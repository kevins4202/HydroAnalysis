13465,this study investigated the performance of partial nitrification pn carbon oxidation denitrification and anammox in a continuous tower biofilter reactor tbfr with large height to diameter ratio of 13 in treating actual landfill leachate the nitrogen loading rate nlr and organic loading rate olr varied from 0 44 to 1 31 kg n m3 day and 1 59 to 4 76 kg m3 day respectively the average removal rates of total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod in the tbfr reached 87 47 and 88 45 at the maximum nlr and olr of 1 31 kg n m3 day and 4 76 kg m3 day respectively variation of water quality along the tbfr in different operating conditions indicated that approximately 45 60 of the influent nh4 n was converted into no2 n and nearly 55 70 of the influent cod was removed in the 0 40 cm zone which provided suitable conditions for the subsequent anaerobic anammox and denitrification processes in the 40 160 cm zone overall the tbfr with a large height to diameter ratio demonstrated an effective technology for the treatment of landfill leachate by creating distinct aerobic and anaerobic zones in a single reactor graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tower biofilter reactor landfill leachate partial nitrification denitrification anammox 1 introduction with the rapid economic and societal development the generation of municipal solid waste has continuously increased in recent decades 1 sanitary landfilling is the most commonly used municipal solid waste disposal method in many developing countries due to its economy 2 3 however landfill leachate generated from by sanitary landfilling usually contains high concentrations of refractory organic matter 4 5 ammonia nitrogen 6 and heavy metals 7 8 the complex characteristics of landfill leachate vary considerably as a result of many factors such as waste type and composition 9 burial time 10 and seasonal weather variation 11 landfill leachate could cause great harm to water bodies and ecosystems if not treated effectively and properly 12 13 therefore exploring cost effective methods for treating landfill leachate is an important problem and challenge in the aspect of wastewater treatment 14 compared with physicochemical treatment technology conventional nitrification and denitrification have been widely considered as the economical biological treatment and are widely used in most wastewater treatment plants to remove organics and nitrogen from municipal wastewater 15 however the conventional nitrification and denitrification processes definitely consume a larger amount of oxygen in nitrification and more external carbon sources in denitrification which inevitably causes high operating cost 16 therefore this method is not suitable for the cod and nh4 n removals of landfill leachate with a low cod n ratio and a low bod cod ratio in comparison with conventional nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox as an autotrophic process could save oxygen supplies and also avoid the lack of carbon sources for denitrification 14 due to these advantages anammox has been commonly considered as the most economical method and widely used for the treatment of high ammonia wastewater such as landfill leachate and sludge digestion liquid 17 18 however anammox requires a certain quantity of no2 n as an electron acceptor to oxidize nh4 n and produce n2 and the presence of a certain amount of organic matter in the influent could negatively hinder the subsequent anammox process 19 20 which seems not consistent with the water quality of landfill leachate several studies have demonstrated that combined partial nitrification and anammox pn anammox in multi stage or a single reactor system exhibits high nitrogen removal rates 21 22 unlike the multi stage system combined pn anammox in a single reactor system is more complex and is easily affected by many operational factors 23 the partitioned coexistence of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria anaob in a single reactor mainly depends on alternating anoxic and aerobic conditions controlling aeration time and controlling dissolved oxygen at low concentrations 15 finding an appropriate method for restraining nitrogen oxidizing bacteria nob effectively and preserving aob and anaob simultaneously have become the major challenges encountered in developing integrated pn anammox reactors 12 therefore controlling the different metabolic activities of multiple microorganisms is crucial for advanced nitrogen removal in consideration of these problems a method combining pn carbon oxidation denitrification and anammox in a tower biofilter reactor tbfr with a large height to diameter ratio for the removals of nitrogen and cod was developed to treat landfill leachate this experiment mainly studied the effects of the different influent nitrogen loading rates nlrs and organic loading rates olrs on the removal of organic matter and nitrogen from landfill leachate moreover the variations in cod and nitrogen concentrations and the activities of the dominant bacteria in different reactor height zones were explored this study aimed to develop an innovative technology that combines pn carbon oxidation denitrification and anammox in a single reactor this combined technology is important for the treatment of landfill leachate or similar wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental

study the raw landfill leachate used in this study was collected from a local landfill in xi an city and stored in a low temperature environment 4 c to keep water quality stable the diluted landfill leachate was used as the influent after 147 days of domestication the physicochemical characteristics of the raw leachate and influent were analyzed and are listed in table 1 2 3 2 operating conditions the whole experimental operational period included three operating stages as shown in table 2 olrs and nlrs were increased stepwise from 1 59 kg m3 day to 4 76 kg m3 day and from 0 44 kg n m3 day to 1 31 kg n m3 day in three different phases respectively and the hydraulic retention time hrt at different stages was always maintained at 12 h 2 4 sampling analysis and calculations 2 4 1 collection and measurement of water samples influent and effluent samples were taken every 3 days during the whole experiment and samples at 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm of the reactor were collected in the stable phase of each working condition all the water samples were filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m filter before determination and analysis the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn codcr mlvss and mlss were

total of 10 ml of mixed solution taken from the zone of the as and several fillers taken from the carrier sampling ports of the heights of 40 cm bf were for the measurements of ammonia utilization rate aur and nitrite utilization rate nur at the stable stage of each operating condition meanwhile some fillers were taken from the carrier sampling ports of the heights of 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm for the measurement of the denitrification rate dnr and specific anammox activity saa of bfs 2 4 2 1 activity assay of nitrification the samples of as and 40 cm bf from the tbfr were rinsed several times with distilled water to remove the remaining nutrients in the medium for the measurement of the aur and nur according to the g holm kristensen s methods 25 the samples were used to measure as aur as nur 40 cm bf aur and 40 cm bf nur the bottles were sparged with air to ensure the adequate oxygen the reaction solutions were 200 mg l nh4 n for aur measurement and 200 mg l no2 n for nur measurement respectively the tests were run for 12 h at 30 2 c and water samples were taken at 2 h intervals for the analysis of decrements in nh4 n and no2 n meanwhile mlvss concentrations were measured when testing for the aur and nur of as whereas bf biomass was measured when testing for the aur and nur of 40 cm bf 2 4 2 2 activity assay of denitrification the bf samples were placed in a serum bottle 250 ml containing certain no3 n and cod concentrations then the serum bottles were fully exposed to high purity nitrogen gas finally all the serum bottles were placed in a water shaking bath 50 5 rpm at 30 2 c and water samples were taken at 2 h intervals to determine diachronic changes in no3 n and no2 n concentrations meanwhile the concentrations of mlvss were further measured when the dnr were carried out and calculated 2 4 2 3 activity assay of anammox the bf samples were transferred to the corresponding serum bottles 250 ml for the anammox activity test according to niu s method 26 first a stock solution containing nh4cl and nano2 was added to the reaction bottles to obtain the initial concentration of 200 mg nh4 n l and 200 mg no2 n l after the stock solution and carriers were added into the serum bottles the bottles were filled with high purity nitrogen to remove the residual oxygen and then sealed with the rubber stoppers to maintain them in anaerobic conditions then all the serum bottles were placed in a water shaking bath 50 5 rpm at 30 2 c and water samples were taken at 2 h intervals for the analysis of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations anammox activity was calculated and determined as biomass specific ammonium consumption rates mlvss was also measured when testing for saa whereas bf biomass was measured when testing for the saa of bf 2 4 3 calculations the removal rates of nitrogen and cod were calculated using the following formula 1 efficiency c inf c eff c eff 100 where efficiency refers to the removal rate of each pollutant c inf is the pollutant concentration in the inlet c eff is the pollutant concentration in the outlet the nitrite accumulation rate nar of the pn process was calculated through the following expression 2 nar no 2 n no 2 n no 3 n 100 where no 2 n and no 3 n represent the concentrations of no 2 n and no 3 n in the 40 cm height of the reactor respectively 2 5 high throughput sequencing analysis as samples were taken from the cone section of the bottom of the reactor and bf samples were collected from the 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm zones of the reactor at the end of phase iii on day 263 briefly microbial dna was

ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 bacterial community structure was then analyzed with an illumina sequencing platform by genergy biotechnology co ltd shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the tbfr the removal efficiency of the tbfr was estimated by determining influent and effluent cod tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations every 3 days the whole operation period was divided into two stages the start up period and the increasing olr and nlr period phases i iii 3 1 1 start up period 1 variation in nitrogen concentrations and removal rates during the start up period the variations in nitrogen concentrations in the influent and effluent and nitrogen removal efficiencies during the start up period of the tbfr are shown in fig 2 during the first 33 days of the start up period the effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn fluctuated greatly under the nlr of 0 4 kg n m3 day subsequently the concentration of tn and nh4 n in the effluent showed a slow decreasing trend in contrast the no2 n concentration increased steadily in the early stage reached the maximum value of 40 76 mg l on day 54 then slowly decreased and stabilized at 4 99 mg l at the end of the test during the whole process the effluent no3 n concentration remained stable at a low level of approximately 7 48 mg l meanwhile the maximum effluent no2 n 40 76 mg l concentration was recovered and nitrite accumulation rate nar reached 83 33 on day 54 from day 55 onwards the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent of the reactor decreased simultaneously on day 147 the effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations reached their minimum values and the reactor operated stably by then the nh4 n and tn removal rates had reached 91 60 and 85 66 respectively indicating that the start up of coupled pn and anammox in tbfr had been completed 2 variations in nitrogen concentration along flow distance from the inlet in tbfr fig 3 indicates the variations in nitrogen concentrations along the flow distance from the inlet in the tbfr at the end of the start up period as shown in fig 3 half of the influent nh4 n concentration was degraded in the 0 40 cm zone due to the presence of an air supply in the influent zone of the reactor meanwhile the no2 n concentration increased greatly in the 0 40 cm zone resulting in a Î´no2 n Î´nh4 n ratio of 0 83 in the 0 40 cm zone of the tbfr which provided the suitable substrates for the upper anammox in the 40 80 cm zone both the reduction in tn concentration and the increment in no2 n concentration were not obvious the concentrations of tn nh4 n and no2 n in the 80 160 cm zone of the reactor presented an obvious decreasing tendency the actual corresponding ratios of Î´no2 n Î´nh4 n and Î´no3 n Î´nh4 n in the 80 160 cm zone were 1 17 and 0 04 owing to the complex microbial community of the reactor which were less than the theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 in the anammox system 27 3 1 2 tbfr operation under different nlrs and olrs the nitrogen and cod removal performances in the tbfr system during landfill leachate treatment were investigated over a 263 day operational period as depicted in fig 4 the operational period could be divided into three phases in accordance with nlrs and olrs and the hrt at different stages was always maintained at 12 h phase i lasted for 81 days under the nlr of 0 44 kg n m3 day and the olr of 1 59 kg m3 day during the first 33 days the mean influent concentrations of tn and cod remained at 207 53 mg l and 722 26 mg l respectively whereas the effluent cod concentration gradually decreased to approximately 81 52 mg l day 186 with the removal efficiency of 87 48 cod as illustrated in fig 4 a meanwhile the effluent tn and nh4 n concentrations also rapidly decreased to the values of less than 37 76 mg l and 10 32 mg l day 33 respectively with the tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies 81 52 and 94 92 respectively as depicted in fig 4 b throughout the entirety of the operation the effluent no2 n concentration remained nearly unchanged 5 43 mg l whereas the effluent no3 n concentration first increased and then tended to stabilize 12 78 mg l in addition the one time abrupt decline of cod nh4 n and tn removal rates was observed during phase i which occurred on day 36 when effluent cod nh4 n and tn concentrations had increased to 317 53 mg l 150 09 mg l and 142 11 mg l respectively resulting in the cod nh4 n and tn removal rates of 63 98 35 79 and 31 96 respectively the decline on day 36 was due to the increases in influent tn and cod concentrations that is thirty days were needed for recovery during the steady state operation period 66 81 days the mean cod nh4 n and tn removal rates stabilized at 82 47 91 15 and 83 16 respectively during phase ii 82 165 days the mean influent cod tn and nh4 n concentrations were 1544 79 mg l 431 36 mg l and 401 49 mg l respectively resulting in nlr and olr values of 0 88 kg n m3 day and 3 18 kg m3 day respectively the aeration rate was gradually increased to 0 4 l min to supply sufficient oxygen as shown in fig 4 a and b cod tn and nh4 n concentrations in the effluent gradually decreased and stabilized after an adaptation period of 40 days the average effluent cod tn and nh4 n concentrations in the stable stage were 301 40 mg l 64 74 mg l and 49 26 mg l respectively leading to the corresponding removal rates of 80 49 85 00 and 87 73 respectively throughout the entirety of phase ii the no2 n concentration slightly decreased whereas the effluent no3 n concentration slightly increased anyway the effluent average concentrations of no2 n and no3 n were kept at low level and maintained stably at about 4 60 mg l and 5 01 mg l respectively during phase iii 166 263 days the nlr and olr further increased to 1 31 kg n m3 day and 4 76 kg m3 day respectively through the elevation of the mean influent concentrations of cod and tn to 2360 79 mg l and 642 30 mg l respectively similar to that in the previous two stages the recovery period of nlr and olr in phase iii reached 53 days when the aeration rate was adjusted to 1 2 l min the average nitrogen and cod removals of phase iii in the stable stage were slightly higher than those in phase ii with the tn nh4 n and cod removal rates of 87 47 90 45 and 88 45 respectively antwi et al achieved the tn removal efficiencies of around 90 and cod removal efficiencies of around 30 under a nlr ranging 0 31 1 84 kg n m3 d and a olr ranging 0 38 2 31 kg m3 d using a lab scale upflow sludge bed usb reactor when the do concentration of the system was at 0 2 mg l 12 zhang et al obtained a nitrogen removal rate of 98 7 and a cod removal rate of nearly 66 0 respectively at the influent nh4 n scod and total nitrogen tn of 1000 250 mg l 1100 200 mg l and 1300 75 mg l respectively using a sbr reactor 28 these results suggested that one single reactor could achieve more than 90 nitrogen removal at stable operation performance for pn a process in the treatment of landfill leachate however the removal of cod was at a low level in contrast this study showed integral advantages to the previously reported works with the stable tn and cod removal efficiencies of 87 47 and 88 45 respectively under the maximum nlr and olr of 1 31 kg n m3 day and 4 76 kg m3 day respectively as shown in fig 4 c the influent concentrations of no2 n and no3 n remained stable at 0 05 mg l and 2 33 mg l respectively compared with that in phase ii the effluent concentration of no2 n in phase iii slightly increased to 10 01 mg l however in phase iii the effluent no3 n concentration slightly decreased to 2 33 mg l in brief this experiment showed that nh4 n tn and cod removal rates could remain at 87 86 90 59 and 88 45 in the tbfr under the nlr of 1 31 kg n m3 day and the olr of 4 76 kg m3 day when diluted landfill leachate was used as the influent the nitrogen and cod removal rates in the tbfr declined and required an adaptation stage when the nlr was increased stepwise from 0 88 kg n m3 day to 1 31 kg n m3 day and the olr was gradually increased from 3 18 kg m3 day to 4 76 kg m3 day then the reactor gradually achieved good nitrogen and cod removal rates after a short period of recovery this behavior indicated that the tbfr had the strong resistance and good adaptability to high nlrs and olrs however this study was still in the laboratory simulation stage in the future pilot experiments could be conducted to explore the feasibility and stability of the integrated tower biofilter reactor with larger ratio of height to diameter for the treatment of the actual landfill leachate so as to provide the valuable reference and guidance for the treatment and disposal of landfill leachate in practical projects 3 2 changes in nitrogen concentration along the flow distance of the tbfr fig 5 shows the variation in nitrogen and cod concentrations along the flow distance from the inlet of the tbfr during the different phases under various influent nlrs and olrs the change trends of nitrogen and cod concentrations along the flow distance from the inlet of the tbfr did not obviously differ during the three phases of tbfr operation nh4 n and cod removal and no2 n production mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm zone then the residual nh4 n and produced no2 n in the 40 160 cm zone were simultaneously removed this phenomenon was accompanied by a slight and stable increase in no3 n concentration along the flow distance in the tbfr during the above process tn concentration along the flow distance from the inlet of the tbfr declined gradually the transformation ratios of nitrogen in different tbfr zones during the three operating phases were calculated table 3 on the basis of fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the removal ratios in the 0 40 cm zone during phases i ii and iii were 55 50 51 62 and 45 38 for nh4 n respectively and were 54 89 55 93 and 65 99 for cod respectively correspondingly the accumulation rates of no2 n during phases i ii and iii were 90 71 96 30 and 96 33 respectively at the 40 cm of the reactor these results indicated that nearly half of the influent nh4 n and a large amount of cod were removed in the 0 40 cm zone during the three operating phases because of the presence of a certain amount of air in the influent zone of the reactor meanwhile as presented in table 3 the corresponding ratios of Î´ no2 n Î´ nh4 n in the 0 40 cm zone were between 0 75 and 0 95 during the three different phases all the corresponding ratios of Î´ no2 n Î´ nh4 n in the 0 40 cm zone were slightly less than 1 1 because excessive aeration was sometimes applied at the bottom of the reactor and a small amount of generated no2 n was further oxidized into no3 n by the redundant oxygen the amounts of no3 n produced in the 0 40 cm zone accounted for 9 23 3 70 and 3 67 of the nox n produced during phases i ii and iii respectively indicating that pn and carbon oxidation reactions mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm zone the inconspicuous removal of tn in this section was due to the various transformations of inorganic nitrogen the simultaneous removals of nh4 n and no2 n mainly occurred in the 40 160 cm zone as shown in fig 5 in the 40 160 cm zone during phases i ii and iii the removal rates for nh4 n were 80 25 74 25 and 81 62 respectively and those for no2 n were 93 82 96 17 and 95 67 respectively compared with the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n at the zone of 40 cm these results indicated that the simultaneous nh4 n and no2 n removals mainly occurred in the 40 160 cm zone in the experiment the corresponding Î´ no2 n Î´ nh4 n and Î´ no3 n Î´ nh4 n ratios during the three phases remained at 0 92 1 25 and 0 01 0 06 in the 40 160 cm zone which were both lower than the theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 in the single anammox system 29 this finding could be attributed to the high cod and nh4 n in the influent and an appropriate air supply at the bottom of the reactor and these conditions promoted the formation of a complex community structure in the single reactor the removal ratios in the 40 160 cm zone during phases i ii and iii were 27 93 24 23 and 22 06 for cod respectively compared with the concentrations of cod in the influent denitrifiers could also use organic carbon sources and consume part of no3 n and no2 n through denitrification under anoxic and anaerobic conditions 30 most of the cod degradation in the influent mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm section of the reactor which greatly reduced the influence of organic matter on the subsequent anammox in the 40 160 cm section the complex symbiotic relationship among nitrifiers denitrifiers anaob and other possible coexisting bacteria in the tbfr resulted in the differences between the theoretical and actual values observed in this experiment therefore the tbfr system with a larger ratio of height to diameter of 13 really provided a suitable environment for the coexistence of diverse functional bacteria in different heights by the variations of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions along the reactor during phases i ii and iii when the nlr was increased from 0 44 kg n m3 day to 1 31 kg n m3 day the removal rates for nh4 n reached 91 21 87 54 and 89 96 respectively and those for tn were 80 35 81 75 and 85 59 respectively the cod removal rates during phases i ii and iii when the olr was increased from 1 59 kg m3 day to 4 76 kg m3 day were 82 82 80 16 and 88 05 respectively this finding indicated that the single tbfr had strong adaptability and environmental resistance under the changing olrs and nlrs this study demonstrated that pn in the 0 40 cm zone could fully use the biodegradable cod in the influent and steadily supply the appropriate substrates to the upper anammox reaction in the 40 160 cm zone of the tbfr which greatly reduced energy consumption 3 3 changes of microbial activity in the tbfr fig 6 shows the changes in microbial activity along tbfr zones under the stable conditions of different operation phases during phases i iii the aurs of the as in the cone zone were approximately 4 0 6 0 times the nurs of the as in the cone zone these differences indirectly indicated that pn mainly occurred in the as however this section also experienced carbon oxidation due to high cod concentration in the influent similarly all the aurs of the 40 cm bf zone were nearly 2 5 5 0 times higher than the nurs of the 40 cm bf zone during different phases in phases i iii all the aurs of the 40 cm bf zone were all greatly reduced compared with the aurs of as this result demonstrated that pn capacity gradually weakened as the flow distance was increased moreover the results indicated that the aurs of as and 40 cm bf zone were enhanced by the increase in nlrs during phases i iii the saas of bf in the 120 cm zone reached 12 49 mg n gvss h 17 88 mg n gvss h and 19 54 mg n gvss h in phases i ii and iii respectively and were 5 27 4 36 and 3 43 times higher than those in the 40 cm bf zone respectively by contrast the saas of bf in the 80 cm zone were 6 91 mgn gvss h 9 24 mg n gvss h and 12 94 mg n gvss h which were 2 92 2 25 and 2 27 times higher than those in the 40 cm bf zone respectively thus all the saas of bf in the 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm zones increased with the increment in nlrs the variation in saas in the 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm zones could account for the change in water quality in the 40 160 cm bf zone in the tbfr indicating that anammox mainly occurred in the 40 160 cm zone of the reactor the dnrs of bf in the 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm zones did not follow obvious trends but all tended to increase at different heights as nlrs and olrs were further increased these results demonstrated that the whole reactor presented denitrification capability in the presence of an organic carbon source the tbfr with a large height to diameter ratio of 13 could provide a good partition that could successfully enable pn denitrification and anammox in a single reactor pn mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm zone of the tbfr whereas anammox mainly occurred within the 40 160 cm bf zone of the tbfr moreover saas enhanced with the increase in reactor height and nlrs in addition the whole reactor exhibited denitrification capability in the presence of an organic carbon source and a certain denitrification capacity along the whole reactor was conducive to the efficient removal of nitrogen and cod 3 4 high throughput sequencing analysis of the activated sludge and bioflim fig 7 shows the high throughput sequencing analysis results for the relative abundance of microbial species at the genus level in different zones of the tbfr the as and bf samples were collected in the steady stage of phase iii on day 263 all bacteria with relative abundances of less than 0 5 and undetermined sequences were designated as others as shown in fig 7 although the as and 40 cm bf zone had different proportions of dominant bacteria they contained similar types of bacteria in the as saprospiraceae was the dominant genus 31 71 followed by rhodobacter 12 12 nitrosomonas 11 37 and desulfomicrobium 10 03 of the 13 bacterial phyla detected in the 40 cm bf rhodobacter desulfomicrobium saprospiraceae and nitrosomonas were dominant and accounted for 16 67 13 84 12 75 and 12 70 of bacterial abundance respectively nitrosomonas as a genus of aob 31 was the dominant aob in the pn system whereas nob represented by nitrobacter and nitrospira were not detected these results indicated that aob was the dominant nitrifying bacteria in the as and 40 cm bf zone the high quantities of aob could be ascribed to the high nar observed in the 0 40 cm zone saprospiraceae as a member of bacteroidetes could hydrolyze and decompose complex organic compounds 32 33 they accounted for 31 71 and 12 75 of the bacteria in the as and 40 cm bf zone respectively the high quantities of nitrosomonas and saprospiraceae in the as and 40 zone illustrated that pn and carbon oxidation were the dominant reactions in the as and 40 cm zone the dominant species in the zones of 80 cm bf and 120 cm bf varied greatly from those in the 40 cm bf zone and certain amounts of new bacteria were derived these results directly proved that the partitioning of the tbfr had changed by a certain extent as shown in fig 7 desulfomicrobium remained the dominant bacterium 10 99 followed by armatimonadetes gp5 10 77 burkholderiales 4 88 and candidatus brocadia 4 42 in the 80 cm bf zone the main strains in the 120 cm bf were armatimonadetes candidatus brocadia desulfomicrobium and bradyrhizobiaceae with the corresponding proportions of 18 98 6 61 5 29 and 3 87 respectively in this study candidatus brocadia was detected as the sole anammox genus and the dominant bacteria candidatus brocadia a typical anammox bacterium 34 was also detected in the 40 cm zone with an abundance of only 1 40 while it accounted for 4 42 in 80 cm bf and 16 61 in 120 cm bf respectively the significant increase in its quantity in the 40 160 cm bf zone with the increase in tbfr height contributed to the high nitrogen removal in the system the results of microbial community analysis showed that the tbfr had the distinct aerobic and anaerobic zones that provided favorable conditions for the growth of dominant bacteria a highly complex microbial community developed in the as and bf exposed to landfill leachate it contained coexisting functional species such as aob denitrifying bacteria and anaob which promoted the efficient removal of nitrogen and carbon in the individual tbfr with a high height to diameter ratio of 13 thus autotrophic nitrification heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic anammox can be feasibly integrated into a single tbfr for treating landfill leachate successfully 4 conclusion a tbfr with large height to diameter ratio was operated to treat the actual landfill leachate for 263 days the average removal rates of tn and cod in tbfr reached 87 47 and 88 45 under the maximum nlr and olr of 1 31 kg n m3 day and 4 76 kg m3 day respectively anammox achieved a high tn removal in the upper reactor and suitable substrate concentrations of anammox were produced via pn on the bottom of the reactor besides the bacteria community structure analysis demonstrated the dominant aob nitrosomonas and anaob candidatus brocadia constituted the syntrophic microbial community in tbfr the tbfr system with a larger ratio of height to diameter of 13 really provided a suitable environment for the coexistence of the diverse functional bacteria in different heights by the variations of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions along the reactor which had a strong stability to treat the actual landfill leachate or similar wastewater declaration of competing

13465,this study investigated the performance of partial nitrification pn carbon oxidation denitrification and anammox in a continuous tower biofilter reactor tbfr with large height to diameter ratio of 13 in treating actual landfill leachate the nitrogen loading rate nlr and organic loading rate olr varied from 0 44 to 1 31 kg n m3 day and 1 59 to 4 76 kg m3 day respectively the average removal rates of total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod in the tbfr reached 87 47 and 88 45 at the maximum nlr and olr of 1 31 kg n m3 day and 4 76 kg m3 day respectively variation of water quality along the tbfr in different operating conditions indicated that approximately 45 60 of the influent nh4 n was converted into no2 n and nearly 55 70 of the influent cod was removed in the 0 40 cm zone which provided suitable conditions for the subsequent anaerobic anammox and denitrification processes in the 40 160 cm zone overall the tbfr with a large height to diameter ratio demonstrated an effective technology for the treatment of landfill leachate by creating distinct aerobic and anaerobic zones in a single reactor graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tower biofilter reactor landfill leachate partial nitrification denitrification anammox 1 introduction with the rapid economic and societal development the generation of municipal solid waste has continuously increased in recent decades 1 sanitary landfilling is the most commonly used municipal solid waste disposal method in many developing countries due to its economy 2 3 however landfill leachate generated from by sanitary landfilling usually contains high concentrations of refractory organic matter 4 5 ammonia nitrogen 6 and heavy metals 7 8 the complex characteristics of landfill leachate vary considerably as a result of many factors such as waste type and composition 9 burial time 10 and seasonal weather variation 11 landfill leachate could cause great harm to water bodies and ecosystems if not treated effectively and properly 12 13 therefore exploring cost effective methods for treating landfill leachate is an important problem and challenge in the aspect of wastewater treatment 14 compared with physicochemical treatment technology conventional nitrification and denitrification have been widely considered as the economical biological treatment and are widely used in most wastewater treatment plants to remove organics and nitrogen from municipal wastewater 15 however the conventional nitrification and denitrification processes definitely consume a larger amount of oxygen in nitrification and more external carbon sources in denitrification which inevitably causes high operating cost 16 therefore this method is not suitable for the cod and nh4 n removals of landfill leachate with a low cod n ratio and a low bod cod ratio in comparison with conventional nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox as an autotrophic process could save oxygen supplies and also avoid the lack of carbon sources for denitrification 14 due to these advantages anammox has been commonly considered as the most economical method and widely used for the treatment of high ammonia wastewater such as landfill leachate and sludge digestion liquid 17 18 however anammox requires a certain quantity of no2 n as an electron acceptor to oxidize nh4 n and produce n2 and the presence of a certain amount of organic matter in the influent could negatively hinder the subsequent anammox process 19 20 which seems not consistent with the water quality of landfill leachate several studies have demonstrated that combined partial nitrification and anammox pn anammox in multi stage or a single reactor system exhibits high nitrogen removal rates 21 22 unlike the multi stage system combined pn anammox in a single reactor system is more complex and is easily affected by many operational factors 23 the partitioned coexistence of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria anaob in a single reactor mainly depends on alternating anoxic and aerobic conditions controlling aeration time and controlling dissolved oxygen at low concentrations 15 finding an appropriate method for restraining nitrogen oxidizing bacteria nob effectively and preserving aob and anaob simultaneously have become the major challenges encountered in developing integrated pn anammox reactors 12 therefore controlling the different metabolic activities of multiple microorganisms is crucial for advanced nitrogen removal in consideration of these problems a method combining pn carbon oxidation denitrification and anammox in a tower biofilter reactor tbfr with a large height to diameter ratio for the removals of nitrogen and cod was developed to treat landfill leachate this experiment mainly studied the effects of the different influent nitrogen loading rates nlrs and organic loading rates olrs on the removal of organic matter and nitrogen from landfill leachate moreover the variations in cod and nitrogen concentrations and the activities of the dominant bacteria in different reactor height zones were explored this study aimed to develop an innovative technology that combines pn carbon oxidation denitrification and anammox in a single reactor this combined technology is important for the treatment of landfill leachate or similar wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental

study the raw landfill leachate used in this study was collected from a local landfill in xi an city and stored in a low temperature environment 4 c to keep water quality stable the diluted landfill leachate was used as the influent after 147 days of domestication the physicochemical characteristics of the raw leachate and influent were analyzed and are listed in table 1 2 3 2 operating conditions the whole experimental operational period included three operating stages as shown in table 2 olrs and nlrs were increased stepwise from 1 59 kg m3 day to 4 76 kg m3 day and from 0 44 kg n m3 day to 1 31 kg n m3 day in three different phases respectively and the hydraulic retention time hrt at different stages was always maintained at 12 h 2 4 sampling analysis and calculations 2 4 1

stable phase of each working condition all the water samples were filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m filter before determination and analysis the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn codcr mlvss and mlss were

total of 10 ml of mixed solution taken from the zone of the as and several fillers taken from the carrier sampling ports of the heights of 40 cm bf were for the measurements of ammonia utilization rate aur and nitrite utilization rate nur at the stable stage of each operating condition meanwhile some fillers were taken from the carrier sampling ports of the heights of 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm for the measurement of the denitrification rate dnr and specific anammox activity saa of bfs 2 4 2 1 activity assay of nitrification the samples of as and 40 cm bf from the tbfr were rinsed several times with distilled water to remove the remaining nutrients in the medium for the measurement of the aur and nur according to the g holm kristensen s methods 25 the samples were used to measure as aur as nur 40 cm bf aur and 40 cm bf nur the bottles were sparged with air to ensure the adequate oxygen the reaction solutions were 200 mg l nh4 n for aur measurement and 200 mg l no2 n for nur measurement respectively the tests were run for 12 h at 30 2 c and water samples were taken at 2 h intervals for the analysis of decrements in nh4 n and no2 n meanwhile mlvss concentrations were measured when testing for the aur and nur of as whereas bf biomass was measured when testing for the aur and nur of 40 cm bf 2 4 2 2 activity assay of denitrification the bf samples were placed in a serum bottle 250 ml containing certain no3 n and cod concentrations then the serum bottles were fully exposed to high purity nitrogen gas finally all the serum bottles were placed in a water shaking bath 50 5 rpm at 30 2 c and water samples were taken at 2 h intervals to determine diachronic changes in no3 n and no2 n concentrations meanwhile the concentrations of mlvss were further measured when the dnr were carried out and calculated 2 4 2 3 activity assay of anammox the bf samples were transferred to the corresponding serum bottles 250 ml for the anammox activity test according to niu s method 26 first a stock solution containing nh4cl and nano2 was added to the reaction bottles to obtain the initial concentration of 200 mg nh4 n l and 200 mg no2 n l after the stock solution and carriers were added into the serum bottles the bottles were filled with high purity nitrogen to remove the residual oxygen and then sealed with the rubber stoppers to maintain them in anaerobic conditions then all the serum bottles were placed in a water shaking bath 50 5 rpm at 30 2 c and water samples were taken at 2 h intervals for the analysis of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations anammox activity was calculated and determined as biomass specific ammonium consumption rates mlvss was also measured when testing for saa whereas bf biomass was measured when testing for the saa of bf 2 4 3 calculations the removal rates of nitrogen and cod were calculated using the following formula 1 efficiency c inf c eff c eff 100 where efficiency refers to the removal rate of each pollutant c inf is the pollutant concentration in the inlet c eff is the pollutant concentration in the outlet the nitrite accumulation rate nar of the pn process was calculated through the following expression 2 nar no 2 n no 2 n no 3 n 100 where no 2 n and no 3 n represent the concentrations of no 2 n and no 3 n in the 40 cm height of the reactor respectively 2 5 high throughput sequencing analysis as samples were taken from the cone section of the bottom of the reactor and bf samples were collected from the 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm zones of the reactor at the end of phase iii on day 263 briefly microbial dna was

ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 bacterial community structure was then analyzed with an illumina sequencing platform by genergy biotechnology co ltd shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the tbfr the removal efficiency of the tbfr was estimated by determining influent and effluent cod tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations every 3 days the whole operation period was divided into two stages the start up period and the increasing olr and nlr period phases i iii 3 1 1 start up period 1 variation in nitrogen concentrations and removal rates during the start up period the variations in nitrogen concentrations in the influent and effluent and nitrogen removal efficiencies during the start up period of the tbfr are shown in fig 2 during the first 33 days of the start up period the effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn fluctuated greatly under the nlr of 0 4 kg n m3 day subsequently the concentration of tn and nh4 n in the effluent showed a slow decreasing trend in contrast the no2 n concentration increased steadily in the early stage reached the maximum value of 40 76 mg l on day 54 then slowly decreased and stabilized at 4 99 mg l at the end of the test during the whole process the effluent no3 n concentration remained stable at a low level of approximately 7 48 mg l meanwhile the maximum effluent no2 n 40 76 mg l concentration was recovered and nitrite accumulation rate nar reached 83 33 on day 54 from day 55 onwards the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent of the reactor decreased simultaneously on day 147 the effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations reached their minimum values and the reactor operated stably by then the nh4 n and tn removal rates had reached 91 60 and 85 66 respectively indicating that the start up of coupled pn and anammox in tbfr had been completed 2 variations in nitrogen concentration along flow distance from the inlet in tbfr fig 3 indicates the variations in nitrogen concentrations along the flow distance from the inlet in the tbfr at the end of the start up period as shown in fig 3 half of the influent nh4 n concentration was degraded in the 0 40 cm zone due to the presence of an air supply in the influent zone of the reactor meanwhile the no2 n concentration increased greatly in the 0 40 cm zone resulting in a Î´no2 n Î´nh4 n ratio of 0 83 in the 0 40 cm zone of the tbfr which provided the suitable substrates for the upper anammox in the 40 80 cm zone both the reduction in tn concentration and the increment in no2 n concentration were not obvious the concentrations of tn nh4 n and no2 n in the 80 160 cm zone of the reactor presented an obvious decreasing tendency the actual corresponding ratios of Î´no2 n Î´nh4 n and Î´no3 n Î´nh4 n in the 80 160 cm zone were 1 17 and 0 04 owing to the complex microbial community of the reactor which were less than the theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 in the anammox system 27 3 1 2 tbfr operation under different nlrs and olrs the nitrogen and cod removal performances in the tbfr system during landfill leachate treatment were investigated over a 263 day operational period as depicted in fig 4 the operational period could be divided into three phases in accordance with nlrs and olrs and the hrt at different stages was always maintained at 12 h phase i lasted for 81 days under the nlr of 0 44 kg n m3 day and the olr of 1 59 kg m3 day during the first 33 days the mean influent concentrations of tn and cod remained at 207 53 mg l and 722 26 mg l respectively whereas the effluent cod concentration gradually decreased to approximately 81 52 mg l day 186 with the removal efficiency of 87 48 cod as illustrated in fig 4 a meanwhile the effluent tn and nh4 n concentrations also rapidly decreased to the values of less than 37 76 mg l and 10 32 mg l day 33 respectively with the tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies 81 52 and 94 92 respectively as depicted in fig 4 b throughout the entirety of the operation the effluent no2 n concentration remained nearly unchanged 5 43 mg l whereas the effluent no3 n concentration first increased and then tended to stabilize 12 78 mg l in addition the one time abrupt decline of cod nh4 n and tn removal rates was observed during phase i which occurred on day 36 when effluent cod nh4 n and tn concentrations had increased to 317 53 mg l 150 09 mg l and 142 11 mg l respectively resulting in the cod nh4 n and tn removal rates of 63 98 35 79 and 31 96 respectively the decline on day 36 was due to the increases in influent tn and cod concentrations that is thirty days were needed for recovery during the steady state operation period 66 81 days the mean cod nh4 n and tn removal rates stabilized at 82 47 91 15 and 83 16 respectively during phase ii 82 165 days the mean influent cod tn and nh4 n concentrations were 1544 79 mg l 431 36 mg l and 401 49 mg l respectively resulting in nlr and olr values of 0 88 kg n m3 day and 3 18 kg m3 day respectively the aeration rate was gradually increased to 0 4 l min to supply sufficient oxygen as shown in fig 4 a and b cod tn and nh4 n concentrations in the effluent gradually decreased and stabilized after an adaptation period of 40 days the average effluent cod tn and nh4 n concentrations in the stable stage were 301 40 mg l 64 74 mg l and 49 26 mg l respectively leading to the corresponding removal rates of 80 49 85 00 and 87 73 respectively throughout the entirety of phase ii the no2 n concentration slightly decreased whereas the effluent no3 n concentration slightly increased anyway the effluent average concentrations of no2 n and no3 n were kept at low level and maintained stably at about 4 60 mg l and 5 01 mg l respectively during phase iii 166 263 days the nlr and olr further increased to 1 31 kg n m3 day and 4 76 kg m3 day respectively through the elevation of the mean influent concentrations of cod and tn to 2360 79 mg l and 642 30 mg l respectively similar to that in the previous two stages the recovery period of nlr and olr in phase iii reached 53 days when the aeration rate was adjusted to 1 2 l min the average nitrogen and cod removals of phase iii in the stable stage were slightly higher than those in phase ii with the tn nh4 n and cod removal rates of 87 47 90 45 and 88 45 respectively antwi et al achieved the tn removal efficiencies of around 90 and cod removal efficiencies of around 30 under a nlr ranging 0 31 1 84 kg n m3 d and a olr ranging 0 38 2 31 kg m3 d using a lab scale upflow sludge bed usb reactor when the do concentration of the system was at 0 2 mg l 12 zhang et al obtained a nitrogen removal rate of 98 7 and a cod removal rate of nearly 66 0 respectively at the influent nh4 n scod and total nitrogen tn of 1000 250 mg l 1100 200 mg l and 1300 75 mg l respectively using a sbr reactor 28 these results suggested that one single reactor could achieve more than 90 nitrogen removal at stable operation performance for pn a process in the treatment of landfill leachate however the removal of cod was at a low level in contrast this study showed integral advantages to the previously reported works with the stable tn and cod removal efficiencies of 87 47 and 88 45 respectively under the maximum nlr and olr of 1 31 kg n m3 day and 4 76 kg m3 day respectively as shown in fig 4 c the influent concentrations of no2 n and no3 n remained stable at 0 05 mg l and 2 33 mg l respectively compared with that in phase ii the effluent concentration of no2 n in phase iii slightly increased to 10 01 mg l however in phase iii the effluent no3 n concentration slightly decreased to 2 33 mg l in brief this experiment showed that nh4 n tn and cod removal rates could remain at 87 86 90 59 and 88 45 in the tbfr under the nlr of 1 31 kg n m3 day and the olr of 4 76 kg m3 day when diluted landfill leachate was used as the influent the nitrogen and cod removal rates in the tbfr declined and required an adaptation stage when the nlr was increased stepwise from 0 88 kg n m3 day to 1 31 kg n m3 day and the olr was gradually increased from 3 18 kg m3 day to 4 76 kg m3 day then the reactor gradually achieved good nitrogen and cod removal rates after a short period of recovery this behavior indicated that the tbfr had the strong resistance and good adaptability to high nlrs and olrs however this study was still in the laboratory simulation stage in the future pilot experiments could be conducted to explore the feasibility and stability of the integrated tower biofilter reactor with larger ratio of height to diameter for the treatment of the actual landfill leachate so as to provide the valuable reference and guidance for the treatment and disposal of landfill leachate in practical projects 3 2 changes in nitrogen concentration along the flow distance of the tbfr fig 5 shows the variation in nitrogen and cod concentrations along the flow distance from the inlet of the tbfr during the different phases under various influent nlrs and olrs the change trends of nitrogen and cod concentrations along the flow distance from the inlet of the tbfr did not obviously differ during the three phases of tbfr operation nh4 n and cod removal and no2 n production mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm zone then the residual nh4 n and produced no2 n in the 40 160 cm zone were simultaneously removed this phenomenon was accompanied by a slight and stable increase in no3 n concentration along the flow distance in the tbfr during the above process tn concentration along the flow distance from the inlet of the tbfr declined gradually the transformation ratios of nitrogen in different tbfr zones during the three operating phases were calculated table 3 on the basis of fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the removal ratios in the 0 40 cm zone during phases i ii and iii were 55 50 51 62 and 45 38 for nh4 n respectively and were 54 89 55 93 and 65 99 for cod respectively correspondingly the accumulation rates of no2 n during phases i ii and iii were 90 71 96 30 and 96 33 respectively at the 40 cm of the reactor these results indicated that nearly half of the influent nh4 n and a large amount of cod were removed in the 0 40 cm zone during the three operating phases because of the presence of a certain amount of air in the influent zone of the reactor meanwhile as presented in table 3 the corresponding ratios of Î´ no2 n Î´ nh4 n in the 0 40 cm zone were between 0 75 and 0 95 during the three different phases all the corresponding ratios of Î´ no2 n Î´ nh4 n in the 0 40 cm zone were slightly less than 1 1 because excessive aeration was sometimes applied at the bottom of the reactor and a small amount of generated no2 n was further oxidized into no3 n by the redundant oxygen the amounts of no3 n produced in the 0 40 cm zone accounted for 9 23 3 70 and 3 67 of the nox n produced during phases i ii and iii respectively indicating that pn and carbon oxidation reactions mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm zone the inconspicuous removal of tn in this section was due to the various transformations of inorganic nitrogen the simultaneous removals of nh4 n and no2 n mainly occurred in the 40 160 cm zone as shown in fig 5 in the 40 160 cm zone during phases i ii and iii the removal rates for nh4 n were 80 25 74 25 and 81 62 respectively and those for no2 n were 93 82 96 17 and 95 67 respectively compared with the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n at the zone of 40 cm these results indicated that the simultaneous nh4 n and no2 n removals mainly occurred in the 40 160 cm zone in the experiment the corresponding Î´ no2 n Î´ nh4 n and Î´ no3 n Î´ nh4 n ratios during the three phases remained at 0 92 1 25 and 0 01 0 06 in the 40 160 cm zone which were both lower than the theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 in the single anammox system 29 this finding could be attributed to the high cod and nh4 n in the influent and an appropriate air supply at the bottom of the reactor and these conditions promoted the formation of a complex community structure in the single reactor the removal ratios in the 40 160 cm zone during phases i ii and iii were 27 93 24 23 and 22 06 for cod respectively compared with the concentrations of cod in the influent denitrifiers could also use organic carbon sources and consume part of no3 n and no2 n through denitrification under anoxic and anaerobic conditions 30 most of the cod degradation in the influent mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm section of the reactor which greatly reduced the influence of organic matter on the subsequent anammox in the 40 160 cm section the complex symbiotic relationship among nitrifiers denitrifiers anaob and other possible coexisting bacteria in the tbfr resulted in the differences between the theoretical and actual values observed in this experiment therefore the tbfr system with a larger ratio of height to diameter of 13 really provided a suitable environment for the coexistence of diverse functional bacteria in different heights by the variations of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions along the reactor during phases i ii and iii when the nlr was increased from 0 44 kg n m3 day to 1 31 kg n m3 day the removal rates for nh4 n reached 91 21 87 54 and 89 96 respectively and those for tn were 80 35 81 75 and 85 59 respectively the cod removal rates during phases i ii and iii when the olr was increased from 1 59 kg m3 day to 4 76 kg m3 day were 82 82 80 16 and 88 05 respectively this finding indicated that the single tbfr had strong adaptability and environmental resistance under the changing olrs and nlrs this study demonstrated that pn in the 0 40 cm zone could fully use the biodegradable cod in the influent and steadily supply the appropriate substrates to the upper anammox reaction in the 40 160 cm zone of the tbfr which greatly reduced energy consumption 3 3 changes of microbial activity in the tbfr fig 6 shows the changes in microbial activity along tbfr zones under the stable conditions of different operation phases during phases i iii the aurs of the as in the cone zone were approximately 4 0 6 0 times the nurs of the as in the cone zone these differences indirectly indicated that pn mainly occurred in the as however this section also experienced carbon oxidation due to high cod concentration in the influent similarly all the aurs of the 40 cm bf zone were nearly 2 5 5 0 times higher than the nurs of the 40 cm bf zone during different phases in phases i iii all the aurs of the 40 cm bf zone were all greatly reduced compared with the aurs of as this result demonstrated that pn capacity gradually weakened as the flow distance was increased moreover the results indicated that the aurs of as and 40 cm bf zone were enhanced by the increase in nlrs during phases i iii the saas of bf in the 120 cm zone reached 12 49 mg n gvss h 17 88 mg n gvss h and 19 54 mg n gvss h in phases i ii and iii respectively and were 5 27 4 36 and 3 43 times higher than those in the 40 cm bf zone respectively by contrast the saas of bf in the 80 cm zone were 6 91 mgn gvss h 9 24 mg n gvss h and 12 94 mg n gvss h which were 2 92 2 25 and 2 27 times higher than those in the 40 cm bf zone respectively thus all the saas of bf in the 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm zones increased with the increment in nlrs the variation in saas in the 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm zones could account for the change in water quality in the 40 160 cm bf zone in the tbfr indicating that anammox mainly occurred in the 40 160 cm zone of the reactor the dnrs of bf in the 40 cm 80 cm and 120 cm zones did not follow obvious trends but all tended to increase at different heights as nlrs and olrs were further increased these results demonstrated that the whole reactor presented denitrification capability in the presence of an organic carbon source the tbfr with a large height to diameter ratio of 13 could provide a good partition that could successfully enable pn denitrification and anammox in a single reactor pn mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm zone of the tbfr whereas anammox mainly occurred within the 40 160 cm bf zone of the tbfr moreover saas enhanced with the increase in reactor height and nlrs in addition the whole reactor exhibited denitrification capability in the presence of an organic carbon source and a certain denitrification capacity along the whole reactor was conducive to the efficient removal of nitrogen and cod 3 4 high throughput sequencing analysis of the activated sludge and bioflim fig 7 shows the high throughput sequencing analysis results for the relative abundance of microbial species at the genus level in different zones of the tbfr the as and bf samples were collected in the steady stage of phase iii on day 263 all bacteria with relative abundances of less than 0 5 and undetermined sequences were designated as others as shown in fig 7 although the as and 40 cm bf zone had different proportions of dominant bacteria they contained similar types of bacteria in the as saprospiraceae was the dominant genus 31 71 followed by rhodobacter 12 12 nitrosomonas 11 37 and desulfomicrobium 10 03 of the 13 bacterial phyla detected in the 40 cm bf rhodobacter desulfomicrobium saprospiraceae and nitrosomonas were dominant and accounted for 16 67 13 84 12 75 and 12 70 of bacterial abundance respectively nitrosomonas as a genus of aob 31 was the dominant aob in the pn system whereas nob represented by nitrobacter and nitrospira were not detected these results indicated that aob was the dominant nitrifying bacteria in the as and 40 cm bf zone the high quantities of aob could be ascribed to the high nar observed in the 0 40 cm zone saprospiraceae as a member of bacteroidetes could hydrolyze and decompose complex organic compounds 32 33 they accounted for 31 71 and 12 75 of the bacteria in the as and 40 cm bf zone respectively the high quantities of nitrosomonas and saprospiraceae in the as and 40 zone illustrated that pn and carbon oxidation were the dominant reactions in the as and 40 cm zone the dominant species in the zones of 80 cm bf and 120 cm bf varied greatly from those in the 40 cm bf zone and certain amounts of new bacteria were derived these results directly proved that the partitioning of the tbfr had changed by a certain extent as shown in fig 7 desulfomicrobium remained the dominant bacterium 10 99 followed by armatimonadetes gp5 10 77 burkholderiales 4 88 and candidatus brocadia 4 42 in the 80 cm bf zone the main strains in the 120 cm bf were armatimonadetes candidatus brocadia desulfomicrobium and bradyrhizobiaceae with the corresponding proportions of 18 98 6 61 5 29 and 3 87 respectively in this study candidatus brocadia was detected as the sole anammox genus and the dominant bacteria candidatus brocadia a typical anammox bacterium 34 was also detected in the 40 cm zone with an abundance of only 1 40 while it accounted for 4 42 in 80 cm bf and 16 61 in 120 cm bf respectively the significant increase in its quantity in the 40 160 cm bf zone with the increase in tbfr height contributed to the high nitrogen removal in the system the results of microbial community analysis showed that the tbfr had the distinct aerobic and anaerobic zones that provided favorable conditions for the growth of dominant bacteria a highly complex microbial community developed in the as and bf exposed to landfill leachate it contained coexisting functional species such as aob denitrifying bacteria and anaob which promoted the efficient removal of nitrogen and carbon in the individual tbfr with a high height to diameter ratio of 13 thus autotrophic nitrification heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic anammox can be feasibly integrated into a single tbfr for treating landfill leachate successfully 4 conclusion a tbfr with large height to diameter ratio was operated to treat the actual landfill leachate for 263 days the average removal rates of tn and cod in tbfr reached 87 47 and 88 45 under the maximum nlr and olr of 1 31 kg n m3 day and 4 76 kg m3 day respectively anammox achieved a high tn removal in the upper reactor and suitable substrate concentrations of anammox were produced via pn on the bottom of the reactor besides the bacteria community structure analysis demonstrated the dominant aob nitrosomonas and anaob candidatus brocadia constituted the syntrophic microbial community in tbfr the tbfr system with a larger ratio of height to diameter of 13 really provided a suitable environment for the coexistence of the diverse functional bacteria in different heights by the variations of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions along the reactor which had a strong stability to treat the actual landfill leachate or similar wastewater declaration of competing

13466,the study presents the results of the degradation of simazine at concentrations of 4 mg l and 0 5 mg l by means of different advanced oxidation processes photolysis of hydrogen peroxide under sunlight and uv light fenton and photo fenton under sunlight and uv light in ultrapure water at laboratory scale the aim of the study was to optimize some of the main operating variables involved in the process reaction time concentrations of iron and peroxide light sources and ph employing d optimal and full factorial design using contour plots from the d optimal design the concentrations of iron and peroxide sunlight and uv radiation were found to be the factors that most influence the advanced oxidation processes employed in this study full factorial analysis allowed us to establish the time concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide and operating variables that most affect the degradation of simazine under sunlight and uv radiation the degradation kinetics were likewise determined establishing that the kinetic constants obey the following ascending order of effectiveness kphotolysis under sunlight kphoto fenton under sunlight kuv kphotofenton under uv radiation kphotolysis under uv radiation finally among the different advanced oxidation processes applied to the degradation of simazine in ultrapure water it was determined that the h2o2 uv process provides the highest level of pesticide removal keywords aops degradation simazine multivariable experimental design emerging contaminants 1 introduction emerging contaminants pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products their metabolites and or reaction products are compounds that have been increasing in number and volume of production in recent decades in line with industrial and technological development within this group pesticides are the most widely used organic compounds on a global scale and can be found in the soil surface water groundwater and even in drinking water 1 5 although they are present at low concentrations in the environment at an order of magnitude ranging from ng l to Î¼g l these compounds can have toxic effects on plants and wildlife belonging to the different ecosystems into which they are discharged furthermore they can be transferred to people via the food chain in many different ways bioaccumulation biomagnification etc with the corresponding hazard to health concerns about these compounds have accordingly increased in recent decades 6 one of the most widely used pesticides is simazine this pesticide is a highly toxic organochlorine compound belonging to the triazines group 7 it has been used as an herbicide for more than 50 years to combat pests control broadleaf weeds and annual grasses in fruit crop fields and hence increase agricultural production its widespread use was banned by the european union in 2004 2004 ec because scientific studies had shown that this organic compound accumulates in the soil of agricultural areas before being leached into surface water and groundwater used to supply cities 1 8 reaching concentrations of up to 0 06 4 5 mg l in the waters of these areas despite this ban at a european level it continues to be used in some countries like australia 9 in mammals simazine may bring about alterations in the endocrine system increasing the production of oestrogen 10 and altering the hypothalamic regulation of the lh hormone which influences reproduction and foetal growth furthermore in the case of mice it can generate apoptosis and cell proliferation during gestation 11 prolonged consumption of simazine is harmful to humans because it forms part of the food chain being found in particular in oils and fruits 12 when contaminated wastewaters reach drinking water treatment plants dwtts numerous studies 13 have shown that current treatment operations implemented in these plants such as filtration chlorination coagulation and activated carbon adsorption do not appear to be sufficiently effective to destroy these pollutants they remove the contaminant from the aqueous phase to another but do not destroy it or obtain water without any content in pesticides this is because they are recalcitrant compounds that are difficult to degrade it is hence necessary to research the type of treatment to carry out to achieve the goal of complying with the legal limits established by international and national regulations in spain royal decree 140 2003 regarding water for human consumption sets a limit of 0 5 Î¼g l for the total amount of pesticides in water and a limit of 0 1 Î¼g l for each individual pesticide including simazine within this context advanced oxidation processes aops are currently emerging as a leading alternative technology in the treatment of water contaminated with organic products that are not treatable by means of conventional techniques 14 15 aops involve the generation and use of oxidizing transient species such as reactive oxygen species ros noteworthy among ros is the hydroxyl radical oh with an eo of 2 8 v 16 which enables the chemical removal of recalcitrant contaminants and is highly effective in the oxidation of organic matter 17 18 19 different types of aops exist including the fenton process photo fenton process under sunlight and uv light photolysis of hydrogen peroxide under sunlight and uv light and uv radiation one of the most effective aops is the fenton reaction eqs 1 7 in which hydrogen peroxide is catalytically decomposed into ros by ferrous eq 1 and ferric eq 2 ions generally under acidic conditions 20 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh k 63 l mol 1 s 1 2 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h k 3 1 10 3 l mol 1 s 1 3 oh h2o2 ho2 h2o k 3 3 107 l mol 1 s 1 4 oh fe2 fe3 oh k 3 0 108 l mol 1 s 1 5 fe3 ho2 fe2 o2 h k 2 0 103 l mol 1 s 1 6 fe2 ho2 h fe3 h2o2 k 1 2 106 l mol 1 s 1 7 ho2 ho2 h2o2 o2 k 8 3 105 l mol 1 s 1 in water the aqua complexes of fe 3 are dependent on ph at ph 3 fe h2o 5 oh 2 is the predominant species exhibiting significant photoactivity in the uv and visible range of sunlight eq 8 8 fe h2o 5 oh 2 hv fe2 h ho in addition to removing organic matter commonly present in water the photochemical variant of the fenton reaction the photo fenton system is also capable of removing other harder to degrade compounds like xenobiotic compounds and chemical contaminants such as pesticides without the risk of formation of disinfectant by products dbps such as halogenated toxic compounds 21 in this case in the uv visible range 200 600 nm photolysis of fe3 complexes leads to regeneration of fe2 and an increase in oh radical production 22 23 when advanced oxidation processes are combined with light of a suitable wavelength solar or uv they have been shown to be among the most effective treatments for the removal of pesticides 24 25 they also cause a series of chain reactions that end in the mineralization of organic matter yielding co2 and water as end products 17 the main parameters affecting the fenton processes fenton and photo fenton are the ph concentration of iron in solution concentration of hydrogen peroxide irradiance and presence of other ions the optimum ph for fenton processes ranges between 2 5 and 3 2 20 in fact at ph higher than 4 fe2 ions are easily transformed to fe3 precipitating as iron hydroxy complexes 26 therefore one of the greatest scientific challenges for employing the photo fenton process as an optimal treatment for the degradation of pollutants is to find the suitable conditions to improve the efficiency of this process at neutral or near neutral ph likewise the water matrix to which the treatment is applied has a major influence on pesticide removal rates due to the presence of other ions with this in mind to achieve optimum control of their degradation each applied advanced oxidation treatment must be specifically studied depending on the type of pollutant and the matrix to which it is to be applied the efficiency of photolysis in combination with the use of chemical oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide improves the rate of degradation of the pesticide radiation may be used to break down the oxygen bonds of hydrogen peroxide thereby increasing the generation of hydroxyl radicals as shown in reactions 9 12 9 h2o2 hv 2 oh 10 ho r oh r 11 ho r h h2o r 12 ho r r oh uv radiation processes can also cause rapid degradation of the pesticide due to dechlorination hydroxylation reactions followed by a slow process of dealkylation 27 the use of this technology also enables overcoming the difficulties presented by the removal of these types of substances as it readily degrades the organic matter in the water permits reducing water treatment costs due to being more efficient safer and less complex than other treatment systems destroys contaminants without transferring them to another medium and does not generate waste furthermore its setup is simple the power requirements are low and complete oxidation of the pollutants to co2 and water is achieved 28 the drawbacks of this technology are that no residual effect is produced so that after implementing the aop and for its application in water for supply it is necessary to add an agent to protect the water from being polluted by other possible contaminants such as microorganisms within this context the main objective of this study was to determine at laboratory scale the optimal operating conditions for fenton oxidation photo fenton oxidation and photolysis of hydrogen peroxide under artificial sunlight and uv light for the removal of simazine in ultrapure water 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical methods the concentration of simazine in the degradation processes was analysed by hplc beckman coulter system gold 125 solvent module the chromatograph is equipped with a uv detector system gold 166 and a licrospher 100 rp 18 precolumn 5 Î¼m a superspher 100 rp 18 e c18 lichrocart column 5 Î¼m 2 mm 125 mm was used as the stationary phase the mobile phase was 70 30 v v acetonitrile and ultrapure water with a flow rate of 1 ml min in isocratic mode analyses were performed with an injection volume of 20 Î¼l by means of a hamilton ga 22s 51 mm pst2 syringe supelco simazine detection was performed at a wavelength of 230 nm total organic carbon toc was determined on a shimadzu toc 5050a total organic carbon analyser toc concentrations were calculated as the difference between total carbon tc and inorganic carbon ic the ph and conductivity of the pesticide solutions were measured using a crison mm4 multimeter the amount of hydrogen peroxide was measured throughout the experiments using merckoquant reagent strips from 0 to 100 mg l of h2o2 the initial and final concentrations of hydrogen peroxide were monitored using a solution of titanium oxysulphate via a spectrophotometric method at 410 nm modified din 38402 h15 method 2 2 reagents simazine was provided by sigma aldrich with a purity of 99 5 table 1 shows the main characteristics of the pesticide the iron sulphate heptahydrate for analysis feso47h2o with a purity of 99 5 was provided by scharlau hydrogen peroxide 30 w v was provided by panreac acetonitrile other hplc grade reagents and solvents were supplied by prolabo vwr the water used for preparing the different solutions and conducting the experiments came from an ultrapure water purification system 18 2 mÏ cm 2 3 data analysis multivariate experimental designs which simultaneously change the conditions in the experiments are being increasingly used nowadays as they provide maximum information with minimal experimental cost although their potential has yet to be exploited in environmental analysis 29 in this study a multivariate experimental design was carried out to model the simazine degradation process the dependent variable via a function the response surface which relates it to the independent variables involved in the aops described in section 2 5 the experimental designs used in this study are d optimal and full factorial design the d optimal experimental design domain was selected by analyzing experimental results from previous studies 30 33 the results of the d optimal experimental design were used as a factor screening to determine factors with either a positive or negative influence on the response variable this allowed a more limited experimental domain to be established and discarding other factors so that the subsequent full factorial design would be more efficient the r2 and q2 statistical parameters were used to check the quality of the proposed models the closer to the unit these parameters are the better their predictive power while the difference between them should not exceed 0 2 0 3 34 in accordance with the chemical nature of the data in this study r2 values 0 8 and q2 values 0 5 are considered acceptable and q2 values 0 8 are deemed excellent 35 to perform the experimental design and multivariate analysis we used the modde software developed by umetrics this software provides two parameters the validity of the model which is a measure of error which should be greater than 0 25 for there to be no lack of fit and reproducibility the reproducibility of a perfect model is 1 2 3 1 d optimal design d optimal design may be used when the number of experiments that need a classical design is very high 36 or when qualitative variables are being studied and the aim is to obtain a response surface as in our case in accordance with previous scientific studies on the fenton and photo fenton processes 20 three variables were selected two quantitative variables and one qualitative variable to determine the experimental conditions that maximize the percentage degradation of simazine dependent variable y 0 0 the independent variables chosen were the light condition as a qualitative variable x1 and the initial concentration of fe 2 x2 and initial concentration of h2o2 x3 as quantitative variables these parameters were defined as controlled because their value can be determined and their variation may involve optimization of the response variable the d optimal design is quadratic second order the modde software generating a series of proposals via an algorithm to determine the following equation 13 y b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 b12x1x2 b13x1x3 b23x2x3 b22x2x2 b33x3x3 the coefficient b0 is the difference between observed and predicted values for the response variable y this design maximizes the determinant of the x x matrix x is the expanded matrix of nxp dimensions n being the number of experiments and p the model coefficients the proposals generated by modde are chosen according to g efficiency the condition number and logdetnorm the g efficiency value is a measure of the statistical efficiency of the d optimal design compared to a factorial model g efficiency 100 this parameter should range at least from 65 to 70 34 the condition number is calculated as the ratio between the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the x x matrix and is a measure of design sphericity factorial designs without central points have a condition number of one and are located on the surface of a sphere most experimental designs have a condition number between 1 and 5 normally remaining below 10 depending on the number of factors logdetnorm is the logarithm of the determinant of the x x matrix normalized by the number of terms in the model p and the number of trials n it should be as close to zero as possible the following table table 2 summarizes the design parameters of the d optimal model employed in this paper and it can be seen to meet the conditions described previously the modde 10 0 software was used as a tool to optimize experimental conditions and select the most suitable advanced oxidation processes for the degradation of simazine furthermore the r statistical program was used to determine degradation models with environmental significance 2 3 2 full factorial model full factorial experimental design provides comprehensive information on the effect of each factor and all the possible interactions but requires more experiments than other models as the number of trials increases exponentially with the number of factors under study according to 2k where k is the number of factors that is why the optimal conditions obtained in the d optimal design were used as well as studying other factors not employed previously such as ph and time 2 4 photo reactors simazine degradation experiments were carried out in a suntest cps or luzchem photo reactor depending on the required light source in the applied aop each of the reactors used in the study are described in detail below i suntest cps photo reactor atlas linsengerich germany this is a solar radiation simulator operating within the 290 600 nm range the device is equipped with a xenon arc lamp as light source providing an average radiation intensity of 713 w m2 the mean irradiation intensity was monitored by means of a kipp zonen cuv5 radiometer ii luzchem photo reactor this photo reactor is equipped with 14 low pressure 32 cm w x33 cm d x21 cm h ultraviolet lamps 254 nm providing an average illumination of 175 foot candles both photo reactors are equipped with temperature control exposure time irradiation power and stirring systems samples previously spiked with simazine were placed in a 50 ml quartz reactor and situated inside the photo reactor before starting the experiments the photo reactors were switched on for 10 min for the light intensity of the lamps to stabilize 2 5 advanced oxidation processes the advanced oxidation processes applied in the present study were i fenton feso4 h2o2 darkness ii solar photo fenton feso4 h2o2 sunlight iii photo fenton under uv radiation feso4 h2o2 uv iv photolysis of hydrogen peroxide under sunlight h2o2 hv v photolysis of h2o2 under uv radiation h2o2 uv and vi ultraviolet radiation uv only table 3 shows the analysed variables and experimental conditions applied in each of the applied processes studied here for the fenton and photo fenton processes the iron source was first added to the reactor containing the simazine subsequently the ph was adjusted from 2 8 to 7 depending on the experiment and hydrogen peroxide was then added the sample was kept stirring at all times in the fenton process the samples were kept in darkness at 25 c while different light sources sunlight and artificial light were used in the photo fenton process the temperature reached in the reactor never exceeded 38 c for the hydrogen peroxide photolysis experiments the ph of the simazine solution was adjusted and different concentrations of h2o2 were added in accordance with the experimental conditions set out in table 3 aliquots were taken at pre established time intervals in the pesticide degradation process and subsequently measured by high pressure liquid chromatography hplc 3 results and discussion 3 1 d optimal model the d optimal model was applied to determine the variables and experimental conditions that most influence the degradation of simazine in ultrapure water by means of advanced oxidation processes a 4 mg l concentration of simazine was used for this purpose due to its proximity to the limit of solubility of the compound 5 mg l table 1 this concentration also falls within the 2 5 mg l range corresponding to the concentrations found in some agricultural areas where the use of this pesticide is widespread prior to dilution in surface waters 37 in the d optimal model the percentage degradation of simazine deg was considered the dependent variable while the independent variables were light sunlight darkness and uv radiation initial iron concentration 0 25 and 50 mg l and initial h2o2 concentration 1 5 and 10 mg l twenty one experiments were carried in all to study the interaction of these variables taking samples at intervals of 5 10 15 30 45 and 60 min table 4 shows the results degradation rate over time 60 min the use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant for treating water contaminated with persistent chemical compounds such as simazine has advantages over other oxidants such as chlorine and ozone in terms of its commercial availability thermal stability solubility in water and minimum investment in addition to avoiding the formation of products such as trihalomethanes 17 28 under conditions of darkness as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide increases from 1 mg l to 10 mg l the degradation rate of the compound increases from 1 to 6 after 60 min of treatment however these results are far from acceptable it can be seen that although hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizer with an oxidation potential of 1 80 and 0 87 v at ph 0 and 14 respectively 38 it is not sufficient in itself to completely degrade organochlorine compounds such as simazine therefore it was decided to study its combination with other physicochemical agents to facilitate the formation of hydroxyl radicals which have a higher oxidizing power of around 2 8 v 16 among the chemical agents most often used in combination with h2o2 is the fe 2 ion and among the physical agents sunlight and uv light when adding feso4 to the darkness h2o2 system an increase was observed in the degradation rate from 1 to 60 within only 5 min of reaction time reaching degradation rates above 80 after 45 min of treatment this behaviour is due to the fenton reaction 20 which is favoured at a ph near 3 2 where hydrogen peroxide is catalytically decomposed into reactive oxygen species ros by the ferric and ferrous ions present in the reaction eqs 1 7 hydrogen peroxide 10 mg l in the presence of sunlight achieved only 10 degradation of the pesticide after 60 min whereas a 100 removal rate was obtained after 45 min when it was used in combination with uv light this behaviour could be due to the facts that solar radiation is less energetic than uv radiation and that during photolysis using solar radiation the amount of hydroxyl radicals available to degrade the compound is low 39 an increase in the reaction rate is observed at low h2o2 concentrations as h2o2 can act as an electron acceptor and is in turn capable of generating hydroxyl radicals 40 41 however as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide decreases the simazine degradation rate likewise decreases probably due to the scavenger effect of hydroxyl radicals produced by the excess h2o2 37 in this case the excess h2o2 reacts with the hydroxyl radicals generating less reactive species such as ho2 eq 16 which may in turn react with the hydroxyl radicals generating oxygen and water eq 17 16 oh h2o2 h2o ho2 17 oh ho2 h2o o2 the photo fenton processes under sunlight and uv radiation on the other hand achieve high degradation rates from 5 min exposure time onwards obtaining values higher than 90 after 60 min of treatment furthermore the photo fenton reactions occur in two distinct phases an initial phase during the first 10 min of the experiment in which most of the degradation of the herbicide takes place coinciding with the greater amount of h2o2 present and a second much slower phase that lasts until the end of the experiment the breakthrough point of these two phases is also determined by the exhaustion of the hydrogen peroxide surface contour plots generated by the d optimal model were used to determine the variables that affect the process these plots fig 01 of supplementary data represent the simazine degradation rate versus the concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide under conditions of darkness sunlight and uv radiation under conditions of darkness fig 01a supplementary data excess iron 40 mg l and hydrogen peroxide 10 mg l is required for long periods of time to degrade at least 70 of the pollutant under study at high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide according to 42 and 43 the hydroxyl radical ho acts by attracting h2o2 forming less reactive radical species such as ho2 furthermore excess iron can pose a physical barrier increasing the turbidity of the water and minimizing the penetration of light into the treated water 44 for these reasons it is not considered a viable process and hence its study was discontinued in the presence of sunlight fig 01b supplementary data however degradation rates reach values of around 90 employing 50 ppm feso4 and 5 ppm h2o2 at ph 6 degradation and mineralization processes accelerate due to the contribution of the homogeneous photo fenton process which favours the formation of iron water complexes which are excellent generators of photoactive ros at 450 nm 22 despite the degradation values obtained it is not considered an optimal system because of the high concentrations of iron needed to carry out the process which are in breach of spanish legislation as per royal decree 140 2003 according to which the concentration of iron in drinking water should not exceed 0 2 mg l for this reason the optimal conditions of h2o2 and fe need to be set maintaining a ratio of 1 10 so that the amount of iron used is the minimum possible analyzing the photo fenton system under uv light on the other hand it can be seen in fig 01c that the degradation rate is higher than 96 employing concentrations of less than 5 mg l feso4 and 5 mg l h2o2 likewise in the absence of iron using 2 ppm hydrogen peroxide in the presence of uv radiation degradation rates of around 90 were achieved from the aforementioned results it can be determined that the concentrations of fe and h2o2 sunlight and uv radiation are factors that influence the aops applied in this paper to the degradation of simazine rivas et al 32 investigated the effects of ph temperature and iron concentration on the degradation of simazine at a given concentration of hydrogen peroxide these authors determined that the effective dose of fe ii had a greater influence on the degradation of the compound than the dosage of hydrogen peroxide in the present study both species were found to have a significant influence on the process furthermore the best results were obtained applying the photo fenton under sunlight and photolysis under uv light having studied the variables that most influence the advanced oxidation processes applied to simazine the goal was established of achieving at least 90 degradation of the compound this is the percentage established by legislation to consider some chemicals degradable as is the case of surfactants 45 the fenton process does not reach the target of 90 simazine degradation as can be seen in the response surface of fig 01a it was hence discarded from the next phase of the study as previously stated solar radiation meets the set objective only when employed in the photo fenton process with high concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide 50 ppm feso4 and 5 ppm h2o2 however uv radiation is capable of achieving 90 simazine degradation even in the absence of iron uv photolysis of hydrogen peroxide and in the presence of iron uv photo fenton process employing smaller amounts of reagents than with solar radiation 3 2 full factorial model based on the results obtained in the d optimal model the section shows the results of applying the full factorial model to low concentrations of simazine 0 5 mg l in line with the concentrations typically found in natural waters to determine the optimal values of the most influential variables in the aops studied in this paper ph and time were added to the variables studied in the d optimal model sunlight uv radiation concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide as these two variables are considered critical in the efficiency of aops according to chiron et al 46 to study the degradation of simazine a 2k full factorial design was performed using the anova statistical application 47 48 the use of this model yielded a total of 19 possible combinations of 4 replicates of the studied variables for advanced oxidation processes under sunlight and uv radiation a simazine concentration of 0 5 mg l was used to apply the full factorial model this amount had already been used by other authors in degradation studies of emerging contaminants in drinking water 30 37 and is very close to those found in wastewater effluent concentrations of up to 0 2 mg l 49 50 as stated in the previous section the application of the factorial design provides an empirical relationship between the response function percentage degradation and the independent terms ph time fe and h2o2 as described in eq 13 13 y b0 b1ph b2time b3fe b4h2o2 b5ph fe b6h2o2 time b7time ph b8time fe b9fe time where b0 is the independent term b1 b2 b3 and b4 are the linear terms and b5 b6 b7 b8 and b9 are the quadratic terms of the iterative solution the coefficient values indicate the positive or negative influence of the factors considered in the process 3 2 1 mathematical model of simazine degradation under sunlight the photo fenton advanced oxidation processes under sunlight were studied under conditions of ph 3 4 5 and 6 for 3 9 and 15 min employing iron concentrations of 0 2 mg l 1 1 mg l and 2 mg l and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 0 5 mg l 2 75 mg l and 5 mg l table 5 it can be seen in table 5 that at the studied ph values simazine degradation rates exceed 80 under the following conditions 2 mg l fe2 and 0 5 mg l h2o2 experiment 6 or 5 mg l h2o2 experiment 8 after 15 min of exposure to sunlight however as the ph increases to around 6 degradation rates likewise decrease this is because at these ph the generation of insoluble iron species such as goethite hematite magnetite and lepidocrocrite is favoured decreasing the concentration of soluble iron available for the photo fenton reaction 51 furthermore the quantum yields of the photons and the wavelengths of the solar radiation reaching the organic compounds fall within the lower energy bands of the light spectrum reducing the rate of generation of reactive oxygen species table 6 shows the model parameters obtained to explain the solar photo fenton advanced oxidation processes the function coefficients show that the concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide versus time have a positive effect on the degradation of the pesticide time being the factor that most affects the degradation of simazine as indicated by the value of its coefficient according to fallmann et al 52 the dependence on the iron concentration may be due to the fact that the reaction rate increases with the amount of catalyst until reaching a maximum value above which it tends to the asymptote at a certain threshold concentration of iron this threshold is dependent on the light source the thickness of the irradiated layer and the type of wastewater as filtering of internal light may occur the ph however has a negative effect on simazine degradation this is because the degradation process slows down with increasing ph due to the amount of available iron in the reaction as a function of ph as previously explained in the results obtained in the d optimal model to check the goodness of the model obtained in this study fig 1 shows the theoretical values predicted by the model and those obtained experimentally a high correlation of the model is observed with an r2 of 0 96 3 2 2 simazine degradation under photo fenton oxidation similar to the experiments employing sunlight the full factorial model was applied to the simazine degradation experiments under uv light the photo fenton advanced oxidation processes under uv light were studied under conditions of ph 3 4 5 and 6 for 3 9 and 15 min using iron concentrations of 0 2 mg l and 2 mg l and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 0 5 mg l 2 75 mg l and 5 mg l table 5 in this case 19 experiments were performed in all with four replicates the results of which are shown in table 7 analysing the results presented in table 7 it can be seen that simazine degradation increases with time of exposure to the advanced oxidation process obtaining degradation rates higher than 95 within 10 min previous studies 37 reported total degradation of the compound within 15 min of treatment furthermore it is confirmed that photo fenton processes are strongly ph dependent although this influence is more apparent when employing sunlight than with uv radiation as the latter is more energetic than sunlight acidic ph favours the formation of soluble iron species such as fe oh h2o 5 2 which are active under uv a radiation and sunlight within the visible range 53 54 however the photo fenton process is also efficient at neutral or near neutral ph in this case however homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes depend on ph and oxidation by products which vary during the process at neutral or near neutral ph the fe2 in solution decreases due to the formation of iron hydroxides iron hydroxides continue with the heterogeneous fenton process via reactions 14 and 15 generating hydroxyl radicals 14 15 the ferrous ion oxidizes to the ferric ion due to the dissolved oxygen in the water generating ferric ferrous metastable intermediate species green rusts these intermediate species finally become stable iron oxides 47 on the other hand a noticeable transformation of simazine can be observed in experiments 1 and 9 in table 7 when exposed to uv radiation in the absence of hydrogen peroxide at acidic ph 3 and neutral ph 7 respectively after 2 min of irradiation the degradation rate reached a value close to 80 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide degradation increases due to the presence of hydroxyl radicals generated during the photochemical reactions thus when adding 2 5 mg l h2o2 more than 90 of the compound had been removed experiments 3 and 11 the results also show the synergistic effects of uv light and hydrogen peroxide on the degradation rate experiments 3 7 11 and 15 and the degree of dependence of this rate on the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide during the first minutes of irradiation experiments 1 5 9 and 13 the increase in the peroxide concentration below 5 ppm is expected to accelerate the consumption of oxygen reactive species such as the oh radical to produce a smaller amount of ho2 radicals 17 20 the uv treatment was effective in the removal of the pesticide within the first few minutes reducing the initial concentration by around 80 experiments 1 and 9 for longer times the removal of simazine becomes more difficult not reaching 100 removal after 10 min of irradiation experiments 5 and 13 furthermore if hydrogen peroxide is added to the reaction system at higher concentrations than the pesticide itself its concentration may not change significantly during the reaction time 37 these differences point to the formation of reaction intermediates during the oxidation reaction which were not completely degraded to co2 and h2o the compounds 2 hydroxy 4 6 bis ethylamine s triazine 2 chloro 4 amino 6 ethylamine s triazine deisopropylatrazine and 2 chloro 4 6 diamino s triazine diamino chlorotriazine were reported as the main degradation products 55 analysing the results and applying anova statistical analysis it can be seen that in order to achieve optimum degradation values close to 100 with the fastest degradation kinetics the most efficient process was uv 2 5 mg l h2o2 table 8 shows the values obtained from the full factorial model as well as the r2 correlation coefficients and the residual error of the model the function coefficients show that the concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide have a positive effect on the degradation of the pesticide these results agree with those obtained by catalkaya and kargi 37 when applying the box behnken experimental design to simazine degradation processes via the fenton reaction on the other hand the ph has a negative effect on the degradation of simazine the degradation process slows down with increasing ph time is the factor that most affects simazine degradation as evidenced by the value of the coefficient the model presents a high correlation between the degradation data obtained experimentally and the theoretical model data r2 0 8512 as can be observed in the following figure fig 2 despite the high removal rates of the starting compound simazine the decrease in toc was relatively low in some cases the toc value even increased over time this was the case in the uv h2o2 process in which the initial toc was 0 8 mg l reaching 1 12 mg l within 1 min intermediate time in experiment 11 and 1 14 mg l within 5 min intermediate time in experiment 15 it was also the case in the uv h2o2 fe process which started out with an initial toc of 1 26 mg l reaching 1 30 mg l within five minutes intermediate time in experiment 15 this evolution of toc was similar in the three processes obtaining toc values close to 1 ppm within 10 min of treatment indicating that total mineralization is not taking place this is because the s atrazine ring is not destroyed in the degradation pathway of simazine by photo fenton processes and stable products such as cyanuric acid are formed 56 according to kavitha and palanivelu 57 this may be due to the formation of short chain by products such as carboxylic acids which halts the reduction in toc as a result of the production of organic and inorganic acids the ph decreased from neutral ph 7 to acidic ph 3 5 during irradiation experiment 13 beltran et al 58 reported an h2o2 uv kinetic degradation study obtaining complete degradation of the compound employing 136 mg l h2o2 and 5 mg l simazine their results established that the major contribution to the conversion pathway of the contaminant was due to the radical reaction 68 compared to the 32 contribution reported for direct photolysis 18 3 3 kinetics of simazine degradation comparing the kinetic models obtained for the degradation of simazine under sunlight and uv light the degradation rate of the compound is found to be directly related to time in both cases in the aops employing sunlight however the concentrations of iron and peroxide have a direct relationship with the removal of the compound these processes being favoured at acidic phs although both models have the same parameters the influence of each in the oxidation process is different depending on the light source employed in the process simazine degradation processes via the application of aops under sunlight and uv radiation follow first order kinetics eq 18 18 a a o e kt table 9 shows the kinetic constants sec 1 of simazine degradation by solar photolysis and the photo fenton process under sunlight at ph 3 and 6 in the solar photolysis processes employing 1 mg l and 10 mg l h2o2 the degradation rate of the compound was negligible around 6 and 10 respectively the value of their constant is hence assumed to be zero 0 the same occurs in the solar photo fenton process employing 0 5 ppm h2o2 and 2 ppm fe where the degradation rate obtained is only 4 18 in general aops under sunlight are found to be more efficient at ph acids the experimental condition of sunlight 5 ppm h2o2 2 ppm fe being faster with a constant rate of 0 003 s 1 table 9 according to the reaction rate followed by the photo fenton processes under sunlight i e solar radiation 0 5 ppm h2o2 0 2 ppm fe solar radiation 5 ppm h2o2 0 2 ppm fe solar radiation 5 ppm h2o2 2 ppm fe it follows that increasing the dosage of iron is more beneficial for the reaction than increasing the dosage of peroxide because it is the fe which provides speed to the reaction as a function of ph as evidenced by the coefficient of fe in the full factorial model applied table 7 furthermore table 10 shows the kinetic constants of simazine degradation by aops under uv radiation differences between the applied treatments are observed the decreasing order of efficiency of the degradation processes being as follows uv h2o2 uv h2o2 fe uv the fastest most efficient process is uv h2o2 ensuring degradation rates above 90 with a rate constant 0 02 s 1 compared to the experiments under sunlight a higher degradation rate and a higher reaction rate were generally obtained in the uv light experiments thus within 2 min of irradiation in the absence of h2o2 the degradation rate had already reached 83 with a k value of 0 011 s 1 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide a synergetic effect between uv light and hydrogen peroxide was observed the hydroxyl radicals generated during the photochemical reactions increasing substantially in this case more than 90 of the compound had been removed in the presence of 2 5 mg l h2o2 within the same reaction time in short when comparing the aops using sunlight and uv radiation the following increasing trend in the reaction rate is observed kphotolysis under sunlight kphoto fenton under sunlight kuv kphoto fenton under uv radiation kphotolysis under uv radiation 4 conclusions the d optimal model was used to evaluate the influence of hydrogen peroxide iron and light conditions on the degradation of simazine using advanced oxidation processes degradation levels are highly dependent on the operating conditions i e reagent dosage time and ph from the results obtained with the d optimal model 90 simazine degradation was established as a reference value to discard the effectiveness of the fenton process under the conditions studied in this paper and optimize the main operating variables the concentrations of iron and peroxide which can affect photolysis and photo fenton processes under sunlight and uv radiation two mathematical equations are proposed using the full factorial model for advanced oxidation processes under sunlight and uv light the effectiveness of the independent variables and their interactions in the removal of the pesticide were determined comparing the obtained kinetic models of simazine degradation under sunlight and uv light it is reported that in both cases the degradation rate of the compound is directly related to time however in the aop with sunlight the concentration of iron and peroxides is directly related to compound removal and these processes are beneficial at acidic ph although the two models have the same parameters the influence of each of them on the oxidation process is different depending on the light source used in the process the following increasing order of the degree of influence of the operating variables in the aops using sunlight is established h2o2 fe time while in the aops using uv radiation the increasing order of influence is fe h2o2 time furthermore high degradation rates were obtained but low rates of mineralization due to the formation of reaction intermediates having analysed the kinetic constants obtained from the aops studied in this paper it is concluded that the optimal process to use in the treatment of natural water would be uv h2o2 employing 2 5 ppm h2o2 in future lines of research once the optimal conditions are known the influence on the formation of reaction intermediates should be studied in order to achieve better mineralisation rates declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements

13466,the study presents the results of the degradation of simazine at concentrations of 4 mg l and 0 5 mg l by means of different advanced oxidation processes photolysis of hydrogen peroxide under sunlight and uv light fenton and photo fenton under sunlight and uv light in ultrapure water at laboratory scale the aim of the study was to optimize some of the main operating variables involved in the process reaction time concentrations of iron and peroxide light sources and ph employing d optimal and full factorial design using contour plots from the d optimal design the concentrations of iron and peroxide sunlight and uv radiation were found to be the factors that most influence the advanced oxidation processes employed in this study full factorial analysis allowed us to establish the time concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide and operating variables that most affect the degradation of simazine under sunlight and uv radiation the degradation kinetics were likewise determined establishing that the kinetic constants obey the following ascending order of effectiveness kphotolysis under sunlight kphoto fenton under sunlight kuv kphotofenton under uv radiation kphotolysis under uv radiation finally among the different advanced oxidation processes applied to the degradation of simazine in ultrapure water it was determined that the h2o2 uv process provides the highest level of pesticide removal keywords aops degradation simazine multivariable experimental design emerging contaminants 1 introduction emerging contaminants pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products their metabolites and or reaction products are compounds that have been increasing in number and volume of production in recent decades in line with industrial and technological development within this group pesticides are the most widely used organic compounds on a global scale and can be found in the soil surface water groundwater and even in drinking water 1 5 although they are present at low concentrations in the environment at an order of magnitude ranging from ng l to Î¼g l these compounds can have toxic effects on plants and wildlife belonging to the different ecosystems into which they are discharged furthermore they can be transferred to people via the food chain in many different ways bioaccumulation biomagnification etc with the corresponding hazard to health concerns about these compounds have accordingly increased in recent decades 6 one of the most widely used pesticides is simazine this pesticide is a highly toxic organochlorine compound belonging to the triazines group 7 it has been used as an herbicide for more than 50 years to combat pests control broadleaf weeds and annual grasses in fruit crop fields and hence increase agricultural production its widespread use was banned by the european union in 2004 2004 ec because scientific studies had shown that this organic compound accumulates in the soil of agricultural areas before being leached into surface water and groundwater used to supply cities 1 8 reaching concentrations of up to 0 06 4 5 mg l in the waters of these areas despite this ban at a european level it continues to be used in some countries like australia 9 in mammals simazine may bring about alterations in the endocrine system increasing the production of oestrogen 10 and altering the hypothalamic regulation of the lh hormone which influences reproduction and foetal growth furthermore in the case of mice it can generate apoptosis and cell proliferation during gestation 11 prolonged consumption of simazine is harmful to humans because it forms part of the food chain being found in particular in oils and fruits 12 when contaminated wastewaters reach drinking water treatment plants dwtts numerous studies 13 have shown that current treatment operations implemented in these plants such as filtration chlorination coagulation and activated carbon adsorption do not appear to be sufficiently effective to destroy these pollutants they remove the contaminant from the aqueous phase to another but do not destroy it or obtain water without any content in pesticides this is because they are recalcitrant compounds that are difficult to degrade it is hence necessary to research the type of treatment to carry out to achieve the goal of complying with the legal limits established by international and national regulations in spain royal decree 140 2003 regarding water for human consumption sets a limit of 0 5 Î¼g l for the total amount of pesticides in water and a limit of 0 1 Î¼g l for each individual pesticide including simazine within this context advanced oxidation processes aops are currently emerging as a leading alternative technology in the treatment of water contaminated with organic products that are not treatable by means of conventional techniques 14 15 aops involve the generation and use of oxidizing transient species such as reactive oxygen species ros noteworthy among ros is the hydroxyl radical oh with an eo of 2 8 v 16 which enables the chemical removal of recalcitrant contaminants and is highly effective in the oxidation of organic matter 17 18 19 different types of aops exist including the fenton process photo fenton process under sunlight and uv light photolysis of hydrogen peroxide under sunlight and uv light and uv radiation one of the most effective aops is the fenton reaction eqs 1 7 in which hydrogen peroxide is catalytically decomposed into ros by ferrous eq 1 and ferric eq 2 ions generally under acidic conditions 20 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh k 63 l mol 1 s 1 2 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h k 3 1 10 3 l mol 1 s 1 3 oh h2o2 ho2 h2o k 3 3 107 l mol 1 s 1 4 oh fe2 fe3 oh k 3 0 108 l mol 1 s 1 5 fe3 ho2 fe2 o2 h k 2 0 103 l mol 1 s 1 6 fe2 ho2 h

photoactivity in the uv and visible range of sunlight eq 8 8 fe h2o 5 oh 2 hv fe2 h ho in addition to removing organic matter commonly present in water the photochemical variant of the fenton reaction the photo fenton system is also capable of removing other harder to degrade compounds like xenobiotic compounds and chemical contaminants such as pesticides without the risk of formation of disinfectant by products dbps such as halogenated toxic compounds 21 in this case in the uv visible range 200 600 nm photolysis of fe3 complexes leads to regeneration of fe2 and an increase in oh radical production 22 23 when advanced oxidation processes are combined with light of a suitable wavelength solar or uv they have been shown to be among the most effective treatments for the removal of pesticides 24 25 they also cause a series of chain reactions that end in the mineralization of organic matter yielding co2 and water as end products 17 the main parameters affecting the fenton processes fenton and photo fenton are the ph concentration of iron in solution concentration of hydrogen peroxide irradiance and presence of other ions the optimum ph for fenton processes ranges between 2 5 and 3 2 20 in fact at ph higher than 4 fe2 ions are easily transformed to fe3 precipitating as iron hydroxy complexes 26 therefore one of the greatest scientific challenges for employing the photo fenton process as an optimal treatment for the degradation of pollutants is to find the suitable conditions to improve the efficiency of this process at neutral or near neutral ph likewise the water matrix to which the treatment is applied has a major influence on pesticide removal rates due to the presence of other ions with this in mind to achieve optimum control of their degradation each applied advanced oxidation treatment must be specifically studied depending on the type of pollutant and the matrix to which it is to be applied the efficiency of photolysis in combination with the use of chemical oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide improves the rate of degradation of the pesticide radiation may be used to break down the oxygen bonds of hydrogen peroxide thereby increasing the generation of hydroxyl radicals as shown in reactions 9 12 9 h2o2 hv 2 oh 10 ho r oh r 11 ho r h h2o r 12 ho r r oh uv radiation processes can also cause rapid degradation of the pesticide due to dechlorination hydroxylation reactions followed by a slow process of dealkylation 27 the use of this technology also enables overcoming the difficulties presented by the removal of these types of substances as it readily degrades the organic matter in the water permits reducing water treatment costs due to being more efficient safer and less complex than other treatment systems destroys contaminants without transferring them to another medium and does not generate waste furthermore its setup is simple the power requirements are low and complete oxidation of the pollutants to co2 and water is achieved 28 the drawbacks of this technology are that no residual effect is produced so that after implementing the aop and for its application in water for supply it is necessary to add an agent to protect the water from being polluted by other possible contaminants such as microorganisms within this context the main objective of this study was to determine at laboratory scale the optimal operating conditions for fenton oxidation photo fenton oxidation and photolysis of hydrogen peroxide under artificial sunlight and uv light for the removal of simazine in ultrapure water 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical methods the concentration of simazine in the degradation processes was analysed by hplc beckman coulter system gold 125 solvent module the chromatograph is equipped with a uv detector system gold 166 and a licrospher 100 rp 18 precolumn 5 Î¼m a superspher 100 rp 18 e c18 lichrocart column 5 Î¼m 2 mm 125 mm was used as the stationary phase the mobile phase was 70 30 v v acetonitrile and ultrapure water with a flow rate of 1 ml min in isocratic mode analyses were performed with an injection volume of 20 Î¼l by means of a hamilton ga 22s 51 mm pst2 syringe supelco simazine detection was performed at a wavelength of 230 nm total organic carbon toc was determined on a shimadzu toc 5050a total organic carbon analyser toc concentrations were calculated as the difference between total carbon tc and inorganic carbon ic the ph and conductivity of the pesticide solutions were measured using a crison mm4 multimeter the amount of hydrogen peroxide was measured throughout the experiments using merckoquant reagent strips from 0 to 100 mg l of h2o2 the initial and final concentrations of hydrogen peroxide were monitored using a solution of titanium oxysulphate via a spectrophotometric method at 410 nm modified din 38402 h15 method 2 2 reagents simazine was provided by sigma aldrich with a purity of 99 5 table 1 shows the main characteristics of the pesticide the iron sulphate heptahydrate for analysis feso47h2o with a purity of 99 5 was provided by scharlau hydrogen peroxide 30 w v was provided by panreac acetonitrile other hplc grade reagents and solvents were supplied by prolabo vwr the water used for preparing the different solutions and conducting the experiments came from an ultrapure water purification system 18 2 mÏ cm 2 3 data analysis multivariate experimental designs which simultaneously change the conditions in the experiments are being increasingly used nowadays as they provide maximum information with minimal experimental cost although their potential has yet to be exploited in environmental analysis 29 in this study a multivariate experimental design was carried out to model the simazine degradation process the dependent variable via a function the response surface which relates it to the independent variables involved in the aops described in section 2 5 the experimental designs used in this study are d optimal and full factorial design the d optimal experimental design domain was selected by analyzing experimental results from previous studies 30 33 the results of the d optimal experimental design were used as a factor screening to determine factors with either a positive or negative influence on the response variable this allowed a more limited experimental domain to be established and discarding other factors so that the subsequent full factorial design would be more efficient the r2 and q2 statistical parameters were used to check the quality of the proposed models the closer to the unit these parameters are the better their predictive power while the difference between them should not exceed 0 2 0 3 34 in accordance with the chemical nature of the data in this study r2 values 0 8 and q2 values 0 5 are considered acceptable and q2 values 0 8 are deemed excellent 35 to perform the experimental design and multivariate analysis we used the modde software developed by umetrics this software provides two parameters the validity of the model which is a measure of error which should be greater than 0 25 for there to be no lack of fit and reproducibility the reproducibility of a perfect model is 1 2 3 1 d optimal design d optimal design may be used when the number of experiments that need a classical design is very high 36 or when qualitative variables are being studied and the aim is to obtain a response surface as in our case in accordance with previous scientific studies on the fenton and photo fenton processes 20 three variables were selected two quantitative variables and one qualitative variable to determine the experimental conditions that maximize the percentage degradation of simazine dependent variable y 0 0 the independent variables chosen were the light condition as a qualitative variable x1 and the initial concentration of fe 2 x2 and initial concentration of h2o2 x3 as quantitative variables these parameters were defined as controlled because their value can be determined and their variation may involve optimization of the response variable the d optimal design is quadratic second order the modde software generating a series of proposals via an algorithm to determine the following equation 13 y b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 b12x1x2 b13x1x3 b23x2x3 b22x2x2 b33x3x3 the coefficient b0 is the difference between observed and predicted values for the response variable y this design maximizes the determinant of the x x matrix x is the expanded matrix of nxp dimensions n being the number of experiments and p the model coefficients the proposals generated by modde are chosen according to g efficiency the condition number and logdetnorm the g efficiency value is a measure of the statistical efficiency of the d optimal design compared to a factorial model g efficiency 100 this parameter should range at least from 65 to 70 34 the condition number is calculated as the ratio between the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the x x matrix and is a measure of design sphericity factorial designs without central points have a condition number of one and are located on the surface of a sphere most experimental designs have a condition number between 1 and 5 normally remaining below 10 depending on the number of factors logdetnorm is the logarithm of the determinant of the x x matrix normalized by the number of terms in the model p and the number of trials n it should be as close to zero as possible the following table table 2 summarizes the design parameters of the d optimal model employed in this paper and it can be seen to meet the conditions described previously the modde 10 0 software was used as a tool to optimize experimental conditions and select the most suitable advanced oxidation processes for the degradation of simazine furthermore the r statistical program was used to determine degradation models with environmental significance 2 3 2 full factorial model full factorial experimental design provides comprehensive information on the effect of each factor and all the possible interactions but requires more experiments than other models as the number of trials increases exponentially with the number of factors under study according to 2k where k is the number of factors that is why the optimal conditions obtained in the d optimal design were used as well as studying other factors not employed previously such as ph and time 2 4 photo reactors simazine degradation experiments were carried out in a suntest cps or luzchem photo reactor depending on the required light source in the applied aop each of the reactors used in the study are described in detail below i suntest cps photo reactor atlas linsengerich germany this is a solar radiation simulator operating within the 290 600 nm range the device is equipped with a xenon arc lamp as light source providing an average radiation intensity of 713 w m2 the mean irradiation intensity was monitored by means of a kipp zonen cuv5 radiometer ii luzchem photo reactor this photo reactor is equipped with 14 low pressure 32 cm w x33 cm d x21 cm h ultraviolet lamps 254 nm providing an average illumination of 175 foot candles both photo reactors are equipped with temperature control exposure time irradiation power and stirring systems samples previously spiked with simazine were placed in a 50 ml quartz reactor and situated inside the photo reactor before starting the experiments the photo reactors were switched on for 10 min for the light intensity of the lamps to stabilize 2 5 advanced oxidation processes the advanced oxidation processes applied in the present study were i fenton feso4 h2o2 darkness ii solar photo fenton feso4 h2o2 sunlight iii photo fenton under uv radiation feso4 h2o2 uv iv photolysis of hydrogen peroxide under sunlight h2o2 hv v photolysis of h2o2 under uv radiation h2o2 uv and vi ultraviolet radiation uv only table 3 shows the analysed variables and experimental conditions applied in each of the applied processes studied here for the fenton and photo fenton processes the iron source was first added to the reactor containing the simazine subsequently the ph was adjusted from 2 8 to 7 depending on the experiment and hydrogen peroxide was then added the sample was kept stirring at all times in the fenton process the samples were kept in darkness at 25 c while different light sources sunlight and artificial light were used in the photo fenton process the temperature reached in the reactor never exceeded 38 c for the hydrogen peroxide photolysis experiments the ph of the simazine solution was adjusted and different concentrations of h2o2 were added in accordance with the experimental conditions set out in table 3 aliquots were taken at pre established time intervals in the pesticide degradation process and subsequently measured by high pressure liquid chromatography hplc 3 results and discussion 3 1 d optimal model the d optimal model was applied to determine the variables and experimental conditions that most influence the degradation of simazine in ultrapure water by means of advanced oxidation processes a 4 mg l concentration of simazine was used for this purpose due to its proximity to the limit of solubility of the compound 5 mg l table 1 this concentration also falls within the 2 5 mg l range corresponding to the concentrations found in some agricultural areas where the use of this pesticide is widespread prior to dilution in surface waters 37 in the d optimal model the percentage degradation of simazine deg was considered the dependent variable while the independent variables were light sunlight darkness and uv radiation initial iron concentration 0 25 and 50 mg l and initial h2o2 concentration 1 5 and 10 mg l twenty one experiments were carried in all to study the interaction of these variables taking samples at intervals of 5 10 15 30 45 and 60 min table 4 shows the results degradation rate over time 60 min the use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant for treating water contaminated with persistent chemical compounds such as simazine has advantages over other oxidants such as chlorine and ozone in terms of its commercial availability thermal stability solubility in water and minimum investment in addition to avoiding the formation of products such as trihalomethanes 17 28 under conditions of darkness as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide increases from 1 mg l to 10 mg l the degradation rate of the compound increases from 1 to 6 after 60 min of treatment however these results are far from acceptable it can be seen that although hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizer with an oxidation potential of 1 80 and 0 87 v at ph 0 and 14 respectively 38 it is not sufficient in itself to completely degrade organochlorine compounds such as simazine therefore it was decided to study its combination with other physicochemical agents to facilitate the formation of hydroxyl radicals which have a higher oxidizing power of around 2 8 v 16 among the chemical agents most often used in combination with h2o2 is the fe 2 ion and among the physical agents sunlight and uv light when adding feso4 to the darkness h2o2 system an increase was observed in the degradation rate from 1 to 60 within only 5 min of reaction time reaching degradation rates above 80 after 45 min of treatment this behaviour is due to the fenton reaction 20 which is favoured at a ph near 3 2 where hydrogen peroxide is catalytically decomposed into reactive oxygen species ros by the ferric and ferrous ions present in the reaction eqs 1 7 hydrogen peroxide 10 mg l in the presence of sunlight achieved only 10 degradation of the pesticide after 60 min whereas a 100 removal rate was obtained after 45 min when it was used in combination with uv light this behaviour could be due to the facts that solar radiation is less energetic than uv radiation and that during photolysis using solar radiation the amount of hydroxyl radicals available to degrade the compound is low 39 an increase in the reaction rate is observed at low h2o2 concentrations as h2o2 can act as an electron acceptor and is in turn capable of generating hydroxyl radicals 40 41 however as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide decreases the simazine degradation rate likewise decreases probably due to the scavenger effect of hydroxyl radicals produced by the excess h2o2 37 in this case the excess h2o2 reacts with the hydroxyl radicals generating less reactive species such as ho2 eq 16 which may in turn react with the hydroxyl radicals generating oxygen and water eq 17 16 oh h2o2 h2o ho2 17 oh ho2 h2o o2 the photo fenton processes under sunlight and uv radiation on the other hand achieve high degradation rates from 5 min exposure time onwards obtaining values higher than 90 after 60 min of treatment furthermore the photo fenton reactions occur in two distinct phases an initial phase during the first 10 min of the experiment in which most of the degradation of the herbicide takes place coinciding with the greater amount of h2o2 present and a second much slower phase that lasts until the end of the experiment the breakthrough point of these two phases is also determined by the exhaustion of the hydrogen peroxide surface contour plots generated by the d optimal model were used to determine the variables that affect the process these plots fig 01 of supplementary data represent the simazine degradation rate versus the concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide under conditions of darkness sunlight and uv radiation under conditions of darkness fig 01a supplementary data excess iron 40 mg l and hydrogen peroxide 10 mg l is required for long periods of time to degrade at least 70 of the pollutant under study at high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide according to 42 and 43 the hydroxyl radical ho acts by attracting h2o2 forming less reactive radical species such as ho2 furthermore excess iron can pose a physical barrier increasing the turbidity of the water and minimizing the penetration of light into the treated water 44 for these reasons it is not considered a viable process and hence its study was discontinued in the presence of sunlight fig 01b supplementary data however degradation rates reach values of around 90 employing 50 ppm feso4 and 5 ppm h2o2 at ph 6 degradation and mineralization processes accelerate due to the contribution of the homogeneous photo fenton process which favours the formation of iron water complexes which are excellent generators of photoactive ros at 450 nm 22 despite the degradation values obtained it is not considered an optimal system because of the high concentrations of iron needed to carry out the process which are in breach of spanish legislation as per royal decree 140 2003 according to which the concentration of iron in drinking water should not exceed 0 2 mg l for this reason the optimal conditions of h2o2 and fe need to be set maintaining a ratio of 1 10 so that the amount of iron used is the minimum possible analyzing the photo fenton system under uv light on the other hand it can be seen in fig 01c that the degradation rate is higher than 96 employing concentrations of less than 5 mg l feso4 and 5 mg l h2o2 likewise in the absence of iron using 2 ppm hydrogen peroxide in the presence of uv radiation degradation rates of around 90 were achieved from the aforementioned results it can be determined that the concentrations of fe and h2o2 sunlight and uv radiation are factors that influence the aops applied in this paper to the degradation of simazine rivas et al 32 investigated the effects of ph temperature and iron concentration on the degradation of simazine at a given concentration of hydrogen peroxide these authors determined that the effective dose of fe ii had a greater influence on the degradation of the compound than the dosage of hydrogen peroxide in the present study both species were found to have a significant influence on the process furthermore the best results were obtained applying the photo fenton under sunlight and photolysis under uv light having studied the variables that most influence the advanced oxidation processes applied to simazine the goal was established of achieving at least 90 degradation of the compound this is the percentage established by legislation to consider some chemicals degradable as is the case of surfactants 45 the fenton process does not reach the target of 90 simazine degradation as can be seen in the response surface of fig 01a it was hence discarded from the next phase of the study as previously stated solar radiation meets the set objective only when employed in the photo fenton process with high concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide 50 ppm feso4 and 5 ppm h2o2 however uv radiation is capable of achieving 90 simazine degradation even in the absence of iron uv photolysis of hydrogen peroxide and in the presence of iron uv photo fenton process employing smaller amounts of reagents than with solar radiation 3 2 full factorial model based on the results obtained in the d optimal model the section shows the results of applying the full factorial model to low concentrations of simazine 0 5 mg l in line with the concentrations typically found in natural waters to determine the optimal values of the most influential variables in the aops studied in this paper ph and time were added to the variables studied in the d optimal model sunlight uv radiation concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide as these two variables are considered critical in the efficiency of aops according to chiron et al 46 to study the degradation of simazine a 2k full factorial design was performed using the anova statistical application 47 48 the use of this model yielded a total of 19 possible combinations of 4 replicates of the studied variables for advanced oxidation processes under sunlight and uv radiation a simazine concentration of 0 5 mg l was used to apply the full factorial model this amount had already been used by other authors in degradation studies of emerging contaminants in drinking water 30 37 and is very close to those found in wastewater effluent concentrations of up to 0 2 mg l 49 50 as stated in the previous section the application of the factorial design provides an empirical relationship between the response function percentage degradation and the independent terms ph time fe and h2o2 as described in eq 13 13 y b0 b1ph b2time b3fe b4h2o2 b5ph fe b6h2o2 time b7time ph b8time fe b9fe time where b0 is the independent term b1 b2 b3 and b4 are the linear terms and b5 b6 b7 b8 and b9 are the quadratic terms of the iterative solution the coefficient values indicate the positive or negative influence of the factors considered in the process 3 2 1 mathematical model of simazine degradation under sunlight the photo fenton advanced oxidation processes under sunlight were studied under conditions of ph 3 4 5 and 6 for 3 9 and 15 min employing iron concentrations of 0 2 mg l 1 1 mg l and 2 mg l and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 0 5 mg l 2 75 mg l and 5 mg l table 5 it can be seen in table 5 that at the studied ph values simazine degradation rates exceed 80 under the following conditions 2 mg l fe2 and 0 5 mg l h2o2 experiment 6 or 5 mg l h2o2 experiment 8 after 15 min of exposure to sunlight however as the ph increases to around 6 degradation rates likewise decrease this is because at these ph the generation of insoluble iron species such as goethite hematite magnetite and lepidocrocrite is favoured decreasing the concentration of soluble iron available for the photo fenton reaction 51 furthermore the quantum yields of the photons and the wavelengths of the solar radiation reaching the organic compounds fall within the lower energy bands of the light spectrum reducing the rate of generation of reactive oxygen species table 6 shows the model parameters obtained to explain the solar photo fenton advanced oxidation processes the function coefficients show that the concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide versus time have a positive effect on the degradation of the pesticide time being the factor that most affects the degradation of simazine as indicated by the value of its coefficient according to fallmann et al 52 the dependence on the iron concentration may be due to the fact that the reaction rate increases with the amount of catalyst until reaching a maximum value above which it tends to the asymptote at a certain threshold concentration of iron this threshold is dependent on the light source the thickness of the irradiated layer and the type of wastewater as filtering of internal light may occur the ph however has a negative effect on simazine degradation this is because the degradation process slows down with increasing ph due to the amount of available iron in the reaction as a function of ph as previously explained in the results obtained in the d optimal model to check the goodness of the model obtained in this study fig 1 shows the theoretical values predicted by the model and those obtained experimentally a high correlation of the model is observed with an r2 of 0 96 3 2 2 simazine degradation under photo fenton oxidation similar to the experiments employing sunlight the full factorial model was applied to the simazine degradation experiments under uv light the photo fenton advanced oxidation processes under uv light were studied under conditions of ph 3 4 5 and 6 for 3 9 and 15 min using iron concentrations of 0 2 mg l and 2 mg l and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 0 5 mg l 2 75 mg l and 5 mg l table 5 in this case 19 experiments were performed in all with four replicates the results of which are shown in table 7 analysing the results presented in table 7 it can be seen that simazine degradation increases with time of exposure to the advanced oxidation process obtaining degradation rates higher than 95 within 10 min previous studies 37 reported total degradation of the compound within 15 min of treatment furthermore it is confirmed that photo fenton processes are strongly ph dependent although this influence is more apparent when employing sunlight than with uv radiation as the latter is more energetic than sunlight acidic ph favours the formation of soluble iron species such as fe oh h2o 5 2 which are active under uv a radiation and sunlight within the visible range 53 54 however the photo fenton process is also efficient at neutral or near neutral ph in this case however homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes depend on ph and oxidation by products which vary during the process at neutral or near neutral ph the fe2 in solution decreases due to the formation of iron hydroxides iron hydroxides continue with the heterogeneous fenton process via reactions 14 and 15 generating hydroxyl radicals 14 15 the ferrous ion oxidizes to the ferric ion due to the dissolved oxygen in the water generating ferric ferrous metastable intermediate species green rusts these intermediate species finally become stable iron oxides 47 on the other hand a noticeable transformation of simazine can be observed in experiments 1 and 9 in table 7 when exposed to uv radiation in the absence of hydrogen peroxide at acidic ph 3 and neutral ph 7 respectively after 2 min of irradiation the degradation rate reached a value close to 80 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide degradation increases due to the presence of hydroxyl radicals generated during the photochemical reactions thus when adding 2 5 mg l h2o2 more than 90 of the compound had been removed experiments 3 and 11 the results also show the synergistic effects of uv light and hydrogen peroxide on the degradation rate experiments 3 7 11 and 15 and the degree of dependence of this rate on the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide during the first minutes of irradiation experiments 1 5 9 and 13 the increase in the peroxide concentration below 5 ppm is expected to accelerate the consumption of oxygen reactive species such as the oh radical to produce a smaller amount of ho2 radicals 17 20 the uv treatment was effective in the removal of the pesticide within the first few minutes reducing the initial concentration by around 80 experiments 1 and 9 for longer times the removal of simazine becomes more difficult not reaching 100 removal after 10 min of irradiation experiments 5 and 13 furthermore if hydrogen peroxide is added to the reaction system at higher concentrations than the pesticide itself its concentration may not change significantly during the reaction time 37 these differences point to the formation of reaction intermediates during the oxidation reaction which were not completely degraded to co2 and h2o the compounds 2 hydroxy 4 6 bis ethylamine s triazine 2 chloro 4 amino 6 ethylamine s triazine deisopropylatrazine and 2 chloro 4 6 diamino s triazine diamino chlorotriazine were reported as the main degradation products 55 analysing the results and applying anova statistical analysis it can be seen that in order to achieve optimum degradation values close to 100 with the fastest degradation kinetics the most efficient process was uv 2 5 mg l h2o2 table 8 shows the values obtained from the full factorial model as well as the r2 correlation coefficients and the residual error of the model the function coefficients show that the concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide have a positive effect on the degradation of the pesticide these results agree with those obtained by catalkaya and kargi 37 when applying the box behnken experimental design to simazine degradation processes via the fenton reaction on the other hand the ph has a negative effect on the degradation of simazine the degradation process slows down with increasing ph time is the factor that most affects simazine degradation as evidenced by the value of the coefficient the model presents a high correlation between the degradation data obtained experimentally and the theoretical model data r2 0 8512 as can be observed in the following figure fig 2 despite the high removal rates of the starting compound simazine the decrease in toc was relatively low in some cases the toc value even increased over time this was the case in the uv h2o2 process in which the initial toc was 0 8 mg l reaching 1 12 mg l within 1 min intermediate time in experiment 11 and 1 14 mg l within 5 min intermediate time in experiment 15 it was also the case in the uv h2o2 fe process which started out with an initial toc of 1 26 mg l reaching 1 30 mg l within five minutes intermediate time in experiment 15 this evolution of toc was similar in the three processes obtaining toc values close to 1 ppm within 10 min of treatment indicating that total mineralization is not taking place this is because the s atrazine ring is not destroyed in the degradation pathway of simazine by photo fenton processes and stable products such as cyanuric acid are formed 56 according to kavitha and palanivelu 57 this may be due to the formation of short chain by products such as carboxylic acids which halts the reduction in toc as a result of the production of organic and inorganic acids the ph decreased from neutral ph 7 to acidic ph 3 5 during irradiation experiment 13 beltran et al 58 reported an h2o2 uv kinetic degradation study obtaining complete degradation of the compound employing 136 mg l h2o2 and 5 mg l simazine their results established that the major contribution to the conversion pathway of the contaminant was due to the radical reaction 68 compared to the 32 contribution reported for direct photolysis 18 3 3 kinetics of simazine degradation comparing the kinetic models obtained for the degradation of simazine under sunlight and uv light the degradation rate of the compound is found to be directly related to time in both cases in the aops employing sunlight however the concentrations of iron and peroxide have a direct relationship with the removal of the compound these processes being favoured at acidic phs although both models have the same parameters the influence of each in the oxidation process is different depending on the light source employed in the process simazine degradation processes via the application of aops under sunlight and uv radiation follow first order kinetics eq 18 18 a a o e kt table 9 shows the kinetic constants sec 1 of simazine degradation by solar photolysis and the photo fenton process under sunlight at ph 3 and 6 in the solar photolysis processes employing 1 mg l and 10 mg l h2o2 the degradation rate of the compound was negligible around 6 and 10 respectively the value of their constant is hence assumed to be zero 0 the same occurs in the solar photo fenton process employing 0 5 ppm h2o2 and 2 ppm fe where the degradation rate obtained is only 4 18 in general aops under sunlight are found to be more efficient at ph acids the experimental condition of sunlight 5 ppm h2o2 2 ppm fe being faster with a constant rate of 0 003 s 1 table 9 according to the reaction rate followed by the photo fenton processes under sunlight i e solar radiation 0 5 ppm h2o2 0 2 ppm fe solar radiation 5 ppm h2o2 0 2 ppm fe solar radiation 5 ppm h2o2 2 ppm fe it follows that increasing the dosage of iron is more beneficial for the reaction than increasing the dosage of peroxide because it is the fe which provides speed to the reaction as a function of ph as evidenced by the coefficient of fe in the full factorial model applied table 7 furthermore table 10 shows the kinetic constants of simazine degradation by aops under uv radiation differences between the applied treatments are observed the decreasing order of efficiency of the degradation processes being as follows uv h2o2 uv h2o2 fe uv the fastest most efficient process is uv h2o2 ensuring degradation rates above 90 with a rate constant 0 02 s 1 compared to the experiments under sunlight a higher degradation rate and a higher reaction rate were generally obtained in the uv light experiments thus within 2 min of irradiation in the absence of h2o2 the degradation rate had already reached 83 with a k value of 0 011 s 1 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide a synergetic effect between uv light and hydrogen peroxide was observed the hydroxyl radicals generated during the photochemical reactions increasing substantially in this case more than 90 of the compound had been removed in the presence of 2 5 mg l h2o2 within the same reaction time in short when comparing the aops using sunlight and uv radiation the following increasing trend in the reaction rate is observed kphotolysis under sunlight kphoto fenton under sunlight kuv kphoto fenton under uv radiation kphotolysis under uv radiation 4 conclusions the d optimal model was used to evaluate the influence of hydrogen peroxide iron and light conditions on the degradation of simazine using advanced oxidation processes degradation levels are highly dependent on the operating conditions i e reagent dosage time and ph from the results obtained with the d optimal model 90 simazine degradation was established as a reference value to discard the effectiveness of the fenton process under the conditions studied in this paper and optimize the main operating variables the concentrations of iron and peroxide which can affect photolysis and photo fenton processes under sunlight and uv radiation two mathematical equations are proposed using the full factorial model for advanced oxidation processes under sunlight and uv light the effectiveness of the independent variables and their interactions in the removal of the pesticide were determined comparing the obtained kinetic models of simazine degradation under sunlight and uv light it is reported that in both cases the degradation rate of the compound is directly related to time however in the aop with sunlight the concentration of iron and peroxides is directly related to compound removal and these processes are beneficial at acidic ph although the two models have the same parameters the influence of each of them on the oxidation process is different depending on the light source used in the process the following increasing order of the degree of influence of the operating variables in the aops using sunlight is established h2o2 fe time while in the aops using uv radiation the increasing order of influence is fe h2o2 time furthermore high degradation rates were obtained but low rates of mineralization due to the formation of reaction intermediates having analysed the kinetic constants obtained from the aops studied in this paper it is concluded that the optimal process to use in the treatment of natural water would be uv h2o2 employing 2 5 ppm h2o2 in future lines of research once the optimal conditions are known the influence on the formation of reaction intermediates should be studied in order to achieve better mineralisation rates declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements

13467,co contamination of antibiotics and manganese mn2 prevailing in groundwater enhances the difficulties for water treatment in this study a manganese oxide mnox filter media which was developed for the removal of mn2 and ammonium by catalytic oxidation was adopted to simultaneously remove tetracycline tet and mn2 from groundwater the experimental results show that tet removal is the result of the synthesis of adsorption and oxidation and the presence of a certain concentration of mn2 1 and 5 mg l in the influent significantly reduces the tet removal capacity of the filter media similarly the presence of tet decreases the mn2 removal capacity the breakthrough curves could be fully described with the thomas model the surface characteristics and structures of the mnox filter samples were determined using scanning electron microscopy x ray diffraction and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy various analysis results reveal that the high valence manganese in the crystal lattice of mnox is consumed during tet removal which leads to lattice enlargement however during the simultaneous removal of mn2 and tet tet consumes high valence manganese produced by autocatalysis especially trivalent manganese the mechanism underlying the simultaneous removal of mn2 and tet by the mnox filter media is revealed in this study therefore this work provides guidance for the prevention and control of antibiotic contaminants during groundwater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mnox filter tetracycline removal mn2 removal adsorption catalytic oxidation 1 introduction manganese mn2 is a common inorganic pollutant in groundwater 1 2 it causes aesthetic and operational problems such as water discoloration laundry stains and pipe clogging as well as chronic poisoning and health problems in humans 3 4 in addition to many inorganic contaminants in water numerous new organic contaminants such as antibiotics have emerged in recent years 5 7 tetracycline tet one of the most abundant antibiotics in the environment 8 9 is persistent highly toxic and difficult to degrade 10 11 due to the low flow velocity and long renewal cycle of groundwater it is impossible to completely purify and remediate contaminated groundwater 12 after contaminated groundwater enters a drinking water treatment plant a traditional water purification process including coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection is generally used to effectively remove suspended solids colloidal substances and microorganisms but such processes are generally insufficient to remove organic contaminants and mn2 13 14 therefore it is important to develop an effective process for the removal of these environmental contaminants at present chemical oxidation and biological oxidation are the most widely used processes for removing mn2 from drinking water 15 16 during chemical oxidation the oxidative properties of the oxidant are utilized to oxidize low valence mn2 to insoluble manganese oxide mnox which is then removed by coagulation precipitation and filtration 17 however several problems associated with this method have been reported such as the high cost of treatment chemicals water discoloration due to excessive dosages or red discoloration of the effluent 15 18 biological oxidation is significantly affected by the water temperature and microbial activity and this method is less efficient at low temperatures 15 19 methods for removing tet from drinking water include adsorption 20 22 ion exchange 23 24 biofilm technology 19 25 advanced oxidation 26 28 and membrane separation 29 30 however most of these methods have limitations removal of tet using adsorption and ion exchange is generally time consuming and the treatment effect is not sustainable 21 31 the removal effect of biofilm technology is not sustainable and limited by the tet tolerance of microorganisms although advanced oxidation and membrane separation technologies can be used to effectively remove tet the former method generates byproducts that are harmful to human health 32 and the equipment and operating costs of the latter method are high current manganese and tet removal methods are cumbersome and mainly used to target single contaminants limiting their widespread use in groundwater treatment plants previously our group developed a type of mnox filter medium for removing conventional inorganic pollutants such as mn2 and ammonium from groundwater through catalytic oxidation 33 34 however the efficiency of this filter with respect to the removal of new organic contaminants remains unclear in this study we adopted mature mnox filter media that is media that were used and studied continuously for one year tet was selected as a typical trace organic contaminant of groundwater a continuous flow small scale filter system was used to investigate the efficiency of simultaneous tet and manganese removal by the mnox filter media as well as the interaction between the pollutants based on the microscopic characterization of the mnox filter media the reaction steps and removal mechanism are revealed in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of mnox filter media the mature mnox filter media used in this study were obtained from a pilot scale water treatment plant in shaanxi province china the active filter media were prepared with an oxidation reduction method potassium permanganate kmno4 and manganese chloride mncl2 solutions were separately pumped into a pilot scale filtration system filled with green quartz sand and mn2 was oxidized to manganese oxide because the solubility of mnox is relatively low mnox was transported to the filter by the raw water and then deposited on the surface of the quartz sand thus an active mnox filter film was formed by the continuous deposition of mnox during the start up period previous studies have demonstrated that this mnox filter media can continuously perform catalytic oxidation to remove manganese and ammonium the active filter was run continuously for one year samples of the active filter media were collected from the top of the filter bed density 2 7 g l d80 1 41 mm d10 0 76 mm coefficient of non uniformity k80 1 85 2 2 experimental setup a small scale filter system was built within a groundwater treatment plant in xi an city china the small scale filter system consisted of a pump filter column water in and outlet pipelines and water distribution bottle fig 1 a longer peristaltic pump was used the filter column consisted of a transparent plexiglass column with an inner diameter of 16 mm and height of 200 mm the mnox filter media were packed into this column up to a height of 100 mm and a resulting mass of 32 g the top and bottom of the filter column was supported by a 20 mm high layer of glass beads particle sizes of 3 4 mm both ends of the filter column were sealed with rubber plugs a water inlet and outlet were installed at the lower and upper ends respectively 2 3 experimental and analytical methods to determine the performance of the mnox filter media in the simultaneous removal tet and mn2 and the interaction between the pollutants two sets of experiments were carried out tet was purchased from macklin shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china while mncl2 was purchased from kermel tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd china raw groundwater was obtained from a water supply plant in xi an and used as the filter influent the physico chemical parameters of the raw groundwater used in the experiments are shown in table 1 the empty bed contact time was 8 min and the filtration rate of the column was 0 75 m h the first set of experiments during which three filter columns were run simultaneously was used to investigate the effect of mn2 on tet removal the tet concentration in the influent of each filter column was 5 mg l while the mn2 concentrations were 0 1 and 5 mg l respectively the experiment was stopped when the influent and effluent tet concentrations were the same hence the three filter columns were used to treat 110 110 and 40 l of water respectively in addition to investigate the effect of tet on mn2 removal two extra filter columns were utilized the influent tet concentration kept at 5 mg l and 110 and 40 l of water were treated at mn2 concentrations of 1 and 5 mg l respectively it should be noted that when the influent mn2 concentration was 5 mg l the influent and effluent tet concentration was completely the same when the filter column runs to 40 l so the operation was stopped in advance during the experiment in the small scale filter system the effluent samples collected from the filter column were filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane to determine the pollutant concentration a shimadzu toc lcpn total organic carbon toc analyzer was used to measure toc high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade methanol and acetic acid were provided by kermel tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd china the tet concentration was determined through high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 2000 series jasco tokyo japan the chromatographic separation was performed in a waters c18 column of 4 6 150 mm and 5 Î¼m particle diameter provided by agilent a methanol solution methanol ultrapure water 1 acetic acid 60 40 was utilized as the mobile phase the flow velocity sample volume detection wavelength and tet retention time were 1 ml min 100 Î¼l 280 nm and 6 min respectively the mn2 concentration was measured with potassium periodate spectrophotometry 2 4 characterization methods the following methods were used to periodically analyze the characteristics of the oxide film and to evaluate any changes in the morphology and structure of the mnox filter media during the operation of the filter column the microtopography of the mnox was measured using scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta 600f the microstructure crystal structure and crystallinity of the samples was analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd shimadzu 7000s l and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps k alpha x ray photoelectron spectrometer thermo electron corporation usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 manganese and tetracycline removal performance 3 1 1 effect of manganese on tetracycline removal the influence of three different influent mn2 concentrations 0 1 and 5 mg l on the tet 5 mg l removal efficiency of mnox filter media was investigated the results are shown in fig 2 at influent tet and mn2 concentrations of 5 mg l and 0 1 and 5 mg l respectively the tet removal ability q e of the mnox filter media was 10 95 6 21 and 0 29 mg g the equation used in this experiment to calculate the tet removal ability was as follows 1 re moval a bility q e c 0 c t v m where c 0 and c t are the concentration of tet in the influent and effluent mg l v is the volume of treated water l and m is the mass of the mnox filter media g clearly a higher mn2 concentration led to the mnox filter media having a worse tet removal ability fig 2a b and c a comparison of the changes in the tet removal rates with the amount of treated water depending on different influent mn2 concentrations shows that the tet removal rates varied significantly under different influent mn2 concentrations at high influent mn2 concentrations e g 5 mg l the tet removal rates decreased sharply and eventually reached zero fig 2d these results show that when tet coexists with mn2 the mn2 pollution significantly inhibits tet removal 3 1 2 effect of tetracycline on mn2 removal to explore the effect of tet on the removal of mn2 by mnox filter media the tet concentrations were maintained at 0 and 5 mg l respectively while the mn2 concentrations were set to 1 and 5 mg l respectively the experimental results are shown in fig 3 when the influent mn2 concentration was 1 mg l and the tet concentration was 0 the mn2 removal efficiency of the filter column remained above 80 throughout the experiment fig 3a however when the tet concentration was increased to 5 mg l the mn2 removal efficiency of the filter column gradually decreased to 20 fig 3b and e similarly when the influent contained only 5 mg l mn2 the removal efficiency of the filter column decreased from 90 to 70 fig 3c correspondingly the manganese removal efficiency decreased rapidly with a tet concentration of 5 mg l after treating 40 l of influent water the manganese removal capacity was totally lost fig 3d and f these results indicate that the presence of tet is not conducive to the removal of mn2 3 2 analysis of tetracycline breakthrough behavior the breakthrough curves of tet removal by the mnox filter media depending on the mn2 concentration are shown in fig 4 the breakthrough time decreases with increasing mn2 concentration implying competition between mn2 and tet the breakthrough curves predicted for the tet removal by the thomas model are shown in fig 4 in the curves c t c o was plotted versus c o t the thomas model can be expressed as follows 35 2 c t c 0 1 1 exp k th q 0 m q c 0 k th t 1000 where k th is the thomas rate constant l h mg and q 0 is the maximum uptake capacity mg g m is the mass of the mnox filter media g q is the volumetric flow rate l h and t is the running time h the model parameters k th and q 0 can be estimated via a nonlinear fit of the experimental breakthrough data the model constants k th and q 0 and correlation coefficients estimated with the thomas model are provided in table 2 increasing the mn2 concentration to 5 mg l led to an increase in k th and a decrease in q 0 the maximum removal capacity q e of the mnox filter media based on the experimental tet removal results is also presented in table 2 this value is similar to that predicted by the thomas model the correlation coefficients r2 0 85 indicate that the breakthrough curves can be fully described with the thomas model 3 3 sem analysis the build up and surface microtopography of the original filter sample as well as the filter samples obtained after mn2 5 mg l removal sample mn tet 5 mg l removal sample tet and simultaneous tet 5 mg l and mn2 5 mg l removal sample mn tet were analyzed using sem the results are shown in fig 5 images of the mnox filter sample show that the filter media consist of many small aggregates of particles and significantly different surface morphologies resulted from the different tet and mn2 concentrations fig 5 the surface morphologies of the original sample tet and sample mn particles exhibit relatively rough folds that can facilitate the contact and adsorption of contaminants these folds were formed during the removal of contaminants by mnox attaching to the surfaces of the filter media sample tet contains significantly smaller surface particles than sample mn and sample mn tet and is similar to the original sample most of the particles have a diameter of 3 5 Î¼m fig 5a and e this indicates that the removal of tet does not change the surface morphology of the sample by contrast the surface particles of sample mn tet and sample mn exhibited similar diameters 6 9 Î¼m which were obviously larger than that of the original sample this increase in surface particle size is mainly attributed to the removal of mn2 which generates mnox however the surface morphologies of sample mn tet and sample mn particles differ significantly from the surface particles of sample tet fig 5c and g as they are more spherical and smoother this indicates that the mechanism underlying the simultaneous removal of tet and mn2 differs from that associated with the removal of mn2 3 4 xrd analysis the phase and chemical composition are the main factors that influence the selective adsorption and oxidation properties of manganese oxides on tet the crystalline phases and crystallinity of the mnox filter media samples were determined using xrd patterns the xrd pattern of the original sample fig 6 is consistent with that obtained in our previous study 34 36 it contains three peaks at d spacings of 9 80 Ã¥ 9 0 4 87 Ã¥ 18 2 and 3 26 Ã¥ 27 4 in the range of 5 35 the crystalline phase of manganese oxides were identified as tunnel structures 37 39 in contrast to the other three samples the peaks of sample tet are shifted to lower angles which can be attributed to lattice enlargement of the material 40 based on the literature 40 the radii of the mn4 mn3 and mn2 cations are 0 053 0 065 and 0 083 nm respectively therefore the mnox lattice expands during the reduction from mn4 mn3 to mn3 mn2 the above results indicate that tet removal consumes the high valence manganese mn3 and mn4 present in the crystal lattice of mnox however the xrd peaks of sample mn tet did not shift this is likely due to the tendency of tet to react preferentially with mnox generated by the autocatalytic action of mn2 in aqueous solutions 36 which prevents the consumption of high valence manganese in the crystal lattice 3 5 surface characterization using xps spectra fig 7 shows the mn 2p3 2 peaks at 642 2 ev for sample mn sample tet and sample mn tet the broad mn 2p3 2 peak was fitted using three peaks that is 640 2 640 6 642 0 642 1 and 643 4 643 5 ev corresponding to mn2 mn3 and mn4 respectively 34 41 42 the mn2 mn3 and mn4 concentrations of the three samples are summarized in table 3 a comparison of sample mn and sample mn tet shows that the consumption of mn3 and mn4 and the increase in mn2 concentration in sample mn tet are significant this indicates that tet removal consumes mn3 and mn4 a comparison between sample mn tet and sample tet revealed that the addition of mn2 to the solution reduced the mn3 content and increased the mn2 content on the surface of the filter media the mn2 that was removed by the filter media was converted into mn3 and mn4 by autocatalysis and mn2 was not generated as shown in sample mn this confirms that the addition of mn2 changes the tet removal pathway which is consistent with the xrd results the tet consumes mn3 and mn4 generated by mn2 oxidation via an auto catalysis reaction especially mn3 at the same tet concentration more mn2 is accumulated by mn3 oxidation than by mn4 oxidation 3 6 mechanism of simultaneous tetracycline and manganese removal from groundwater with a mnox filter to further investigate the mechanism by which tet is removed by the manganese oxide filters the variation of the influent and effluent toc concentration and toc removal efficiency were measured during tet removal the results are shown in fig 8 the toc removal efficiency was noted to be 40 to 65 for the first 10 l of influent this was attributed to the important effect of the mnox filter media on tet adsorption in the initial experiment subsequently as the surface of the activated filter media became saturated through adsorption the toc removal efficiency decreased sharply with further increases in the treatment volume and the removal efficiency decreased from 65 to 0 however as shown in fig 2a and d for the first 90 l tet removal was maintained at a certain removal capacity 40 consequently it can be inferred that the oxidation process also occurred during tet removal by the mnox filter media and this process was the synthesis function of adsorption and oxidation moreover based on the above mentioned experimental mn2 and tet removal efficiencies obtained with mnox filter media tet and mn2 pollution are mutually inhibited indicating that the two types of pollutants compete with each other for active sites on the surfaces of active filter media in addition the morphological changes associated with simultaneous tet and mn2 removal were significant compared with individual mn2 or tet removal tet removal caused a shift in the xrd peaks to lower angles results of previous studies have shown that the removal of mn2 from a solution is based on the autocatalytic oxidation reaction eq 3 of mnox to mn3 and mn4 34 43 as shown in fig 9a the results of this study show that tet removal leads to a shift in the xrd peaks of mnox to lower angles which is due to lattice enlargement of the material based on the transformation of mn4 mn3 to mn3 mn2 therefore it can be inferred that tet consumes high valence manganese in the crystal lattice fig 9b which results in lattice enlargement as shown in eq 4 this could be confirmed by the results of xps analyses which indicated that tet removal consumes mn3 and mn4 in mnox 3 m n 2 o 2 selfcatalysis me o x me o x m n 3 4 o x 4 me m n 3 4 o x tet me m n 2 3 4 o x product tet however it should be noted that the xrd peaks of sample mn tet did not shift implying a lack of high valence manganese in the crystal lattice hence it can be concluded that the oxidation of mn2 in solution to form high valence manganese through autocatalysis prevents the consumption of high valence manganese in the crystal lattice during the simultaneous removal of tet and mn2 in

to successfully remediate mn2 and tet contamination was established the following conclusions can be drawn mnox filter media which are used for the removal of manganese by catalytic oxidation can also be applied as effective tools for the removal of tet at low concentrations the pollutants compete for active sites on the mnox filter media during the manganese and tet removal the presence of manganese in the influent decreases the tet removal capacity of the mnox filter media while the presence of tet in the influent inhibits manganese removal sem and xrd results indicate that the simultaneous removal of tet and mn2 by the mnox filter media leads to changes in the surface morphology and lattice enlargement which might be due to the accumulation of solid mn2 on the surfaces of the filter media xps results imply that mn3 and mn4 on the surfaces of the mnox filter media are consumed during tet removal on one hand if mn2 is present in the influent mn2 on the surfaces of the filter media is oxidized to mn3 and mn4 via autocatalysis on the other hand tet consumes the mn3 and mn4 generated by autocatalytic oxidation during the removal process declaration of competing

13467,co contamination of antibiotics and manganese mn2 prevailing in groundwater enhances the difficulties for water treatment in this study a manganese oxide mnox filter media which was developed for the removal of mn2 and ammonium by catalytic oxidation was adopted to simultaneously remove tetracycline tet and mn2 from groundwater the experimental results show that tet removal is the result of the synthesis of adsorption and oxidation and the presence of a certain concentration of mn2 1 and 5 mg l in the influent significantly reduces the tet removal capacity of the filter media similarly the presence of tet decreases the mn2 removal capacity the breakthrough curves could be fully described with the thomas model the surface characteristics and structures of the mnox filter samples were determined using scanning electron microscopy x ray diffraction and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy various analysis results reveal that the high valence manganese in the crystal lattice of mnox is consumed during tet removal which leads to lattice enlargement however during the simultaneous removal of mn2 and tet tet consumes high valence manganese produced by autocatalysis especially trivalent manganese the mechanism underlying the simultaneous removal of mn2 and tet by the mnox filter media is revealed in this study therefore this work provides guidance for the prevention and control of antibiotic contaminants during groundwater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mnox filter tetracycline removal mn2 removal adsorption catalytic oxidation 1 introduction manganese mn2 is a common inorganic pollutant in groundwater 1 2 it causes aesthetic and operational problems such as water discoloration laundry stains and pipe clogging as well as chronic poisoning and health problems in humans 3 4 in addition to many inorganic contaminants in water numerous new organic contaminants such as antibiotics have emerged in recent years 5 7 tetracycline tet one of the most abundant antibiotics in the environment 8 9 is persistent highly toxic and difficult to degrade 10 11 due to the low flow velocity and long renewal cycle of groundwater it is impossible to completely purify and remediate contaminated groundwater 12 after contaminated groundwater enters a drinking water treatment plant a traditional water purification process including coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection is generally used to effectively remove suspended solids colloidal substances and microorganisms but such processes are generally insufficient to remove organic contaminants and mn2 13 14 therefore it is important to develop an effective process for the removal of these environmental contaminants at present chemical oxidation and biological oxidation are the most widely used processes for removing mn2 from drinking water 15 16 during chemical oxidation the oxidative properties of the oxidant are utilized to oxidize low valence mn2 to insoluble manganese oxide mnox which is then removed by coagulation precipitation and filtration 17 however several problems associated with this method have been reported such as the high cost of treatment chemicals water discoloration due to excessive dosages or red discoloration of the effluent 15 18 biological oxidation is significantly affected by the water temperature and microbial activity and this method is less efficient at low temperatures 15 19 methods for removing tet from drinking water include adsorption 20 22 ion exchange 23 24 biofilm technology 19 25 advanced oxidation 26 28 and membrane separation 29 30 however most of these methods have limitations removal of tet using adsorption and ion exchange is generally time consuming and the treatment effect is not sustainable 21 31 the removal effect of biofilm technology is not sustainable and limited by the tet tolerance of microorganisms although advanced oxidation and membrane separation technologies can be used to effectively remove tet the former method generates byproducts that are harmful to human health 32 and the equipment and operating costs of the latter method are high current manganese and tet removal methods are cumbersome and mainly used to target single contaminants limiting their widespread use in groundwater treatment plants previously our group developed a type of mnox filter medium for removing conventional inorganic pollutants such as mn2 and ammonium from groundwater through catalytic oxidation 33 34 however the efficiency of this filter with respect to the removal of new organic contaminants remains unclear in this study we adopted mature mnox filter media that is media that were used and studied continuously for one year tet was selected as a typical trace organic contaminant of groundwater a continuous flow small scale filter system was used to investigate the efficiency of simultaneous tet and manganese removal by the mnox filter media as well as the interaction between the pollutants based on the microscopic characterization of the mnox filter media the reaction steps and removal mechanism are revealed in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of mnox filter media the mature mnox filter media used in this study were obtained from a pilot scale water treatment plant in shaanxi province china the active filter media were prepared with an oxidation reduction method potassium permanganate kmno4 and manganese chloride mncl2 solutions were separately pumped into a pilot scale filtration system filled with green quartz sand and mn2 was oxidized to manganese oxide because the solubility of mnox is relatively low mnox was transported to the filter by the raw water and then deposited on the surface of the quartz sand thus an active mnox filter film was formed by the continuous deposition of mnox during the start up period previous studies have demonstrated that this mnox filter media can continuously perform catalytic oxidation to remove manganese and ammonium the active filter was run continuously for one year samples of the active filter media were collected from the top of the filter bed density 2 7 g l d80 1 41 mm d10 0 76 mm coefficient of non uniformity k80 1 85 2 2 experimental setup a small scale filter system was built within a groundwater treatment plant in xi an city china the small scale filter system consisted of a pump filter column water in and outlet pipelines and water distribution bottle fig 1 a longer peristaltic pump was used the filter column consisted of a transparent plexiglass column with an inner diameter of 16 mm and height of 200 mm the mnox filter media were packed into this column up to a height of 100 mm and a resulting mass of 32 g the top and bottom of the filter column was supported by a 20 mm high layer of glass beads particle sizes of 3 4 mm both ends of the filter column were sealed with rubber plugs a water inlet and outlet were installed at the lower and upper ends respectively 2 3 experimental and analytical methods to determine the performance of the mnox filter media in the simultaneous removal tet and mn2 and the interaction between the pollutants two sets of experiments were carried out tet was purchased from macklin shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china while mncl2 was purchased from kermel tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd china raw groundwater was obtained from a water supply plant in xi an and used as the filter influent the physico chemical parameters of the raw groundwater used in the experiments are shown in table 1 the empty bed contact time was 8 min and the filtration rate of the column was 0 75 m h the first set of experiments during which three filter columns were run simultaneously was used to investigate the effect of mn2 on tet removal the tet concentration in the influent of each filter column was 5 mg l while the mn2 concentrations were 0 1 and 5 mg l respectively the experiment was stopped when the influent and effluent tet concentrations were the same hence the three filter columns were used to treat 110 110 and 40 l of water respectively in addition to investigate the effect of tet on mn2 removal two extra filter columns were utilized the influent tet concentration kept at 5 mg l and 110 and 40 l of water were treated at mn2 concentrations of 1 and 5 mg l respectively it should be noted that when the influent mn2 concentration was 5 mg l the influent and effluent tet concentration was completely the same when the filter column runs to 40 l so the operation was stopped in advance during the experiment in the small scale filter system the effluent samples collected from the filter column were filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane to determine the pollutant concentration a shimadzu toc lcpn total organic carbon toc analyzer was used to measure toc high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade methanol and acetic acid were provided by kermel tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd china the tet concentration was determined through high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 2000 series jasco tokyo japan the chromatographic separation was performed in a waters c18 column of 4 6 150 mm and 5 Î¼m particle diameter provided by agilent a methanol solution methanol ultrapure water 1 acetic acid 60 40 was utilized as the mobile phase the flow velocity sample volume detection wavelength and tet retention time were 1 ml min 100 Î¼l 280 nm and 6 min respectively the mn2 concentration was measured with potassium periodate spectrophotometry 2 4 characterization methods the following methods were used to periodically analyze the characteristics of the oxide film and to evaluate any changes in the morphology and structure of the mnox filter media during the operation of the filter column the microtopography of the mnox was measured using scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta 600f the microstructure crystal structure and crystallinity of the samples was analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd shimadzu 7000s l and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps k alpha x ray photoelectron spectrometer thermo electron corporation usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 manganese and tetracycline removal performance 3 1 1 effect of manganese on tetracycline removal the influence of three different influent mn2 concentrations 0 1 and 5 mg l on the tet 5 mg l removal efficiency of mnox filter media was investigated the results are shown in fig 2 at influent tet and mn2 concentrations of 5 mg l and 0 1 and 5 mg l respectively the tet removal ability q e of the mnox filter media was 10 95 6 21 and 0 29 mg g the equation used in this experiment to calculate the tet removal ability was as follows 1 re moval a bility q e c 0 c t v m where c 0 and c t are the concentration of tet in the influent and effluent mg l v is the volume of treated water l and m is the mass of the mnox filter media g clearly a higher mn2 concentration led to the mnox filter media having a worse tet removal ability fig 2a b and c a comparison of the changes in the tet removal rates with the amount of treated water depending on different influent mn2 concentrations shows that the tet removal rates varied significantly under different influent mn2 concentrations at high influent mn2 concentrations e g 5 mg l the tet removal rates decreased sharply and eventually reached zero fig 2d these results show that when tet coexists with mn2 the mn2 pollution significantly inhibits tet removal 3 1 2 effect of tetracycline on mn2 removal to explore the effect of tet on the removal of mn2 by mnox filter media the tet concentrations were maintained at 0 and 5 mg l respectively while the mn2 concentrations were set to 1 and 5 mg l respectively the experimental results are shown in fig 3 when the influent mn2 concentration was 1 mg l and the tet concentration was 0 the mn2 removal efficiency of the filter column remained above 80 throughout the experiment fig 3a however when the tet concentration was increased to 5 mg l the mn2 removal efficiency of the filter column gradually decreased to 20 fig 3b and e similarly when the influent contained only 5 mg l mn2 the removal efficiency of the filter column decreased from 90 to 70 fig 3c correspondingly the manganese removal efficiency decreased rapidly with a tet concentration of 5 mg l after treating 40 l of influent water the manganese removal capacity was totally lost fig 3d and f these results indicate that the presence of tet is not conducive to the removal of mn2 3 2 analysis of tetracycline breakthrough behavior the breakthrough curves of tet removal by the mnox filter media depending on the mn2 concentration are shown in fig 4 the breakthrough time decreases with increasing mn2 concentration implying competition between mn2 and tet the breakthrough curves predicted for the tet removal by the thomas model are shown in fig 4 in the curves c t c o was plotted versus c o t the thomas model can be expressed as follows 35 2 c t c 0 1 1 exp k th q 0 m q c 0 k th t 1000 where k th is the thomas rate constant l h mg and q 0 is the maximum uptake capacity mg g m is the mass of the mnox filter media g q is the volumetric flow rate l h and t is the running time h the model parameters k th and q 0 can be estimated via a nonlinear fit of the experimental breakthrough data the model constants k th and q 0 and correlation coefficients estimated with the thomas model are provided in table 2 increasing the mn2 concentration to 5 mg l led to an increase in k th and a decrease in q 0 the maximum removal capacity q e of the mnox filter media based on the experimental tet removal results is also presented in table 2 this value is similar to that predicted by the thomas model the correlation coefficients r2 0 85 indicate that the breakthrough curves can be fully described with the thomas model 3 3 sem analysis the build up and surface microtopography of the original filter sample as well as the filter samples obtained after mn2 5 mg l removal sample mn tet 5 mg l removal sample tet and simultaneous tet 5 mg l and mn2 5 mg l removal sample mn tet were analyzed using sem the results are shown in fig 5 images of the mnox filter sample show that the filter media consist of many small aggregates of particles and significantly different surface morphologies resulted from the different tet and mn2 concentrations fig 5 the surface morphologies of the original sample tet and sample mn particles exhibit relatively rough folds that can facilitate the contact and adsorption of contaminants these folds were formed during the removal of contaminants by mnox attaching to the surfaces of the filter media sample tet contains significantly smaller surface particles than sample mn and sample mn tet and is similar to the original sample most of the particles have a diameter of 3 5 Î¼m fig 5a and e this indicates that the removal of tet does not change the surface morphology of the sample by contrast the surface particles of sample mn tet and sample mn exhibited similar diameters 6 9 Î¼m which were obviously larger than that of the original sample this increase in surface particle size is mainly attributed to the removal of mn2 which generates mnox however the surface morphologies of sample mn tet and sample mn particles differ significantly from the surface particles of sample tet fig 5c and g as they are more spherical and smoother this indicates that the mechanism underlying the simultaneous removal of tet and mn2 differs from that associated with the removal of mn2 3 4 xrd analysis the phase and chemical composition are the main factors that influence the selective adsorption and oxidation properties of manganese oxides on tet the crystalline phases and crystallinity of the mnox filter media samples were determined using xrd patterns the xrd pattern of the original sample fig 6 is consistent with that obtained in our previous study 34 36 it contains three peaks at d spacings of 9 80 Ã¥ 9 0 4 87 Ã¥ 18 2 and 3 26 Ã¥ 27 4 in the range of 5 35 the crystalline phase of manganese oxides were identified as tunnel structures 37 39 in contrast to the other three samples the peaks of sample tet are shifted to lower angles which can be attributed to lattice enlargement of the material 40 based on the literature 40 the radii of the mn4 mn3 and mn2 cations are 0 053 0 065 and 0 083 nm respectively therefore the mnox lattice expands during the reduction from mn4 mn3 to mn3 mn2 the above results indicate that tet removal consumes the high valence manganese mn3 and mn4 present in the crystal lattice of mnox however the xrd peaks of sample mn tet did not shift this is likely due to the tendency of tet to react preferentially with mnox generated by the autocatalytic action of mn2 in aqueous solutions 36 which prevents the consumption of high valence manganese in the crystal lattice 3 5 surface characterization using xps spectra fig 7 shows the mn 2p3 2 peaks at 642 2 ev for sample mn sample tet and sample mn tet the broad mn 2p3 2 peak was fitted using three peaks that is 640 2 640 6 642 0 642 1 and 643 4 643 5 ev corresponding to mn2 mn3 and mn4 respectively 34 41 42 the mn2 mn3 and mn4 concentrations of the three samples are summarized in table 3 a comparison of sample mn and sample mn tet shows that the consumption of mn3 and mn4 and the increase in mn2 concentration in sample mn tet are significant this indicates that tet removal consumes mn3 and mn4 a comparison between sample mn tet and sample tet revealed that the addition of mn2 to the solution reduced the mn3 content and increased the mn2 content on the surface of the filter media the mn2 that was removed by the filter media was converted into mn3 and mn4 by autocatalysis and mn2 was not generated as shown in sample mn this confirms that the addition of mn2 changes the tet removal pathway which is consistent with the xrd results the tet consumes mn3 and mn4 generated by mn2 oxidation via an auto catalysis reaction especially mn3 at the same tet concentration more mn2 is accumulated by mn3 oxidation than by mn4 oxidation 3 6 mechanism of simultaneous tetracycline and manganese removal from groundwater with a mnox filter to further investigate the mechanism by which tet is removed by the manganese oxide filters the variation of the influent and effluent toc concentration and toc removal efficiency were measured during tet removal the results are shown in fig 8 the toc removal efficiency was noted to be 40 to 65 for the first 10 l of influent this was attributed to the important effect of the mnox filter media on tet adsorption in the initial experiment subsequently as the surface of the activated filter media became saturated through adsorption the toc removal efficiency decreased sharply with further increases in the treatment volume and the removal efficiency decreased from 65 to 0 however as shown in fig 2a and d for the first 90 l tet removal was maintained at a certain removal capacity 40 consequently it can be inferred that the oxidation process also occurred during tet removal by the mnox filter media and this process was the synthesis function of adsorption and oxidation moreover based on the above mentioned experimental mn2 and tet removal efficiencies obtained with mnox filter media tet and mn2 pollution are mutually inhibited indicating that the two types of pollutants compete with each other for active sites on the surfaces of active filter media in addition the morphological changes associated with simultaneous tet and mn2 removal were significant compared with individual mn2 or tet removal tet removal caused a shift in the xrd peaks to lower angles results of previous studies have shown that the removal of mn2 from a solution is based on the autocatalytic oxidation reaction eq 3 of mnox to mn3 and mn4 34 43 as shown in fig 9a the results of this study show that tet removal leads to a shift in the xrd peaks of mnox to lower angles which is due to lattice enlargement of the material based on the transformation of mn4 mn3 to mn3 mn2 therefore it can be inferred that tet consumes high valence manganese in the crystal lattice fig 9b which results in lattice enlargement as shown in eq 4 this could be confirmed by the results of xps analyses which indicated that tet removal consumes mn3 and mn4 in mnox 3 m n 2 o 2 selfcatalysis me o x me o x m n 3 4 o x 4 me m n 3 4 o x tet me m n 2 3 4 o x product tet however it should be noted that the xrd peaks of sample mn tet did not shift implying a lack of high valence manganese in the crystal lattice hence it can be concluded that the oxidation of mn2 in solution to form high valence manganese through autocatalysis prevents the consumption of high valence manganese in the crystal lattice during the simultaneous removal of tet and mn2 in other words except for during adsorption tet consumes high valence manganese produced by autocatalysis especially trivalent manganese but not the high valence manganese in the crystal lattice as shown in eq 5 and fig 9c 5 m n 2 o 2 selfcatalysis me o x me o x m n 3 4 o x tet me o x m n 2 3 4 o x product tet 4 conclusions in this work the application of mnox filter media was extended and a strategy to successfully remediate mn2 and tet contamination was established the following conclusions can be drawn mnox filter media which are used for the removal of manganese by catalytic oxidation can also be applied as effective tools for the removal of tet at low concentrations the pollutants compete for active sites on the mnox filter media during the manganese and tet removal the presence of manganese in the influent decreases the tet removal capacity of the mnox filter media while the presence of tet in the influent inhibits manganese removal sem and xrd results indicate that the simultaneous removal of tet and mn2 by the mnox filter media leads to changes in the surface morphology and lattice enlargement which might be due to the accumulation of solid mn2 on the surfaces of the filter media xps results imply that mn3 and mn4 on the surfaces of the mnox filter media are consumed during tet removal on one hand if mn2 is present in the influent mn2 on the surfaces of the filter media is oxidized to mn3 and mn4 via autocatalysis on the other hand tet consumes the mn3 and mn4 generated by autocatalytic oxidation during the removal process declaration of competing

13468,in this study a water disinfection flow reactor with a spiral channel configuration was developed to treat drinking water by using 278 nm ultraviolet uv c light emitting diodes the effects of the flow rate spiral pitch and radiative power were investigated to improve the efficiency of sterilizing escherichia coli the spiral channel configuration was used to induce dean vortices and increase the microbial exposure time the results of this study indicated that at all the examined flow rates the flow reactor with a spiral pitch of 10 mm achieved the highest log inactivation among three reactors with different pitches the shorter the spiral pitch the higher was the dean number and longer was the exposure time in the flow channel increasing the flow rate not only enhanced dean effect but also reduced the microbial exposure time moreover the exposure time and dean number exhibited opposite trends under a varying flow rate the optimal log inactivation was achieved at a flow rate of 60 ml min and a droop was observed in the fluence response curve when the flow rate was less than 60 ml min due to a decrease of dean effect in the flow reactor under the same uv fluence the shorter the spiral pitch the higher was the sterilization efficiency of the flow reactor graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords uv c led spiral channel water disinfection escherichia coli 1

reactors can be classified into two major types batch 10 12 and flow through 13 16 reactors according to the literature the sterilization efficiency of a flow through reactor is less than that of a batch rector because of the complex fluid flow mechanisms in a flow through reactor sozzi and taghipour 17 applied lagrangian and eulerian models to simulate the reactor performance by using computational fluid dynamics where the fluid dynamics inside the flow through reactor exhibited a significant influence on water disinfection uv mercury lamps are traditional uv light sources used in water disinfection systems sultan 18 compared the differences between parallel and staggered configurations of mercury lamps for water disinfection their results indicated that the lamp configuration substantially affects the performance of an open channel reactor and that the effect of wall roughness on the reactor performance is dependent on the reynolds number xu et al 19 20 and li et al 21 investigated the effects of the reactor shape lamp arrangement flow rate and power on the reactor performance for water treatment the complex interactions among these design parameters affected the uv fluence and microbial exposure time sultan et al 22 determined that the asymmetric lamp configuration was efficient for an uv reactor because of the high uv fluence received by pathogens under this configuration the fluid flow inside a reactor plays a crucial role in inactivating the microorganisms present in water ujhidy et al 23 investigated the fluid flow in a helical tube helical elements

sterilizing pathogenic microbes and bacteriophage uv c light emitting diodes leds have become commercially available for water treatment due to a significant increase in their radiative efficiency a uv led also exhibits several advantages over a mercury lamp such as being mercury free and having a tunable wavelength long lifetime and flexible design 27 oguma et al 28 applied 265 280 and 310 nm uv leds in batch and flow through reactors the 280 nm led exhibited the highest time based efficiency for e coli and 4 0 log inactivation was achieved at a fluence of 13 8 mj cm2 furthermore the flow through reactor exhibited the tailing effect and an efficiency lower than that of the batch reactor cai and hu 29 developed a uv photoreactor to remove methoxazole and trimethoprim from treated wastewater li et al 30 used single and combined wavelengths of uv leds to inactivate e coli in water their results indicated that a 280 nm led is a suitable for inactivating and reactivating e coli due to its high output power according to the literature a 280 nm uv led can efficiently inactivate different microorganisms 31 32 literature on applying uv c leds to water disinfection in a flow reactor is limited the present study is to develop a flow reactor that combines uv c leds and a spiral channel configuration for water disinfection the flow reactor is efficient and can provide safe drinking water a spiral channel was used to increase microbial exposure time and induce dean vortices in the flow reactor three spiral channel configurations with different spiral pitches were fabricated to analyze the effect of dean flow on water sterilization efficiency the flow rate radiative power and spiral pitch were analyzed to improve the efficiency of sterilizing e coli a theoretical simulation and an experiment were performed to gain insights into the design of a flow reactor with a spiral channel and uv c leds 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment for water disinfection fig 1 illustrates the experiment conducted for water disinfection by using a uv c led module an agilent e3632a power supply and a gw instek gpe1326 power supply were used as the power sources for the uv module and water pump respectively a flow meter was used to control the flow rate of water between 40 and 120 ml min e coli ifo 3301 was used as the microorganism in water the bacteria were incubated in an incubator containing 100 ml nzcym broth at 37 c for 12 h and then resuspended to obtain an e coli concentration of 107 cfu ml the cell concentration was determined using a photometer m6 metertech inc to determine the population density the spread plate technique was applied to both irradiated and nonirradiated samples with a volume of 100 Î¼l the samples were then incubated for 24 h at 37 c the plate counts of 10 300 colonies were considered in the experiment the log inactivation was defined as the product of rate constant k and uv dose 30 1 log n 0 n k uv dose in which n and n 0 represented the number of colonies in the unirradiated and irradiated samples respectively 2 2 design of the flow reactor the uv c module comprised 24 leds to achieve uniform irradiance distribution inside the flow reactor irradiance distribution in the reactor was significantly affected by the radiation pattern and led arrangement the influence of irradiance distribution on water disinfection was shown in our previous work 16 the results showed that the uv module offered the highest inactivation efficiency due to a significant improvement in irradiance uniformity the leds were manufactured by lg innotek and each led had a radiative power of 10 mw at a rated current of 100 ma the leds were attached on an aluminum rod by using solder paste to provide sufficient heat dissipation the aluminum rod was 12 cm long and had six leds on each side with a constant interval of 16 mm as displayed in fig 2 a quartz glass tube was used to seal the spiral channel and facilitate uv light transmittance the flow reactor was developed using a three dimensional printer with a semispherical spiral channel configuration the diameter of the spiral channel was 7 mm flow reactors with three spiral pitches 10 20 and 30 mm were analyzed in the experiment as illustrated in fig 3 a c to evaluate the improvement obtained in the reactor performance by using the spiral channel configuration the results obtained for this configuration were compared with those obtained for a traditional flow through reactor as depicted in fig 3 d 2 3 fluid dynamics inside the reactor the fluid motion inside the flow reactor significantly influences the uv fluence received by the microorganisms the microbial exposure time was determined by dividing the average water velocity in the channel by the distance between the inlet and the outlet in this study the average velocity was defined as the average speed of 10 000 pathlines inside the reactor the purpose is to simulate bacterial movement in the reactor a spiral channel was used to induce dean vortices in the reactor the commercial software ansys was used to analyze the fluid motion in the spiral channel by using a realizable k Îµ model 33 the conservation equations of mass and momentum can be expressed as follows 2 Ï t Ï v 0 3 Ï v t Ï v v p Ï Ïg f where Ï v p f and Ï represent density velocity pressure turbulent dispersion force and the stress tensor respectively studies have indicated that dean vortices can efficiently enhance the mixing of fluid particles the dean number was used to analyze the magnitude of secondary flow in the spiral channel 34 4 d e r e r x Ï 0 5 where r e and Ï indicate the reynolds number and radius of curvature respectively an increase in the dean number effectively enhanced the mixing of fluid particles in the adopted aqueous solution increasing the reynolds number not only helped increase the dean vortices but also reduced the microbial exposure time 3 results and discussion the flow rate and spiral pitch are key design parameters that affect the reactor performance for water disinfection fig 4 illustrates the log inactivation at different flow rates for the three spiral pitches in the experiment the flow rate was varied between 40 and 120 ml min the minimum spiral pitch of the developed flow reactor was 10 mm as illustrated in fig 4 the log inactivation increased as the flow rate was increased from 40 to 60 ml min for the three spiral channel configurations an optimal log inactivation was achieved at a flow rate of 60 ml min the reactor had optimal inactivation values of 5 1 4 5 and 3 4 log at spiral pitches of 10 20 and 30 mm respectively when the flow rate exceeded 60 ml min the log inactivation decreased approximately linearly with the flow rate for the three reactors the experiment was repeated three times and the maximum deviation was 6 furthermore at all flow rates the log inactivation increased as the spiral pitch was decreased from 30 to 10 mm the flow reactor with a pitch of 10 mm exhibited the highest performance among the three flow reactors with different spiral pitches the flow reactor achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log at all flow rates at a spiral pitch of 10 mm the shorter the spiral pitch the higher was the exposure time for the microorganisms inside the flow reactor the aforementioned results obtained for the spiral channel reactor were compared with the results obtained using a traditional flow through reactor the log inactivation decreased when the flow rate was increased from 40 to 120 ml min for the flow through reactor at a flow rate of 40 ml min the log inactivation of the flow through reactor was similar to that of the reactor with a spiral pitch of 10 mm but higher than those of the reactors with spiral pitches of 20 and 30 mm this result is attributed to the microbial exposure time inside the reactors as displayed in fig 5 at all flow rates the flow through reactor had a longer exposure time than did the reactors with spiral pitches of 20 and 30 mm when the flow rate exceeded 60 ml min the flow through reactor exhibited the lowest efficiency in water disinfection due to the lack of mixing effect of fluid particles inside the flow channel a numerical analysis was conducted to investigate how spiral pitch affected the fluid motion inside the reactor fig 6 displays the correlations between the magnitude of secondary flow in the coiled tube d e and the flow rate under the three spiral pitches the aforementioned dean flow enhances the mixing of fluid particles 35 as illustrated in fig 6 d e increased linearly with the flow rate under the three pitches the shorter the spiral pitch the higher was the value of d e in the flow channel this result is attributed to the increase in the reynolds number among the three reactors with different spiral pitches the reactor with a spiral pitch of 10 mm had the highest de value at all flow rates the results indicated that de increased from 10 9 to 32 6 when the flow rate was increased from 40 to 120 ml min increasing the flow rate not only aided in improving the mixing of fluid particles but also decreased the microbial exposure time in the reactor fig 7 a presents the top view of the velocity field in the flow reactor at a pitch of 10 mm under a flow rate of 40 ml min to present the magnitudes of dean vortices in the spiral channel fig 7 b d illustrates the cross sectional views of the velocity field at various flow rates the results indicate that the use of the spiral channel induced dean vortices at a flow rate of 40 ml min fig 7 b furthermore the magnitude of the dean vortices in the spiral channel increased with the flow rate as displayed in fig 7 c and d increasing the microbial exposure time and dean vortices simultaneously is crucial for increasing the efficiency in sterilizaing e coli in the water disinfection reactor fig 8 a c illustrates the correlations among the exposure time dean number and flow rate under the three spiral pitches as illustrated in fig 8 a the micorbial exposure time decreased significantly from 28 0 to 9 3 s as the flow rate was increased from 40 to 120 ml min at a spiral pitch of 10 mm the decrease in exposure time reduced the uv fluence received by the microorganisms and thus the log inactivation of e coli in contrast to the exposure time the de value increased linearly from 10 9 to 32 6 when the flow rate increased from 40 to 120 ml min fig 8 b and c exhibits similar trends at spiral pitches of 20 and 30 mm respectively the exposure time and dean number decreased evidently with an increase in the spiral pitch the results indicated that the exposure time and dean number had optimal values at a flow rate between 60 and 70 ml min the aforementioned findings can explain why an optimal log inactivation was observed at a flow rate of 60 ml min when the flow rate was increased from 40 to 60 ml min the log inactivation increased due to the increase in dean flow in addition when the flow rate exceeded 60 ml min the log inactivation decreased due to the decrease in the exposure time fig 9 presents the log inactivation at various radiative powers in the experiment the reactors had a spiral pitch of 10 mm the radiative power was varied between 6 and 10 mw for each uv c led the results indicated that the log inactivation exhibited similar trends with the flow rate when the radiative power of the led was varied from 6 to 10 mw the highest inactivation efficiencies of 5 1 4 6 and 4 2 log were obtained with radiative powers of 10 8 and 6 mw respectively at 10 mw the reactor achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log at all flow rates when the radiative power was decreased to 6 mw the reactor achieved 4 0 log only at a flow rate of 60 ml min furthermore the log inactivation increased approximated linearly with the radiative power at all flow rates fig 10 displays the fluence response curve of the flow reactor for three radiative powers the fluence received by the microorganisms is defined as the product of the average irradiance and exposure time the average irradiance is defined as the average of the irradiance at the outer wall of the quartz glass tube in addition different fluences were obtained by adjusting the flow rate between 40 and 120 ml min a decrease in the flow rate resulted in an increase in the uv fluence received by the microorganisms due to an increase in the exposure time at a radiative power of 10 mw the fluence increased from 27 4 to 54 7 mj cm2 when the flow rate was decreased from 120 to 60 ml min as displayed in fig 10 the log inactivation exhibited similar trends with the uv fluence at different radiative powers when the flow rate was decreased from 120 to 60 ml min the log inactivation increased approximately linearly with the fluence and achieved an optimal value at a flow rate of 60 ml min under the three radiative powers the flow reactor achieved the highest log inactivation at fluences of 54 7 43 8 and 32 8 mj cm2 when applying radiative powers of 10 8 and 6 mw respectively the optimal reactor performance in sterilizing e coli was achieved due to the sufficient uv fluence and the high mixing of microorganisms inside the flow reactor as the fluence continuously increased the reactor performance declined evidently with the uv fluence a droop was observed in the fluence response curve for different radiative powers this droop was attributed to the decrease in dean flow in the flow reactor 4 conclusion a water disinfection reactor with a spiral channel configuration was developed in this study to treat drinking water by using an uv c led array the spiral channel configuration effectively increased the efficiency in sterilizing e coli due to the generation of dean vortices and the increase in exposure time the effects of the spiral pitch radiative power and flow rate were investigated to improve the reactor performance some key findings of this study are listed as follows 1 the flow reactors with three different spiral pitches achieved the highest log inactivation at a flow rate of 60 ml min 2 at all flow rates the flow reactor with a spiral pitch of 10 mm exhibited the highest log inactivation among the three reactors with different pitches 3 both dean vortices and the exposure time substantially affected the reactor performance in sterilizing e coli in water however the exposure time and dean number exhibited opposite trends under varying flow rates 4 the log inactivation exhibited similar trends with flow rate when the radiative power was varied from 6 to 10 mw at 10 mw the reactor achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log at all flow rates with a spiral pitch of 10 mm 5 a droop was observed in the fluence response curve when the flow rate was less than 60 ml min at various radiative powers due to the decrease of dean flow in the spiral channel under the same uv fluence the reactor with a spiral pitch of 10 mm

three reactors with different pitches the shorter the spiral pitch the higher was the dean number and longer was the exposure time in the flow channel increasing the flow rate not only enhanced dean effect but also reduced the microbial exposure time moreover the exposure time and dean number exhibited opposite trends under a varying flow rate the optimal log inactivation was achieved at a flow rate of 60 ml min and a droop was observed in the fluence response curve when the flow rate was less than 60 ml min due to a decrease of dean effect in the flow reactor under the same uv fluence the

reactors can be classified into two major types batch 10 12 and flow through 13 16 reactors according to the literature the sterilization efficiency of a flow through reactor is less than that of a batch rector because of the complex fluid flow mechanisms in a flow through reactor sozzi and taghipour 17 applied lagrangian and eulerian models to simulate the reactor performance by using computational fluid dynamics where the fluid dynamics inside the flow through reactor exhibited a significant influence on water disinfection uv mercury lamps are traditional uv light sources used in water disinfection systems sultan 18 compared the differences between parallel and staggered configurations of mercury lamps for water disinfection their results indicated that the lamp configuration substantially affects the performance of an open channel reactor and that the effect of wall roughness on the reactor performance is dependent on the reynolds number xu et al 19 20 and li et al 21 investigated the effects of the reactor shape lamp arrangement flow rate and power on the reactor performance for water treatment the complex interactions among these design parameters affected the uv

drinking water a spiral channel was used to increase microbial exposure time and induce dean vortices in the flow reactor three spiral channel configurations with different spiral pitches were fabricated to analyze the effect of dean flow on water sterilization efficiency the flow rate radiative power and spiral pitch were analyzed to improve the efficiency of sterilizing e coli a theoretical simulation and an experiment were performed to gain insights into the design of a flow reactor with a spiral channel and uv c leds 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment for water disinfection fig 1 illustrates the experiment conducted for water disinfection by using a uv c led module an agilent e3632a power supply and a gw instek gpe1326 power supply were used as the power sources for the uv module and water pump respectively a flow meter was used to control the flow rate of water between 40 and 120 ml min e coli ifo 3301 was used as the microorganism in water the bacteria were incubated in an incubator containing 100 ml nzcym broth at 37 c for 12 h and then resuspended to obtain an e coli concentration of 107 cfu ml the cell concentration was determined using a photometer m6 metertech inc to determine the population density the spread plate technique was applied to both irradiated and nonirradiated samples with a volume of 100 Î¼l the samples were then incubated for 24 h at 37 c the plate counts of 10 300 colonies were considered in the experiment the log inactivation was defined as the product of rate constant k and uv dose 30 1 log n 0 n k uv dose in which n and n 0 represented the number of colonies in the unirradiated and irradiated samples respectively 2 2 design of the flow reactor the uv c module comprised 24 leds to achieve uniform irradiance distribution inside the flow reactor irradiance distribution in the reactor was significantly affected by the radiation pattern and led arrangement the influence of irradiance distribution on water disinfection was shown in our previous work 16 the results showed that the uv module offered the highest inactivation efficiency due to a significant improvement in irradiance uniformity the leds were manufactured by lg innotek and each led had a radiative power of 10 mw at a rated current of 100 ma the leds were attached on an aluminum rod by using solder paste to provide sufficient heat dissipation the aluminum rod was 12 cm long and had six leds on each side with a constant interval of 16 mm as displayed in fig 2 a quartz glass tube was used to seal the spiral channel and facilitate uv light transmittance the flow reactor was developed using a three dimensional printer with a semispherical spiral channel configuration the diameter of the spiral channel was 7 mm flow reactors with three spiral pitches 10 20 and 30 mm were analyzed in the experiment as illustrated in fig 3 a c to evaluate the improvement obtained in the reactor performance by using the spiral channel configuration the results obtained for this configuration were compared with those obtained for a traditional flow through reactor as depicted in fig 3 d 2 3 fluid dynamics inside the reactor the fluid motion inside the flow reactor significantly influences the uv fluence received by the microorganisms the microbial exposure time was determined by dividing the average water velocity in the channel by the distance between the inlet and the outlet in this study the average velocity was defined as the average speed of 10 000 pathlines inside the reactor the purpose is to simulate bacterial movement in the reactor a spiral channel was used to induce dean vortices in the reactor the commercial software ansys was used to analyze the fluid motion in the spiral channel by using a realizable

dispersion force and the stress tensor respectively studies have indicated that dean vortices can efficiently enhance the mixing of fluid particles the dean number was used to analyze the magnitude of secondary flow in the spiral channel 34 4 d e r e r x Ï 0 5 where r e and Ï indicate the reynolds number and radius of curvature respectively an increase in the dean number effectively enhanced the mixing of fluid particles in the adopted aqueous solution increasing the reynolds number not only helped increase the dean vortices but also reduced the microbial exposure time 3 results and

inactivation values of 5 1 4 5 and 3 4 log at spiral pitches of 10 20 and 30 mm respectively when the flow rate exceeded 60 ml min the log inactivation decreased approximately linearly with the flow rate for the three reactors the experiment was repeated three times and the maximum deviation was 6 furthermore at all flow rates the log inactivation increased as the spiral pitch was decreased from 30 to 10 mm the flow reactor with a pitch of 10 mm exhibited the highest performance among the three flow reactors with different spiral pitches the flow reactor achieved an inactivation value of 4 0 log at all flow rates at a spiral pitch of 10 mm the shorter the spiral pitch the higher was the exposure time for the microorganisms inside the flow reactor the aforementioned results obtained for the spiral channel reactor were compared with the results obtained using a traditional flow through reactor the log inactivation decreased when the flow rate was increased from 40 to 120 ml min for the flow through reactor at a flow rate of 40 ml min the log inactivation of the flow through reactor was similar to that of the reactor with a spiral pitch of 10 mm but higher than those of the reactors with spiral pitches of 20 and 30 mm this result is attributed to the microbial exposure time inside the reactors as displayed in fig 5 at all flow rates the flow through reactor had a longer

13469,the disposal of untreated or partially treated brewery wastewater can cause pollution problems to the receiving water bodies the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a two stage horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland hssfcw system planted with cyperus alternifolius and typha latifolia in polishing an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating brewery effluent in kombolcha northern ethiopia the system was integrated with the uasb reactor and its performance efficiency was monitored for a year using standard methods the first order kinetic model was used to correlate the influent and effluent pollutant concentrations and estimate the areal rate constant ka by fitting the experimental data to the model the hssfcw s water quality index wqi and oxygen transfer rate otr were also calculated the findings showed that hssfcw removed 89 total suspended solids tss 92 chemical oxygen demand cod 83 6 total nitrogen tn 92 9 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 74 4 total phosphorous tp and 79 5 orthophosphate po4 3 literature comparable otr values were obtained for each hssfcw stage with a total otr value of 23 5 g 2d 1 effluent concentrations of cod

polishing of the effluent with two stage hssfcw has shifted the wqi from a good to excellent water quality rating and thus can be used as a sustainable polishing technique for agro process wastewaters keywords up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor brewery wastewater constructed wetland the combined effect of macrophytes water quality index 1 introduction the safety of industrial wastewater and its consequences on the environment has become a major concern worldwide biological wastewater treatment is becoming a more attractive alternative solution and it is being used in developed and developing countries 1 the anaerobic process is deemed a sustainable technology for treating wastewaters rich in organic matter at the secondary level 2 however it cannot be seen as providing a complete environmental solution as its treated effluents would typically not meet the desired discharge limits in terms of residual carbon and nutrients 3 4 clean water and sanitation are the sixth and final sustainable development goals set by the united nations which significantly enhances quality water access for safe reuse and discharge into the environmnet by 2030 anaerobic reactor integrated with a constructed wetland cw system is adequate and efficient for wastewater quality improvement and meeting national discharge limits 4 many studies have reported that subsurface flow constructed wetlands ssfcws are effectively integrated with anaerobic reactors and treat wastewaters with high effluent quality 5 6 including brewery effluents 7 and are being succeeded as a water quality improving tools 8 among the ssfcws a single stage horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland hssfcw system is widely used at the tertiary level to further reduce pollutants such as organic matter suspended solids metals nutrients and pathogens globally 6 9 10 however high strength food processing wastewaters such as breweries are difficult to treat using this polishing system 11 therefore various hssfcw configurations connected in series need to be investigated for effective pollutant removal via controlling load variations 12 hssfcw systems planted with different macrophytes enhance treatment performances but this enhancement varies depending on macrophyte species 8 12 some commonly used macrophytes are c alternifolius and t latifolia both mainly applied to the purification of municipal domestic and industrial wastewaters individually hssfcw planted with c alternifolius and t latifolia has been studied for their ability to remove organic matter suspended solids and nutrients 13 14 however there are no research findings that show their combined treatment efficiency is optimal c alternifolius and t latifolia are water tolerant macrophytes that grow in nutrient rich wastewater media 15 16 combined macrophytes attributed a positive effect on improved nutrient removal through enhancement of oxygen availability stimulating nitrification and denitrification including absorption and adsorption 8 in addition macrophyte species richness provides increased biomass production which may greatly enhance nutrient reductions due to increased nutrient retention microbial activity and macrophytes uptake 17 studies have assessed the efficacy of two hybrid cw systems one with a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland followed by free water surface constructed wetland and the other with hssfcw followed by free water surface constructed wetland system in treating domestic wastewater for a year and reported a maximum removal efficiencies of 80 and 78 chemical oxygen demand cod 81 and 82 biological oxygen demand bod 63 and 69 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and 79 and 89 total suspended solids tss respectively 18 this indicates that the use of combined systems would improve the removal efficiency of residual organics nutrients and other pollutants from the effluents 19 in the cw system wastewater purification is achieved by a wide variety of physical chemical and biological processes occurring inside its component 20 however its pollutant removal efficiency is mostly affected by hydraulic factors 21 22 for instance the lower pollutant hydraulic loading rate brings pollutants to have a higher rate of contact time within the cw 23 favors greater chances of tss sedimentation and cod degradation including high nutrient absorption and retention 24 and thus improving the effluent quality furthermore cw treatment efficiency depends on the nature of wastewater media types macrophyte types wetland design and macrophyte aeration abilities 25 climatic conditions also influence a cw removal process by altering the wastewater characteristics macrophytes growth and microbial processes 26 cw treatment performance is evaluated based on removal efficiency however this calculation doesn t provide additional information on the removal dynamics of pollutants 4 hence cw modeling provides a major benefit to understand the sensitivity of product quality to parameter changes in the cw system furthermore models provide a major benefit to the designer and suitable process equipment modification 20 27 the first order area specific equation is used to represent wetland effluent concentrations as a function of influent concentrations most available models assume the inflexibility of parameters for the description of wetland as a plug flow reactor accordingly if a hydraulic flow rate is not disruptive the wetland designation is considered as a plug flow reactor 28 to predict pollutant removals in the cw system a simple regression model is used which focuses on influent effluent pollutant concentrations rather than the internal process data 4 there are many ways to describe the pollutant removals in cw but many different studies have used the first order kinetic model for pollutant removal based on the application of the area based rate constant 29 31 since most pollutant removal processes in this system depend on their areal k rate coefficients represented by ka the pollutant removal profiles in the cw systems are widely employed based on the assumption of an exponential decrease of influent and effluent pollutant concentrations from the inlet to the outlet end 20 32 35 larger ka rates indicate greater the pollutant is removed more rapidly in the cw 30 the overall aim of wastewater treatment plants is to produce high quality effluent with zero discharges that do not have effects on human health and the environment the water quality index wqi is a key parameter to indicate the overall nature of given wastewater by incorporating a complex set of wastewater record data and generating a single value which is used to understand the spatial and temporal variations in effluent quality hence evaluation and communication of the quality status of the treatment plant effluent is important to judge its suitability for reuse and or safe disposal in the past few studies are conducted using different quality indices to provide status of wastewater quality 36 37 however the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme 37 indices are frequently used for water quality assessment due to its realibility and flexibility concerning the type and number of wastewater quality variables to be tested 38 various efforts have been made to increase brewery wastewater treatment efficiency using efficient macrophyte species 7 39 40 however detailed research data on the efficiency and effluent quality of cw system are still missing for brewery wastewater treatment in addition no study has been conducted on a combination of uasb reactor and two stage hssfcw system for brewery wastewater treatment therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the post treatment efficiency of a pilot scale two stage hssfcw system for treating anaerobically treated brewery effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental location a two stage pilot scale hssfcw

the volume of the existing uasb reactor is 592 m3 which works based on the average hydraulic flow rate of 840 m3 per day the uasb reactor is preceeded with a screening and buffering tank serving as pretreatments the screening is used to remove oil and grease and heavy solid materials the buffering tank is used to balance the ph variation and flow from the operation of the brewing process a 3000

hssfcw body was made from concrete and the interior region was well insulated to avoid any seepage the outlet pipe was installed at 0 35 m above the floor inside the hssfcw system and was connected to the collection tank using t fitting pipe a 15 25 mm size clay rock media composed of 76 36 w w silicon oxide sio2 13 69 w w aluminum oxide al2o3 4 24 w w iron oxide fe2o3 1 52 w w calcium oxide cao and 0 1 w w magnesium oxide mgo obtained from mitikolo was filled to the depth of 0 45 m with effective porosity of 0 27 two locally available macrophytes were collected from borkena river and identified at addis ababa university national herbarium and planted in the two stage hssfcw cells without mixing in august 2018 as indicated in fig 2 c alternifolius was planted at a density of 5 plants m2 in the first cell due to its high ph resistance 41 high productivity relatively strong root system easy adaptation to organic load changes salinity tolerance and high nutrient absorption capacity 15 while t latifolia was planted at a density of 5 plants m2 in the second cell due to its short root length 42 less salinity tolerance and ability to mitigate nutrient rich wastewater 16 in addition these macrophytes have low evapotranspiration rates 43 being considered a selection criterion the endorsed macrophytes were acclimatized with diluted wastewater 75 25 brewery effluent to clean pipe water ratio from a reservoir continuously the size of the wetland area needed was determined using a first order plug flow model eq 1 proposed by kickuth and is widely used for sizing hssfcw systems for domestic sewage wastewater treatment 44 1 as qd ln c i ln c e k bod the daily hydraulic flow rate qd 0 698 m3d 1 the influent bod concentration ci 223 9 mgl 1 the recommended national discharge limit of effluent bod ce 60 mgl 1 and bod rate constant kbod values were used to calculate the size of each series connected two stage hssfcw system the kbod is usually lower ranging from 0 07 to 0 1 md 1 45 because kbod is temperature dependent and bod degradation rates vary by 10 per degree celsius 44 but according to vymazal and kropfelova 46 many countries used 0 08 md

is the length of wetland m w is the width of wetland m as m2 is the surface area of the hssfcw cell d m is the influent flow depth and p is the porosity of the media used 2 3 operation of the two stage pilot scale hssfcw system the experiment was initiated in january 2019 with the pumping of a fixed hydraulic flow rate of 0 698 m3d 1 with the use of a 2 in gate valve a stopwatch and a measuring cylinder at the cw s inlet with a theoretical hrt of 4 days the performance study was monitored for 1 year until december 2019 the pollutant removal efficiency re was computed using the following eq 3 48 3 re c i c e c i x 100 2 4 effluent water quality indexes wqi of the uasb reactor and hssfcw system the wqi of the uasb reactor and two stage hssfcw treatment plant effluents were calculated using selected parameters such as temperature ph tss cod tn nh4 n and tp for this the ethiopian environmental protection authority eepa 49 discharge guideline and one year effluent record

direct measure of biodegradable organic matter oxidized in the beds platzer 53 estimated otr using cod rather than bod using a conversion factor of 0 7 as a measure of biodegradable organic matter factor 4 3 is derived from the stoichiometric of ammonia oxidation with oxygen i e 1 g of ammonia requires 4 3 g of o2 26 2 6 areal removal rate constant a first order kinetic equation was used to determine the areal rate constants of the two stage hssfcw system the effluent concentration was predicted as a function of influent concentration and hydraulic loading rate q using a simplified first order kinetic equation expressed in eq 11 52 11 ln c i ka q ln c e as expressed in eq 11 the areal rate constant ka md 1 of pollutants were obtained by correlating or fitting of the influent and effluent concentrations of tss cod total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorous tp and orthophosphate po4 3 the y intercept value is used to determine the areal rate constant 2 7 wastewater sampling and analyses wastewater samples were collected three times per month from the inlet middle point and outlet of the series connected two stage hssfcw cell for one year using pre cleaned ethylene polyvinyl bottles and transported to the laboratory for immediate analysis on site wastewater parameters such as ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a handheld intellicaltm ph temperature digital probe hach hd30d flexi loveland usa and do meter ysi 550a yellow springs oh usa respectively whereas the off site parameters such as tss cod tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 were measured using the oven dry method reactor digestion method persulfate digestion method nessler method molybdovanadate with acid persulfate digestion method and phosver 3 method respectively according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 54 2 8 data analysis the data obtained from the study were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical data analysis using microsoft excel 2013 and originpro2017 the results were expressed in terms of mean and standard deviation values results were presented using graphs and tables 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of two stage pilot scale hssfcw system the post treatment performance of a series connected two stage hssfcw integrated with the existing uasb reactor for the treatment of brewery wastewater was monitored over a year table 1 reports the average value and standard deviation of each of the main brewery pollutants studied for the two stage hssfcw post treated effluent of the uasb reactor as shown in fig 3 a and b the uasb effluent tss and cod concentrations entering into the two stage hssfcw system were varied from 123 7 to 274 4 mgl 1 and 207 3 to 614 mgl 1 respectively after polishing with cw cell 1 cw1 both tss and cod concentrations were fluctuated from 31 3 to 116 4 mgl 1 and 30 3 to 199 mgl 1 respectively with corresponding average removal efficiencies of 68 5 57 6 to 83 for tss and 74 2 67 6 to 85 4 for cod further polishing with the cw cell 2 cw2 showed high quality effluent tss and cod concentrations which varied from 5 3 to 50 5 mgl 1 and 7 4 to 64 1 mgl 1 respectively with corresponding average removal efficiencies of 66 6 56 6 to 83 1 for tss and 69 8 61 6 to 78 2 for cod however enhanced tss and cod removal efficiencies of 89 81 6 to 97 1 for tss and 92 89 6 to 96 4 for cod were achieved throughout the study periods by the complete system cw1 cw2 table 1 fig 3 a and b carballeira et al 55 reported that macrophytes have an important role in tss and cod removals similarly the two macrophytes used in this study contributed favorable tss and cod removals across the stages however better and almost steadier reductions were achieved by the complete system macrophytes root mat enhances more solid particles adhering biodegradation and consumption of organic matters via attached anaerobic aerobic microorganisms 56 57 moreover macrophytes root oxygen transfer potential has a positive effect on pollutant removal in a cw system 58 and provides sufficient do for heterotrophic aerobic microorganisms metabolic activity that reduces organic matter through biodegradation 59 the key factors contributing to the reduction of suspended solids and organic matter in the system are the retention of suspended solids within the filter beds and the biodegradation of organic matter by heterotrophic bacteria adhered to the media 52 treatment efficiency comparison of the complete system was mostly performed with a single stage hssfcw system due to a lack of available research data de sousa et al 60 examined the efficiency of a juncus spp planted hssfcw system for polishing uasb reactor sewage wastewater and reported 70 to 71 tss and 79 to 86 cod removals at hrt of 10 days another study by von sperling 61 also obtained improved tss and cod removal of 87 8 and 84 5 respectively using a t latifolia planted hssfcw system integrated with a uasb reactor for the treatment of sewage wastewater in general treatment of uasb reactor brewery effluent using a two stage hssfcw system planted with c aternifolius and t latifolia showed promising removal of tss and cod concentrations these marked removal efficiencies may be associated with the concerted action of combined macrophytes through adhering more solid particles biodegradation of organic matter via the action of anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms located close to the rhizosphere of the macrophytes and in the pores of the substrate 13 56 62 post treatment using the two stage hssfcw system also showed promising removal efficiencies for total nitrogen and ammonium across the cells the tn and nh4 n concentrations of the uasb effluent showed significant fluctuations ranged from 25 to 101 4 mgl 1 and 17 3 to 74 8 mgl 1 respectively but the polishing of these pollutants by the cw1 cell was able to reduce over 50 of the initial tn and nh4 n concentrations to the range of 11 to 51 5 mgl 1 and 2 9 to 28 3 mgl 1 respectively fig 3 c and d the corresponding average removal efficiencies of 55 7 49 2 to 61 6 for tn and 65 5 58 8 to 83 3 for nh4 n were also obtained further treatment with cw2 cell drastically decreased the cw1 effluent tn and nh4 n concentrations by two fold and three fold to the range of 2 8 to 21 mgl 1 and 0 7 to 9 1 mgl 1 respectively with corresponding average removal efficiency of 63 2 57 4 to 74 5 and 77 6 73 5 to 84 respectively the combined system cw1 cw2 achieved improved tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies of 83 6 79 3 to 88 8 and 92 9 89 5 to 96 3 respectively table 1 fig 3 c and d another study also showed that c alternifolius based treatment of aerobic palm oil mill effluent at 11 days hrt removed 92 nh4 n 13 leto et al 43 also indicated that c alternifolius based treatment of domestic wastewater removed 65 2 of tn and 66 7 of nh4 n in this study cw1 planted with c alternifolius increased tn and nh4 n removals might due to the relatively high do concentration which is also in agreement with the findings of la bella et al 62 who observed the vital role of c alternifolius in liable oxygen transport and enables better nitrification moreover previous study result showed that c alternifolius has a larger root mass deeper root growth and higher aboveground biomass and good nitrogen absorption ability more than other macrophytes 59 on the other hand a study showed removal efficiency of 74 8 tn and 88 5 nh4 n for a hssfcw cell planted with t latifolia during the polishing of an anaerobic baffled reactor treated domestic wastewater 63 many research findings showed that t latifolia planted bed favors more denitrification process 62 64 due to its short root growth 42 enhanced removal of nitrogen and its species is mainly dependent on the good oxygen delivery capacity of macrophytes 65 and nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria present in a wetland cell 66 in this study the enhanced total nitrogen and ammonia removal efficiencies achieved by the complete system may be due to the concerted action of the combined macrophytes through physicochemical and biological processes which is in agreement with zhu et al 67 who suggested that two stage cw would provide better nitrogen removal nitrogen removal is achieved through plant uptake adsorption volatilizations and microbial activities 32 overall the present study results were comparable with the findings of da motta marques et al 68 who reported 90 4 tn and 95 nh4 n removal efficiencies at 1 5 days hrt for hssfcw cell planted with z bonorriensis and t subalata during the polishing of the uasb reactor treated municipal wastewater as well as cheng et al 69 who also reported 96 3 of nh4 n removal efficiency using a two stage hssfcw system planted with p australis and p stratiotes macrophytes during polishing of the uasb reactor treated mixture of sewage and swine wastewater at hrt of 13 5 days analogously the two stage hssfcw system showed promising removal efficiencies for phosphorus rich uasb effluent treatment in this study fig 3 e and f present the uasb effluent tp and po4 3 concentrations ranging from 17 9 to 42 9 mgl 1 and 10 2 to 32 9 mgl 1 respectively after polishing this phosphorus rich effluent with a two stage hssfcw system significant reduction in tp concentration was observed in cw1 and cw2 with a range of 10 5 to 30 mgl 1 and 2 5 to 16 3 mgl 1respectively with a corresponding average removal efficiency of 41 1 30 1 to 51 6 and 57 7 25 to 80 2 table 1 fig 3 e and f similarly the po4 3 concentration at the outlet of cw1 varied from 5 6 to 19 4 mgl 1 with a corresponding average removal efficiency of 48 1 34 4 to 60 7 and further polishing with cw2 reduced to the range of 1 4 to 9 3 mgl 1 with a corresponding average removal efficiency of 62 6 36 6 to 80 tp and po4 3 concentrations ranged from 2 5 to 42 9 mgl 1 and 1 4 to 32 9 mgl 1 with average removal efficiencies of 74 4 54 8 to 89 8 and 79 5 58 5 to 90 3 respectively were achieved by the complete system cw1 cw2 table 1 fig 3 e and f this phytoremediation process showed promising tp and po4 3 removal efficiencies which meet the national eepa discharge standard limit values however after august there were fluctuations of these values probably due to the saturation of clay media active sites which decreases the absorption abilities 14 phosphorous removal in a cw system is dependent on the type of media and macrophytes used these wetland components play a significant role in its removal via media absorption microbial biodegradation as well as plant uptake 7 likewise ciria et al 14 reviewed that the clay media was the main phosphorous sink and increased its removal efficiency by 36 through adsorption whereas the presence of macrophytes contributed over 60 of phosphorus removal 70 wijaya et al 59 and xu et al 65 were also observed good phosphorous uptake abilities of c alternifolius and t latifolia de sousa et al 60 reported 90 tp removal using a juncus sp planted hssfcw cell during polishing of anaerobic reactor treated sewage wastewater at hrt of 10 days the present study result was lower than da motta marques et al 68 finding who reported 93 3 of phosphorous removal at 1 5 days hrt using a z bonorriensis and t subalata planted hssfcw cells during polishing of uasb reactor treated municipal wastewater and higher than cheng et al 69 who reported 75 1 tp removal using a p australis and p stratiotes planted two stage hssfcw system during polishing of the uasb reactor treated mixture of sewage and swine wastewater at hrt of 13 5 days 3 2 treatment plant effluent water quality index the ethiopian environmental protection authority eepa 49 guideline was used as standard values for temperature ph tss cod tn nh4 n and tp table 1 to calculate the wqi of both the uasb reactor and the two stage hssfcw system accordingly the wqi of a uasb reactor effluent was varied from 91 6 to 92 9 but further treatment with a two stage hssfcw system improved its wqi to the range of 95 8 to 100 fig 4 according to the canadian water quality guidelines water quality classification indices indicated that the excellent wqi rating varied between 95 wqi 100 good 80 wqi 94 fair 65 wqi 79 marginal 45 wqi 64 poor 0 wqi 44 51 comparing to these ratings the present study wqi of the uasb reactor effluent is classified into a good water quality class while the two stage hssfcw effluent is classified into an excellent water quality class this implies that post treatment of anaerobically treated brewery effluents with a series connected two stage hssfcw system is promising for the enhancement of the quality of brewery effluents for reuse in addition the greater wqi value of the two stage hssfcw effluent also indicates that it is suitable for sustained discharge without impairing the aquatic ecosystem similarly marine 71 recommended that the water quality ranked under excellent with values varied from 95 to 100 does not cause any environmental threat or impairment whereas the good quality category ranged from 80 to 94 causes some degree of environmental threat or impairment as indicated in table 1 the uasb reactor effluent pollutants such as tss cod tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 concentrations exceeded the national discharge standard limits and hence disposal of these pollutants into the receiving water bodies may cause water body s deterioration however its subsequent further treatment with the two stage hssfcw system gave lower average pollutant concentrations that meet the national discharge standard limits may be due to a wide range of physical chemical and biological processes such as sedimentation filtration precipitation adsorption plant uptake and microbial degradation and consumption 20 56 57 in agreement with the present study very few studies monitored wastewater treatment plants water quality indices and reported that out of 22 treatment plants one treatment plant effluent quality is classified in the excellent water class twelve treatment plants effluent classified in the good quality class three treatment plants showed a poor water quality class three treatment plants under a very poor quality class and the last three treatment plant effluents were classified in the unsuitable for intended use class 72 3 3 oxygen transfer rate otr in the two stage hssfcw system convective air diffusion is used to transport oxygen from the atmosphere to the filter bed the otr is critical to know the amount of available oxygen concentration for efficient oxidation of organic matter nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen in the cw 52 fig 5 shows that the increased otr is more pronounced for the cw1 which varied from 11 9 to 29 8 g 2d 1 while in the cw2 otr value was varied from 1 6 to 10 8 g 2d 1 the calculated otr values significantly varied between the stages p 0 05 which may be due to a gradual decrease in the loading rate and the macrophytes aeration ability variation the higher otr value in the cw1 mainly used for the degradation of organic matter and biological nitrification similarly la bella et al 62 reported the vital role of c alternifolius in liable oxygen transport and enables better nitrification due to its larger root mass deeper root growth and higher aboveground biomass 59 whereas the lower otr values in the cw2 may predominate the denitrification process many research reports indicated that t latifolia planted cell favors more denitrification process 62 64 due to its short root growth 42 higher oxygen secretion by macrophytes has a positive effect on pollutant removal in the cw system 58 and provides better do for heterotrophic aerobic microorganism metabolic activity that reduces organic matter through degradation 59 llorÃ©ns et al 52 also reported that the increase in do concentration enhances the activity of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria and therefore the organic matter oxidation the hydrolysis of organic nitrogen compounds and the nitrification processes were improved the total otr value of 23 5 g 2d 1 obtained in this study for the complete system is considerably lower than llorÃ©ns et al 52 reported total otr value of 54 69 g 2d 1 with the four series connected horizontal filter beds whereas it is nearly comparable to the recommended otr value of 30 g 2d 1 used for design criteria for organic matter total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen removals in cw 26 53 3 4 estimation of area based kinetic rate constants for measured brewery pollutants a first order kinetic model was used to study the removal kinetics ka of main brewery pollutants across the two stage hssfcw system the calculated ka values for tss cod tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 removal along the series connected two stage of hssfcw treatment system as well as the complete system are presented in table 2 as indicated in table 2 the ka values vary across the stages which may be due to process variations which may arise from the effect of macrophytes research findings also show that the pollutant removal mechanisms in cw systems are different due to the diversity of kinetics expressed in removal rates 73 74 in the cw1 cw2 the cod kinetic constant was 0 26 md 1 which was higher than trang et al 75 reported cod removal rate constant which varied from 0 06 to 0 082 md 1 this higher ka value obtained in a complete treatment system provides the highest removal of organic matter table 1 however in this study tss areal rate constant indicated in table 2 was found in the reported tss removal rate constant range of 0 085 0 315 md 1 75 the tn removal rate constant found in this study was higher than the area based removal rate constant range of 0 014 0 066 md 1 estimated by trang et al 75 along the length of the constructed wetland starting from the inlet to the outlet similarly the evaluation of the 136 free water surface wetlands and 123 hssfcw systems showed an area based removal rate constant of 0 034 and 0 023 md 1 for tn respectively 28 in addition the present tn areal rate constant is higher than the rate constants reported by cui et al 30 varied from 0 007 to 0 1 md 1 in the hssfcw and konnerup et al 76 estimated ka value which varied from 0 008 to 0 016 md 1 in tropical ssfcw system the higher ka of tn found in this study compared to these authors reported values may be due to ammonification nitrification and denitrification which provide better removal in a cw system concerning tp a higher tp removal rate constant varied from 0 11 to 0 23 md 1 was reported from the evaluation of the 136 free water surface wetlands and 123 hssfcw systems 28 however in this study ka of tp was higher than the ka of 0 005 0 014 md 1 reported by konnerup et al 76 and 0 037 md 1 reported by kantawanichkul et al 26 another study result reported by kadlec 28 indicated that the computation of the ka rate for tp in 282 free surface flow constructed wetlands and 82 hssfcw systems revealed 0 027 md 1 and 0 016 md 1 respectively the main tp removal process in the cw cells may be attributed to media adsorption or precipitation as well as both macrophyte and microbial uptakes 7 higher ka values indicate a more efficient removal and sufficient wastewater treatment is accomplished 4 the model s goodness of fit for the entire treatment system cw1 cw2 was good for cod tn and nh4 n with r2 values 0 85 table 2 whereas a decreased fit was found for tp and po4 3 with r2 values shown in table 2 4 conclusion in this study the implementation of an environmentally friendly two stage pilot scale hssfcw post treatment technology showed a promising result with substantial decreases in pollutant concentrations and higher removal efficiencies this study s otr value was comparable to the recommended otr value of 30 g 2d 1 used for cw design criteria which is directly related to the high removal of organic matter nitrogen and ammonium in the two stage hssfcw system the plug flow model was used to describe the behavior of the influent and effluent concentrations and appropriate fits were achieved for all pollutants except phosphorous and orthophosphate across the stages and complete system the areal rate constant ka obtained in this study is also significantly higher than those stated in the literature suggesting more efficient removal and the final effluent meets the national discharge standard limits except phosphorous which was exceeded at the end of the experimental period and requires additional treatment the treatment plant effluent wqi result also indicated that the uasb reactor effluent was categorized into a good quality class but further treatment with the two stage hssfcw system improved its status and categorized into an excellent water quality class as a result the anaerobic two stage hssfcw integrated treatment system can be used as an alternative and effective option for brewery wastewater treatment and resource recovery declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments authors would like to acknowledge addis ababa university for financial support from its thematic research programme as well as the kombolcha brewery factory for providing necessary equipment and laboratory facilities for undertaking the study 
13469,the disposal of untreated or partially treated brewery wastewater can cause pollution problems to the receiving water bodies the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a two stage horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland hssfcw system planted with cyperus alternifolius and typha latifolia in polishing an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating brewery effluent in kombolcha northern ethiopia the system was integrated with the uasb reactor and its performance efficiency was monitored for a year using standard methods the first order kinetic model was used to correlate the influent and effluent pollutant concentrations and estimate the areal rate constant ka by fitting the experimental data to the model the hssfcw s water quality index wqi and oxygen transfer rate otr were also calculated the findings showed that hssfcw removed 89 total suspended solids tss 92 chemical oxygen demand cod 83 6 total nitrogen tn 92 9 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 74 4 total phosphorous tp and 79 5 orthophosphate po4 3 literature comparable otr values were obtained for each hssfcw stage with a total otr value of 23 5 g 2d 1 effluent concentrations of cod tn and nh4 n were reasonably correlated r2 0 85 to influent concentrations the calculated ka md 1 for tss cod tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 were 0 26 0 26 0 11 0 18 0 08 and 0 08 respectively further polishing of the effluent with two stage hssfcw has shifted the wqi from a good to excellent water quality rating and thus can be used as a sustainable polishing technique for agro process wastewaters keywords up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor brewery wastewater constructed wetland the combined effect of macrophytes water quality index 1 introduction the safety of industrial wastewater and its consequences on the environment has become a major concern worldwide biological wastewater treatment is becoming a more attractive alternative solution and it is being used in developed and developing countries 1 the anaerobic process is deemed a sustainable technology for treating wastewaters rich in organic matter at the secondary level 2 however it cannot be seen as providing a complete environmental solution as its treated effluents would typically not meet the desired discharge limits in terms of residual carbon and nutrients 3 4 clean water and sanitation are the sixth and final sustainable development goals set by the united nations which significantly enhances quality water access for safe reuse and discharge into the environmnet by 2030 anaerobic reactor integrated with a constructed wetland cw system is adequate and efficient for wastewater quality improvement and meeting national discharge limits 4 many studies have reported that subsurface flow constructed wetlands ssfcws are effectively integrated with anaerobic reactors and treat wastewaters with high effluent quality 5 6 including brewery effluents 7 and are being succeeded as a water quality improving tools 8 among the ssfcws a single stage horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland hssfcw system is widely used at the tertiary level to further reduce pollutants such as organic matter suspended solids metals nutrients and pathogens globally 6 9 10 however high strength food processing wastewaters such as breweries are difficult to treat using this polishing system 11 therefore various hssfcw configurations connected in series need to be investigated for effective pollutant removal via controlling load variations 12 hssfcw systems planted with different macrophytes enhance treatment performances but this enhancement varies depending on macrophyte species 8 12 some commonly used macrophytes are c alternifolius and t latifolia both mainly applied to the purification of municipal domestic and industrial wastewaters individually hssfcw planted with c alternifolius and t latifolia has been studied for their ability to remove organic matter suspended solids and nutrients 13 14 however there are no research findings that show their combined treatment efficiency is optimal c alternifolius and t latifolia are water tolerant macrophytes that grow in nutrient rich wastewater media 15 16 combined macrophytes attributed a positive effect on improved nutrient removal through enhancement of oxygen availability stimulating nitrification and denitrification including absorption and adsorption 8 in addition macrophyte species richness provides increased biomass production which may greatly enhance nutrient reductions due to increased nutrient retention microbial activity and macrophytes uptake 17 studies have assessed the efficacy of two hybrid cw systems one with a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland followed by free water surface constructed wetland and the other with hssfcw followed by free water surface constructed wetland system in treating domestic wastewater for a year and reported a maximum removal efficiencies of 80 and 78 chemical oxygen demand cod 81 and 82 biological oxygen demand bod 63 and 69 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and 79 and 89 total suspended solids tss respectively 18 this indicates that the use of combined systems would improve the removal efficiency of residual organics nutrients and other pollutants from the effluents 19 in the cw system wastewater purification is achieved by a wide variety of physical chemical and biological processes occurring inside its component 20 however its pollutant removal efficiency is mostly affected by hydraulic factors 21 22 for instance the lower pollutant hydraulic loading rate brings pollutants to have a higher rate of contact time within the cw 23 favors greater chances of tss sedimentation and cod degradation including high nutrient absorption and retention 24 and thus improving the effluent quality furthermore cw treatment efficiency depends on the nature of wastewater media types macrophyte types wetland design and macrophyte aeration abilities 25 climatic conditions also influence a cw removal process by altering the wastewater characteristics macrophytes growth and microbial processes 26 cw treatment performance is evaluated based on removal efficiency however this calculation doesn t provide additional information on the removal dynamics of pollutants 4 hence cw modeling provides a major benefit to understand the sensitivity of product quality to parameter changes in the cw system furthermore models provide a major benefit to the designer and suitable process equipment modification 20 27 the first order area specific equation is used to represent wetland effluent concentrations as a function of influent concentrations most available models assume the inflexibility of parameters for the description of wetland as a plug flow reactor accordingly if a hydraulic flow rate is not disruptive the wetland designation is considered as a plug flow reactor 28 to predict pollutant removals in the cw system a simple regression model is used which focuses on influent effluent pollutant concentrations rather than the internal process data 4 there are many ways to describe the pollutant removals in cw but many different studies have used the first order kinetic model for pollutant removal based on the application of the area based rate constant 29 31 since most pollutant removal processes in this system depend on their areal k rate coefficients represented by ka the pollutant removal profiles in the cw systems are widely employed based on the assumption of an exponential decrease of influent and effluent pollutant concentrations from the inlet to the outlet end 20 32 35 larger ka rates indicate greater the pollutant is removed more rapidly in the cw 30 the overall aim of wastewater treatment plants is to produce high quality effluent with zero discharges that do not have effects on human health and the environment the water quality index wqi is a key parameter to indicate the overall nature of given wastewater by incorporating a complex set of wastewater record data and generating a single value which is used to understand the spatial and temporal variations in effluent quality hence evaluation and communication of the quality status of the treatment plant effluent is important to judge its suitability for reuse and or safe disposal in the past few studies are conducted using different quality indices to provide status of wastewater quality 36 37 however the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme 37 indices are frequently used for water quality assessment due to its realibility and flexibility concerning the type and number of wastewater quality variables to be tested 38 various efforts have been made to increase brewery wastewater treatment efficiency using efficient macrophyte species 7 39 40 however detailed research data on the efficiency and effluent quality of cw system are still missing for brewery wastewater treatment in addition no study has been conducted on a combination of uasb reactor and two stage hssfcw system for brewery wastewater treatment therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the post treatment efficiency of a pilot scale two stage hssfcw system for treating anaerobically treated brewery effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental location a two stage pilot scale hssfcw system was connected with the existing up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor based treatment plant in kombolcha town northern ethiopia fig 1 located at 11 04 42 43 n 39 43 34 45 e and 1833 m above sea level an area with annual average minimum and maximum temperatures varying between 6 1 and 15 2 c and 24 7 30 4 c respectively and mean annual rainfall of 255 7 mm 2 2 experimental design and setup the experimental setup for the two stage pilot scale hssfcw system integrated with the existing uasb reactor is shown in fig 2 which consists of four parts uasb reactor treatment plant existing i distribution tank ii two stage hssfcw system iii and collection tank iv the uasb reactor distribution tank and the two stage hssfcw system were connected by a pvc pipe with control valves the volume of the existing uasb reactor is 592 m3 which works based on the average hydraulic flow rate of 840 m3 per day the uasb reactor is preceeded with a screening and buffering tank serving as pretreatments the screening is used to remove oil and grease and heavy solid materials the buffering tank is used to balance the ph variation and flow from the operation of the brewing process a 3000 liter volume distribution tank was used as a storage tank from the uasb reactor the two equally sized series connected wetland cells had length width depth dimensions of 7 56 m 1 52 m 0 45 m the hssfcw body was made from concrete and the interior region was well insulated to avoid any seepage the outlet pipe was installed at 0 35 m above the floor inside the hssfcw system and was connected to the collection tank using t fitting pipe a 15 25 mm size clay rock media composed of 76 36 w w silicon oxide sio2 13 69 w w aluminum oxide al2o3 4 24 w w iron oxide fe2o3 1 52 w w calcium oxide cao and 0 1 w w magnesium oxide mgo obtained from mitikolo was filled to the depth of 0 45 m with effective porosity of 0 27 two locally available macrophytes were collected from borkena river and identified at addis ababa university national herbarium and planted in the two stage hssfcw cells without mixing in august 2018 as indicated in fig 2 c alternifolius was planted at a density of 5 plants m2 in the first cell due to its high ph resistance 41 high productivity relatively strong root system easy adaptation to organic load changes salinity tolerance and high nutrient absorption capacity 15 while t latifolia was planted at a density of 5 plants m2 in the second cell due to its short root length 42 less salinity tolerance and ability to mitigate nutrient rich wastewater 16 in addition these macrophytes have low evapotranspiration rates 43 being considered a selection criterion the endorsed macrophytes were acclimatized with diluted wastewater 75 25 brewery effluent to clean pipe water ratio from a reservoir continuously the size of the wetland area needed was determined using a first order plug flow model eq 1 proposed by kickuth and is widely used for sizing hssfcw systems for domestic sewage wastewater treatment 44 1 as qd ln c i ln c e k bod the daily hydraulic flow rate qd 0 698 m3d 1 the influent bod concentration ci 223 9 mgl 1 the recommended national discharge limit of effluent bod ce 60 mgl 1 and bod rate constant kbod values were used to calculate the size of each series connected two stage hssfcw system the kbod is usually lower ranging from 0 07 to 0 1 md 1 45 because kbod is temperature dependent and bod degradation rates vary by 10 per degree celsius 44 but according to vymazal and kropfelova 46 many countries used 0 08 md 1 each cell had an efficient aspect ratio l w of 5 1 which agrees with the recommended value of 5 1 47 the theoretical hydraulic retention time hrt is calculated using eq 2 2 hrt day lwdp qd where l is the length of wetland m w is the width of wetland m as m2 is the surface area of the hssfcw cell d m is the influent flow depth and p is the porosity of the media used 2 3 operation of the two stage pilot scale hssfcw system the experiment was initiated in january 2019 with the pumping of a fixed hydraulic flow rate of 0 698 m3d 1 with the use of a 2 in gate valve a stopwatch and a measuring cylinder at the cw s inlet with a theoretical hrt of 4 days the performance study was monitored for 1 year until december 2019 the pollutant removal efficiency re was computed using the following eq 3 48 3 re c i c e c i x 100 2 4 effluent water quality indexes wqi of the uasb reactor and hssfcw system the wqi of the uasb reactor and two stage hssfcw treatment plant effluents were calculated using selected parameters such as temperature ph tss cod tn nh4 n and tp for this the ethiopian environmental protection authority eepa 49 discharge guideline and one year effluent record data were used the wqi was calculated using the ccme 50 conceptual framework indicated in eq 4 4 wqi 100 f 1 f 2 f 3 1 732 where f1 is the percentage of treated effluent parameters which does not meet

values were classified into five categories following ccme as excellent 95 wqi 100 good 80 wqi 94 fair 65 wqi 79 marginal 45 wqi 64 and poor 0 wqi 44 51 2 5 estimation of the theoretical oxygen transfer rate otr in the two stage hssfcw system the theoretical oxygen transfer rate otr gm 2d 1 was calculated using the equation proposed by llorÃ©ns et al 52 10 otr q x 0 7 x cod in cod out 4 3 x nh 4 n in nh 4 n out where codin codout stands for the removed cod mgl 1 and nh4 nin nh4 nout stands for ammonium nitrogen mgl 1 nitrified in the wetland beds bod has traditionally been used as a direct measure of biodegradable organic matter oxidized in the beds platzer 53 estimated otr using cod rather than bod using a conversion factor of 0 7 as a measure of biodegradable organic matter factor 4 3 is derived from the stoichiometric of ammonia oxidation with oxygen i e 1 g of ammonia requires 4 3 g of o2 26 2 6 areal removal rate constant a first order kinetic equation was used to determine the areal rate constants of the two stage hssfcw system the effluent concentration was predicted as a function of influent concentration and hydraulic loading rate q using a simplified first order kinetic equation expressed in eq 11 52 11 ln c i ka q ln c e as expressed in eq 11 the areal rate constant ka md 1 of pollutants were obtained by correlating or fitting of the influent and effluent concentrations of tss cod total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorous tp and orthophosphate po4 3 the y intercept value is used to determine the areal rate constant 2 7 wastewater sampling and analyses wastewater samples were collected three times per month from the inlet middle point and outlet of the series connected two stage hssfcw cell for one year using pre cleaned ethylene polyvinyl bottles and transported to the laboratory for immediate analysis on site wastewater parameters such as ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a handheld intellicaltm ph temperature digital probe hach hd30d flexi loveland usa and do meter ysi 550a yellow springs oh usa respectively whereas the off site parameters such as tss cod tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 were measured using the oven dry method reactor digestion method persulfate digestion method nessler method molybdovanadate with acid persulfate digestion method and phosver 3 method respectively according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 54 2 8 data analysis the data obtained from the study were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical data analysis using microsoft excel 2013 and originpro2017 the results were expressed in terms of mean and standard deviation values results were presented using graphs and tables 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of two stage pilot scale hssfcw system the post treatment performance of a series connected two stage hssfcw integrated with the existing uasb reactor for the treatment of brewery wastewater was monitored over a year table 1 reports the average value and standard deviation of each of the main brewery pollutants studied for the two stage hssfcw post treated effluent of the uasb reactor as shown in fig 3 a and b the uasb effluent tss and cod concentrations entering into the two stage hssfcw system were varied from 123 7 to 274 4 mgl 1 and 207 3 to 614 mgl 1 respectively after polishing with cw cell 1 cw1 both tss and cod concentrations were fluctuated from 31 3 to 116 4 mgl 1 and 30 3 to 199 mgl 1 respectively with corresponding average removal efficiencies of 68 5 57 6 to 83 for tss and 74 2 67 6 to 85 4 for cod further polishing with the cw cell 2 cw2 showed high quality effluent tss and cod concentrations which varied from 5 3 to 50 5 mgl 1 and 7 4 to 64 1 mgl 1 respectively with corresponding average removal efficiencies of 66 6 56 6 to 83 1 for tss and 69 8 61 6 to 78 2 for cod however enhanced tss and cod removal efficiencies of 89 81 6 to 97 1 for tss and 92 89 6 to 96 4 for cod were achieved throughout the study periods by the complete system cw1 cw2 table 1 fig 3 a and b carballeira et al 55 reported that macrophytes have an important role in tss and cod removals similarly the two macrophytes used in this study contributed favorable tss and cod removals across the stages however better and almost steadier reductions were achieved by the complete system macrophytes root mat enhances more solid particles adhering biodegradation and consumption of organic matters via attached anaerobic aerobic microorganisms 56 57 moreover macrophytes root oxygen transfer potential has a positive effect on pollutant removal in a cw system 58 and provides sufficient do for heterotrophic aerobic microorganisms metabolic activity that reduces organic matter through biodegradation 59 the key factors contributing to the reduction of suspended solids and organic matter in the system are the retention of suspended solids within the filter beds and the biodegradation of organic matter by heterotrophic bacteria adhered to the media 52 treatment efficiency comparison of the complete system was mostly performed with a single stage hssfcw system due to a lack of available research data de sousa et al 60 examined the efficiency of a juncus spp planted hssfcw system for polishing uasb reactor sewage wastewater and reported 70 to 71 tss and 79 to 86 cod removals at hrt of 10 days another study by von sperling 61 also obtained improved tss and cod removal of 87 8 and 84 5 respectively using a t latifolia planted hssfcw system integrated with a uasb reactor for the treatment of sewage wastewater in general treatment of uasb reactor brewery effluent using a two stage hssfcw system planted with c aternifolius and t latifolia showed promising removal of tss and cod concentrations these marked removal efficiencies may be associated with the concerted action of combined macrophytes through adhering more solid particles biodegradation of organic matter via the action of anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms located close to the rhizosphere of the macrophytes and in the pores of the substrate 13 56 62 post treatment using the two stage hssfcw system also showed promising removal efficiencies for total nitrogen and ammonium across the cells the tn and nh4 n concentrations of the uasb effluent showed significant fluctuations ranged from 25 to 101 4 mgl 1 and 17 3 to 74 8 mgl 1 respectively but the polishing of these pollutants by the cw1 cell was able to reduce over 50 of the initial tn and nh4 n concentrations to the range of 11 to 51 5 mgl 1 and 2 9 to 28 3 mgl 1 respectively fig 3 c and d the corresponding average removal efficiencies of 55 7 49 2 to 61 6 for tn and 65 5 58 8 to 83 3 for nh4 n were also obtained further treatment with cw2 cell drastically decreased the cw1 effluent tn and nh4 n concentrations by two fold and three fold to the range of 2 8 to 21 mgl 1 and 0 7 to 9 1 mgl 1 respectively with corresponding average removal efficiency of 63 2 57 4 to 74 5 and 77 6 73 5 to 84 respectively the combined system cw1 cw2 achieved improved tn and nh4 n removal efficiencies of 83 6 79 3 to 88 8 and 92 9 89 5 to 96 3 respectively table 1 fig 3 c and d another study also showed that c alternifolius based treatment of aerobic palm oil mill effluent at 11 days hrt removed 92 nh4 n 13 leto et al 43 also indicated that c alternifolius based treatment of domestic wastewater removed 65 2 of tn and 66 7 of nh4 n in this study cw1 planted with c alternifolius increased tn and nh4 n removals might due to the relatively high do concentration which is also in agreement with the findings of la bella et al 62 who observed the vital role of c alternifolius in liable oxygen transport and enables better nitrification moreover previous study result showed that c alternifolius has a larger root mass deeper root growth and higher aboveground biomass and good nitrogen absorption ability more than other macrophytes 59 on the other hand a study showed removal efficiency of 74 8 tn and 88 5 nh4 n for a hssfcw cell planted with t latifolia during the polishing of an anaerobic baffled reactor treated domestic wastewater 63 many research findings showed that t latifolia planted bed favors more denitrification process 62 64 due to its short root growth 42 enhanced removal of nitrogen and its species is mainly dependent on the good oxygen delivery capacity of macrophytes 65 and nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria present in a wetland cell 66 in this study the enhanced total nitrogen and ammonia removal efficiencies achieved by the complete system may be due to the concerted action of the combined macrophytes through physicochemical and biological processes which is in agreement with zhu et al 67 who suggested that two stage cw would provide better nitrogen removal nitrogen removal is achieved through plant uptake adsorption volatilizations and microbial activities 32 overall the present study results were comparable with the findings of da motta marques et al 68 who reported 90 4 tn and 95 nh4 n removal efficiencies at 1 5 days hrt for hssfcw cell planted with z bonorriensis and t subalata during the polishing of the uasb reactor treated municipal wastewater as well as cheng et al 69 who also reported 96 3 of nh4 n removal efficiency using a two stage hssfcw system planted with p australis and p stratiotes macrophytes during polishing of the uasb reactor treated mixture of sewage and swine wastewater at hrt of 13 5 days analogously the two stage hssfcw system showed promising removal efficiencies for phosphorus rich uasb effluent treatment in this study fig 3 e and f present the uasb effluent tp and po4 3 concentrations ranging from 17 9 to 42 9 mgl 1 and 10 2 to 32 9 mgl 1 respectively after polishing this phosphorus rich effluent with a two stage hssfcw system significant reduction in tp concentration was observed in cw1 and cw2 with a range of 10 5 to 30 mgl 1 and 2 5 to 16 3 mgl 1respectively with a corresponding average removal efficiency of 41 1 30 1 to 51 6 and 57 7 25 to 80 2 table 1 fig 3 e and f similarly the po4 3 concentration at the outlet of cw1 varied from 5 6 to 19 4 mgl 1 with a corresponding average removal efficiency of 48 1 34 4 to 60 7 and further polishing with cw2 reduced to the range of 1 4 to 9 3 mgl 1 with a corresponding average removal efficiency of 62 6 36 6 to 80 tp and po4 3 concentrations ranged from 2 5 to 42 9 mgl 1 and 1 4 to 32 9 mgl 1 with average removal efficiencies of 74 4 54 8 to 89 8 and 79 5 58 5 to 90 3 respectively were achieved by the complete system cw1 cw2 table 1 fig 3 e and f this phytoremediation process showed promising tp and po4 3 removal efficiencies which meet the national eepa discharge standard limit values however after august there were fluctuations of these values probably due to the saturation of clay media active sites which decreases the absorption abilities 14 phosphorous removal in a cw system is dependent on the type of media and macrophytes used these wetland components play a significant role in its removal via media absorption microbial biodegradation as well as plant uptake 7 likewise ciria et al 14 reviewed that the clay media was the main phosphorous sink and increased its removal efficiency by 36 through adsorption whereas the presence of macrophytes contributed over 60 of phosphorus removal 70 wijaya et al 59 and xu et al 65 were also observed good phosphorous uptake abilities of c alternifolius and t latifolia de sousa et al 60 reported 90 tp removal using a juncus sp planted hssfcw cell during polishing of anaerobic reactor treated sewage wastewater at hrt of 10 days the present study result was lower than da motta marques et al 68 finding who reported 93 3 of phosphorous removal at 1 5 days hrt using a z bonorriensis and t subalata planted hssfcw cells during polishing of uasb reactor treated municipal wastewater and higher than cheng et al 69 who reported 75 1 tp removal using a p australis and p stratiotes planted two stage hssfcw system during polishing of the uasb reactor treated mixture of sewage and swine wastewater at hrt of 13 5 days 3 2 treatment plant effluent water quality index the ethiopian environmental protection authority eepa 49 guideline was used as standard values for temperature ph tss cod tn nh4 n and tp table 1 to calculate the wqi of both the uasb reactor and the two stage hssfcw system accordingly the wqi of a uasb reactor effluent was varied from 91 6 to 92 9 but further treatment with a two stage hssfcw system improved its wqi to the range of 95 8 to 100 fig 4 according to the canadian water quality guidelines water quality classification indices indicated that the excellent wqi rating varied between 95 wqi 100 good 80 wqi 94 fair 65 wqi 79 marginal 45 wqi 64 poor 0 wqi 44 51 comparing to these ratings the present study wqi of the uasb reactor effluent is classified into a good water quality class while the two stage hssfcw effluent is classified into an excellent water quality class this implies that post treatment of anaerobically treated brewery effluents with a series connected two stage hssfcw system is promising for the enhancement of the quality of brewery effluents for reuse in addition the greater wqi value of the two stage hssfcw effluent also indicates that it is suitable for sustained discharge without impairing the aquatic ecosystem similarly marine 71 recommended that the water quality ranked under excellent with values varied from 95 to 100 does not cause any environmental threat or impairment whereas the good quality category ranged from 80 to 94 causes some degree of environmental threat or impairment as indicated in table 1 the uasb reactor effluent pollutants such as tss cod tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 concentrations exceeded the national discharge standard limits and hence disposal of these pollutants into the receiving water bodies may cause water body s deterioration however its subsequent further treatment with the two stage hssfcw system gave lower average pollutant concentrations that meet the national discharge standard limits may be due to a wide range of physical chemical and biological processes such as sedimentation filtration precipitation adsorption plant uptake and microbial degradation and consumption 20 56 57 in agreement with the present study very few studies monitored wastewater treatment plants water quality indices and reported that out of 22 treatment plants one treatment plant effluent quality is classified in the excellent water class twelve treatment plants effluent classified in the good quality class three treatment plants showed a poor water quality class three treatment plants under a very poor quality class and the last three treatment plant effluents were classified in the unsuitable for intended use class 72 3 3 oxygen transfer rate otr in the two stage hssfcw system convective air diffusion is used to transport oxygen from the atmosphere to the filter bed the otr is critical to know the amount of available oxygen concentration for efficient oxidation of organic matter nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen in the cw 52 fig 5 shows that the increased otr is more pronounced for the cw1 which varied from 11 9 to 29 8 g 2d 1 while in the cw2 otr value was varied from 1 6 to 10 8 g 2d 1 the calculated otr values significantly varied between the stages p 0 05 which may be due to a gradual decrease in the loading rate and the macrophytes aeration ability variation the higher otr value in the cw1 mainly used for the degradation of organic matter and biological nitrification similarly la bella et al 62 reported the vital role of c alternifolius in liable oxygen transport and enables better nitrification due to its larger root mass deeper root growth and higher aboveground biomass 59 whereas the lower otr values in the cw2 may predominate the denitrification process many research reports indicated that t latifolia planted cell favors more denitrification process 62 64 due to its short root growth 42 higher oxygen secretion by macrophytes has a positive effect on pollutant removal in the cw system 58 and provides better do for heterotrophic aerobic microorganism metabolic activity that reduces organic matter through degradation 59 llorÃ©ns et al 52 also reported that the increase in do concentration enhances the activity of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria and therefore the organic matter oxidation the hydrolysis of organic nitrogen compounds and the nitrification processes were improved the total otr value of 23 5 g 2d 1 obtained in this study for the complete system is considerably lower than llorÃ©ns et al 52 reported total otr value of 54 69 g 2d 1 with the four series connected horizontal filter beds whereas it is nearly comparable to the recommended otr value of 30 g 2d 1 used for design criteria for organic matter total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen removals in cw 26 53 3 4 estimation of area based kinetic rate constants for measured brewery pollutants a first order kinetic model was used to study the removal kinetics ka of main brewery pollutants across the two stage hssfcw system the calculated ka values for tss cod tn nh4 n tp and po4 3 removal along the series connected two stage of hssfcw treatment system as well as the complete system are presented in table 2 as indicated in table 2 the ka values vary across the stages which may be due to process variations which may arise from the effect of macrophytes research findings also show that the pollutant removal mechanisms in cw systems are different due to the diversity of kinetics expressed in removal rates 73 74 in the cw1 cw2 the cod kinetic constant was 0 26 md 1 which was higher than trang et al 75 reported cod removal rate constant which varied from 0 06 to 0 082 md 1 this higher ka value obtained in a complete treatment system provides the highest removal of organic matter table 1 however in this study tss areal rate constant indicated in table 2 was found in the reported tss removal rate constant range of 0 085 0 315 md 1 75 the tn removal rate constant found in this study was higher than the area based removal rate constant range of 0 014 0 066 md 1 estimated by trang et al 75 along the length of the constructed wetland starting from the inlet to the outlet similarly the evaluation of the 136 free water surface wetlands and 123 hssfcw systems showed an area based removal rate constant of 0 034 and 0 023 md 1 for tn respectively 28 in addition the present tn areal rate constant is higher than the rate constants reported by cui et al 30 varied from 0 007 to 0 1 md 1 in the hssfcw and konnerup et al 76 estimated ka value which varied from 0 008 to 0 016 md 1 in tropical ssfcw system the higher ka of tn found in this study compared to these authors reported values may be due to ammonification nitrification and denitrification which provide better removal in a cw system concerning tp a higher tp removal rate constant varied from 0 11 to 0 23 md 1 was reported from the evaluation of the 136 free water surface wetlands and 123 hssfcw systems 28 however in this study ka of tp was higher than the ka of 0 005 0 014 md 1 reported by konnerup et al 76 and 0 037 md 1 reported by kantawanichkul et al 26 another study result reported by kadlec 28 indicated that the computation of the ka rate for tp in 282 free surface flow constructed wetlands and 82 hssfcw systems revealed 0 027 md 1 and 0 016 md 1 respectively the main tp removal process in the cw cells may be attributed to media adsorption or precipitation as well as both macrophyte and microbial uptakes 7 higher ka values indicate a more efficient removal and sufficient wastewater treatment is accomplished 4 the model s goodness of fit for the entire treatment system cw1 cw2 was good for cod tn and nh4 n with r2 values 0 85 table 2 whereas a decreased fit was found for tp and po4 3 with r2 values shown in table 2 4 conclusion in this study the implementation of an environmentally friendly two stage pilot scale hssfcw post treatment technology showed a promising result with substantial decreases in pollutant concentrations and higher removal efficiencies this study s otr value was comparable to the recommended otr value of 30 g 2d 1 used for cw design criteria which is directly related to the high removal of organic matter nitrogen and ammonium in the two stage hssfcw system the plug flow model was used to describe the behavior of the influent and effluent concentrations and appropriate fits were achieved for all pollutants except phosphorous and orthophosphate across the stages and complete system the areal rate constant ka obtained in this study is also significantly higher than those stated in the literature suggesting more efficient removal and the final effluent meets the national discharge standard limits except phosphorous which was exceeded at the end of the experimental period and requires additional treatment the treatment plant effluent wqi result also indicated that the uasb reactor effluent was categorized into a good quality class but further treatment with the two stage hssfcw system improved its status and categorized into an excellent water quality class as a result the anaerobic two stage hssfcw integrated treatment system can be used as an alternative and effective option for brewery wastewater
