18225,in the aftermath of the lead contamination crisis that plagued the water system in flint mi more than 35 000 water samples were collected from the city s premises the majority of these samples 85 were collected through a voluntary crowdsourced sampling campaign the samples were analyzed for lead and copper concentrations by the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq in this study the crowdsourced sampling data was analyzed by means of spatial autocorrelation analysis to reveal the locations of statistically significant hotspot regions of high water lead levels wlls and to track the spatiotemporal evolution of wlls as the system recovered from lead contamination the results showed that hotspot regions that experienced high wlls were consistent with the areas where lead service line lsl density was the highest additionally galvanized service lines and other lead containing plumbing components could have also contributed to lead release in hotspot regions the temporal trend exhibited by the crowdsourced sampling data did not reflect a consistent decrease in wlls despite the interventions implemented by mdeq and epa instead sampled wlls remained high for several months after boosting the orthophosphate dose and launching a city wide residential flushing campaign the findings of this study suggest that this could be partially attributed to disproportionate sampling from premises in hotspot regions of high wlls and lsl density keywords flint water crisis lead contamination spatial analysis hotspots lead service lines citizen science 1 introduction well into the 21st century water systems across north america and europe still struggle to supply safe drinking water to the rapidly growing urban population in the face of tight fiscal resources aging infrastructure systems and tainted water sources hering et al 2013 local communities throughout the us have been plagued by impaired drinking water quality as evidenced by widespread violations of the safe drinking water act sdwa standards allaire et al 2018 in 2015 nearly one in every four people in the us was served by a community water system that violated one or more of the sdwa rules fedinick et al 2017 approximately 15 of these violations were reported for breaching health based standards such as exceeding the permissible levels or not applying the necessary treatment while the rest included failing to either monitor the water for regulated contaminants or report contamination to state authorities and or notify the public fedinick et al 2017 waterborne contamination episodes that occurred in the us in recent years have taken a toll on public perception of the safety of drinking water as revealed by recent national polls firth et al 2016 mccarthy 2017 at the heart of these contamination episodes lead contamination crises that took place in washington dc in 2001 edwards et al 2009 edwards and dudi 2004 and more recently in flint mi in 2014 hanna attisha et al 2016 drew significant public attention to the dire public health consequences of drinking water lead contamination lead is a toxic heavy metal that is known to pose a multitude of health hazards the most prominent health implication of lead exposure is impairing the cognitive and intellectual functions in fetuses and young children jusko et al 2008 lanphear et al 2002 the primary source for water lead contamination is typically lead service lines lsls which are lead pipes that connect household plumbing to utility owned water mains del toral et al 2013 sandvig et al 2008 approximately 6 1 million lsls are estimated to be currently in use in the us cornwell et al 2016 and the epa estimates that around 6 5 to 10 million homes have service lines that are at least partially made of lead epa 2016a additionally other lead bearing plumbing components including brass fixtures and faucets leaded solder at pipe connections and galvanized service lines gsls can also release lead to drinking water riblet et al 2019 triantafyllidou and edwards 2012 a variety of factors are known to influence lead release from lsls and lead bearing plumbing components including water chemistry conditions type of deposited lead scales water use profiles and seasonal variables abokifa and biswas 2017 masters et al 2016a xie and giammar 2011 all of the aforementioned lead contamination episodes share a common scenario water supply source and or water treatment operations were altered without sufficient planning leading to unforeseen changes in the water chemistry that resulted in excessive release of lead from existing lsls and lead bearing plumbing components liu et al 2017 pieper et al 2018 roy and edwards 2019 the events that led up to the water contamination crisis in flint mi are now well documented flint water advisory task force 2016 masten et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 on april 25 2014 flint s water source was switched from lake huron to flint river and corrosion control treatment was discontinued in the wake of this switch a cascade of water quality issues was triggered in the city s drinking water which was not limited to widespread lead contamination but also included disappearance of chlorine residuals high levels of disinfection byproducts and detection of fecal coliform bacteria and legionella rhoads et al 2017 schwake et al 2016 zahran et al 2018 a sharp increase in the number of children with elevated blood lead levels blls was observed during the contamination episode gómez et al 2018 hanna attisha et al 2016 routine bio solids monitoring revealed a 14 increase in lead mass during the contamination episode compared to pre crisis levels roy et al 2019 most of this increase took place from july to september 2014 which coincided with the period during which the percentage of flint children under 6 years with blls above 5 μg dl almost doubled roy et al 2019 in late 2015 the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq and the us environmental protection agency epa initiated a set of interventions in response to the contamination crisis on october 16 2015 flint switched back to detroit water and sewerage department dwsd water supply with orthophosphate op corrosion control treatment on december 9 2015 the dosage of op was boosted to 3 7 3 9 mg l from the original dose of 1 2 mg l normally added to dwsd water pieper et al 2018 during the period from may 1 15 2016 a flushing campaign was launched in flint flush for flint in which residents were encouraged to flush their plumbing systems at no additional cost to help accelerate the recovery and clean the system by removing lead bearing scales epa 2016b a campaign for replacing lsls and gsls fast start started in march 2016 through which more than 9400 service lines sls were replaced as of november 2019 city of flint 2016 the bulk of these replacements took place in 2017 and 2018 following flint s switch back to dwsd multiple water sampling campaigns were launched with the aim of understanding wll trends and assessing the effect of the implemented corrective measures on the recovery of the water system the virginia tech vt flint water research team led a city wide citizen science water sampling study that spanned the two year period from august 2015 to 2017 pieper et al 2018 the results showed that wlls in sampled premises consistently declined with time in response to the implemented interventions and that wlls varied by sl material in 2016 the epa conducted multiple rounds of sequential profile sampling to identify the primary sources of lead and to evaluate the effectiveness of corrosion control treatment and lsl removal on the wlls lytle et al 2019 the results suggested that gsls and brass fittings fixtures contributed to lead release especially in premises where lsls were not present in addition to the aforementioned sampling efforts mdeq lunched a major sampling campaign after switching back to dwsd in which over 35 000 water samples were collected from flint s premises state of michigan 2016 the majority of these samples 85 were obtained via voluntary crowdsourced sampling whereby homeowners acquired free testing kits and collected samples from their taps goovaerts 2017a the remaining samples were collected through a sentinel sampling program under the supervision of the mdeq to track changes in lead concentrations at specific sites all samples collected under both the crowdsourced and the sentinel sampling programs were tested for lead and copper concentrations by mdeq and the results were posted online on a periodic basis given the timely nature of the lead contamination crisis recent studies aimed to explore the results of this sampling campaign using a variety of statistical geostatistical analysis methods abernethy et al 2016 goovaerts 2019 2018 2017a 2017b goovaerts used the sampling data to model the temporal trends of wlls goovaerts 2017a and to examine the sampling bias between sentinel and crowdsourced samples goovaerts 2017b these studies concluded that samples collected through the sentinel program exceeded the lead and copper rule lcr action level al of 15 μg l at a lower rate than samples collected through the crowdsourced sampling program goovaerts 2017a and that crowdsourced samples better captured the main characteristics of flint houses i e construction year and presence of lsls than state controlled sampling goovaerts 2017b more recently the data was used to develop multivariate geostatistical models for predicting wlls in the premises of flint goovaerts 2019 2018 in addition abernethy et al 2016 and chojnacki et al 2017 developed an ensemble of predictive data driven models to assess the potential of lead contamination in flint homes based on sampling results census data and housing characteristics these studies concluded that the geographic location of sampled premises is one of the most important predictive features for the potential of exceeding 15 μg l which could indicate the presence of problematic hotspots within which local premises were affected by lead contamination more than other areas building upon the aforementioned studies this work aims to examine the spatiotemporal trends exhibited by wlls measured through the crowdsourced sampling program the objectives of this study are to 1 test whether wlls sampled from the premises of flint exhibited a unique i e non random spatial pattern 2 reveal the locations of hotspot and coldspot regions that experienced significantly higher and lower wlls than the rest of the city 3 track the spatiotemporal evolution of wlls after flint switched back to dwsd water supply and assess the influence of the implemented interventions and 4 examine the relationship between the spatial patterns exhibited by the wlls and the spatial distribution of lsls revealing such spatial patterns particularly hotspots of high wlls can help delineate the regions that were affected the most by the lead contamination crisis examining the local housing characteristics particularly the spatial distribution of lsls within these hotspots can help us better understand the primary indicators for lead contamination in addition by inspecting the temporal evolution of these hotspots the spatiotemporal trends of recovery in response to the implemented interventions can be better understood 2 data and methods this section provides a description of the datasets used in the analysis which is followed by an explanation of the spatial analysis conducted to reveal spatial patterns in the wlls spatial autocorrelation analysis saa based on the global and local indices of moran s i anselin 1995 moran 1950 was implemented to reveal the locations of hotspot and coldspot premises that experienced statistically significantly higher and lower wlls than the rest of the city respectively the temporal evolution of spatial wll patterns and the role of spatial density of lsls in driving spatial wll patterns were also examined 2 1 datasets three datasets were used in the analysis namely the residential sampling data the sl data and the housing characteristics data the mdeq made the sampling results available online in the form of spreadsheet files xlsx containing the street addresses of sampled premises wll measurements and sample collection dates state of michigan 2016 the sl data was made available to the authors by request from the gis center at the university of michigan flint um flint in the form of digital maps containing the type of sl for each land parcel the housing data is available on arcgis online by the department of housing and urban development in the form of gis maps containing information about ownership land use taxpayer data and vacancy status for each land parcel arcgis online 2015 2 1 1 crowdsourced sampling data in this study the dataset of crowdsourced samples was used in the analysis crowdsourced samples were collected at a much finer spatial and temporal resolution than sentinel samples and can hence better capture the complex geographical patterns exhibited by the wlls as demonstrated by previous studies goovaerts 2017a 2017b nevertheless it is worth noting that crowdsourced samples were voluntarily collected by homeowners who did not necessarily undergo formal training and thus may lack proper control over sampling procedure compared to sentinel samples an elaborate discussion on the heterogeneity between both sampling datasets can be found elsewhere goovaerts 2017a 2017b a summary of the sampling instructions is provided in the supporting information section s 1 and a detailed description can be found in goovaerts 2017a the crowdsourced sampling dataset comprised a total of 30 758 first draw wll measurements that were collected from the premises of flint over the period from 9 3 2015 to 12 19 2017 subsequent samples were significantly sparser both spatially and temporally and were hence not included in the analysis to avoid biasing the spatiotemporal trends only 1 337 samples were collected in 2018 the minimum reporting level mrl for lead concentrations was 1 μg l and samples with a non detectable lead concentration were given a numeric wll of 0 μg l to facilitate the analysis preprocessing of the sampling data included the following 1 all samples were geocoded by converting street addresses to geographic coordinates using google s geocoding api the api successfully geocoded 29 939 samples despite the fact that many samples had poorly formatted or misspelled addresses 2 samples that had a missing address 495 samples or failed to geocode because of invalid incomplete address 324 samples those collected outside the city boundaries 1 293 samples and samples collected before the city switched back to dwsd on 10 16 2015 252 samples were discarded from the dataset the filtered sampling dataset used in the analysis contained 28 394 geocoded samples 3 each water sample was then assigned to the individual land parcel whose address matched its geocoded address for approximately 19 of the samples matching the addresses was not successful mainly due to inconsistencies in address format between sampling and parcel datasets samples whose addresses could not be directly matched were assigned to the land parcel whose centroid was closest to their geocoded coordinates using a 2 d euclidean distance metric by matching the land parcels in the sl data with the housing data in flint sampled premises were found to be primarily residential premises 84 in addition to smaller fractions of public 8 and commercial 6 premises 2 1 2 service line data two gis maps of flint sls were provided by the gis center at um flint containing information about the sl for each land parcel in flint the first map comprised the city s original sl records from the 1980s while the second map was an updated version reflecting any locations that had been visually verified and or that may had been replaced as of november 2016 the updated map was used in the analysis herein and the dataset included the type e g copper lead plastic zinc etc and the source either city records or field verification of the sl for each of the 56 038 land parcels in flint the dataset comprised a total of 4 100 sls that had either a full or a partial lsl e g lead copper lead galvanized lead plastic etc it is worth acknowledging here that goovaerts 2017c indicated that the city records on the composition of sls has an over estimated percentage of lsls most likely due to failure to update the records as the lsls were being replaced with copper pipes nevertheless excavations done during the first phase of the fast start sl replacement program suggested that the actual number of lsls in flint is likely larger than what is shown in the sls map abernethy et al 2018 surprisingly 96 of the excavations revealed the presence of lead in the public portion of the sl abernethy et al 2018 which was significantly different from the city records that indicated that only 40 of the sls would contain lead in either portion of the sl abernethy et al 2018 furthermore the gis map comprises more than 13 000 records of unknown sl material and these records were found to contain a non negligible fraction of unidentified lsls goovaerts 2017a 2 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis of water lead levels to reveal the spatial patterns in the wlls the proposed approach involves two main stages first global saa based on the global index of moran s i moran 1950 was applied to indicate whether wlls are spatially clustered i e neighboring premises have similarly high or low wlls or dispersed i e neighboring premises have dissimilar wlls at the city scale upon verifying the nature and statistical significance of the city wide spatial patterns in the wlls the local index of moran s i anselin 1995 was used to reveal the locations and statistical significance of local hotspot coldspot premises of high low wlls 2 2 1 global moran s i to reveal whether the sampled wlls exhibit spatial autocorrelation the global index of moran s i was calculated as goodchild 1986 1 i n w i 1 n j 1 n w i j l i l l j l i 1 n l i l 2 where n is the number of sampled premises l i and l j are the wlls sampled from premises i and j respectively l is the mean wll across all sampled premises w i j is the pairwise spatial weight that represents the spatial relationship between the wlls sampled from premises i and j and w is the sum of all the pairwise spatial weights w i 1 n j 1 n w i j in order to validate that the observed spatial pattern deviates from spatial randomness i e that the wlls are not randomly scattered across all premises with no unique spatial pattern the value of the global i was standardized by calculating a corresponding z score as z i e i s i where e i and s i are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of i values representing spatial randomness a z score close to zero indicates that the spatial pattern exhibited by the wlls is insignificant since the observed value of i is very close to the expected value under spatial randomness in contrast for cases where the absolute value of the z score is far from zero wlls are believed to exhibit a unique pattern and the larger the magnitude of z the more significant the spatial pattern positive autocorrelation z 0 indicates clustering whereby neighboring premises have similar wlls while negative autocorrelation z 0 indicates dispersion that arises when neighboring premises have dissimilar wlls to calculate e i and s i the reference distribution representing spatial randomness needs to be known to avoid making any assumptions on the distribution e g the commonly used normal distribution assumption e i and s i were calculated by means of a non parametric permutation based approach whereby the l i values were randomly shuffled across all premises for a number of permutations 999 in this study and the global i value was recomputed for each permutation 2 2 2 local moran s i to identify the locations of the hotspot coldspot premises with high low wlls the local moran s index i i was calculated for each sampled premise as anselin 1995 2 i i l i l s 2 j 1 j i n w i j l j l where s 2 is the variance of the wll across all sampled premises the value of the local i i can range anywhere from 1 1 the local i i of each individual premise indicates whether the wll sampled in the premise is positively correlated i i 0 negatively correlated i i 0 or not correlated i i 0 with the measured wlls in neighboring premises premises with i i 0 are part of a spatial cluster of neighboring premises that have similar wlls having identified the premises that belong to spatial clusters i i 0 the wlls in each of these premises l i and its spatial lag s l i which is the weighted average of the wlls in neighboring premises s l i j 1 j i n w i j l j were compared to the mean wll across all sampled premises l accordingly each premise with i i 0 was classified into either a hotspot which is a premise with a high wll surrounded by neighboring premises with high wlls i e both l i and s l i are l or a coldspot which is the exact opposite on the other hand premises that have wlls different from their neighboring premises i e either a high wll premise in a low wll neighborhood or the exact opposite were considered spatial outliers i i 0 similar to the global index the statistical significance of the local i i for each sampled premise was tested by using a conditional permutation approach whereby the reference distribution of i i for each premise was generated by holding the l i value fixed and shuffling the values of l j across the rest of the premises for a number of permutations a p value was then computed for each premise as p i m 1 k 1 where k is the number of random permutations k 999 in this study and m is the number of instances from the generated reference distribution that are greater in magnitude than the observed i i index the smaller the value of p i the higher the statistical significance of the observed spatial pattern the p values were corrected for multiple comparisons by means of the false discovery rate fdr method of benjamini and hochberg 1995 and a significance level of 0 05 was considered 2 2 3 spatial weights a crucial component of the saa is the pairwise spatial weights w i j since neighboring premises are more likely to have similar characteristics e g premise age type of the sl etc they are expected to experience similar wlls spatial weights aim to capture the intensity of such spatial relationship between wlls recorded at neighboring premises the procedure for determining spatial weights proceeded as follows first pairwise euclidian distances were calculated between the centroids of each pair of sampled premises r i j neighboring premises were determined based on a selected threshold distance whereby any given pair of sampled premises whose r i j r t were considered neighbors for neighboring premises the pairwise weight w i j was computed as w i j r t r i j while the spatial weight between non neighboring premises i e for r i j r t was set to zero finally the spatial weights were row standardized so that the spatial weights for each premise sum up to unity fig s 1 in the supporting information si shows that the number of islands i e premises with zero neighbors consistently decreases as the selected threshold distance increases up to 500 m beyond which increasing the threshold distance does not further decrease the number of islands hence a threshold distance of 500 m was used in this study 2 2 4 data preparation for spatial analysis samples were collected from 12 860 premises and around 4 500 premises were sampled more than once multiple samples collected from the same premise were averaged to generate a single representative wll for each premise to be used in the spatial analysis l i in addition a box cox transformation was applied to the wlls prior to conducting the saa in order to suppress the biasintroduced by excessively high wlls zhang et al 2008 a box cox lambda value of 0 594 was found to maximize the log likelihood function and was hence used herein 2 2 5 temporal evolution of spatial patterns in order to reveal the temporal trends exhibited by the hotspots and coldspots during the 26 5 months sampling period after switching back to dwsd the filtered sampling dataset 28 394 samples was divided into four sub periods and the saa was repeated on each of the four sub periods as described above the four sub periods were divided based on the sampling date sub period 1 oct 16 2015 feb 15 2016 sub period 2 feb 15 2016 may 15 2016 sub period 3 may 15 2016 jan 01 2017 and sub period 4 jan 01 2017 dec 20 2017 fig s 2 shows the monthly sampling frequency during the study period together with the start and end dates of each sub period these dates were selected to match the timeline of the interventions implemented by the mdeq epa to reduce lead release the start date of the first sub period oct 16 2015 marked the date on which flint switched back to dwsd with op to ensure that the first sub period comprised a representative number of samples the end date of the first sub period feb 15 2016 was selected to mark approximately 2 months after tripling of the op dose began dec 9 2015 the end date of the second sub period may 15 2016 marked the end of the flushing campaign flush for flint while the end date of the third sub period jan 1 2017 marked the beginning of the bulk of lsl and gsl replacements fast start given the fact that unequal number of samples were collected during each sub period it was important to ensure that the spatial distribution of sampled premises was consistent among the four sub periods i e that the samples collected during each sub period were spatially distributed across the different regions in the same manner as other sub periods fig s 3 shows that the ripley s k profiles ripley 1981 for each of the four sub periods are almost identical and hence the spatial distribution of the sampled premises is consistent despite the different number of samples collected during each of the four sub periods 2 3 spatial patterns of lead service line density as indicated by recent forensic and water sampling studies lytle et al 2019 olson et al 2017 destabilized leaded corrosion scales that were present in homes with lsls are believed to be the primary source of lead release during the lead contamination crisis in flint to test whether hotspots of elevated wlls are spatially correlated with regions of high spatial density of lsls we examined the spatial clustering in the distribution of lsls by repeating the global and local moran s i analyses eqs 1 and 2 for the spatial density of lsls this was done by replacing the wlls l i with the density of lsls around each sampled premise d i lsl density around each sampled premise was calculated as the fraction of homes that has a lsl within a specific radius from the sampled premise fig s 4 shows that the mean lsl density around all sampled premises increases as the selected radius increases up to 50 m beyond which the mean lsl density remains fairly constant hence a radius of 50 m was implemented for the calculation of the lsl density it is worth noting that this analysis aims to find premises located in neighborhoods with a high lsl density which is different from finding clusters of premises with lsls for instance a premise with no lsl cannot be part of the later but can still be part of the former this definition of the lsl density may result in overestimating the clustering due to artificial spatial autocorrelation from the overlapping radii despite this limitation lsl density still provided a simple means to overcome the aforementioned limitation of unidentified lsls in the sls map 2 4 code implementation codes developed to conduct the analysis were written in python 3 6 the spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted using the python spatial analysis library pysal other python libraries used for data analysis and visualization include scipy numpy statsmodels astropy pandas geopandas matplotlib seaborn and scikit learn 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary statistics table 1 lists summary statistics of wlls sampled during the 26 5 month period after switching back to dwsd it is important to note that the results reported herein are based on all sampled wlls 28 394 samples not the averaged box cox transformed values that were strictly used to conduct the spatial analysis as explained above approximately 49 of samples had detectable lead 13 876 samples and 8 exceeded 15 μg l 2 168 samples additionally twelve samples exceeded hazardous waste levels 5 000 μg l approximately 7 of sampled premises had a mean wll above 15 μg l 919 premises fig 1 shows the locations of all 12 860 sampled premises where red and grey markers represent premises with a mean wll above and below 15 μg l respectively 3 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis of water lead levels 3 2 1 global spatial autocorrelation analysis global moran s i analysis was first conducted to identify spatial patterns exhibited by wlls sampled during the entire sampling campaign the calculated global i was 0 12 which corresponded to a standardized z value of 57 fig s 5 shows that the global z dashed line is significantly more positive than the range of random permutations that represent spatial randomness the large positive z value indicated that sampled wlls were spatially clustered on a global scale i e neighboring premises have similar wlls with high statistical significance 3 2 2 revealing the locations of hotspots and coldspots as previously mentioned hotspot and coldspot premises were identified by comparing the mean wll measured in each premise l i and its spatial lag s l i with the mean wll sampled across all premises l fig s 6 shows a scatterplot between the mean wll for each premise and its spatial lag commonly known as the moran scatterplot hotspots red markers were identified as premises with a high wll surrounded by neighboring premises with high wlls while coldspots blue markers were identified as premises with low wlls surrounded by premises with low wlls approximately 16 of all sampled premises were labeled as hotspots 2 037 premises while coldspot premises comprised approximately 16 of all sampled premises 2 019 premises a smaller fraction of sampled premises were labeled as spatial outliers i i 0 which were either premises with a high wll surrounded by neighboring premises with low wlls 977 premises or the vice versa 816 premises the smaller fraction of spatial outliers compared to spatial clusters as revealed by local moran s i is consistent with the results of the global analysis showing that wlls were spatially clustered on a global scale the remaining 7 011 premises had a statistically insignificant spatial pattern i e fdr corrected p i 0 05 it is worth noting that the fdr corrections reduced the number of premises with a statistically significant pattern from 6 998 to 5 849 16 fig 2 a depicts the locations of hotspot red markers and coldspot blue markers premises on the map of flint hotspot and coldspot premises were found to exist in clusters of different shapes and sizes and were spread across flint s nine wards these spatial patterns could not be simply visualized from the distribution of the premises with mean wlls 15 μg l as depicted in fig 1 hence the use of a spatial clustering algorithm was deemed crucial for identifying such spatial patterns and more importantly for testing their statistical significance by zooming in on the hotspot and coldspot premises identified within ward 2 fig 2 b it can be seen that premises within the same ward had different classifications depending on their wlls and the statistical significance of their spatial correlation with their neighboring premises it is also worth mentioning that the locations of the hotspots of high wlls revealed by the saa approach implemented in this study visually matched to some extent the residential areas revealed by hanna attisha et al 2016 to have high blls in children younger than 5 years in their study hanna attisha et al 2016 used ordinary kriging to predict the surface of childhood blls during the lead contamination crisis the hotspot clusters of high wlls depicted in fig 2 particularly the ones between wards 2 5 and 6 and between wards 3 4 and 5 visually matched the areas predicted by hanna attisha et al 2016 to have high childhood blls in addition the locations of the coldspot clusters on the perimeters of flint were in agreement with the areas predicted by hanna attisha et al 2016 to have low blls 3 2 3 variation in wlls by sl material table 1 lists summary statistics of wlls sampled from the premises labeled as hotspots and coldspots based on saa of wlls for samples collected from hotspot premises the fraction of samples with detectable lead 84 and the fraction of samples that exceeded 15 μg l 16 were considerably higher than the corresponding values for all sampled premises 49 and 8 respectively conversely only 5 of the samples collected from coldspot premises had detectable lead and none of the 3 335 samples collected from coldspot premises exceeded 15 μg l approximately 16 of the hotspot premises had a known lsl 316 premises which is more than twice the fraction of all sampled premises with a known lsl 7 wlls sampled in hotspot premises that had a known lsl were higher than those that had other sl material mann whitney p 0 05 additionally 29 and 27 of the hotspot premises had a known gsl and copper sl respectively for hotspot premises with a known gsl the fraction of samples with detectable lead and with wll above 15 μg l were 85 and 16 respectively which were remarkably higher than the corresponding values for all sampled premises 49 and 8 respectively similarly 78 of samples collected from hotspot premises with a known copper sl had detectable lead and 16 of the samples exceeded 15 μg l which were also considerably higher than the corresponding values for all sampled premises taken together these results suggested that in addition to lsls gsls and other lead bearing plumbing components e g soldered joints and brass fitting fixtures may have also contributed to lead release from hotspot premises which is consistent with the findings of the epa profile sampling study lytle et al 2019 approximately 27 of the hotspot premises had an unknown sl material interestingly wlls sampled in these premises were not significantly different from those sampled in hotspot premises with a known lsl mann whitney p 0 05 or a known gsl mann whitney p 0 05 but were higher than wlls sampled in hotspot premises with a known copper sl mann whitney p 0 05 these results suggested the presence of unidentified lsls and gsls in the sl map as previously noted by goovaerts 2017a 3 2 4 disproportionate sampling from hotspots another interesting finding is the disproportionate sampling from hotspot premises of high wlls as can be seen from the results in table 1 the average number of samples collected from each of the hotspot premises of high wlls was 2 60 samples premise which was approximately 22 higher than the average number of samples collected from non hotspot premises 2 13 samples premise furthermore the average number of samples collected from coldspot premises was 1 65 samples premise which was 29 less than non coldspot premises 2 31 samples premise these findings support the results of recent studies which hypothesized that homeowners of high risk premises that have initially observed high wlls were more likely to repeat the sampling goovaerts 2017b in addition these findings shed light on the kind of sampling biases that can exist in data from crowdsourced sampling campaigns which decision makers need to correct for in order to accurately assess the water quality trends as discussed later in section 3 4 3 2 5 temporal evolution of hotspots and coldspots table 2 lists summary statistics of the samples collected during each of the four sampling sub periods together with the type of intervention being evaluated during each sub period i e ordinary op dosage high op dosage flushing and sl replacements wlls sampled in the second sub period were higher than those sampled in the first third and fourth sub periods pairwise mann whitney p 0 05 as can be seen from the results listed in table 2 the 90th percentile wll the fraction of samples with detectable lead and with wll above 15 μg l all increased from the first to the second sub period and then consistently decreased from the second to the fourth sub period these results implied that the wlls remained high for a few months after the tripling of the op dose in dec 2015 and then started to decline following the flushing campaign in may 2016 a detailed discussion of the observed temporal trends is left to section 3 4 fig s 7 shows the locations of the hotspot and coldspot premises revealed by saa of wlls measured during each of the four sub periods the locations of the hotspot and coldspot clusters for each of the four sub periods were generally consistent with those identified for the entire sampling period fig 2 a yet despite the higher wlls observed during the second sub period the size of the hotspot and coldspot clusters consistently shrank from sub period 1 through 4 table 2 lists the number of premises labeled as hotspots and coldspots together with the global moran s z calculated for each of the four sub periods a consistent decrease was observed in the strength of the spatial autocorrelation as evidenced by the decrease of the global z from 35 for sub period 1 to 7 for sub period 4 the decrease in the strength of the clustering was also reflected by the consistent decrease in the fraction of premises labeled as hotspots from approximately 11 for sub period 1 to approximately 1 for sub period 4 and the consistent decrease in the fraction of coldspot premises from approximately 13 to approximately 2 these results indicated that the sampled wlls across flint were becoming more homogenous and thus the degree of spatial autocorrelation gradually decreased which could be attributed to the fact that most of the sampled premises were experiencing similar wlls as the system recovered from the crisis and or because homeowners of low risk premises were less likely to repeat the sampling 3 3 spatial patterns of lead service line density 3 3 1 sampled premises with lsls fig s 8 depicts the locations of all 56 038 land parcels in the sls map where red markers represent the 4 100 premises with a known lsl either partial or full while grey markers represent premises with other sl materials copper galvanized unknown etc table 3 lists summary statistics of the wlls measured in sampled premises with a lsl approximately 7 of the sampled premises had a lsl 899 premises from which 2 376 samples approximately 8 of all samples were collected for samples collected from premises with a lsl the fraction of samples with detectable lead 70 and with a wll above 15 μg l 11 were higher than the corresponding values for all the sampled premises table 1 nevertheless wlls sampled in all sampled premises with a known lsl table 3 were significantly lower than those sampled in hotspot premises revealed by saa of the wlls table 1 mann whitney p 0 05 these results indicated that revealing hotspots of high wlls using the saa approach presented herein captured the regions that experienced high lead exposure better than simply relying on the presence absence of the lsl as the sole indicator of high lead release as explained in section 3 2 2 this could be attributed to the presence of unidentified lsls in the sl dataset and or the fact that gsls and other lead bearing plumbing components contributed to lead release during the contamination episode additionally lead release is dependent on water chemistry conditions which can vary from one region to another within the same system this variation is reflected in the spatial distribution of the wlls across the system which was captured by the saa 3 3 2 spatial clustering in lsl density to examine the spatial clustering in the distribution of the lsls both the global and local moran s i analyses were repeated for the spatial density of the lsls around each of the sampled premises the density of the lsls was found to be spatially clustered on a global scale with high statistical significance i 0 25 z 127 fig 3 a shows the locations of the hotspot and coldspot premises of high and low lsl density respectively the number of premises labeled as hotspots of high lsl density was 1 689 approximately 13 of sampled premises while the number of coldspot premises of low lsl density was 5 160 approximately 40 table 3 lists summary statistics of the wlls sampled from the premises labeled as hotspots and coldspots based on saa of the lsl density for samples collected from hotspot premises of high lsl density the fraction of samples with detectable lead 68 and with wlls above 15 μg l 11 were higher than those for all sampled premises table 1 conversely the fraction of samples with detectable lead 36 and with wlls above 15 μg l 5 for coldspot premises of low lsl density were lower than all sampled premises similar to the hotspots of high wlls a disproportionate number of samples was collected from hotspot premises of high lsl density and premises with lsls on average 2 64 samples were collected from each sampled premise with a knwon lsl which was approximately 22 higher than the corresponding fraction of samples collected from sampled premises without a lsl similarly 2 34 samples were collected from each hotspot premise of high lsl density which was 8 higher than the corresponding fraction of samples collected from non hotspot premises 3 3 3 relationship between spatial patterns of wlls and lsl density the locations of the hotspot and coldspot clusters identified based on the lsl density fig 3 a closely resembled those identified based on the wlls fig 2 a the number of premises labeled as hotspots for both high wll and high lsl density was 675 while those labeled as coldspots for both low wll and low lsl density was 1 711 furthermore a pearson s chi squared test of the contingency table of the labeled premises based on both wlls and lsl density revealed a strong association between both labels χ 2 4814 p 0 001 taken together these findings indicated that the density of lsls around premises labeled as hotspots of high wlls was significantly higher than the rest of the sampled premises while coldspot premises of low wlls were primarily located in neighborhoods with low lsl density although the wll at any premise does not depend on whether or not its neighbors have lsls the findings of this study suggested that the spatial patterns in lsl density were correlated with the spatial patterns exhibited by the wlls this implied that the density of lsls could be spatially associated with the distribution of other relevant housing characteristics e g plumbing age and materials affordability of renovations etc which could in turn indicate the presence of other lead bearing plumbing components overall these findings may have implications for the development of prediction models that aim to forecast wlls as a function of the characteristics of the premise previous studies relied on the presence absence of a lsl at the premise as a predictor of the wll abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 the findings of this study suggested that the density of the lsls in the close neighborhood of the sampled premise may also serve as a predictor of the wlls in such predictive models furthermore different prediction models can be fit to the data from hotspot and coldspot premises independently such spatial models would properly account for the influence of the local predictors within each cluster on the wlls and would hence provide a direct means for incorporating the geographic influence into the prediction models as suggested by abernethy et al 2016 3 4 spatiotemporal trends of recovery and impact of interventions fig 4 shows the monthly trends of the sampled wlls over the two year period after flint switched back to dwsd fig 4 a depicts the fraction of samples with a wll exceeding four different thresholds namely 15 50 100 and 500 μg l while fig 4 b displays the temporal trends exhibited by four different percentile wlls namely the 50th 70th 90th and 95th percentile wlls the temporal trends depicted in fig 4 demonstrate that wlls in the sampled premises did not immediately decline after flint switched back to dwsd instead wlls generally increased over the period from dec 2015 to may 2016 and then remained high throughout the summer of 2016 before starting to consistently decline from sep 2016 to jan 2017 the wlls increased again in 2017 below we break down this temporal trend to highlight the efficacy of the corrective measures implemented by mdeq and epa as well as the influence of sampling biases on the observed wlls 3 4 1 boosting the orthophosphate dose wlls appeared to increase following the tripling of the op dose in dec 2015 where wlls sampled in jan 2016 were significantly lower than may 2016 mann whitney p 0 05 the 90th percentile wll increased from 8 0 μg l in jan 2016 to 15 0 μg l in may 2016 and the fraction of samples above 15 μg l increased from 5 to 10 during the same period goovaerts 2017a explained the increase observed in the wlls after the 10th week from switching back to dwsd by the changes that were introduced to the sampling protocol where homeowners were instructed not to pre flush the sl before the 6 h stagnation period and to collect the samples at normal instead of low flow rates yet samples collected by the vt team in mar 2016 still showed relatively high wlls pieper et al 2018 where the 90th percentile wll of the first draw samples and the fraction of samples above 15 μg l were 22 4 μg l and 15 respectively furthermore sporadic spikes of high lead concentrations were observed in several of the sampled homes with phosphate concentrations as high as 9 1 mg l as po4 3 p pieper et al 2018 op dosing is generally effective in reducing the release of soluble lead by forming low solubility lead scales and thus creating a passive protective barrier to reduce lead dissolution edwards and mcneill 2002 however op dosing may accelerate galvanic corrosion of leaded solder joints and partially replaced lsls nguyen et al 2011 which may explain the increase in the wlls during the period from dec 2015 to may 2016 furthermore high op dosing may result in higher total lead concentrations in the short term due to the formation and transport of lead phosphate particles zhao et al 2018 hence the increase in the fraction of samples above 50 and 100 μg l from dec 2015 to may 2016 observed in fig 4 a may also be partially attributed to the temporary formation of lead particles following the tripling of the op dose 3 4 2 flushing the plumbing network surprisingly sampled wlls did not drop following the flushing campaign that took place in may 2016 instead wlls remained high through mid sep 2016 before starting to consistently drop furthermore wlls sampled in may 2016 were not significantly different from those sampled from mid august to mid september 2016 mann whitney p 0 05 as can be seen from fig 4 the monthly fraction of samples above 15 μg l and the 90th percentile wll remained above 9 and 14 μg l respectively throughout the period from may to sep 2016 in contrast similarly high wlls were not observed in the vt study where samples collected in jul 2016 had noticeably lower wlls than those collected in mar 2016 pieper et al 2018 furthermore since lead release from lead op scales have little temperature dependency masters et al 2016b the increase in the water temperature could not fully explain the high wlls observed in the summer of 2016 this was also evident in the results from routine biosolids monitoring where no correlation between lead in sewage biosolids and water temperature was observed roy et al 2019 nevertheless unlike the results of the vt repeat sampling study in which the same premises were sampled during each round the crowdsourced sampling data used in the analysis herein comprises sampling biases originating from the disproportionate sampling from hotspot premises as previously mentioned the results of this study suggested that the high wlls observed during the summer of 2016 could be partially attributed to the disproportionate sampling from hotspot premises that experienced high wlls and or those located in high lsl density neighborhoods fig 5 shows the monthly trends of the fraction of samples that were collected from hotspot premises of high wlls dashed red line and high lsl density solid blue line during the period from the may 2016 to oct 2016 the fraction of samples that were collected from hotspot premises of high wlls almost doubled from 17 to 31 similarly the fraction of samples collected from hotspot premises of high lsl density increased from 11 to 22 during the same period to control the bias introduced by disproportionate sampling from high risk premises fig 6 displays the wlls observed in high and low risk premises plotted independently high risk premises are defined as premises that were both hotspots of high wlls and high lsl density 675 premises 1 764 samples while low risk premises 9 809 premises 20 902 samples are ones that were neither hotspots of high wlls nor hotspots of high lsl density consistent with the trends seen for all samples fig 4 wlls in high risk premises increased from dec 2015 to may 2016 as can be seen in fig 6 a nevertheless unlike the trends observed for all samples wlls in high risk premises started to decline shortly after the flushing campaign where wlls sampled in sep 2016 were lower than those sampled in may 2016 mann whitney p 0 05 as can be seen in fig 6 a the fraction of samples from high risk premises that exceeded 15 μg l decreased from 26 in may 2016 to 12 in sep 2016 and then further declined to 5 in dec 2016 similarly wlls in low risk premises showed an overall decreasing trend throughout the period from may to december 2016 taken together the results suggested that the high wlls observed during summer 2016 could be partially explained by the disproportionate sampling from high risk premises after controlling this bias the results of the crowdsourced sampling campaign were consistent with the findings of the vt repeat sampling study the consistent decline in the wlls observed in the high risk premises from may to december 2016 suggested that the flushing campaign was effective in removing unstable lead corrosion scales furthermore peak wlls for high risk premises were observed in the samples collected from mid april to mid may with a notable contribution of particulate lead 13 and 6 of the samples were above 50 and 100 μg l respectively that can be attributed to the mobilization of lead scales during the flushing campaign 3 4 3 service line replacements following the consistent decline in the wlls that was observed after the flushing campaign the wlls appeared to increase again in 2017 as can be seen in fig 4 we hypothesize that this increase is attributed to the large scale lead and galvanized sl replacement campaign that was launched in march 2016 with the bulk of the replacements starting in early 2017 abernethy et al 2018 vibrations and other disturbances during lsl excavation may dislodge leaded scales and lead containing particulates brown and cornwell 2015 these lead containing scales may get trapped in the home plumbing and then subsequently released after lsl replacement as suggested by the epa profile sampling lytle et al 2019 this may explain the increase in particulate lead during the period from january to september 2017 fig 4 where the fraction of samples that exceeded 50 and 100 μg l increased from 1 1 and 0 6 respectively to 3 7 and 1 6 respectively to further clarify this trend fig s 9 shows the wlls sampled in one of the hotstpot premises where repeated sampling took place the depicted premise is a residential home with an unknown sl material forty samples were collected from this premise during the period from january 2016 to december 2017 sampled wlls were consistently below 100 μg l until a sudden spike of very high lead concentration took place in july 2017 3 82 mg l after which 6 more samples exceeded 100 μg l over the following three months with two samples exceeding 7 2 and 1 6 mg l respectively wlls sampled in the following months were generally below 15 μg l while knowledge regarding whether this specific premise received a sl replacement was not available its wll profile shows a sudden sharp increase in the release of lead particles which was indicative of the disturbances associated with lead galvanized sl replacements 4 conclusions in the wake of the lead contamination crisis that struck flint mi a large scale water sampling campaign took place in the city more than 35 000 water samples were collected from the premises of flint most of which were collected through a crowdsourced sampling effort the samples were analyzed for lead and copper concentrations by the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq and the results were routinely posted online in this study the crowdsourced sampling data was analyzed to reveal the locations of hotspot regions that experienced excessive lead release by means of spatial autocorrelation analysis saa based on the global and local indices of moran s i furthermore saa was used to track the spatiotemporal evolution of the water lead levels wlls as flint gradually recovered from the lead contamination crisis and to reveal the spatial patterns in the density of lead service lines lsls in the city the implemented saa approach revealed that the locations of hotspot regions of high wlls significantly matched those where the density of lsls was the highest furthermore the temporal trend exhibited by the crowdsourced samples did not show a consistent decline in the wlls which was found to be partially attributed to the disproportionate sampling from premises in the hotspot regions the results also asserted that homeowners of high risk premises were more likely to repeat the sampling as suggested by previous studies and thus highlighting the kind of biases that may exist in crowdsourced sampling data with the increasing interest in citizen science and crowdsourcing water quality data collection the utility of the proposed geospatial analysis generalizes well beyond the lead contamination crisis in flint the presented approach can help water utilities extract useful information from the results of crowdsourced water quality sampling campaigns which can be leveraged in identifying regions that experience persistently high levels of a variety of water contaminants by revealing the locations of hotspot regions that experience high contamination levels the presented analysis can help water utilities design targeted sampling campaigns and prioritize the implementation of corrective and protective measures it is worth acknowledging however that the presented approach is demonstrated on a dataset of an exceptionally high resolution both spatially and temporally compared to what most water utilities currently collect on a routine basis nevertheless as water quality sensors become cheaper smaller and smarter the amount of data that utilities will be able to collect is forecasted to significantly increase this calls for the development of computational tools to leverage such massive data in decision making declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18225,in the aftermath of the lead contamination crisis that plagued the water system in flint mi more than 35 000 water samples were collected from the city s premises the majority of these samples 85 were collected through a voluntary crowdsourced sampling campaign the samples were analyzed for lead and copper concentrations by the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq in this study the crowdsourced sampling data was analyzed by means of spatial autocorrelation analysis to reveal the locations of statistically significant hotspot regions of high water lead levels wlls and to track the spatiotemporal evolution of wlls as the system recovered from lead contamination the results showed that hotspot regions that experienced high wlls were consistent with the areas where lead service line lsl density was the highest additionally galvanized service lines and other lead containing plumbing components could have also contributed to lead release in hotspot regions the temporal trend exhibited by the crowdsourced sampling data did not reflect a consistent decrease in wlls despite the interventions implemented by mdeq and epa instead sampled wlls remained high for several months after boosting the orthophosphate dose and launching a city wide residential flushing campaign the findings of this study suggest that this could be partially attributed to disproportionate sampling from premises in hotspot regions of high wlls and lsl density keywords flint water crisis lead contamination spatial analysis hotspots lead service lines citizen science 1 introduction well into the 21st century water systems across north america and europe still struggle to supply safe drinking water to the rapidly growing urban population in the face of tight fiscal resources aging infrastructure systems and tainted water sources hering et al 2013 local communities throughout the us have been plagued by impaired drinking water quality as evidenced by widespread violations of the safe drinking water act sdwa standards allaire et al 2018 in 2015 nearly one in every four people in the us was served by a community water system that violated one or more of the sdwa rules fedinick et al 2017 approximately 15 of these violations were reported for breaching health based standards such as exceeding the permissible levels or not applying the necessary treatment while the rest included failing to either monitor the water for regulated contaminants or report contamination to state authorities and or notify the public fedinick et al 2017 waterborne contamination episodes that occurred in the us in recent years have taken a toll on public perception of the safety of drinking water as revealed by recent national polls firth et al 2016 mccarthy 2017 at the heart of these contamination episodes lead contamination crises that took place in washington dc in 2001 edwards et al 2009 edwards and dudi 2004 and more recently in flint mi in 2014 hanna attisha et al 2016 drew significant public attention to the dire public health consequences of drinking water lead contamination lead is a toxic heavy metal that is known to pose a multitude of health hazards the most prominent health implication of lead exposure is impairing the cognitive and intellectual functions in fetuses and young children jusko et al 2008 lanphear et al 2002 the primary source for water lead contamination is typically lead service lines lsls which are lead pipes that connect household plumbing to utility owned water mains del toral et al 2013 sandvig et al 2008 approximately 6 1 million lsls are estimated to be currently in use in the us cornwell et al 2016 and the epa estimates that around 6 5 to 10 million homes have service lines that are at least partially made of lead epa 2016a additionally other lead bearing plumbing components including brass fixtures and faucets leaded solder at pipe connections and galvanized service lines gsls can also release lead to drinking water riblet et al 2019 triantafyllidou and edwards 2012 a variety of factors are known to influence lead release from lsls and lead bearing plumbing components including water chemistry conditions type of deposited lead scales water use profiles and seasonal variables abokifa and biswas 2017 masters et al 2016a xie and giammar 2011 all of the aforementioned lead contamination episodes share a common scenario water supply source and or water treatment operations were altered without sufficient planning leading to unforeseen changes in the water chemistry that resulted in excessive release of lead from existing lsls and lead bearing plumbing components liu et al 2017 pieper et al 2018 roy and edwards 2019 the events that led up to the water contamination crisis in flint mi are now well documented flint water advisory task force 2016 masten et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 on april 25 2014 flint s water source was switched from lake huron to flint river and corrosion control treatment was discontinued in the wake of this switch a cascade of water quality issues was triggered in the city s drinking water which was not limited to widespread lead contamination but also included disappearance of chlorine residuals high levels of disinfection byproducts and detection of fecal coliform bacteria and legionella rhoads et al 2017 schwake et al 2016 zahran et al 2018 a sharp increase in the number of children with elevated blood lead levels blls was observed during the contamination episode gómez et al 2018 hanna attisha et al 2016 routine bio solids monitoring revealed a 14 increase in lead mass during the contamination episode compared to pre crisis levels roy et al 2019 most of this increase took place from july to september 2014 which coincided with the period during which the percentage of flint children under 6 years with blls above 5 μg dl almost doubled roy et al 2019 in late 2015 the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq and the us environmental protection agency epa initiated a set of interventions in response to the contamination crisis on october 16 2015 flint switched back to detroit water and sewerage department dwsd water supply with orthophosphate op corrosion control treatment on december 9 2015 the dosage of op was boosted to 3 7 3 9 mg l from the original dose of 1 2 mg l normally added to dwsd water pieper et al 2018 during the period from may 1 15 2016 a flushing campaign was launched in flint flush for flint in which residents were encouraged to flush their plumbing systems at no additional cost to help accelerate the recovery and clean the system by removing lead bearing scales epa 2016b a campaign for replacing lsls and gsls fast start started in march 2016 through which more than 9400 service lines sls were replaced as of november 2019 city of flint 2016 the bulk of these replacements took place in 2017 and 2018 following flint s switch back to dwsd multiple water sampling campaigns were launched with the aim of understanding wll trends and assessing the effect of the implemented corrective measures on the recovery of the water system the virginia tech vt flint water research team led a city wide citizen science water sampling study that spanned the two year period from august 2015 to 2017 pieper et al 2018 the results showed that wlls in sampled premises consistently declined with time in response to the implemented interventions and that wlls varied by sl material in 2016 the epa conducted multiple rounds of sequential profile sampling to identify the primary sources of lead and to evaluate the effectiveness of corrosion control treatment and lsl removal on the wlls lytle et al 2019 the results suggested that gsls and brass fittings fixtures contributed to lead release especially in premises where lsls were not present in addition to the aforementioned sampling efforts mdeq lunched a major sampling campaign after switching back to dwsd in which over 35 000 water samples were collected from flint s premises state of michigan 2016 the majority of these samples 85 were obtained via voluntary crowdsourced sampling whereby homeowners acquired free testing kits and collected samples from their taps goovaerts 2017a the remaining samples were collected through a sentinel sampling program under the supervision of the mdeq to track changes in lead concentrations at specific sites all samples collected under both the crowdsourced and the sentinel sampling programs were tested for lead and copper concentrations by mdeq and the results were posted online on a periodic basis given the timely nature of the lead contamination crisis recent studies aimed to explore the results of this sampling campaign using a variety of statistical geostatistical analysis methods abernethy et al 2016 goovaerts 2019 2018 2017a 2017b goovaerts used the sampling data to model the temporal trends of wlls goovaerts 2017a and to examine the sampling bias between sentinel and crowdsourced samples goovaerts 2017b these studies concluded that samples collected through the sentinel program exceeded the lead and copper rule lcr action level al of 15 μg l at a lower rate than samples collected through the crowdsourced sampling program goovaerts 2017a and that crowdsourced samples better captured the main characteristics of flint houses i e construction year and presence of lsls than state controlled sampling goovaerts 2017b more recently the data was used to develop multivariate geostatistical models for predicting wlls in the premises of flint goovaerts 2019 2018 in addition abernethy et al 2016 and chojnacki et al 2017 developed an ensemble of predictive data driven models to assess the potential of lead contamination in flint homes based on sampling results census data and housing characteristics these studies concluded that the geographic location of sampled premises is one of the most important predictive features for the potential of exceeding 15 μg l which could indicate the presence of problematic hotspots within which local premises were affected by lead contamination more than other areas building upon the aforementioned studies this work aims to examine the spatiotemporal trends exhibited by wlls measured through the crowdsourced sampling program the objectives of this study are to 1 test whether wlls sampled from the premises of flint exhibited a unique i e non random spatial pattern 2 reveal the locations of hotspot and coldspot regions that experienced significantly higher and lower wlls than the rest of the city 3 track the spatiotemporal evolution of wlls after flint switched back to dwsd water supply and assess the influence of the implemented interventions and 4 examine the relationship between the spatial patterns exhibited by the wlls and the spatial distribution of lsls revealing such spatial patterns particularly hotspots of high wlls can help delineate the regions that were affected the most by the lead contamination crisis examining the local housing characteristics particularly the spatial distribution of lsls within these hotspots can help us better understand the primary indicators for lead contamination in addition by inspecting the temporal evolution of these hotspots the spatiotemporal trends of recovery in response to the implemented interventions can be better understood 2 data and methods this section provides a description of the datasets used in the analysis which is followed by an explanation of the spatial analysis conducted to reveal spatial patterns in the wlls spatial autocorrelation analysis saa based on the global and local indices of moran s i anselin 1995 moran 1950 was implemented to reveal the locations of hotspot and coldspot premises that experienced statistically significantly higher and lower wlls than the rest of the city respectively the temporal evolution of spatial wll patterns and the role of spatial density of lsls in driving spatial wll patterns were also examined 2 1 datasets three datasets were used in the analysis namely the residential sampling data the sl data and the housing characteristics data the mdeq made the sampling results available online in the form of spreadsheet files xlsx containing the street addresses of sampled premises wll measurements and sample collection dates state of michigan 2016 the sl data was made available to the authors by request from the gis center at the university of michigan flint um flint in the form of digital maps containing the type of sl for each land parcel the housing data is available on arcgis online by the department of housing and urban development in the form of gis maps containing information about ownership land use taxpayer data and vacancy status for each land parcel arcgis online 2015 2 1 1 crowdsourced sampling data in this study the dataset of crowdsourced samples was used in the analysis crowdsourced samples were collected at a much finer spatial and temporal resolution than sentinel samples and can hence better capture the complex geographical patterns exhibited by the wlls as demonstrated by previous studies goovaerts 2017a 2017b nevertheless it is worth noting that crowdsourced samples were voluntarily collected by homeowners who did not necessarily undergo formal training and thus may lack proper control over sampling procedure compared to sentinel samples an elaborate discussion on the heterogeneity between both sampling datasets can be found elsewhere goovaerts 2017a 2017b a summary of the sampling instructions is provided in the supporting information section s 1 and a detailed description can be found in goovaerts 2017a the crowdsourced sampling dataset comprised a total of 30 758 first draw wll measurements that were collected from the premises of flint over the period from 9 3 2015 to 12 19 2017 subsequent samples were significantly sparser both spatially and temporally and were hence not included in the analysis to avoid biasing the spatiotemporal trends only 1 337 samples were collected in 2018 the minimum reporting level mrl for lead concentrations was 1 μg l and samples with a non detectable lead concentration were given a numeric wll of 0 μg l to facilitate the analysis preprocessing of the sampling data included the following 1 all samples were geocoded by converting street addresses to geographic coordinates using google s geocoding api the api successfully geocoded 29 939 samples despite the fact that many samples had poorly formatted or misspelled addresses 2 samples that had a missing address 495 samples or failed to geocode because of invalid incomplete address 324 samples those collected outside the city boundaries 1 293 samples and samples collected before the city switched back to dwsd on 10 16 2015 252 samples were discarded from the dataset the filtered sampling dataset used in the analysis contained 28 394 geocoded samples 3 each water sample was then assigned to the individual land parcel whose address matched its geocoded address for approximately 19 of the samples matching the addresses was not successful mainly due to inconsistencies in address format between sampling and parcel datasets samples whose addresses could not be directly matched were assigned to the land parcel whose centroid was closest to their geocoded coordinates using a 2 d euclidean distance metric by matching the land parcels in the sl data with the housing data in flint sampled premises were found to be primarily residential premises 84 in addition to smaller fractions of public 8 and commercial 6 premises 2 1 2 service line data two gis maps of flint sls were provided by the gis center at um flint containing information about the sl for each land parcel in flint the first map comprised the city s original sl records from the 1980s while the second map was an updated version reflecting any locations that had been visually verified and or that may had been replaced as of november 2016 the updated map was used in the analysis herein and the dataset included the type e g copper lead plastic zinc etc and the source either city records or field verification of the sl for each of the 56 038 land parcels in flint the dataset comprised a total of 4 100 sls that had either a full or a partial lsl e g lead copper lead galvanized lead plastic etc it is worth acknowledging here that goovaerts 2017c indicated that the city records on the composition of sls has an over estimated percentage of lsls most likely due to failure to update the records as the lsls were being replaced with copper pipes nevertheless excavations done during the first phase of the fast start sl replacement program suggested that the actual number of lsls in flint is likely larger than what is shown in the sls map abernethy et al 2018 surprisingly 96 of the excavations revealed the presence of lead in the public portion of the sl abernethy et al 2018 which was significantly different from the city records that indicated that only 40 of the sls would contain lead in either portion of the sl abernethy et al 2018 furthermore the gis map comprises more than 13 000 records of unknown sl material and these records were found to contain a non negligible fraction of unidentified lsls goovaerts 2017a 2 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis of water lead levels to reveal the spatial patterns in the wlls the proposed approach involves two main stages first global saa based on the global index of moran s i moran 1950 was applied to indicate whether wlls are spatially clustered i e neighboring premises have similarly high or low wlls or dispersed i e neighboring premises have dissimilar wlls at the city scale upon verifying the nature and statistical significance of the city wide spatial patterns in the wlls the local index of moran s i anselin 1995 was used to reveal the locations and statistical significance of local hotspot coldspot premises of high low wlls 2 2 1 global moran s i to reveal whether the sampled wlls exhibit spatial autocorrelation the global index of moran s i was calculated as goodchild 1986 1 i n w i 1 n j 1 n w i j l i l l j l i 1 n l i l 2 where n is the number of sampled premises l i and l j are the wlls sampled from premises i and j respectively l is the mean wll across all sampled premises w i j is the pairwise spatial weight that represents the spatial relationship between the wlls sampled from premises i and j and w is the sum of all the pairwise spatial weights w i 1 n j 1 n w i j in order to validate that the observed spatial pattern deviates from spatial randomness i e that the wlls are not randomly scattered across all premises with no unique spatial pattern the value of the global i was standardized by calculating a corresponding z score as z i e i s i where e i and s i are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of i values representing spatial randomness a z score close to zero indicates that the spatial pattern exhibited by the wlls is insignificant since the observed value of i is very close to the expected value under spatial randomness in contrast for cases where the absolute value of the z score is far from zero wlls are believed to exhibit a unique pattern and the larger the magnitude of z the more significant the spatial pattern positive autocorrelation z 0 indicates clustering whereby neighboring premises have similar wlls while negative autocorrelation z 0 indicates dispersion that arises when neighboring premises have dissimilar wlls to calculate e i and s i the reference distribution representing spatial randomness needs to be known to avoid making any assumptions on the distribution e g the commonly used normal distribution assumption e i and s i were calculated by means of a non parametric permutation based approach whereby the l i values were randomly shuffled across all premises for a number of permutations 999 in this study and the global i value was recomputed for each permutation 2 2 2 local moran s i to identify the locations of the hotspot coldspot premises with high low wlls the local moran s index i i was calculated for each sampled premise as anselin 1995 2 i i l i l s 2 j 1 j i n w i j l j l where s 2 is the variance of the wll across all sampled premises the value of the local i i can range anywhere from 1 1 the local i i of each individual premise indicates whether the wll sampled in the premise is positively correlated i i 0 negatively correlated i i 0 or not correlated i i 0 with the measured wlls in neighboring premises premises with i i 0 are part of a spatial cluster of neighboring premises that have similar wlls having identified the premises that belong to spatial clusters i i 0 the wlls in each of these premises l i and its spatial lag s l i which is the weighted average of the wlls in neighboring premises s l i j 1 j i n w i j l j were compared to the mean wll across all sampled premises l accordingly each premise with i i 0 was classified into either a hotspot which is a premise with a high wll surrounded by neighboring premises with high wlls i e both l i and s l i are l or a coldspot which is the exact opposite on the other hand premises that have wlls different from their neighboring premises i e either a high wll premise in a low wll neighborhood or the exact opposite were considered spatial outliers i i 0 similar to the global index the statistical significance of the local i i for each sampled premise was tested by using a conditional permutation approach whereby the reference distribution of i i for each premise was generated by holding the l i value fixed and shuffling the values of l j across the rest of the premises for a number of permutations a p value was then computed for each premise as p i m 1 k 1 where k is the number of random permutations k 999 in this study and m is the number of instances from the generated reference distribution that are greater in magnitude than the observed i i index the smaller the value of p i the higher the statistical significance of the observed spatial pattern the p values were corrected for multiple comparisons by means of the false discovery rate fdr method of benjamini and hochberg 1995 and a significance level of 0 05 was considered 2 2 3 spatial weights a crucial component of the saa is the pairwise spatial weights w i j since neighboring premises are more likely to have similar characteristics e g premise age type of the sl etc they are expected to experience similar wlls spatial weights aim to capture the intensity of such spatial relationship between wlls recorded at neighboring premises the procedure for determining spatial weights proceeded as follows first pairwise euclidian distances were calculated between the centroids of each pair of sampled premises r i j neighboring premises were determined based on a selected threshold distance whereby any given pair of sampled premises whose r i j r t were considered neighbors for neighboring premises the pairwise weight w i j was computed as w i j r t r i j while the spatial weight between non neighboring premises i e for r i j r t was set to zero finally the spatial weights were row standardized so that the spatial weights for each premise sum up to unity fig s 1 in the supporting information si shows that the number of islands i e premises with zero neighbors consistently decreases as the selected threshold distance increases up to 500 m beyond which increasing the threshold distance does not further decrease the number of islands hence a threshold distance of 500 m was used in this study 2 2 4 data preparation for spatial analysis samples were collected from 12 860 premises and around 4 500 premises were sampled more than once multiple samples collected from the same premise were averaged to generate a single representative wll for each premise to be used in the spatial analysis l i in addition a box cox transformation was applied to the wlls prior to conducting the saa in order to suppress the biasintroduced by excessively high wlls zhang et al 2008 a box cox lambda value of 0 594 was found to maximize the log likelihood function and was hence used herein 2 2 5 temporal evolution of spatial patterns in order to reveal the temporal trends exhibited by the hotspots and coldspots during the 26 5 months sampling period after switching back to dwsd the filtered sampling dataset 28 394 samples was divided into four sub periods and the saa was repeated on each of the four sub periods as described above the four sub periods were divided based on the sampling date sub period 1 oct 16 2015 feb 15 2016 sub period 2 feb 15 2016 may 15 2016 sub period 3 may 15 2016 jan 01 2017 and sub period 4 jan 01 2017 dec 20 2017 fig s 2 shows the monthly sampling frequency during the study period together with the start and end dates of each sub period these dates were selected to match the timeline of the interventions implemented by the mdeq epa to reduce lead release the start date of the first sub period oct 16 2015 marked the date on which flint switched back to dwsd with op to ensure that the first sub period comprised a representative number of samples the end date of the first sub period feb 15 2016 was selected to mark approximately 2 months after tripling of the op dose began dec 9 2015 the end date of the second sub period may 15 2016 marked the end of the flushing campaign flush for flint while the end date of the third sub period jan 1 2017 marked the beginning of the bulk of lsl and gsl replacements fast start given the fact that unequal number of samples were collected during each sub period it was important to ensure that the spatial distribution of sampled premises was consistent among the four sub periods i e that the samples collected during each sub period were spatially distributed across the different regions in the same manner as other sub periods fig s 3 shows that the ripley s k profiles ripley 1981 for each of the four sub periods are almost identical and hence the spatial distribution of the sampled premises is consistent despite the different number of samples collected during each of the four sub periods 2 3 spatial patterns of lead service line density as indicated by recent forensic and water sampling studies lytle et al 2019 olson et al 2017 destabilized leaded corrosion scales that were present in homes with lsls are believed to be the primary source of lead release during the lead contamination crisis in flint to test whether hotspots of elevated wlls are spatially correlated with regions of high spatial density of lsls we examined the spatial clustering in the distribution of lsls by repeating the global and local moran s i analyses eqs 1 and 2 for the spatial density of lsls this was done by replacing the wlls l i with the density of lsls around each sampled premise d i lsl density around each sampled premise was calculated as the fraction of homes that has a lsl within a specific radius from the sampled premise fig s 4 shows that the mean lsl density around all sampled premises increases as the selected radius increases up to 50 m beyond which the mean lsl density remains fairly constant hence a radius of 50 m was implemented for the calculation of the lsl density it is worth noting that this analysis aims to find premises located in neighborhoods with a high lsl density which is different from finding clusters of premises with lsls for instance a premise with no lsl cannot be part of the later but can still be part of the former this definition of the lsl density may result in overestimating the clustering due to artificial spatial autocorrelation from the overlapping radii despite this limitation lsl density still provided a simple means to overcome the aforementioned limitation of unidentified lsls in the sls map 2 4 code implementation codes developed to conduct the analysis were written in python 3 6 the spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted using the python spatial analysis library pysal other python libraries used for data analysis and visualization include scipy numpy statsmodels astropy pandas geopandas matplotlib seaborn and scikit learn 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary statistics table 1 lists summary statistics of wlls sampled during the 26 5 month period after switching back to dwsd it is important to note that the results reported herein are based on all sampled wlls 28 394 samples not the averaged box cox transformed values that were strictly used to conduct the spatial analysis as explained above approximately 49 of samples had detectable lead 13 876 samples and 8 exceeded 15 μg l 2 168 samples additionally twelve samples exceeded hazardous waste levels 5 000 μg l approximately 7 of sampled premises had a mean wll above 15 μg l 919 premises fig 1 shows the locations of all 12 860 sampled premises where red and grey markers represent premises with a mean wll above and below 15 μg l respectively 3 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis of water lead levels 3 2 1 global spatial autocorrelation analysis global moran s i analysis was first conducted to identify spatial patterns exhibited by wlls sampled during the entire sampling campaign the calculated global i was 0 12 which corresponded to a standardized z value of 57 fig s 5 shows that the global z dashed line is significantly more positive than the range of random permutations that represent spatial randomness the large positive z value indicated that sampled wlls were spatially clustered on a global scale i e neighboring premises have similar wlls with high statistical significance 3 2 2 revealing the locations of hotspots and coldspots as previously mentioned hotspot and coldspot premises were identified by comparing the mean wll measured in each premise l i and its spatial lag s l i with the mean wll sampled across all premises l fig s 6 shows a scatterplot between the mean wll for each premise and its spatial lag commonly known as the moran scatterplot hotspots red markers were identified as premises with a high wll surrounded by neighboring premises with high wlls while coldspots blue markers were identified as premises with low wlls surrounded by premises with low wlls approximately 16 of all sampled premises were labeled as hotspots 2 037 premises while coldspot premises comprised approximately 16 of all sampled premises 2 019 premises a smaller fraction of sampled premises were labeled as spatial outliers i i 0 which were either premises with a high wll surrounded by neighboring premises with low wlls 977 premises or the vice versa 816 premises the smaller fraction of spatial outliers compared to spatial clusters as revealed by local moran s i is consistent with the results of the global analysis showing that wlls were spatially clustered on a global scale the remaining 7 011 premises had a statistically insignificant spatial pattern i e fdr corrected p i 0 05 it is worth noting that the fdr corrections reduced the number of premises with a statistically significant pattern from 6 998 to 5 849 16 fig 2 a depicts the locations of hotspot red markers and coldspot blue markers premises on the map of flint hotspot and coldspot premises were found to exist in clusters of different shapes and sizes and were spread across flint s nine wards these spatial patterns could not be simply visualized from the distribution of the premises with mean wlls 15 μg l as depicted in fig 1 hence the use of a spatial clustering algorithm was deemed crucial for identifying such spatial patterns and more importantly for testing their statistical significance by zooming in on the hotspot and coldspot premises identified within ward 2 fig 2 b it can be seen that premises within the same ward had different classifications depending on their wlls and the statistical significance of their spatial correlation with their neighboring premises it is also worth mentioning that the locations of the hotspots of high wlls revealed by the saa approach implemented in this study visually matched to some extent the residential areas revealed by hanna attisha et al 2016 to have high blls in children younger than 5 years in their study hanna attisha et al 2016 used ordinary kriging to predict the surface of childhood blls during the lead contamination crisis the hotspot clusters of high wlls depicted in fig 2 particularly the ones between wards 2 5 and 6 and between wards 3 4 and 5 visually matched the areas predicted by hanna attisha et al 2016 to have high childhood blls in addition the locations of the coldspot clusters on the perimeters of flint were in agreement with the areas predicted by hanna attisha et al 2016 to have low blls 3 2 3 variation in wlls by sl material table 1 lists summary statistics of wlls sampled from the premises labeled as hotspots and coldspots based on saa of wlls for samples collected from hotspot premises the fraction of samples with detectable lead 84 and the fraction of samples that exceeded 15 μg l 16 were considerably higher than the corresponding values for all sampled premises 49 and 8 respectively conversely only 5 of the samples collected from coldspot premises had detectable lead and none of the 3 335 samples collected from coldspot premises exceeded 15 μg l approximately 16 of the hotspot premises had a known lsl 316 premises which is more than twice the fraction of all sampled premises with a known lsl 7 wlls sampled in hotspot premises that had a known lsl were higher than those that had other sl material mann whitney p 0 05 additionally 29 and 27 of the hotspot premises had a known gsl and copper sl respectively for hotspot premises with a known gsl the fraction of samples with detectable lead and with wll above 15 μg l were 85 and 16 respectively which were remarkably higher than the corresponding values for all sampled premises 49 and 8 respectively similarly 78 of samples collected from hotspot premises with a known copper sl had detectable lead and 16 of the samples exceeded 15 μg l which were also considerably higher than the corresponding values for all sampled premises taken together these results suggested that in addition to lsls gsls and other lead bearing plumbing components e g soldered joints and brass fitting fixtures may have also contributed to lead release from hotspot premises which is consistent with the findings of the epa profile sampling study lytle et al 2019 approximately 27 of the hotspot premises had an unknown sl material interestingly wlls sampled in these premises were not significantly different from those sampled in hotspot premises with a known lsl mann whitney p 0 05 or a known gsl mann whitney p 0 05 but were higher than wlls sampled in hotspot premises with a known copper sl mann whitney p 0 05 these results suggested the presence of unidentified lsls and gsls in the sl map as previously noted by goovaerts 2017a 3 2 4 disproportionate sampling from hotspots another interesting finding is the disproportionate sampling from hotspot premises of high wlls as can be seen from the results in table 1 the average number of samples collected from each of the hotspot premises of high wlls was 2 60 samples premise which was approximately 22 higher than the average number of samples collected from non hotspot premises 2 13 samples premise furthermore the average number of samples collected from coldspot premises was 1 65 samples premise which was 29 less than non coldspot premises 2 31 samples premise these findings support the results of recent studies which hypothesized that homeowners of high risk premises that have initially observed high wlls were more likely to repeat the sampling goovaerts 2017b in addition these findings shed light on the kind of sampling biases that can exist in data from crowdsourced sampling campaigns which decision makers need to correct for in order to accurately assess the water quality trends as discussed later in section 3 4 3 2 5 temporal evolution of hotspots and coldspots table 2 lists summary statistics of the samples collected during each of the four sampling sub periods together with the type of intervention being evaluated during each sub period i e ordinary op dosage high op dosage flushing and sl replacements wlls sampled in the second sub period were higher than those sampled in the first third and fourth sub periods pairwise mann whitney p 0 05 as can be seen from the results listed in table 2 the 90th percentile wll the fraction of samples with detectable lead and with wll above 15 μg l all increased from the first to the second sub period and then consistently decreased from the second to the fourth sub period these results implied that the wlls remained high for a few months after the tripling of the op dose in dec 2015 and then started to decline following the flushing campaign in may 2016 a detailed discussion of the observed temporal trends is left to section 3 4 fig s 7 shows the locations of the hotspot and coldspot premises revealed by saa of wlls measured during each of the four sub periods the locations of the hotspot and coldspot clusters for each of the four sub periods were generally consistent with those identified for the entire sampling period fig 2 a yet despite the higher wlls observed during the second sub period the size of the hotspot and coldspot clusters consistently shrank from sub period 1 through 4 table 2 lists the number of premises labeled as hotspots and coldspots together with the global moran s z calculated for each of the four sub periods a consistent decrease was observed in the strength of the spatial autocorrelation as evidenced by the decrease of the global z from 35 for sub period 1 to 7 for sub period 4 the decrease in the strength of the clustering was also reflected by the consistent decrease in the fraction of premises labeled as hotspots from approximately 11 for sub period 1 to approximately 1 for sub period 4 and the consistent decrease in the fraction of coldspot premises from approximately 13 to approximately 2 these results indicated that the sampled wlls across flint were becoming more homogenous and thus the degree of spatial autocorrelation gradually decreased which could be attributed to the fact that most of the sampled premises were experiencing similar wlls as the system recovered from the crisis and or because homeowners of low risk premises were less likely to repeat the sampling 3 3 spatial patterns of lead service line density 3 3 1 sampled premises with lsls fig s 8 depicts the locations of all 56 038 land parcels in the sls map where red markers represent the 4 100 premises with a known lsl either partial or full while grey markers represent premises with other sl materials copper galvanized unknown etc table 3 lists summary statistics of the wlls measured in sampled premises with a lsl approximately 7 of the sampled premises had a lsl 899 premises from which 2 376 samples approximately 8 of all samples were collected for samples collected from premises with a lsl the fraction of samples with detectable lead 70 and with a wll above 15 μg l 11 were higher than the corresponding values for all the sampled premises table 1 nevertheless wlls sampled in all sampled premises with a known lsl table 3 were significantly lower than those sampled in hotspot premises revealed by saa of the wlls table 1 mann whitney p 0 05 these results indicated that revealing hotspots of high wlls using the saa approach presented herein captured the regions that experienced high lead exposure better than simply relying on the presence absence of the lsl as the sole indicator of high lead release as explained in section 3 2 2 this could be attributed to the presence of unidentified lsls in the sl dataset and or the fact that gsls and other lead bearing plumbing components contributed to lead release during the contamination episode additionally lead release is dependent on water chemistry conditions which can vary from one region to another within the same system this variation is reflected in the spatial distribution of the wlls across the system which was captured by the saa 3 3 2 spatial clustering in lsl density to examine the spatial clustering in the distribution of the lsls both the global and local moran s i analyses were repeated for the spatial density of the lsls around each of the sampled premises the density of the lsls was found to be spatially clustered on a global scale with high statistical significance i 0 25 z 127 fig 3 a shows the locations of the hotspot and coldspot premises of high and low lsl density respectively the number of premises labeled as hotspots of high lsl density was 1 689 approximately 13 of sampled premises while the number of coldspot premises of low lsl density was 5 160 approximately 40 table 3 lists summary statistics of the wlls sampled from the premises labeled as hotspots and coldspots based on saa of the lsl density for samples collected from hotspot premises of high lsl density the fraction of samples with detectable lead 68 and with wlls above 15 μg l 11 were higher than those for all sampled premises table 1 conversely the fraction of samples with detectable lead 36 and with wlls above 15 μg l 5 for coldspot premises of low lsl density were lower than all sampled premises similar to the hotspots of high wlls a disproportionate number of samples was collected from hotspot premises of high lsl density and premises with lsls on average 2 64 samples were collected from each sampled premise with a knwon lsl which was approximately 22 higher than the corresponding fraction of samples collected from sampled premises without a lsl similarly 2 34 samples were collected from each hotspot premise of high lsl density which was 8 higher than the corresponding fraction of samples collected from non hotspot premises 3 3 3 relationship between spatial patterns of wlls and lsl density the locations of the hotspot and coldspot clusters identified based on the lsl density fig 3 a closely resembled those identified based on the wlls fig 2 a the number of premises labeled as hotspots for both high wll and high lsl density was 675 while those labeled as coldspots for both low wll and low lsl density was 1 711 furthermore a pearson s chi squared test of the contingency table of the labeled premises based on both wlls and lsl density revealed a strong association between both labels χ 2 4814 p 0 001 taken together these findings indicated that the density of lsls around premises labeled as hotspots of high wlls was significantly higher than the rest of the sampled premises while coldspot premises of low wlls were primarily located in neighborhoods with low lsl density although the wll at any premise does not depend on whether or not its neighbors have lsls the findings of this study suggested that the spatial patterns in lsl density were correlated with the spatial patterns exhibited by the wlls this implied that the density of lsls could be spatially associated with the distribution of other relevant housing characteristics e g plumbing age and materials affordability of renovations etc which could in turn indicate the presence of other lead bearing plumbing components overall these findings may have implications for the development of prediction models that aim to forecast wlls as a function of the characteristics of the premise previous studies relied on the presence absence of a lsl at the premise as a predictor of the wll abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 the findings of this study suggested that the density of the lsls in the close neighborhood of the sampled premise may also serve as a predictor of the wlls in such predictive models furthermore different prediction models can be fit to the data from hotspot and coldspot premises independently such spatial models would properly account for the influence of the local predictors within each cluster on the wlls and would hence provide a direct means for incorporating the geographic influence into the prediction models as suggested by abernethy et al 2016 3 4 spatiotemporal trends of recovery and impact of interventions fig 4 shows the monthly trends of the sampled wlls over the two year period after flint switched back to dwsd fig 4 a depicts the fraction of samples with a wll exceeding four different thresholds namely 15 50 100 and 500 μg l while fig 4 b displays the temporal trends exhibited by four different percentile wlls namely the 50th 70th 90th and 95th percentile wlls the temporal trends depicted in fig 4 demonstrate that wlls in the sampled premises did not immediately decline after flint switched back to dwsd instead wlls generally increased over the period from dec 2015 to may 2016 and then remained high throughout the summer of 2016 before starting to consistently decline from sep 2016 to jan 2017 the wlls increased again in 2017 below we break down this temporal trend to highlight the efficacy of the corrective measures implemented by mdeq and epa as well as the influence of sampling biases on the observed wlls 3 4 1 boosting the orthophosphate dose wlls appeared to increase following the tripling of the op dose in dec 2015 where wlls sampled in jan 2016 were significantly lower than may 2016 mann whitney p 0 05 the 90th percentile wll increased from 8 0 μg l in jan 2016 to 15 0 μg l in may 2016 and the fraction of samples above 15 μg l increased from 5 to 10 during the same period goovaerts 2017a explained the increase observed in the wlls after the 10th week from switching back to dwsd by the changes that were introduced to the sampling protocol where homeowners were instructed not to pre flush the sl before the 6 h stagnation period and to collect the samples at normal instead of low flow rates yet samples collected by the vt team in mar 2016 still showed relatively high wlls pieper et al 2018 where the 90th percentile wll of the first draw samples and the fraction of samples above 15 μg l were 22 4 μg l and 15 respectively furthermore sporadic spikes of high lead concentrations were observed in several of the sampled homes with phosphate concentrations as high as 9 1 mg l as po4 3 p pieper et al 2018 op dosing is generally effective in reducing the release of soluble lead by forming low solubility lead scales and thus creating a passive protective barrier to reduce lead dissolution edwards and mcneill 2002 however op dosing may accelerate galvanic corrosion of leaded solder joints and partially replaced lsls nguyen et al 2011 which may explain the increase in the wlls during the period from dec 2015 to may 2016 furthermore high op dosing may result in higher total lead concentrations in the short term due to the formation and transport of lead phosphate particles zhao et al 2018 hence the increase in the fraction of samples above 50 and 100 μg l from dec 2015 to may 2016 observed in fig 4 a may also be partially attributed to the temporary formation of lead particles following the tripling of the op dose 3 4 2 flushing the plumbing network surprisingly sampled wlls did not drop following the flushing campaign that took place in may 2016 instead wlls remained high through mid sep 2016 before starting to consistently drop furthermore wlls sampled in may 2016 were not significantly different from those sampled from mid august to mid september 2016 mann whitney p 0 05 as can be seen from fig 4 the monthly fraction of samples above 15 μg l and the 90th percentile wll remained above 9 and 14 μg l respectively throughout the period from may to sep 2016 in contrast similarly high wlls were not observed in the vt study where samples collected in jul 2016 had noticeably lower wlls than those collected in mar 2016 pieper et al 2018 furthermore since lead release from lead op scales have little temperature dependency masters et al 2016b the increase in the water temperature could not fully explain the high wlls observed in the summer of 2016 this was also evident in the results from routine biosolids monitoring where no correlation between lead in sewage biosolids and water temperature was observed roy et al 2019 nevertheless unlike the results of the vt repeat sampling study in which the same premises were sampled during each round the crowdsourced sampling data used in the analysis herein comprises sampling biases originating from the disproportionate sampling from hotspot premises as previously mentioned the results of this study suggested that the high wlls observed during the summer of 2016 could be partially attributed to the disproportionate sampling from hotspot premises that experienced high wlls and or those located in high lsl density neighborhoods fig 5 shows the monthly trends of the fraction of samples that were collected from hotspot premises of high wlls dashed red line and high lsl density solid blue line during the period from the may 2016 to oct 2016 the fraction of samples that were collected from hotspot premises of high wlls almost doubled from 17 to 31 similarly the fraction of samples collected from hotspot premises of high lsl density increased from 11 to 22 during the same period to control the bias introduced by disproportionate sampling from high risk premises fig 6 displays the wlls observed in high and low risk premises plotted independently high risk premises are defined as premises that were both hotspots of high wlls and high lsl density 675 premises 1 764 samples while low risk premises 9 809 premises 20 902 samples are ones that were neither hotspots of high wlls nor hotspots of high lsl density consistent with the trends seen for all samples fig 4 wlls in high risk premises increased from dec 2015 to may 2016 as can be seen in fig 6 a nevertheless unlike the trends observed for all samples wlls in high risk premises started to decline shortly after the flushing campaign where wlls sampled in sep 2016 were lower than those sampled in may 2016 mann whitney p 0 05 as can be seen in fig 6 a the fraction of samples from high risk premises that exceeded 15 μg l decreased from 26 in may 2016 to 12 in sep 2016 and then further declined to 5 in dec 2016 similarly wlls in low risk premises showed an overall decreasing trend throughout the period from may to december 2016 taken together the results suggested that the high wlls observed during summer 2016 could be partially explained by the disproportionate sampling from high risk premises after controlling this bias the results of the crowdsourced sampling campaign were consistent with the findings of the vt repeat sampling study the consistent decline in the wlls observed in the high risk premises from may to december 2016 suggested that the flushing campaign was effective in removing unstable lead corrosion scales furthermore peak wlls for high risk premises were observed in the samples collected from mid april to mid may with a notable contribution of particulate lead 13 and 6 of the samples were above 50 and 100 μg l respectively that can be attributed to the mobilization of lead scales during the flushing campaign 3 4 3 service line replacements following the consistent decline in the wlls that was observed after the flushing campaign the wlls appeared to increase again in 2017 as can be seen in fig 4 we hypothesize that this increase is attributed to the large scale lead and galvanized sl replacement campaign that was launched in march 2016 with the bulk of the replacements starting in early 2017 abernethy et al 2018 vibrations and other disturbances during lsl excavation may dislodge leaded scales and lead containing particulates brown and cornwell 2015 these lead containing scales may get trapped in the home plumbing and then subsequently released after lsl replacement as suggested by the epa profile sampling lytle et al 2019 this may explain the increase in particulate lead during the period from january to september 2017 fig 4 where the fraction of samples that exceeded 50 and 100 μg l increased from 1 1 and 0 6 respectively to 3 7 and 1 6 respectively to further clarify this trend fig s 9 shows the wlls sampled in one of the hotstpot premises where repeated sampling took place the depicted premise is a residential home with an unknown sl material forty samples were collected from this premise during the period from january 2016 to december 2017 sampled wlls were consistently below 100 μg l until a sudden spike of very high lead concentration took place in july 2017 3 82 mg l after which 6 more samples exceeded 100 μg l over the following three months with two samples exceeding 7 2 and 1 6 mg l respectively wlls sampled in the following months were generally below 15 μg l while knowledge regarding whether this specific premise received a sl replacement was not available its wll profile shows a sudden sharp increase in the release of lead particles which was indicative of the disturbances associated with lead galvanized sl replacements 4 conclusions in the wake of the lead contamination crisis that struck flint mi a large scale water sampling campaign took place in the city more than 35 000 water samples were collected from the premises of flint most of which were collected through a crowdsourced sampling effort the samples were analyzed for lead and copper concentrations by the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq and the results were routinely posted online in this study the crowdsourced sampling data was analyzed to reveal the locations of hotspot regions that experienced excessive lead release by means of spatial autocorrelation analysis saa based on the global and local indices of moran s i furthermore saa was used to track the spatiotemporal evolution of the water lead levels wlls as flint gradually recovered from the lead contamination crisis and to reveal the spatial patterns in the density of lead service lines lsls in the city the implemented saa approach revealed that the locations of hotspot regions of high wlls significantly matched those where the density of lsls was the highest furthermore the temporal trend exhibited by the crowdsourced samples did not show a consistent decline in the wlls which was found to be partially attributed to the disproportionate sampling from premises in the hotspot regions the results also asserted that homeowners of high risk premises were more likely to repeat the sampling as suggested by previous studies and thus highlighting the kind of biases that may exist in crowdsourced sampling data with the increasing interest in citizen science and crowdsourcing water quality data collection the utility of the proposed geospatial analysis generalizes well beyond the lead contamination crisis in flint the presented approach can help water utilities extract useful information from the results of crowdsourced water quality sampling campaigns which can be leveraged in identifying regions that experience persistently high levels of a variety of water contaminants by revealing the locations of hotspot regions that experience high contamination levels the presented analysis can help water utilities design targeted sampling campaigns and prioritize the implementation of corrective and protective measures it is worth acknowledging however that the presented approach is demonstrated on a dataset of an exceptionally high resolution both spatially and temporally compared to what most water utilities currently collect on a routine basis nevertheless as water quality sensors become cheaper smaller and smarter the amount of data that utilities will be able to collect is forecasted to significantly increase this calls for the development of computational tools to leverage such massive data in decision making declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18226,this study investigated the regeneration of phenol saturated activated carbon fiber acf with a novel electro peroxydisulfate e pds process compared with traditional electrochemical regeneration e pds process could simultaneously regenerate the exhausted acf and mineralize desorbed contaminants by activating pds in water with a much lower energy consumption 1 6 according to the estimation of relative contributions involved in e pds process reactive oxygen species ros especially sulfate radical s o 4 played a dominant role in the degradation of phenol and its byproducts it was worth noting that the accumulation of byproducts in solution increased significantly after s o 4 concentration decreased in aqueous solution further study proved that the regeneration efficiency of acf could be improved by the application of multiple doses of pds for the effective reduction of byproduct accumulation however application of multiple doses of pds could not prevent acf from being oxidized by ros generated in the system subsequently leading to loss of acf adsorption capacity this limitation is a significant concern in treatment technologies based on carbon materials activated by peroxides and such technologies should be studied further to obtain additional insights on their potential and applicability in industrial practice nevertheless the adsorption capacity of acf remained above 40 after three regeneration cycles in the e pds process therefore e pds process showed promise for further evaluation as a potentially viable approach for the regeneration of carbons saturated with organic pollutants graphical abstract image 1 keywords regeneration electrochemical persulfate activated carbon fiber advanced oxidation process water treatment 1 introduction activated carbon ac materials are commonly used as effective adsorbents for the removal of organic contaminants from wastewater especially from industrial wastewater due to their large surface area high porosity and large numbers of surface functional groups gupta and suhas 2009 moreno castilla 2004 however this removal process only transfers the contaminants from the liquid phase to the solid phase and the contaminants are not actually degraded in addition during the adsorption process ac gradually loses its activity and needs treatment after it is exhausted the exhausted ac is usually incinerated or landfilled to prevent secondary pollution wang and balasubramanian 2009 these disposal methods have resulted in the waste of resources and energy so ac regeneration technologies that are more environmental friendly should be developed currently thermal regeneration is the most commonly used regeneration method thermal regeneration at high temperature can restore over 80 adsorption capacity of ac alvarez et al 2004 marques et al 2017 however the drawbacks of thermal regeneration are also obvious as reported ac could lose mass during the thermal regeneration due to the carbon burn off this problem could be more severe after repeated thermal regenerations ania et al 2004 san miguel et al 2001 moreover this method consumes large amount of energy which leads to high operation cost thus affecting the application of activated carbon adsorption technology in wastewater treatment hutchins 1973 in the past decades electrochemical regeneration appeared as a promising technology for regeneration of exhausted ac mcquillan et al 2018 narbaitz and cen 1994 compared with thermal regeneration electrochemical regeneration could be operated in situ with less energy consumption electrochemical methods require a relatively short time for ac regeneration in a process which pollutants are oxidized by the anode zhang 2002 panizza and cerisola 2009 martínez huitle and panizza 2018 in addition ac can maintain its pore structure without apparent mass loss during electrochemical regeneration garcia oton et al 2005 narbaitz and cen 1994 however traditional electrochemical regeneration always causes secondary pollution a large number of studies have shown that although the regeneration efficiency could reach 70 95 toxic byproducts such as benzoquinone phenolic derived oligomers and polymers were produced in traditional electrochemical regeneration methods of phenol saturated ac these byproducts pose significant threat to human health so the effluent needs further treatment before discharge hussain et al 2013 karimi jashni and narbaitz 2005 in addition the transformation products which are produced by anodic oxidation could be adsorbed on the surface of the anode zhan et al 2016a 2016b those are the limiting factors for the practical application of electrochemical regeneration therefore it is necessary to develop an environmentally friendly and energy efficient technology of ac regeneration which could regenerate ac in situ while mineralizing the adsorbed pollutants thus reducing regeneration cost and eliminating secondary pollution peroxydisulfate pds can be activated by electrochemical methods to generate sulfate radical s o 4 which has been shown to be efficient for the degradation of refractory organic pollutants bu et al 2019 li et al 2019 yan et al 2017 s o 4 based processes had been used in the regeneration of phenol spent granular activated carbon gac and the regeneration efficiency could reach nearly 60 however the regeneration mechanism was not explored in depth huang et al 2017 although extensive research studies have confirmed that s o 4 based processes could mineralize pollutants effectively in water bu et al 2019 yan et al 2017 s o 4 based processes seem not to perform well in the regeneration of spent gac no matter the approach used to optimize the operating parameters i e pds concentration current intensity regeneration time the process could not achieve higher gac regeneration efficiency huang et al 2017 these previous results trigger the following question are there some limitations presented in the s o 4 based processes that affect the regeneration of activated carbon these need to be further explored in our previous studies the electrochemical methods employed could activate pds more effectively with activated carbon fiber acf cathode compared with inert metal cathode liu et al 2018 acf is mainly used as an initiator rather than a catalyst in this system the presence of electric field could prevent acf from being destroyed by the oxidation of pds and generated ros after long time service therefore using the spent acf as cathode and regenerating it by electrochemical activation of pds e pds in situ could theoretically regenerate exhausted acf while degrading organic pollutants this technology might reduce secondary treatment cost and eliminate the risk of environmental pollution in addition to the best of our knowledge there is no research about electrochemical activation of pds e pds to regenerate spent acf while using spent acf as cathode thus the purpose of this study was to assess the regeneration efficiency of acf in electrochemical activation of pds system with saturated acf as cathode phenol as an important chemical in industry was selected as the model compound the main objectives of this study were to investigate i the adsorption capacity of acf for phenol and benzoquinone as well as the desorption of phenol from the surface of saturated acf during e pds process ii the degradation and re adsorption of target organic pollutant on acf during e pds process iii the contribution of different ros iv the limitations of e pds regeneration process and v the variation of the adsorption capacity and structures of acf during four cycles regeneration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the information of acf and chemicals are listed in text s1 all solutions used in this study were prepared with ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm 2 2 adsorption of phenol and benzoquinone bq pieces of acfs 0 2 g 5 0 cm 3 5 cm 3 mm were first soaked in boiling ultrapure water for 2 h and dried at 38 c for 24 h before adsorption then the acfs were added to sealed glass flasks which contained 200 ml phenol solutions with a range of predetermined concentrations then the sealed flasks were placed in a shaker zwy 2102c zhicheng shanghai co with rotating speed at 200 rpm and constant temperature at 25 c for 24 h the adsorption equilibrium values

conducted in a glass column 500 ml 5 cm 5 cm 12 cm with a dc power source pt plated titanium 5 cm 3 5 cm was used as both anode and cathode phenol saturated acf was fixed in the cathode by titanium wire the distance between the electrodes was 2 0 cm na2so4 0 20 m was used as electrolyte solution in traditional electrochemical regeneration while pds was used as electrolyte solution in e pds regeneration all experiments were conducted under constant temperature 298 k and rotating speed 800 rpm 2 4 analytical methods phenol and its main byproducts bq hydroquinone hq catechol cat maleic acid ma and fumaric acid fa were identified and quantified by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a cosmosil c18 column the test parameters of hplc were described in detail in text s2 total organic carbon toc was evaluated using a toc lcph analyzer shimadzu co japan pds was measured by a ki method at 354 nm liang et al 2008 the contents of organic matter adsorbed and remained in regenerated acf were evaluated according to the following method after regeneration the acfs were agitated in a mixed solution of 10 1 0 m naoh and 90 ethanol with the assist of ultrasound and stirring for 30 min each hamdaoui et al 2005 the acfs were collected after repeating the procedures twice this method could recover more than 97 of phenol adsorbed on acf trellu et al 2018 nitrogen gas was purged into mixed solution to eliminate the ethanol before toc measurement the regeneration efficiency re of phenol saturated acf was calculated by comparing the adsorption capacity of regenerated acf qe r and virgin acf qe 0 according to eq 2 2 r e q e r q e 0 the relative contribution of different reactions was estimated by comparing the observed first order rate constants of phenol removal in each independent reaction kindependent and in the e acf pds process according to eq 3 3 c o n t r i b u t i o n k i n d e p e n d e n t k e a c f p d s 2 5 characterization of acf a scanning electron microscope sem tescan inc usa was used to examine the morphologies of acf samples the porosity analysis and brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of acfs before and after regeneration were evaluated with an asap 2020m instrument n2 adsorption 77 k 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of phenol and bq onto acf the adsorption isotherms of phenol and bq are presented in fig s1 and table s1 all isotherms can be fitted well by both the freundlich and the langmuir models indicting that two compounds are adsorbed on the acf with varied energies of adsorption kumar et al 2007 compared with the traditional granular activated carbons gacs the acf used in this research had a higher maximum adsorption capacity of phenol 3 00 mmol g 1 which was due to the relatively higher bet surface area of acf 952 m2 g 1 in addition the maximum adsorption capacity of bq on acf is 2 84 mmol g 1 the higher adsorption capacity of phenol was caused by 1 the strong π π interactions between phenol and acf and 2 the relatively higher hydrophobicity of phenol liu et al 2010 3 2 comparison of e na2so4 and e pds regeneration phenol saturated acf was used as cathode and regenerated by e pds and e na2so4 processes as shown in fig s1 the maximum of phenol adsorbed on acf was about 3 00 mmol g 1 corresponding to the concentrations of phenol as 1 20 mm 112 8 mg l 1 in theory and toc as 86 4 mg c l 1 in theory in the electrochemical regeneration reactor the transfer of phenol between solution and saturated acf was explored as can be seen in fig 1 only 40 95 of phenol was desorbed from saturated acf in the control experiment no current supplied this process reached the equilibrium within 60 min meanwhile the desorption process only transferred phenol from acf to the solution without toc mineralization in the process however almost 96 of initial adsorbed phenol was transferred from acf to solution after e na2so4 regeneration within 60 min table s2 it was reported that the increase of ph which is due to the generation of oh at cathode could cause electrostatic repulsion between phenol and activated carbon surface then promote desorption of phenol from acf berenguer et al 2010 in addition sodium phenate which was difficult to be adsorbed on acf was produced under electric field leading to the desorption of phenol zhang 2002 as shown in fig 1 phenol concentration in the solution phenolsol rapidly increased to 82 36 mg l 1 during the first 15 min and decreased to 18 94 mg l 1 gradually in 360 min the results demonstrated that 83 21 of initial adsorbed phenol was degraded in the e na2so4 regeneration process considering those results e na2so4 regeneration seems an effective method to regenerate phenol saturated acfs however fig 2 shows that the concentration of toc in solution tocsol increased rapidly within the first 60 min then it stay steady during the rest of test almost 84 79 of the initial adsorbed toc remained in the solution after regeneration for 360 min in addition the solution was transformed into yellowish brown from colorless it was reported that the phenol desorbed in solution could be oxidized at the anode to form toxic byproducts phenol derived oligomers which show yellowish brown color in solution zhan et al 2016b therefore e na2so4 process is not an environmentally friendly regeneration method although the e na2so4 regeneration could effectively remove phenol from acf the generation of more toxic byproducts could increase the difficulty of the treatment of regeneration solution by comparison the concentration of phenolsol and tocsol rapidly increased due to the rapid desorption of phenol from acf during e pds regeneration process shown in figs 1 and 2 over 90 of initial adsorbed phenol was removed from acf within 60 min table s2 the results demonstrated that phenol could also be desorbed from acf rapidly in e pds regeneration process meanwhile only 28 37 of the initial adsorbed toc was in the solution after regeneration for 360 min which was much lower than that in e na2so4 regeneration solutions no phenol derived oligomers were observed in the solution during the e pds regeneration process note the solution remained colorless during regeneration which was mainly attributed to the strong oxidizing ability of the e pds regeneration process in addition fig s2 showed that acf cathode could remove phenol more efficiently than an inert metal cathode this was probably due to the fact that acf as cathode could activate peroxide more effectively which had been demonstrated in our preliminary studies liu et al 2018 2019 therefore saturated acf as cathode could effectively promote the degradation of phenol and its derivatives in the e pds regeneration process in e pds and traditional electrochemical regeneration processes only electric energy was consumed in toc mineralization thus the parameter of electrical energy per order ee o was calculated to compare the energy consumption of these two processes the equation and illustration are shown in text s3 as shown in table s3 the energy consumed in e pds regeneration process 5 91 kwh m 3 is only 1 6 of that in traditional electrochemical regeneration 34 92 kwh m 3 therefore compared with e na2so4 regeneration the e pds regeneration could greatly reduce the energy consumption of toc mineralization and the potential risks of the regeneration effluents 3 3 degradation and re adsorption of phenol and its main byproducts during e pds regeneration the evolution of phenol and toc in total adsorbed on acf and in the solution describe as phenoltotal and toctotal was explored during e pds generation process fig 3 a as can be seen in fig 3 a the degradation of phenoltotal and the mineralization of toctotal mainly occurred in the first 180 min regeneration the phenoltotal degradation efficiency and toctotal mineralization efficiency decreased significantly in the later 180 min regeneration meanwhile the evolution of phenolsol and main byproductssol is shown in fig 3 b the concentration of phenolsol increased to 35 59 mg l 1 the peak of the curve rapidly within the first 15 min meanwhile the concentrations of bq catechol cat hydroquinone hq maleic acid ma and fumaric acid fa in the solution were all less than 0 10 mg l 1 the results demonstrated that the phenol desorbed and degraded in the solution was mostly mineralized to co2 and h2o in the early stage of the regeneration then the concentration of phenolsol decreased rapidly accompanied by a tocsol mineralization within the first 180 min while bq cat hq ma and fa were accumulated gradually in the solution however the concentration of phenolsol and bqsol declined gradually accompanied by only slight tocsol mineralization in the later 180 min regeneration meanwhile a large amount of hqsol was accumulated therefore the degraded phenolsol and bqsol was mainly converted to hqsol as byproduct rather than being completely mineralized to co2 and h2o in the last 180 min regeneration the concentration of pds in solution was the dominant factor for determining the concentration of ros under the condition of constant current and temperature xu et al 2017 to explain the results mentioned above the evolution of pds decomposition was monitored during the e pds regeneration process as shown in fig 3 c the residual ratio of pds in the solution was less than 20 after reaction for 180 min this led to a significant reduction of ros generation in the e pds process which was mainly due to the decrease of s 2 o 8 2 concentration as shown in eqs 4 and 5 chen and huang 2015 with the decrease of pds concentration anodic oxidation became gradually the main way of phenol degradation the accumulation of hqsol enhanced as pds concentration decreased to 20 it was reported that bq was one of the main byproducts of phenol formed by anodic oxidation berenguer et al 2010 meanwhile bq could be reduced to hq during the electrochemical process bailey et al 1983 mousset et al 2016 trellu also observed similar behavior during electro fenton regeneration of phenol saturated acf trellu et al 2018 these byproducts accumulated in the solution could be re adsorbed on the acf thereby reducing the regeneration efficiency of the acf therefore the accumulation of byproducts including hq bq and cat after regeneration for 180 min was mainly due to the decrease of pds concentration in solution 4 s 2 o 8 2 e s o 4 s o 4 2 5 s o 4 h 2 o h s o 4 2 o h the toc accumulated in the regeneration solution might be re adsorbed on the acf thus decreasing the regeneration efficiency fig 3 a and fig s3 show the evolution of phenol toc and main oxidation byproducts adsorbed on acf as shown in fig 3 a the concentration of phenol adsorbed on acf decreased rapidly in the first 60 min and reached the lowest value at 180 min the main reason was that phenol could be rapidly removed from acf into solution due to the electrostatic repulsive interactions in the early stage of regeneration however phenol was not desorbed completely as the result of irreversible adsorption of phenol on acf which was also reported in other studies narbaitz and mcewen 2012 zhan et al 2016b meanwhile the byproducts of hq bq and cat accumulated gradually on acf shown in fig s3 as illustrated in fig s4 the color of the solution changed from colorless to yellowish brown after organic compounds desorbed from regenerated acf ultrasound 10 1 0 m naoh and 90 ethanol indicating that phenol derived oligomers are formed berenguer et al 2010 contrary to the degradation trend of toc the regeneration efficiency of acf gradually decreased with the increase of regeneration time shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 3 a the concentration of tocacf toc adsorbed on acf increased from 21 6 to 23 8 mg g 1 as regeneration time increased from 180 min to 360 min as a result the lost of adsorption capacity could attribute to the re adsorption of phenol and its byproducts 3 4 the mechanism of phenol mineralization and acf regeneration 3 4 1 determining the ros usually the ros could be determined by adding excess of different radical scavengers dong et al 2019 yang et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 however adding excess of radical scavengers directly to the regeneration process could affect the adsorption equilibrium of phenol on acf therefore in this study the degradation of phenol during the e pds regeneration process was simulated by e acf pds process in which pristine acf no phenol adsorbed was used as cathode a series of experiments was conducted to determine the ros and estimate the relative contributions both sulfate radicals e0 2 6 v and hydroxyl radicals e0 3 1 v are the main possible oxidizing species generated in the electrochemical activation of pds liu et al 2018 to determine the reactive species the effects of tba and meoh were explored as reported meoh could react with both oh and s o 4 at relatively high rate constants 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 for oh and 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 for s o 4 whereas tba could only react with oh at a relatively high rate constant 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 for oh and 7 6 105 m 1 s 1 for s o 4 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 as illustrated in fig 5 a the removal ratio of phenol decreased from 80 86 to 37 87 in the presence of 1 m meoh after reaction for 30 min while it decreased from 80 86 to 43 71 in the presence of 1 m tba the obviously higher inhibition of meoh than tba on the phenol removal indicated that both oh and s o 4 should contribute to the degradation of phenol 3 4 2 estimation of the relative contribution on phenol degradation during e pds regeneration in the e pds regeneration process phenol can be degraded mainly through the following routes direct electron transfer det pds oxidation nonradical oxidation and ros oxidation we assumed that the generated ros oh and s o 4 in the e pds process could be scavenged completely by 1 m meoh the improved inhibition effect of phenol removal by 10 m meoh was negligible compared with 1 m meoh in this process as shown in fig s5 as shown in fig s6 all relevant processes follow first order kinetics r2 0 95 the proportions of det pds oxidation nonradical oxidation and ros oxidation are shown in fig 5 b the specific calculations are presented in the table 1 as the concentration of pds decreased from 100 mm to 20 mm the contribution proportion of ros oxidation decreased from 84 16 to 63 75 while the contribution proportion of det increased from 11 75 to 31 61 moreover the apparent rate constant on phenol degradation by ros oxidation decreased to less than 30 of the initial value as pds concentration decreased to 20 mm therefore the accumulation of byproducts increased significantly after regeneration for 180 min overall these results illustrated that ros oxidation played a dominant role in phenol and its byproducts degradation during e pds regeneration moreover the relative contributions of oh and s o 4 on phenol degradation were estimated by the method described in text s4 and the results are summarized in table s4 the contribution of s o 4 oxidation in phenol degradation decreased from 60 33 to 43 39 as pds concentration decreased from 100 mm to 20 mm while the steady state concentration of s o 4 decreased from 4 41 10 12 to 1 18 10 12 m in aqueous solution in order to compare the degradation rate of phenol hq and bq by sulfate radical alone 1 m tba was added to quench oh in the e pds process as shown in fig s7 the degradation efficiency of phenol by s o 4 was much higher than those of hq and bq which was in accordance with the accumulation of hq and bq during e pds process in general s o 4 oxidation played a major role in phenol degradation by ros in the e pds process 3 5 regeneration of acf with twice dosing of pds separately from the description above the accumulation of intermediates and phenol in acf which was caused by the decrease of steady state concentration of s o 4 could affect the regeneration efficiency of acf in the e pds process in order to maintain a high level of mineralization efficiency in e pds process the initial concentration of pds was increased to 200 mm as shown in fig 6 a and b there was still 27 25 of pds remaining after regeneration for 6 h compared with the addition of 100 mm pds more tocsol was mineralized with the addition of 200 mm pds the final concentration of toc was 11 26 mg c l 1 however from the standpoint of operation cost it is advisable to try to lower the consumption of pds in pds activated process s o 4 could react with pds to form persulfate radical which only offers weak oxidizing ability eq 6 excessive high concentrations of pds could promote side reactions eqs 6 8 which can lead to unnecessary consumption of pds wang and zhou 2016 c carvalho de almeidaa et al 2019 moreover as can be seen in fig 6 c the regeneration efficiency of acf was reduced significantly at a higher concentration of pds even though the initial adsorbed toc was removed at a larger extent 6 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 7 h s o 4 2 o h s o 4 h 2 o 8 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 to improve the utilization efficiency of pds the method of adding a total of 100 mm pds in two separate doses 50 mm pds at the beginning and 180 min respectively was explored in this study compared with the addition of all 100 mm pds for once adding the same dose of pds at twice separately could keep its concentration at a relatively high value shown in fig 6 b meanwhile the final concentration of tocsol was reduced to 18 82 mg c l 1 shown in fig 6 a the results demonstrated that the mineralization efficiency of the addition of pds at twice was higher than the addition of all pds for once at the same total dose amount at the beginning though the total consumption of pds was the same multiple dosing could ensure the concentration of pds in a suitable range neither too low that affects the generation of sulfate radicals nor too high that promotes side reactions as can be seen in fig s8 compared with once dosing twice dosing could decrease the accumulation of organics phenolsol and hqsol obviously moreover the regeneration efficiency of acf could also be improved by twice dosing pds as shown in fig 6 c therefore multiple dosing should be better for practical application of the acf regeneration process 3 6 the limitations of e pds regeneration process as mentioned above twice dosing could decrease the accumulation of byproducts significantly while the regeneration efficiency of acf only increased from 63 to 66 meanwhile according to the results of fig s1 and table s1 the maximum adsorption capacity of toc in acf was 216 mg g 1 however the concentration of toc adsorbed on acf after 6 h regeneration was only about 24 mg g 1 fig 3 a as a result the regeneration efficiency of acf in e pds system should be more than 80 or more in theory however the actual regeneration efficiency was only about 63 the results illustrated that the accumulation of intermediate products and phenol in acf was not an exclusive factor that affects the regeneration efficiency of acf in e pds process there should be other important factors affecting the regeneration of acf some studies pointed out that the structure of carbon materials could be destroyed in persulfate solution thereby affecting the performance of materials eq 9 lee et al 2013 liang et al 2009 to investigate the effect of pds on the adsorption capacity of acf in e pds process virgin acfs were treated in pds and sodium sulfate solution for 6 h then soaked in 200 ml phenol solution 1600 mg l 1 to test the adsorption capacity of treated acfs respectively as can be seen from fig 7 the adsorption capacity of acf after being treated in sodium sulfate solution was almost the same as that of virgin acf while the adsorption capacity of acf was only about 65 of that of virgin acf after being treated in pds solution no current the sem images also showed that acf was severely damaged in pds solution fig 8 c all those results demonstrated that pds could destroy the pore structure of acf and affect its adsorption capacity 9 a c f s 2 o 8 2 a c f s o 4 10 a c f e a c f 11 s 2 o 8 2 e a c f s o 4 s o 4 2 however the maximum adsorption capacity of acf remained more than 80 of the initial capacity with current applied as shown in fig 7 the acf maximum adsorption capacity could even reach 90 of the initial capacity with 0 5 a current applied besides the sem images showed that acf was barely destroyed in pds solution with 1 a current applied for 180 min fig 8 d meanwhile the data of bet vmicropore and smicropore showed that the properties of acf could be better maintained in pds solution with current applied shown in table 2 all the results demonstrated that the current could protect the acf from pds oxidation in our previous study acf could obtain electrons from the applied electric field at cathode thereby avoiding pds oxidation eq 10 liu et al 2018 the pds activated process could be described as eq 11 in which acf served as a catalyst rather than an initiator it was worth noticing that acf adsorption capacity still had nearly 10 20 decrement especially at relatively higher current intensities increasing the current intensity in electrolyte solution sodium sulfate only has slight impact on the adsorption capacity of acf shown in fig 7 it means that the current could not affect the adsorption capacity of acf however the acf maximum adsorption capacity q0 qe0 decreased from 90 to below 80 when current intensity increased from 0 5 a to 2 0 a shown in fig 7 as is known ros oxidation enhances with the increase of current intensity in electrochemical activated pds process therefore the loss of acf adsorption capacity in e acf pds process might be affected by the ros generated in the system that could oxidize acf continually and the pds adsorbed on the acf that could oxidize acf after application of current ended this limitation could exist in all carbon material activated pds technology therefore how to avoid the oxidation of acf by ros requires further exploration in the e pds regeneration system 3 7 evaluation of multiple regeneration cycles as mentioned earlier pds concentration addition method of pds and current intensity could affect the mineralization of phenol and regeneration efficiency of acf in e pds regeneration systems however it is contradictory between mineralization capacity and regeneration efficiency in this system complete mineralization accompanied with a significant reduction in regeneration efficiency considering both the mineralization efficiency of pollutants and the regeneration efficiency of acf the optimal operating condition was selected for multiple regenerations adding pds twice pds concentration 100 mm regeneration time 6 h current intensity 1 a the regeneration efficiency of acf during four cycles is shown in fig 9 compared with a regeneration efficiency of 66 33 in the first cycle the efficiency of the fourth cycle decreased to 34 12 meanwhile the bet surface area decreased significantly after four cycles shown in table 2 the loss of adsorption capacity was mainly due to the blockage of acf micro pores by the accumulation of phenol hq phenol derived oligomers and other degradation byproducts as well as the partial damage of acf by ros oxidation compared with the first cycle the structure of acf after four cycles was severely damaged as seen from sem image in fig 8 e f the regeneration efficiency decreased to below 40 after four times of regeneration therefore the regenerability of ac in the e pds process is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to be able to use ac for more than three times 4 conclusions the results illustrated that e pds process is an effective and sustainable technology for the regeneration of phenol saturated acf compared with e na2so4 regeneration e pds system could mineralize organic pollutants more efficiently with lower energy consumption thereby reducing secondary pollution the estimation of relative contribution demonstrated that s o 4 played a major role in phenol degradation therefore the accumulation of byproducts in solution which could be re adsorbed on acf mainly occurred after pds was largely consumed improving the addition method of pds twice dosing could increase the regeneration efficiency of acf and reduce the accumulation of byproducts unfortunately twice dosing could not prevent the damage of acf against ros oxidation thereby leading to the reduction of acf adsorption capacity this limitation should be aware of in all carbon materials activated peroxide technologies finally multiple regeneration experiments showed that acf still remained

18226,this study investigated the regeneration of phenol saturated activated carbon fiber acf with a novel electro peroxydisulfate e pds process compared with traditional electrochemical regeneration e pds process could simultaneously regenerate the exhausted acf and mineralize desorbed contaminants by activating pds in water with a much lower energy consumption 1 6 according to the estimation of relative contributions involved in e pds process reactive oxygen species ros especially sulfate radical s o 4 played a dominant role in the degradation of phenol and its byproducts it was worth noting that the accumulation of byproducts in solution increased significantly after s o 4 concentration decreased in aqueous solution further study proved that the regeneration efficiency of acf could be improved by the application of multiple doses of pds for the effective reduction of byproduct accumulation however application of multiple doses of pds could not prevent acf from being oxidized by ros generated in the system subsequently leading to loss of acf adsorption capacity this limitation is a significant concern in treatment technologies based on carbon materials activated by peroxides and such technologies should be studied further to obtain additional insights on their potential and applicability in industrial practice nevertheless the adsorption capacity of acf remained above 40 after three regeneration cycles in the e pds process therefore e pds process showed promise for further evaluation as a potentially viable approach for the regeneration of carbons saturated with organic pollutants graphical abstract image 1 keywords regeneration electrochemical persulfate activated carbon fiber advanced oxidation process water treatment 1 introduction activated carbon ac materials are commonly used as effective adsorbents for the removal of organic contaminants from wastewater especially from industrial wastewater due to their large surface area high porosity and large numbers of surface functional groups gupta and suhas 2009 moreno castilla 2004 however this removal process only transfers the contaminants from the liquid phase to the solid phase and the contaminants are not actually degraded in addition during the adsorption process ac gradually loses its activity and needs treatment after it is exhausted the exhausted ac is usually incinerated or landfilled to prevent secondary pollution wang and balasubramanian 2009 these disposal methods have resulted in the waste of resources and energy so ac regeneration technologies that are more environmental friendly should be developed currently thermal regeneration is the most commonly used regeneration method thermal regeneration at high temperature can restore over 80 adsorption capacity of ac alvarez et al 2004 marques et al 2017 however the drawbacks of thermal regeneration are also obvious as reported ac could lose mass during the thermal regeneration due to the carbon burn off this problem could be more severe after repeated thermal regenerations ania et al 2004 san miguel et al 2001 moreover this method consumes large amount of energy which leads to high operation cost thus affecting the application of activated carbon adsorption technology in wastewater treatment hutchins 1973 in the past decades electrochemical regeneration appeared as a promising technology for regeneration of exhausted ac mcquillan et al 2018 narbaitz and cen 1994 compared with thermal regeneration electrochemical regeneration could be operated in situ with less energy consumption electrochemical methods require a relatively short time for ac regeneration in a process which pollutants are oxidized by the anode zhang 2002 panizza and cerisola 2009 martínez huitle and panizza 2018 in addition ac can maintain its pore structure without apparent mass loss during electrochemical regeneration garcia oton et al 2005 narbaitz and cen 1994 however traditional electrochemical regeneration always causes secondary pollution a large number of studies have shown that although the regeneration efficiency could reach 70 95 toxic byproducts such as benzoquinone phenolic derived oligomers and polymers were produced in traditional electrochemical regeneration methods of phenol saturated ac these byproducts pose significant threat to human health so the effluent needs further treatment before discharge hussain et al 2013 karimi jashni and narbaitz 2005 in addition the transformation products which are produced by anodic oxidation could be adsorbed on the surface of the anode zhan et al 2016a 2016b those are the limiting factors for the practical application of electrochemical regeneration therefore it is necessary to develop an environmentally friendly and energy efficient technology of ac regeneration which could regenerate ac in situ while mineralizing the adsorbed pollutants thus reducing regeneration cost and eliminating secondary pollution peroxydisulfate pds can be activated by electrochemical methods to generate sulfate radical s o 4 which has been shown to be efficient for the degradation of refractory organic pollutants bu et al 2019 li et al 2019 yan et al 2017 s o 4 based processes had been used in the regeneration of phenol spent granular activated carbon gac and the regeneration efficiency could reach nearly 60 however the regeneration mechanism was not explored in depth huang et al 2017 although extensive research studies have confirmed that s o 4 based processes could mineralize pollutants effectively in water bu et al 2019 yan et al 2017 s o 4 based processes seem not to perform well in the regeneration of spent gac no matter the approach used to optimize the operating parameters i e pds concentration current intensity regeneration time the process could not achieve higher gac regeneration efficiency huang et al 2017 these previous results trigger the following question are there some limitations presented in the s o 4 based processes that affect the regeneration of activated carbon these need to be further explored in our previous studies the electrochemical methods employed could activate pds more effectively with activated carbon fiber acf cathode compared with inert metal cathode liu et al 2018 acf is mainly used as an initiator rather than a catalyst in this system the presence of electric field could prevent acf from being destroyed by the oxidation of pds and generated ros after long time service therefore using the spent acf as cathode and regenerating it by electrochemical activation of pds e pds in situ could theoretically regenerate exhausted acf while degrading organic pollutants this technology might reduce secondary treatment cost and eliminate the risk of environmental pollution in addition to the best of our knowledge there is no research about electrochemical activation of pds e pds to regenerate spent acf while using spent acf as cathode thus the purpose of this study was to assess the regeneration efficiency of acf in electrochemical activation of pds system with saturated acf as cathode phenol as an important chemical in industry was selected as the model compound the main objectives of this study were to investigate i the adsorption capacity of acf for phenol and benzoquinone as well as the desorption of phenol from the surface of saturated acf during e pds process ii the degradation and re adsorption of target organic pollutant on acf during e pds process iii the contribution of different ros iv the limitations of e pds regeneration process and v the variation of the adsorption capacity and structures of acf during four cycles regeneration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the information of acf and chemicals are listed in text s1 all solutions used in this study were prepared with ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm 2 2 adsorption of phenol and benzoquinone bq pieces of acfs 0 2 g 5 0 cm 3 5 cm 3 mm were first soaked in boiling ultrapure water for 2 h and dried at 38 c for 24 h before adsorption then the acfs were added to sealed glass flasks which contained 200 ml phenol solutions with a range of predetermined concentrations then the sealed flasks were placed in a shaker zwy 2102c zhicheng shanghai co with rotating speed at 200 rpm and constant temperature at 25 c for 24 h the adsorption equilibrium values

conducted in a glass column 500 ml 5 cm 5 cm 12 cm with a dc power source pt plated titanium 5 cm 3 5 cm was used as both anode and cathode phenol saturated acf was fixed in the cathode by titanium wire the distance between the electrodes was 2 0 cm na2so4 0 20 m was used as electrolyte solution in traditional electrochemical regeneration while pds was used as electrolyte solution in e pds regeneration all experiments were conducted under constant temperature 298 k and rotating speed 800 rpm 2 4 analytical methods phenol and its main byproducts bq hydroquinone hq catechol cat maleic acid ma and fumaric acid fa were identified and quantified by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a cosmosil c18 column the test parameters of hplc were described in detail in text s2 total organic carbon toc was evaluated using a toc lcph analyzer shimadzu co japan pds was measured by a ki method at 354 nm liang et al 2008 the contents of organic matter adsorbed and remained in regenerated acf were evaluated according to the following method after regeneration the acfs were agitated in a mixed solution of 10 1 0 m naoh and 90 ethanol with the assist of ultrasound and stirring for 30 min each hamdaoui et al 2005 the acfs were collected after repeating the procedures twice this method could recover more than 97 of phenol adsorbed on acf trellu et al 2018 nitrogen gas was purged into mixed solution to eliminate the ethanol before toc measurement the regeneration efficiency re of phenol saturated acf was calculated by comparing the adsorption capacity of regenerated acf qe r and virgin acf qe 0 according to eq 2 2 r e q e r q e 0 the relative contribution of different reactions was estimated by comparing the observed first order rate constants of phenol removal in each independent reaction kindependent and in the e acf pds process according to eq 3 3 c o n t r i b u t i o n k i n d e p e n d e n t k e a c f p d s 2 5 characterization of acf a scanning electron microscope sem tescan inc usa was used to examine the morphologies of acf samples the porosity analysis and brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of acfs before and after regeneration were evaluated with an asap 2020m instrument n2 adsorption 77 k 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of phenol and bq onto acf the adsorption isotherms of phenol and bq are presented in fig s1 and table s1 all isotherms can be fitted well by both the freundlich and the langmuir models indicting that two compounds are adsorbed on the acf with varied energies of adsorption kumar et al 2007 compared with the traditional granular activated carbons gacs the acf used in this research had a higher maximum adsorption capacity of phenol 3 00 mmol g 1 which was due to the relatively higher bet surface area of acf 952 m2 g 1 in addition the maximum adsorption capacity of bq on acf is 2 84 mmol g 1 the higher adsorption capacity of phenol was caused by 1 the strong π π interactions between phenol and acf and 2 the relatively higher hydrophobicity of phenol liu et al 2010 3 2 comparison of e na2so4 and e pds regeneration phenol saturated acf was used as cathode and regenerated by e pds and e na2so4 processes as shown in fig s1 the maximum of phenol adsorbed on acf was about 3 00 mmol g 1 corresponding to the concentrations of phenol as 1 20 mm 112 8 mg l 1 in theory and toc as 86 4 mg c l 1 in theory in the electrochemical regeneration reactor the transfer of phenol between solution and saturated acf was explored as can be seen in fig 1 only 40 95 of phenol was desorbed from saturated acf in the control experiment no current supplied this process reached the equilibrium within 60 min meanwhile the desorption process only transferred phenol from acf to the solution without toc mineralization in the process however almost 96 of initial adsorbed phenol was transferred from acf to solution after e na2so4 regeneration within 60 min table s2 it was reported that the increase of ph which is due to the generation of oh at cathode could cause electrostatic repulsion between phenol and activated carbon surface then promote desorption of phenol from acf berenguer et al 2010 in addition sodium phenate which was difficult to be adsorbed on acf was produced under electric field leading to the desorption of phenol zhang 2002 as shown in fig 1 phenol concentration in the solution phenolsol rapidly increased to 82 36 mg l 1 during the first 15 min and decreased to 18 94 mg l 1 gradually in 360 min the results demonstrated that 83 21 of initial adsorbed phenol was degraded in the e na2so4 regeneration process considering those results e na2so4 regeneration seems an effective method to regenerate phenol saturated acfs however fig 2 shows that the concentration of toc in solution tocsol increased rapidly within the first 60 min then it stay steady during the rest of test almost 84 79 of the initial adsorbed toc remained in the solution after regeneration for 360 min in addition the solution was transformed into yellowish brown from colorless it was reported that the phenol desorbed in solution could be oxidized at the anode to form toxic byproducts phenol derived oligomers which show yellowish brown color in solution zhan et al 2016b therefore e na2so4 process is not an environmentally friendly regeneration method although the e na2so4 regeneration could effectively remove phenol from acf the generation of more toxic byproducts could increase the difficulty of the treatment of regeneration solution by comparison the concentration of phenolsol and tocsol rapidly increased due to the rapid desorption of phenol from acf during e pds regeneration process shown in figs 1 and 2 over 90 of initial adsorbed phenol was removed from acf within 60 min table s2 the results demonstrated that phenol could also be desorbed from acf rapidly in e pds regeneration process meanwhile only 28 37 of the initial adsorbed toc was in the solution after regeneration for 360 min which was much lower than that in e na2so4 regeneration solutions no phenol derived oligomers were observed in the solution during the e pds regeneration process note the solution remained colorless during regeneration which was mainly attributed to the strong oxidizing ability of the e pds regeneration process in addition fig s2 showed that acf cathode could remove phenol more efficiently than an inert metal cathode this was probably due to the fact that acf as cathode could activate peroxide more effectively which had been demonstrated in our preliminary studies liu et al 2018 2019 therefore saturated acf as cathode could effectively promote the degradation of phenol and its derivatives in the e pds regeneration process in e pds and traditional electrochemical regeneration processes only electric energy was consumed in toc mineralization thus the parameter of electrical energy per order ee o was calculated to compare the energy consumption of these two processes the equation and illustration are shown in text s3 as shown in table s3 the energy consumed in e pds regeneration process 5 91 kwh m 3 is only 1 6 of that in traditional electrochemical regeneration 34 92 kwh m 3 therefore compared with e na2so4 regeneration the e pds regeneration could greatly reduce the energy consumption of toc mineralization and the potential risks of the regeneration effluents 3 3 degradation and re adsorption of phenol and its main byproducts during e pds regeneration the evolution of phenol and toc in total adsorbed on acf and in the solution describe as phenoltotal and toctotal was explored during e pds generation process fig 3 a as can be seen in fig 3 a the degradation of phenoltotal and the mineralization of toctotal mainly occurred in the first 180 min regeneration the phenoltotal degradation efficiency and toctotal mineralization efficiency decreased significantly in the later 180 min regeneration meanwhile the evolution of phenolsol and main byproductssol is shown in fig 3 b the concentration of phenolsol increased to 35 59 mg l 1 the peak of the curve rapidly within the first 15 min meanwhile the concentrations of bq catechol cat hydroquinone hq maleic acid ma and fumaric acid fa in the solution were all less than 0 10 mg l 1 the results demonstrated that the phenol desorbed and degraded in the solution was mostly mineralized to co2 and h2o in the early stage of the regeneration then the concentration of phenolsol decreased rapidly accompanied by a tocsol mineralization within the first 180 min while bq cat hq ma and fa were accumulated gradually in the solution however the concentration of phenolsol and bqsol declined gradually accompanied by only slight tocsol mineralization in the later 180 min regeneration meanwhile a large amount of hqsol was accumulated therefore the degraded phenolsol and bqsol was mainly converted to hqsol as byproduct rather than being completely mineralized to co2 and h2o in the last 180 min regeneration the concentration of pds in solution was the dominant factor for determining the concentration of ros under the condition of constant current and temperature xu et al 2017 to explain the results mentioned above the evolution of pds decomposition was monitored during the e pds regeneration process as shown in fig 3 c the residual ratio of pds in the solution was less than 20 after reaction for 180 min this led to a significant reduction of ros generation in the e pds process which was mainly due to the decrease of s 2 o 8 2 concentration as shown in eqs 4 and 5 chen and huang 2015 with the decrease of pds concentration anodic oxidation became gradually the main way of phenol degradation the accumulation of hqsol enhanced as pds concentration decreased to 20 it was reported that bq was one of the main byproducts of phenol formed by anodic oxidation berenguer et al 2010 meanwhile bq could be reduced to hq during the electrochemical process bailey et al 1983 mousset et al 2016 trellu also observed similar behavior during electro fenton regeneration of phenol saturated acf trellu et al 2018 these byproducts accumulated in the solution could be re adsorbed on the acf thereby reducing the regeneration efficiency of the acf therefore the accumulation of byproducts including hq bq and cat after regeneration for 180 min was mainly due to the decrease of pds concentration in solution 4 s 2 o 8 2 e s o 4 s o 4 2 5 s o 4 h 2 o h s o 4 2 o h the toc accumulated in the regeneration solution might be re adsorbed on the acf thus decreasing the regeneration efficiency fig 3 a and fig s3 show the evolution of phenol toc and main oxidation byproducts adsorbed on acf as shown in fig 3 a the concentration of phenol adsorbed on acf decreased rapidly in the first 60 min and reached the lowest value at 180 min the main reason was that phenol could be rapidly removed from acf into solution due to the electrostatic repulsive interactions in the early stage of regeneration however phenol was not desorbed completely as the result of irreversible adsorption of phenol on acf which was also reported in other studies narbaitz and mcewen 2012 zhan et al 2016b meanwhile the byproducts of hq bq and cat accumulated gradually on acf shown in fig s3 as illustrated in fig s4 the color of the solution changed from colorless to yellowish brown after organic compounds desorbed from regenerated acf ultrasound 10 1 0 m naoh and 90 ethanol indicating that phenol derived oligomers are formed berenguer et al 2010 contrary to the degradation trend of toc the regeneration efficiency of acf gradually decreased with the increase of regeneration time shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 3 a the concentration of tocacf toc adsorbed on acf increased from 21 6 to 23 8 mg g 1 as regeneration time increased from 180 min to 360 min as a result the lost of adsorption capacity could attribute to the re adsorption of phenol and its byproducts 3 4 the mechanism of phenol mineralization and acf regeneration 3 4 1 determining the ros usually the ros could be determined by adding excess of different radical scavengers dong et al 2019 yang et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 however adding excess of radical scavengers directly to the regeneration process could affect the adsorption equilibrium of phenol on acf therefore in this study the degradation of phenol during the e pds regeneration process was simulated by e acf pds process in which pristine acf no phenol adsorbed was used as cathode a series of experiments was conducted to determine the ros and estimate the relative contributions both sulfate radicals e0 2 6 v and hydroxyl radicals e0 3 1 v are the main possible oxidizing species generated in the electrochemical activation of pds liu et al 2018 to determine the reactive species the effects of tba and meoh were explored as reported meoh could react with both oh and s o 4 at relatively high rate constants 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 for oh and 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 for s o 4 whereas tba could only react with oh at a relatively high rate constant 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 for oh and 7 6 105 m 1 s 1 for s o 4 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 as illustrated in fig 5 a the removal ratio of phenol decreased from 80 86 to 37 87 in the presence of 1 m meoh after reaction for 30 min while it decreased from 80 86 to 43 71 in the presence of 1 m tba the obviously higher inhibition of meoh than tba on the phenol removal indicated that both oh and s o 4 should contribute to the degradation of phenol 3 4 2 estimation of the relative contribution on phenol degradation during e pds regeneration in the e pds regeneration process phenol can be degraded mainly through the following routes direct electron transfer det pds oxidation nonradical oxidation and ros oxidation we assumed that the generated ros oh and s o 4 in the e pds process could be scavenged completely by 1 m meoh the improved inhibition effect of phenol removal by 10 m meoh was negligible compared with 1 m meoh in this process as shown in fig s5 as shown in fig s6 all relevant processes follow first order kinetics r2 0 95 the proportions of det pds oxidation nonradical oxidation and ros oxidation are shown in fig 5 b the specific calculations are presented in the table 1 as the concentration of pds decreased from 100 mm to 20 mm the contribution proportion of ros oxidation decreased from 84 16 to 63 75 while the contribution proportion of det increased from 11 75 to 31 61 moreover the apparent rate constant on phenol degradation by ros oxidation decreased to less than 30 of the initial value as pds concentration decreased to 20 mm therefore the accumulation of byproducts increased significantly after regeneration for 180 min overall these results illustrated that ros oxidation played a dominant role in phenol and its byproducts degradation during e pds regeneration moreover the relative contributions of oh and s o 4 on phenol degradation were estimated by the method described in text s4 and the results are summarized in table s4 the contribution of s o 4 oxidation in phenol degradation decreased from 60 33 to 43 39 as pds concentration decreased from 100 mm to 20 mm while the steady state concentration of s o 4 decreased from 4 41 10 12 to 1 18 10 12 m in aqueous solution in order to compare the degradation rate of phenol hq and bq by sulfate radical alone 1 m tba was added to quench oh in the e pds process as shown in fig s7 the degradation efficiency of phenol by s o 4 was much higher than those of hq and bq which was in accordance with the accumulation of hq and bq during e pds process in general s o 4 oxidation played a major role in phenol degradation by ros in the e pds process 3 5 regeneration of acf with twice dosing of pds separately from the description above the accumulation of intermediates and phenol in acf which was caused by the decrease of steady state concentration of s o 4 could affect the regeneration efficiency of acf in the e pds process in order to maintain a high level of mineralization efficiency in e pds process the initial concentration of pds was increased to 200 mm as shown in fig 6 a and b there was still 27 25 of pds remaining after regeneration for 6 h compared with the addition of 100 mm pds more tocsol was mineralized with the addition of 200 mm pds the final concentration of toc was 11 26 mg c l 1 however from the standpoint of operation cost it is advisable to try to lower the consumption of pds in pds activated process s o 4 could react with pds to form persulfate radical which only offers weak oxidizing ability eq 6 excessive high concentrations of pds could promote side reactions eqs 6 8 which can lead to unnecessary consumption of pds wang and zhou 2016 c carvalho de almeidaa et al 2019 moreover as can be seen in fig 6 c the regeneration efficiency of acf was reduced significantly at a higher concentration of pds even though the initial adsorbed toc was removed at a larger extent 6 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 7 h s o 4 2 o h s o 4 h 2 o 8 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 to improve the utilization efficiency of pds the method of adding a total of 100 mm pds in two separate doses 50 mm pds at the beginning and 180 min respectively was explored in this study compared with the addition of all 100 mm pds for once adding the same dose of pds at twice separately could keep its concentration at a relatively high value shown in fig 6 b meanwhile the final concentration of tocsol was reduced to 18 82 mg c l 1 shown in fig 6 a the results demonstrated that the mineralization efficiency of the addition of pds at twice was higher than the addition of all pds for once at the same total dose amount at the beginning though the total consumption of pds was the same multiple dosing could ensure the concentration of pds in a suitable range neither too low that affects the generation of sulfate radicals nor too high that promotes side reactions as can be seen in fig s8 compared with once dosing twice dosing could decrease the accumulation of organics phenolsol and hqsol obviously moreover the regeneration efficiency of acf could also be improved by twice dosing pds as shown in fig 6 c therefore multiple dosing should be better for practical application of the acf regeneration process 3 6 the limitations of e pds regeneration process as mentioned above twice dosing could decrease the accumulation of byproducts significantly while the regeneration efficiency of acf only increased from 63 to 66 meanwhile according to the results of fig s1 and table s1 the maximum adsorption capacity of toc in acf was 216 mg g 1 however the concentration of toc adsorbed on acf after 6 h regeneration was only about 24 mg g 1 fig 3 a as a result the regeneration efficiency of acf in e pds system should be more than 80 or more in theory however the actual regeneration efficiency was only about 63 the results illustrated that the accumulation of intermediate products and phenol in acf was not an exclusive factor that affects the regeneration efficiency of acf in e pds process there should be other important factors affecting the regeneration of acf some studies pointed out that the structure of carbon materials could be destroyed in persulfate solution thereby affecting the performance of materials eq 9 lee et al 2013 liang et al 2009 to investigate the effect of pds on the adsorption capacity of acf in e pds process virgin acfs were treated in pds and sodium sulfate solution for 6 h then soaked in 200 ml phenol solution 1600 mg l 1 to test the adsorption capacity of treated acfs respectively as can be seen from fig 7 the adsorption capacity of acf after being treated in sodium sulfate solution was almost the same as that of virgin acf while the adsorption capacity of acf was only about 65 of that of virgin acf after being treated in pds solution no current the sem images also showed that acf was severely damaged in pds solution fig 8 c all those results demonstrated that pds could destroy the pore structure of acf and affect its adsorption capacity 9 a c f s 2 o 8 2 a c f s o 4 10 a c f e a c f 11 s 2 o 8 2 e a c f s o 4 s o 4 2 however the maximum adsorption capacity of acf remained more than 80 of the initial capacity with current applied as shown in fig 7 the acf maximum adsorption capacity could even reach 90 of the initial capacity with 0 5 a current applied besides the sem images showed that acf was barely destroyed in pds solution with 1 a current applied for 180 min fig 8 d meanwhile the data of bet vmicropore and smicropore showed that the properties of acf could be better maintained in pds solution with current applied shown in table 2 all the results demonstrated that the current could protect the acf from pds oxidation in our previous study acf could obtain electrons from the applied electric field at cathode thereby avoiding pds oxidation eq 10 liu et al 2018 the pds activated process could be described as eq 11 in which acf served as a catalyst rather than an initiator it was worth noticing that acf adsorption capacity still had nearly 10 20 decrement especially at relatively higher current intensities increasing the current intensity in electrolyte solution sodium sulfate only has slight impact on the adsorption capacity of acf shown in fig 7 it means that the current could not affect the adsorption capacity of acf however the acf maximum adsorption capacity q0 qe0 decreased from 90 to below 80 when current intensity increased from 0 5 a to 2 0 a shown in fig 7 as is known ros oxidation enhances with the increase of current intensity in electrochemical activated pds process therefore the loss of acf adsorption capacity in e acf pds process might be affected by the ros generated in the system that could oxidize acf continually and the pds adsorbed on the acf that could oxidize acf after application of current ended this limitation could exist in all carbon material activated pds technology therefore how to avoid the oxidation of acf by ros requires further exploration in the e pds regeneration system 3 7 evaluation of multiple regeneration cycles as mentioned earlier pds concentration addition method of pds and current intensity could affect the mineralization of phenol and regeneration efficiency of acf in e pds regeneration systems however it is contradictory between mineralization capacity and regeneration efficiency in this system complete mineralization accompanied with a significant reduction in regeneration efficiency considering both the mineralization efficiency of pollutants and the regeneration efficiency of acf the optimal operating condition was selected for multiple regenerations adding pds twice pds concentration 100 mm regeneration time 6 h current intensity 1 a the regeneration efficiency of acf during four cycles is shown in fig 9 compared with a regeneration efficiency of 66 33 in the first cycle the efficiency of the fourth cycle decreased to 34 12 meanwhile the bet surface area decreased significantly after four cycles shown in table 2 the loss of adsorption capacity was mainly due to the blockage of acf micro pores by the accumulation of phenol hq phenol derived oligomers and other degradation byproducts as well as the partial damage of acf by ros oxidation compared with the first cycle the structure of acf after four cycles was severely damaged as seen from sem image in fig 8 e f the regeneration efficiency decreased to below 40 after four times of regeneration therefore the regenerability of ac in the e pds process is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to be able to use ac for more than three times 4 conclusions the results illustrated that e pds process is an effective and sustainable technology for the regeneration of phenol saturated acf compared with e na2so4 regeneration e pds system could mineralize organic pollutants more efficiently with lower energy consumption thereby reducing secondary pollution the estimation of relative contribution demonstrated that s o 4 played a major role in phenol degradation therefore the accumulation of byproducts in solution which could be re adsorbed on acf mainly occurred after pds was largely consumed improving the addition method of pds twice dosing could increase the regeneration efficiency of acf and reduce the accumulation of byproducts unfortunately twice dosing could not prevent the damage of acf against ros oxidation thereby leading to the reduction of acf adsorption capacity this limitation should be aware of in all carbon materials activated peroxide technologies finally multiple regeneration experiments showed that acf still remained relatively high adsorption capacity nearly 40 after three cycles regeneration therefore e pds process is promising for large scale application in phenolic compounds saturated acs regeneration we hope that the findings will provide reference for future studies and application of sulfate radical based aops in practical water treatment systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18227,aerobic ammonia oxidation an important part of the global nitrogen cycle is thought to be jointly driven by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa in coastal wetlands however the activities and contributions of aoa and aob in coastal wetlands have remained largely unknown here we investigated the oxidation capability of aoa and aob in four types of typical coastal wetlands paddy estuary shallow and reed wetland in the bohai region in china using dna based stable isotope probing dna sip quantitative pcr and high throughput sequencing techniques we found that the community structure of aob varied substantially and the aoa structure was more stable across different coastal wetlands the rate of aoa was 0 12 0 84 0 45 and 0 93 μg n g 1 soil d 1 in paddy estuary shallow and reed wetlands and the rate of aob was 5 61 10 72 0 74 and 1 16 μg n g 1 soil d 1 respectively we found that the contribution of aoa gradually increased from paddy to estuary to shallow wetland and finally to reed wetland with values of 2 03 7 25 37 53 and 44 51 respectively our results provide new insight into the mechanisms of the differences in activities and the contributions of aoa and aob in different coastal wetlands and our findings may contribute to further understanding of the global nitrogen cycle graphical abstract the 13c labeled dna was obtained after isotopic incubation and dna sip selection high throughput sequencing technology was used to analyse microbial community structure to evaluate cell specific activity for aoa and aob quantitative pcr was used to measure gene abundance to calculate cell numbers for aoa and aob finally aoa and aob activity were provided in four coastal wetlands image 1 keywords aoa aob ammonia oxidizing activity coastal wetlands 1 introduction serving as buffer zones between the marine zones and inland regions coastal wetlands are among the regions most vulnerable and sensitive to global environment change yu et al 2016 the differences in land use form various microbial patterns which further change the biogeochemical cycle in coastal wetlands the nitrogen cycle is one of the most important element cycles in coastal wetlands around the world coastal wetlands play a significant role as a buffer zone between inland and marine ecosystems in the nitrogen cycle as the first and rate limiting step of nitrification ammonia oxidation is a key process in the global nitrogen cycle pratscher et al 2011 to date ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob have been considered to be jointly responsible for the ammonia oxidation process jc v et al 2004 könneke et al 2005 hatzenpichler et al 2008 de la torre et al 2008 jia and conrad 2009 aoa and aob have been reported to present different abundance community structure and activity patterns in different biotopes however the mechanisms for the differences in the activities and contributions of aoa and aob in coastal wetlands is still unclear generally it has been proposed that aoa contributes more to ammonia oxidation in wetlands than aob for aoa was often reported to be outnumber by aob by about an order of magnitude in various types of wetlands treusch et al 2005 leininger et al 2006 shen et al 2008 yarwood et al 2013 at the same time the half saturation constant for ammonium for some cultured aoa strains martens habbena et al 2009 jung et al 2011 kim et al 2012 was much lower than aob strains which revealed that aoa had a greater affinity for substrates and had competitive advantages over aob particularly in oligotrophic environments verhamme et al 2011 however the abundance of the amoa gene transcript or protein was not sufficient to explain ammonia oxidation activity pester et al 2011 as aoa had a much lower growth rate and lower cell specific ammonia oxidation activity compared to aob belser 1979 jiang and bakken 1999 tourna et al 2011 aoa was thought to be less significant than aob although it possessed a numerically dominant abundance a better approach may be to evaluate the contribution of aoa and aob from the perspectives of both abundance and community structure which could reflect the variance of cell specific ammonia oxidation activity in a previous study cell specific activity and gene abundance were used to reveal the contribution of aoa and aob schauss et al 2009 however the researchers used several groups of cell specific activity data without rigorous consideration of the microbial community structure which made the results unreliable several studies measured and compared the nitrification potentials of aoa and aob through the method of inhibitor experiments in which acetylene 1 octyne allylthiourea atu sulfadiazine dicyandiamide and antibiotics have been used as inhibitors some antibiotics showed little inhibitory effect on aoa while a strong inhibitory effect on aob which make them be exploited to distinguish the activities of aoa and aob schauss et al 2009 lehtovirta morley et al 2011 shen et al 2013 zheng et al 2014 however this method could only provide a rough recognition of aoa and aob activity and could not explain the variance in the activity of aoa and aob moreover research regarding aoa enrichment proposed that it was not sufficient to measure the activity of aoa and aob using inhibitors jung et al 2011 zhalnina et al 2014 the results that aoa was also inhibited or that aob was not completely inhibited suggested that the method of using inhibitors was not robust more advanced dna stable isotope probe dna sip methods have been applied to investigate active archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidizers jia and conrad 2009 zhang et al 2010 wang et al 2014 both aoa and aob have been indirectly shown to be active and dominant in ammonia oxidation in different studies through a single label of the archaeal or bacterial amoa gene however in most cases both archaeal and bacterial amoa genes were labeled and this result led to a continued debate about how to use active microbial abundance to evaluate activities weiwei et al 2011 to date the activities of aoa and aob remain controversial dna sip was effective for distinguishing active ammonia oxidizers while high throughput sequencing technology could provide a clear recognition of active aoa and aob microbial structures the active cell numbers and weighted cell specific activity for aoa and aob could be reflected by active gene abundance and microbial community structure respectively on the basis of this assumption the archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation capabilities could be synthetically assessed in this study we aimed to investigate the activities and contributions of aoa and aob in different coastal wetlands paddy fields pf estuary wetlands ew shallow wetlands sw and reed wetlands rw in the bohai region in china were chosen to perform laboratory isotopic incubation our results first revealed the mechanism for the difference in activities and contributions of aoa and aob in various coastal wetlands based on the abundance and community structure of active aoa and aob which may provide new insights about the role of aoa and aob in the global nitrogen cycle 2 methods 2 1 sampling and characteristics measurement sampling was conducted in july 2012 soil sediment samples were collected from four types of wetlands along the coastline of the bohai rim 34 23 43 29 n and 113 23 125 50 e fig s1 namely in paddies estuary wetlands reed wetlands and shallow wetlands at each sampling site five individual soil sediment cores were

chloride was added to all groups the flasks were incubated at 30 c and the mud was sampled after 24 h incubation to define the total ammonia oxidation rate group a and the archaeal ammonia oxidation rate group b through analyses of nitrite concentration changes the bacterial ammonia oxidation rate was determined by subtracting group b from group a 2 3 microcosm incubation and stable isotope probing of active ammonia oxidizers the dna sip microcosms were constructed in 120 ml serum bottles with 20 g samples and a 50 ml nahco3 solution sealed with rubber stoppers and plastic caps the air

carbon ic sources for each sample two groups of microcosms were supplemented respectively by two ic sources one was 100 mg l 1 nah12co3 and 5 12co2 and the other was 100 mg l 1 nah13co3 and 5 13co2 sigma aldrich co st louis mo usa all treatments were performed in triplicate microcosms and incubated at 30 c in the dark the sodium bicarbonates were added into the corresponding microcosms every

used for the determination of potential nitrifying activity dna was extracted from the soil samples using a fast soil dna kit d5625 01 omega usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and purity of extracted soil dna was determined with a nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher wilmington ma usa sip gradient fractionation was performed as previously described weiwei et al 2011 for each treatment approximately 3 μg of the total dna extracted from the incubated soils was mixed with a cscl stock solution to achieve an initial cscl buoyant density of 1 725 g ml 1 to separate 12c and 13c enriched dna the isopycnic density centrifugation was performed using a 5 1 ml quick seal polyallomer ultracentrifugation tube in a vti65 2 vertical rotor beckman coulter inc palo alto ca usa the 13c labeled dna was separated from the original dna by ultracentrifugation at 177 000 g for 44 h at 20 c dna fractions were obtained by displacing the gradient medium with sterile water from the top of the ultracentrifuge tube using a syringe pump new era pump systems inc farmingdale ny usa approximately 14 dna gradient fractions were obtained with equal volumes of approximately 380 μl and the refractive index of each fraction was measured using an ar200 digital hand held refractometer reichert inc buffalo ny usa the fractionated dna was purified and dissolved

obtained from isopycnic centrifugation of the total dna extracts was used for further sequencing analysis pyrosequencing of the amoa gene for aoa and aob was performed using the primers arch amoa26f arch amoa417r park et al 2010 and amoa 1f amoa 2r rotthauwe et al 1997 respectively table s5 carried out by majorbio shanghai china using illumina miseq sequencing chimera free amoa gene sequences were grouped into otus using a 97 similarity as a cut off and the mothur program was used to generate the otu based shannon diversity index and rarefaction curve schloss et al 2009 phylogenetic analysis of the aoa or aob community was performed using mega6 software with the neighbor joining and maximum parsimony methods tamura et al 2013 the raw sequence data have been deposited at the ncbi with the accession number srp237701 2 6 evaluation of aoa and aob capability the evaluation of aoa and aob capability was carried out by a combination of active microbial cell number and cell specific activity the active cell number was defined by the microbial abundance assuming that each aob and aoa cell contained 2 5 and 1 0 of the amoa gene copy the cell specific activity was calculated as follows q i 1 n p i c i r i where q stands for the weighted cell specific activity of ammonia oxidizers pi stands for the cell specific activity of i clusters that had been reported previously ci stands for the proportion of i clusters in the total microbial community and ri stands for the corrected coefficient for the i cluster under different soil conditions the corrected coefficient is summarized from previous studies watson et al 1971 belser 1979 stein and arp 1998 jiang and bakken 1999 and presented in table s3 2 7 statistical analyses data processing and analysis were performed with spss statistics 20 ibm usa a priori p value of p 0 05 was deﬁned to test signiﬁcant difference 3 results 3 1 measured potential ammonia oxidation activity the potential ammonia oxidation activity was assessed by measuring changes in the nitrite concentration during incubation with penicillin the measured total ammonia oxidation activity was 5 93 13 36 1 16 and 3 24 μg n g 1 soil d 1 in pf ew sw and rw respectively fig s6 the estuary wetland had the highest potential ammonia oxidation activity compared with paddy shallow and reed wetlands the measured activities and contributions of archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation were also calculated the measured contributions of aoa were 25 40 45 98 49 99 and 50 25 in pf ew sw and rw fig s7 respectively 3 2 quantification of archaeal and bacterial amoa genes the growth of aoa and aob during the incubation period was determined by the quantification of archaeal and bacterial amoa genes using quantitative pcr qpcr at days 0 and 56 the copy numbers of the archaeal amoa genes increased by 4 84 4 32 9 91 and 40 2 fold in the 13c incubated microorganisms of pf ew sw and rw respectively specifically the copy numbers increased from 8 76 105 to 4 24 106 6 30 106 to 2 72 107 1 37 106 to 1 36 107 and 8 40 106 to 3 38 107 copies g 1 soil respectively fig s3 the copy numbers of the bacterial amoa genes increased by 31 8 6 74 and 13 6 fold in the 13c incubated microorganisms of pf ew and sw respectively specifically the copy numbers increased from 1 80 105 to 5 73 106 9 93 105 to 6 69 106 and 1 71 105 to 2 32 106 copies g 1 soil respectively fig s3 however the copy numbers of bacterial amoa genes in rw decreased from 2 14 106 to 1 26 106 copies g 1 soil 3 3 dna sip analysis of aoa and aob dna sip was used to determine the active microbial functions responsible for real ammonia oxidation ultracentrifugation of the total extracted dna was performed to separate 12c and 13c enriched dna in four soils after incubation for 56 days real time quantitative pcr of archaeal and bacterial amoa genes in different fractions suggested strong labeling in four tested soils in 13c labeled control groups the highest abundance of both archaeal and bacterial amoa genes was detected in heavy fractions with a buoyant density approximately 1 735 1 755 g ml 1 higher than that in the 12c labeled control groups approximately 1 725 1 730 g ml 1 fig s4 suggesting that aoa and aob were well labeled through carbon assimilation during their growth furthermore the genes obtained from heavy fractions represented active microbes which may be primarily responsible for ammonia oxidation pratscher et al 2011 the abundance of the active amoa gene for aoa and aob was summarized from heavy fractions and is shown in fig 1 the ratios of gene copy numbers of archaeal amoa genes in heavy dna to all dna fractions was 67 82 66 37 81 08 and 68 22 in pf ew sw and rw respectively meanwhile the ratios for bacterial amoa genes were 61 79 70 43 69 7 and 57 35 respectively table 1 according to previous studies the cell numbers of active aoa and aob could be further calculated assuming that each bacterial and archaeal cell contains 2 5 and 1 0 of the amoa gene copy the cell numbers of active aoa were 2 88 106 1 81 107 1 10 107 and 2 30 107 per g soil in pf ew sw and rw respectively the cell numbers of active aob were 1 41 106 1 88 106 6 47 105 and 2 89 105 per g soil respectively 3 4 diversities of active aoa and aob in different tested soils the archaeal and bacterial amoa genes in the dna samples of the heavy fractions in 13c treated microcosms were analyzed by pyrosequencing after 56 days of incubation the high throughput sequencing of 13c amoa genes provided a clear understanding of the community structure for both active aoa and aob for aoa all sequences from tested soils could be grouped into three clusters group 1 1a which could divided into 2 clusters upon detailed analysis and group 1 1b fig 2 a the proportion of group 1 1a 1 represented by n archaeon my1 was 0 26 and 0 16 in pf and rw it was undetected in ew and sw the proportion of group 1 1a 2 represented by n maritimus scm1 was only detected in ew with a value of 4 34 the proportion of group 1 1b represented by nitrososphaera sp jg1 was 99 74 95 66 100 and 99 84 in pf ew sw and rw respectively for active aob the sequences could be grouped into one cluster of genus nitrosomonas and four clusters of nitrosospira fig 2b the nitrosomonas cluster accounted for 91 68 and 94 52 of the labeled bacterial amoa genes in pf and rw however the proportion decreased in ew and sw the nitrosomonas cluster and nitrosospira multiformis cluster became the two main clusters in ew with values of 54 41 and 43 82 respectively meanwhile the nitrosospira multiformis cluster became dominant in sw accounting for 64 48 of total labeled bacterial amoa genes 3 5 evaluation of activities and contributions of aoa and aob the weighted cell specific activity of aoa and aob were determined by the structure of active microbes depending on the measured aoa and aob data to make the results more reliable cell specific activity was amended with certain fundamental environmental parameters mainly ph value and ammonia concentration the weighted cell specific activity of aoa ranged narrowly from 2 88 to 3 31 femto mol nh3 cell 1 d 1 while that of aob ranged from 81 86 to 406 37 femto mol nh3 cell 1 d 1 fig 3 a combined with the active aoa and aob cell numbers the activity of aoa and aob was then calculated the rate of aoa was 0 12 0 84 0 45 and 0 93 μg n g 1 soil d 1 in pf ew sw and rw respectively and the rate of aob was 5 61 10 72 0 74 and 1 16 μg n g 1 soil d 1 respectively fig 3b 4 discussion dna sip relied entirely on cell proliferation thus providing new insight into functional ammonia oxidizers using active microbial abundance instead of existing abundance wang et al 2014 which may be a more accurate means of assessing the role of aoa and aob previous studies determined the importance of aoa and aob based on existing gene abundance leininger et al 2006 chen et al 2008 however that approach may be insufficient as the microbial community may have no function even with a relatively high abundance in previous studies aoa was confirmed to be solely responsible for ammonia oxidation as there was no aob labeled after isotopic incubation zhang et al 2010 in comparison the role of aob could be determined in the same way if aoa was not labeled by isotope jia and conrad 2009 in our study the successful labeling of the amoa gene by isotope demonstrates the function of both aoa and aob during incubation which differs from previous studies the ratio of active genes to all gene abundance differed among the four biotopes implying a difference in the growth of aoa and aob unfortunately in the cases of labeling both archaeal and bacterial amoa genes the role of aoa and aob could not be determined conclusively the high throughput pyrosequencing of both the archaeal and bacterial amoa gene provided a detailed identification of active aoa and aob in four coastal wetlands the main archaeal composition in the four coastal wetlands was group 1 1b with a composition greater than 95 66 which has been demonstrated to be the primary terrestrial group in the literature wang et al 2014 the result that amoa containing archaeal populations were relatively constant was consistent with previous studies jia and conrad 2009 the stability of archaeal composition reflected the stability of the archaeal community structure across various coastal wetlands with different land use types the land use types of coastal wetlands had little impact on the community structure of archaeal ammonia oxidizers in contrast the community structure of bacterial ammonia oxidizers varied in different biotopes the dominant aoa of pf was the nitrosomonas cluster which corresponded with what has been reported in habitats with high ammonia concentrations hastings et al 1997 taylor and bottomley 2006 the proportion of nitrosospira clusters increased to active microcosms in ew and sw nitrosospira species have often been detected in natural environments kowalchuk and stephen 2001 however the primary proportion was the nitrosomonas cluster in rw the high variance in community structure suggested a large response of bacterial ammonia oxidizers to various land use types the distinct responses of aoa and aob to land use conversion liu et al 2017 nitrogen addition and urea amendment carey et al 2016 supported our results to some extent for cell specific activity the aob has a larger range than aoa across coastal wetland types due to a larger range in community structure the variety of land use types effected the average cell specific activity of aoa to a small extent but had a strong effect on aob activity the results may be determined by the stability of the community structure of aoa in different coastal wetlands based on the existing research that aoa had single amoa gene copies and aob had 2 5 copies per cell okano et al 2004 the cell numbers for both aoa and aob were easily calculated in different wetlands the cell numbers varied for both aoa and aob in four coastal wetlands which implied that aoa and aob may play different roles in different wetlands the ammonia oxidation rate was then calculated by combining cell numbers and cell specific activity in addition the potential ammonia oxidation activity of the total ammonia oxidizers aoa and aob was measured using penicillin which inhibited the activity of aob in order to present a comparison with our evaluated results the contributions of aoa in all wetlands were lower than the results measured by penicillin the higher results measured by penicillin fig s7 may be caused by the considerable expression abundance of the aob amoa gene fig s8 the activity and contribution of aoa would be overestimated if aob was not completely inhibited by penicillin the highest expression abundance of aob amoa implied that the contribution of aoa may be largely overestimated in estuary wetlands the community structure of aob was also investigated in detail based on rna the large proportion of nitrosomonas and nitrosospira multiformis clusters fig s8 table s6 which had high cell specific activity suggested that the role of aob cannot be ignored and that the role of aoa was largely overestimated even when considering supplementation with penicillin however our estimates of total ammonia oxidation rates exhibited the same trend as results obtained from experiments fig s6 table s4 suggesting that our evaluation was reliable the ammonia oxidation rates varied for both aoa and aob in different wetlands however the activities of aoa vary little across different land use types compared to aob the aoa activity was low in pf but significantly increased in ew sw and rw this activity may be affected by the higher background ammonia concentration fig s5 although the weighted cell specific activity was extensive in pf the lower abundance led to a considerably lower ammonia oxidation rate for aoa which can be understood from the inhibition of a relatively higher ammonia concentration and which had been previously demonstrated in both field surveys and pure cultures tourna et al 2011 lehtovirta morley et al 2011 the rate of aoa increased by 6 2 75 and 6 75 fold in ew sw and rw compared to pf in such samples with a lower ammonia concentration aoa can survive in oligotrophic conditions martens habbena et al 2009 verhamme et al 2011 thus leading to an increased archaeal ammonia oxidation rate for aob the rate was much higher in pf and ew and significantly decreased in sw and rw which was primarily caused by the lower ammonia affinity of aob compared with aoa in low ammonia concentration areas the contribution of aoa in ammonia oxidation gradually increased from pf to ew to sw and finally to rw with values of 2 03 7 25 37 53 and 44 51 table s4 respectively similarly the contribution of aob was 97 97 92 75 62 47 and 55 49 respectively the value of the 2 03 proportion shows that aoa contributes little in pf whereas the rate of aoa was significantly lower than that of aob anthropogenic activities led to frequent fertilizer addition and higher ammonia concentrations which further illustrated the strong inhibition of aoa although the rate of aoa increased by only 1 11 fold in rw and was even lower in sw when compared with ew the contribution was much higher at approximately 44 51 and 37 53 for rw and sw respectively mainly because of the significant decrease in the aob rate many environmental factors have been reported to have an important effect on aoa and aob abundance and activity caffrey et al 2007 bouskill et al 2012 aob was concluded to be less resistant to oligotrophic conditions under these conditions aoa was more tolerant and in fact increased in activity in favorable environments aoa tends to contribute more to ammonia oxidation 5 conclusion in summary we provide new insights into the mechanisms of variance in activity and the contributions of aoa and aob in different coastal wetlands based on active abundance and community structure our results also suggested that the active community structure of aob varied more strongly among different biotopes and the active community structure of archaeal ammonia oxidizers was more stable furthermore our results also revealed that the contribution of aoa in ammonia oxidation increased from pf to ew to sw and finally to rw aoa may be dominant in coastal wetlands with less nitrogen or nutrient input where aob was inhibited the results thus provide new insights into the mechanisms of variance in aoa and aob activity in different coastal wetlands which may provide a basis for further understanding of the global nitrogen cycle author contributions g d j

investigate active archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidizers jia and conrad 2009 zhang et al 2010 wang et al 2014 both aoa and aob have been indirectly shown to be active and dominant in ammonia oxidation in different studies through a single label of the archaeal or bacterial amoa gene however in most cases both archaeal and bacterial amoa genes were labeled and this result led to a continued debate about how to use active microbial abundance to evaluate activities weiwei et al 2011 to date the activities of aoa and aob remain controversial dna sip was effective for distinguishing active ammonia oxidizers while high throughput sequencing technology could provide a clear recognition of active aoa and aob microbial structures the active cell numbers and weighted cell specific activity for aoa and aob could be reflected by active gene abundance and microbial community structure respectively on the basis of this assumption the archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation capabilities could be synthetically assessed in this study we aimed to investigate the activities and contributions of aoa and aob in different coastal wetlands paddy fields pf estuary wetlands ew shallow wetlands sw and reed wetlands rw in the bohai region in china were chosen to perform laboratory isotopic incubation our results first revealed the mechanism for the difference in activities and contributions of aoa and aob in various coastal wetlands based on the abundance and community structure of active aoa and aob which may provide new insights about the role of aoa and aob in the global nitrogen cycle 2 methods 2 1 sampling and characteristics measurement sampling was conducted in july 2012 soil sediment samples were collected from four types of wetlands along the coastline of the bohai rim 34 23 43 29 n and 113 23 125 50 e fig s1 namely in paddies estuary wetlands reed wetlands and shallow wetlands at each sampling site five individual soil sediment cores were randomly collected from the surface layer with a 30 cm depth and within a 10 10 m area and then composited into a single sample for each site the samples were air dried and then sieved to 2 mm before

shimadzu japan organic carbon was determined with an elemental analyser 2400ii chns o perkinelmer usa 2 2 potential ammonia oxidation activity measured by inhibitors the ammonia oxidation rate for aoa and aob was measured with three replicates in two sets of experiments groups a and b which was designed based on a described previously method zheng et al 2014 the homogenized field moist soil sediment samples 10 0 g were weighed into 150 ml incubation flasks and 80 ml of solution 0 4 g l mgcl2 0 5 g l kcl 0 2 g l kh2po4 1 g l nacl 0 1 g l cacl2 and 10 mm kclo3 fisher scientific was added to each replicate group b was combined with a final concentration of 100 mg l 1 penicillin to inhibit the activity of bacteria after preincubation for one day a final concentration of 0 5 m ammonium chloride was added to all groups the flasks were incubated at 30 c and the mud was sampled after 24 h incubation to define the total ammonia oxidation rate group a and the archaeal ammonia oxidation rate group b through analyses of nitrite concentration changes the bacterial ammonia oxidation rate was determined by subtracting group b from group a 2 3 microcosm incubation and stable isotope probing of active ammonia oxidizers the dna sip microcosms were constructed in 120 ml serum bottles with 20 g samples and a 50 ml nahco3 solution sealed with rubber stoppers and plastic caps the air in the headspace of each bottle was replaced with synthetic air 80 n2 and 20 o2 to remove co2 from the microcosms and external bicarbonates were added to the microcosms as the additional inorganic carbon ic sources for each sample two groups of microcosms were supplemented respectively by two ic sources one was 100 mg l 1 nah12co3 and 5 12co2 and the other was 100 mg l 1 nah13co3 and 5 13co2 sigma aldrich co st louis mo usa all treatments were performed in triplicate microcosms and incubated at 30 c in the dark the sodium bicarbonates were added into the corresponding microcosms every week to maintain a suitable concentration after 56 days of cultivation soils were sampled and then immediately frozen at 80 c for subsequent molecular analysis the remainder of the soil sample was used for the determination of potential nitrifying activity dna was extracted from the soil samples using a fast soil dna kit d5625 01 omega usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and purity of extracted soil dna was determined with a nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher wilmington ma usa sip gradient fractionation was performed as previously described weiwei et al 2011 for each treatment approximately 3 μg of the total dna extracted from the incubated soils was mixed with a cscl stock solution to achieve an initial cscl buoyant density of 1 725 g ml 1 to separate 12c and 13c enriched dna the isopycnic density centrifugation was performed using a 5 1 ml quick seal polyallomer ultracentrifugation tube in a vti65 2 vertical rotor beckman coulter inc palo alto ca usa the 13c labeled dna was separated from the original dna by ultracentrifugation at 177 000 g for 44 h at 20 c dna fractions were obtained by displacing the gradient medium with sterile water from the top of the ultracentrifuge tube using a syringe pump new era pump systems inc farmingdale ny usa approximately 14 dna gradient fractions were obtained with equal volumes of approximately 380 μl and the refractive index of each fraction was measured using an ar200 digital hand held refractometer reichert inc buffalo ny usa the fractionated dna was purified and dissolved in 30 ml of te buffer as previously described freitag et al 2006 2 4 quantitative pcr of amoa genes quantitative pcr qpcr was performed on a myiq2 real time pcr detection system bio rad usa in 20 μl volume reaction mixtures containing the following components 10 μl sybr green i pcr master mix applied biosystems usa 1 μl template dna sample dna or plasmid dna for standard curves forward and reverse primers and sterile water millipore usa the protocol was set as previously described chen et al 2008 2 5 high throughput sequencing for the active amoa gene the heavy dna fractions 2 6 obtained from isopycnic centrifugation of the total dna extracts was used for further sequencing analysis pyrosequencing of the amoa gene for aoa and aob was performed using the primers arch amoa26f arch amoa417r park et al 2010 and amoa 1f amoa 2r rotthauwe et al 1997 respectively table s5 carried out by majorbio shanghai china using illumina miseq sequencing chimera free amoa gene sequences were grouped into otus using a 97 similarity as a cut off and the mothur program was used to generate the otu based shannon diversity index and rarefaction curve schloss et al 2009 phylogenetic analysis of the aoa or aob community was performed using mega6 software with the neighbor joining and maximum parsimony methods tamura et al 2013 the raw sequence data have been deposited at the ncbi with the accession number srp237701 2 6 evaluation of aoa and aob capability the evaluation of aoa and aob capability was carried out by a combination of active microbial cell number and cell specific activity the active cell number was defined by the microbial abundance assuming that each aob and aoa cell contained 2 5 and 1 0 of the amoa gene copy the cell specific activity was calculated as follows q i 1 n p i c i r i where q stands for the weighted cell specific activity of ammonia oxidizers pi stands for the cell specific activity of i clusters that had been reported previously ci stands for the proportion of i clusters in the total microbial community and ri stands for the corrected coefficient for the i cluster under different soil conditions the corrected coefficient is summarized from previous studies watson et al 1971 belser 1979 stein and arp 1998 jiang and bakken 1999 and presented in table s3 2 7 statistical analyses data processing and analysis were performed with spss statistics 20 ibm usa a priori p value of p 0 05 was deﬁned to test signiﬁcant difference 3 results 3 1 measured potential ammonia oxidation activity the potential ammonia oxidation activity was assessed by measuring changes in the nitrite concentration during incubation with penicillin the measured total ammonia oxidation activity was 5 93 13 36 1 16 and 3 24 μg n g 1 soil d 1 in pf ew sw and rw respectively fig s6 the estuary wetland had the highest potential ammonia oxidation activity compared with paddy shallow and reed wetlands the measured activities and contributions of archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation were also calculated the measured contributions of aoa were 25 40 45 98 49 99 and 50 25 in pf ew sw and rw fig s7 respectively 3 2 quantification of archaeal and bacterial amoa genes the growth of aoa and aob during the incubation period was determined by the quantification of archaeal and bacterial amoa genes using quantitative pcr qpcr at days 0 and 56 the copy numbers of the archaeal amoa genes increased by 4 84 4 32 9 91 and 40 2 fold in the 13c incubated microorganisms of pf ew sw and rw respectively specifically the copy numbers increased from 8 76 105 to 4 24 106 6 30 106 to 2 72 107 1 37 106 to 1 36 107 and 8 40 106 to 3 38 107 copies g 1 soil respectively fig s3 the copy numbers of the bacterial amoa genes increased by 31 8 6 74 and 13 6 fold in the 13c incubated microorganisms of pf ew and sw respectively specifically the copy numbers increased from 1 80 105 to 5 73 106 9 93 105 to 6 69 106 and 1 71 105 to 2 32 106 copies g 1 soil respectively fig s3 however the copy numbers of bacterial amoa genes in rw decreased from 2 14 106 to 1 26 106 copies g 1 soil 3 3 dna sip analysis of aoa and aob dna sip was used to determine the active microbial functions responsible for real ammonia oxidation ultracentrifugation of the total extracted dna was performed to separate 12c and 13c enriched dna in four soils after incubation for 56 days real time quantitative pcr of archaeal and bacterial amoa genes in different fractions suggested strong labeling in four tested soils in 13c labeled control groups the highest abundance of both archaeal and bacterial amoa genes was detected in heavy fractions with a buoyant density approximately 1 735 1 755 g ml 1 higher than that in the 12c labeled control groups approximately 1 725 1 730 g ml 1 fig s4 suggesting that aoa and aob were well labeled through carbon assimilation during their growth furthermore the genes obtained from heavy fractions represented active microbes which may be primarily responsible for ammonia oxidation pratscher et al 2011 the abundance of the active amoa gene for aoa and aob was summarized from heavy fractions and is shown in fig 1 the ratios of gene copy numbers of archaeal amoa genes in heavy dna to all dna fractions was 67 82 66 37 81 08 and 68 22 in pf ew sw and rw respectively meanwhile the ratios for bacterial amoa genes were 61 79 70 43 69 7 and 57 35 respectively table 1 according to previous studies the cell numbers of active aoa and aob could be further calculated assuming that each bacterial and archaeal cell contains 2 5 and 1 0 of the amoa gene copy the cell numbers of active aoa were 2 88 106 1 81 107 1 10 107 and 2 30 107 per g soil in pf ew sw and rw respectively the cell numbers of active aob were 1 41 106 1 88 106 6 47 105 and 2 89 105 per g soil respectively 3 4 diversities of active aoa and aob in different tested soils the archaeal and bacterial amoa genes in the dna samples of the heavy fractions in 13c treated microcosms were analyzed by pyrosequencing after 56 days of incubation the high throughput sequencing of 13c amoa genes provided a clear understanding of the community structure for both active aoa and aob for aoa all sequences from tested soils could be grouped into three clusters group 1 1a which could divided into 2 clusters upon detailed analysis and group 1 1b fig 2 a the proportion of group 1 1a 1 represented by n archaeon my1 was 0 26 and 0 16 in pf and rw it was undetected in ew and sw the proportion of group 1 1a 2 represented by n maritimus scm1 was only detected in ew with a value of 4 34 the proportion of group 1 1b represented by nitrososphaera sp jg1 was 99 74 95 66 100 and 99 84 in pf ew sw and rw respectively for active aob the sequences could be grouped into one cluster of genus nitrosomonas and four clusters of nitrosospira fig 2b the nitrosomonas cluster accounted for 91 68 and 94 52 of the labeled bacterial amoa genes in pf and rw however the proportion decreased in ew and sw the nitrosomonas cluster and nitrosospira multiformis cluster became the two main clusters in ew with values of 54 41 and 43 82 respectively meanwhile the nitrosospira multiformis cluster became dominant in sw accounting for 64 48 of total labeled bacterial amoa genes 3 5 evaluation of activities and contributions of aoa and aob the weighted cell specific activity of aoa and aob were determined by the structure of active microbes depending on the measured aoa and aob data to make the results more reliable cell specific activity was amended with certain fundamental environmental parameters mainly ph value and ammonia concentration the weighted cell specific activity of aoa ranged narrowly from 2 88 to 3 31 femto mol nh3 cell 1 d 1 while that of aob ranged from 81 86 to 406 37 femto mol nh3 cell 1 d 1 fig 3 a combined with the active aoa and aob cell numbers the activity of aoa and aob was then calculated the rate of aoa was 0 12 0 84 0 45 and 0 93 μg n g 1 soil d 1 in pf ew sw and rw respectively and the rate of aob was 5 61 10 72 0 74 and 1 16 μg n g 1 soil d 1 respectively fig 3b 4 discussion dna sip relied entirely on cell proliferation thus providing new insight into functional ammonia oxidizers using active microbial abundance instead of existing abundance wang et al 2014 which may be a more accurate means of assessing the role of aoa and aob previous studies determined the importance of aoa and aob based on existing gene abundance leininger et al 2006 chen et al 2008 however that approach may be insufficient as the microbial community may have no function even with a relatively high abundance in previous studies aoa was confirmed to be solely responsible for ammonia oxidation as there was no aob labeled after isotopic incubation zhang et al 2010 in comparison the role of aob could be determined in the same way if aoa was not labeled by isotope jia and conrad 2009 in our study the successful labeling of the amoa gene by isotope demonstrates the function of both aoa and aob during incubation which differs from previous studies the ratio of active genes to all gene abundance differed among the four biotopes implying a difference in the growth of aoa and aob unfortunately in the cases of labeling both archaeal and bacterial amoa genes the role of aoa and aob could not be determined conclusively the high throughput pyrosequencing of both the archaeal and bacterial amoa gene provided a detailed identification of active aoa and aob in four coastal wetlands the main archaeal composition in the four coastal wetlands was group 1 1b with a composition greater than 95 66 which has been demonstrated to be the primary terrestrial group in the literature wang et al 2014 the result that amoa containing archaeal populations were relatively constant was consistent with previous studies jia and conrad 2009 the stability of archaeal composition reflected the stability of the archaeal community structure across various coastal wetlands with different land use types the land use types of coastal wetlands had little impact on the community structure of archaeal ammonia oxidizers in contrast the community structure of bacterial ammonia oxidizers varied in different biotopes the dominant aoa of pf was the nitrosomonas cluster which corresponded with what has been reported in habitats with high ammonia concentrations hastings et al 1997 taylor and bottomley 2006 the proportion of nitrosospira clusters increased to active microcosms in ew and sw nitrosospira species have often been detected in natural environments kowalchuk and stephen 2001 however the primary proportion was the nitrosomonas cluster in rw the high variance in community structure suggested a large response of bacterial ammonia oxidizers to various land use types the distinct responses of aoa and aob to land use conversion liu et al 2017 nitrogen addition and urea amendment carey et al 2016 supported our results to some extent for cell specific activity the aob has a larger range than aoa across coastal wetland types due to a larger range in community structure the variety of land use types effected the average cell specific activity of aoa to a small extent but had a strong effect on aob activity the results may be determined by the stability of the community structure of aoa in different coastal wetlands based on the existing research that aoa had single amoa gene copies and aob had 2 5 copies per cell okano et al 2004 the cell numbers for both aoa and aob were easily calculated in different wetlands the cell numbers varied for both aoa and aob in four coastal wetlands which implied that aoa and aob may play different roles in different wetlands the ammonia oxidation rate was then calculated by combining cell numbers and cell specific activity in addition the potential ammonia oxidation activity of the total ammonia oxidizers aoa and aob was measured using penicillin which inhibited the activity of aob in order to present a comparison with our evaluated results the contributions of aoa in all wetlands were lower than the results measured by penicillin the higher results measured by penicillin fig s7 may be caused by the considerable expression abundance of the aob amoa gene fig s8 the activity and contribution of aoa would be overestimated if aob was not completely inhibited by penicillin the highest expression abundance of aob amoa implied that the contribution of aoa may be largely overestimated in estuary wetlands the community structure of aob was also investigated in detail based on rna the large proportion of nitrosomonas and nitrosospira multiformis clusters fig s8 table s6 which had high cell specific activity suggested that the role of aob cannot be ignored and that the role of aoa was largely overestimated even when considering supplementation with penicillin however our estimates of total ammonia oxidation rates exhibited the same trend as results obtained from experiments fig s6 table s4 suggesting that our evaluation was reliable the ammonia oxidation rates varied for both aoa and aob in different wetlands however the activities of aoa vary little across different land use types compared to aob the aoa activity was low in pf but significantly increased in ew sw and rw this activity may be affected by the higher background ammonia concentration fig s5 although the weighted cell specific activity was extensive in pf the lower abundance led to a considerably lower ammonia oxidation rate for aoa which can be understood from the inhibition of a relatively higher ammonia concentration and which had been previously demonstrated in both field surveys and pure cultures tourna et al 2011 lehtovirta morley et al 2011 the rate of aoa increased by 6 2 75 and 6 75 fold in ew sw and rw compared to pf in such samples with a lower ammonia concentration aoa can survive in oligotrophic conditions martens habbena et al 2009 verhamme et al 2011 thus leading to an increased archaeal ammonia oxidation rate for aob the rate was much higher in pf and ew and significantly decreased in sw and rw which was primarily caused by the lower ammonia affinity of aob compared with aoa in low ammonia concentration areas the contribution of aoa in ammonia oxidation gradually increased from pf to ew to sw and finally to rw with values of 2 03 7 25 37 53 and 44 51 table s4 respectively similarly the contribution of aob was 97 97 92 75 62 47 and 55 49 respectively the value of the 2 03 proportion shows that aoa contributes little in pf whereas the rate of aoa was significantly lower than that of aob anthropogenic activities led to frequent fertilizer addition and higher ammonia concentrations which further illustrated the strong inhibition of aoa although the rate of aoa increased by only 1 11 fold in rw and was even lower in sw when compared with ew the contribution was much higher at approximately 44 51 and 37 53 for rw and sw respectively mainly because of the significant decrease in the aob rate many environmental factors have been reported to have an important effect on aoa and aob abundance and activity caffrey et al 2007 bouskill et al 2012 aob was concluded to be less resistant to oligotrophic conditions under these conditions aoa was more tolerant and in fact increased in activity in favorable environments aoa tends to contribute more to ammonia oxidation 5 conclusion in summary we provide new insights into the mechanisms of variance in activity and the contributions of aoa and aob in different coastal wetlands based on active abundance and community structure our results also suggested that the active community structure of aob varied more strongly among different biotopes and the active community structure of archaeal ammonia oxidizers was more stable furthermore our results also revealed that the contribution of aoa in ammonia oxidation increased from pf to ew to sw and finally to rw aoa may be dominant in coastal wetlands with less nitrogen or nutrient input where aob was inhibited the results thus provide new insights into the mechanisms of variance in aoa and aob activity in different coastal wetlands which may provide a basis for further understanding of the global nitrogen cycle author contributions g d j

18228,this study is an analysis of relationships between microalgae measured as chlorophyll a and the fecal indicator bacteria enterococci microalgae blooms and enterococci exceedances have been occurring in florida s recreational waterways for years more recently this has become a management concern as microalgae blooms have been attributed to potentially toxic cyanobacteria and enterococci exceedances link to human infection illness since both the microalgal blooms and bacterial exceedances occur in regions that receive managed freshwater releases from lake okeechobee we hypothesized that both the blooms and exceedances are related to excess nutrients from the lake two experimental sites on lake okeechobee and the st lucie river downstream of the lake plus a control site on the loxahatchee river which does not receive lake flow were evaluated the hypothesis was evaluated through three study components 1 analysis of available long term data from local environmental databases 2 a year long monthly sampling and analysis of chlorophyll a enterococci nutrients and physical chemical data and 3 microcosm experiments with altered water sediment conditions results support the hypothesis that excess nutrients play a role in both chlorophyll a and enterococci levels for the st lucie river analyses indicate that chlorophyll a correlated significantly with total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn r2 0 30 p 0 008 and the strongest model for enterococci included nitrate nitrite tkn total phosphorus orthophosphorus and turbidity in our long term analysis n 39 r2 0 83 p 0 001 the microcosm results indicated that chlorophyll a and enterococci only persisted for 36 h in water from all sources and that sediments from lake okeechobee may have allowed for sustained levels of chlorophyll a and enterococci levels overall similarities were observed in chlorophyll a and enterococci relationships with nutrient concentrations regardless of a lake okeechobee connection as underscored by a study of flow out of the lake and downstream areas this suggests that both nutrient rich lake water and untreated surface water runoff contribute to microalgae blooms and enterococci exceedances in southeast florida graphical abstract image 1 keywords enterococci cyanobacteria chlorophyll blue green algae total kjeldahl nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction in south florida there has been an abundance of coastal cyanobacteria blooms and exceedances of the fecal indicator bacteria fib enterococci in 2018 a confirmed cyanobacteria bloom resulted in a state of emergency issued for seven counties across the state of florida which lasted from july until november 2018 fdep 2018 during the same period enterococci exceedances instances when the number of enterococci bacteria was higher than 70 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml occurred at beaches in these same counties fdoh 2018 while some studies have included both chlorophyll a and fib measurements rarely have they been evaluated simultaneously under the same monitoring program cyanobacteria are a type of microalgae referred to as blue green algae due to their color but are technically bacteria that use photosynthesis parmar et al 2011 there are various groups and species of microalgae present across florida but cyanobacteria a majority of which have historically been identified as microcystis spp typically dominate the microalgal blooms in lakes and rivers throughout the region burns 2008 these microalgae are a concern since they have the ability to produce toxins such as cyanotoxins the most commonly encountered microcystin which can be an irritant to humans can result in hemorrhage of the liver see dawson 1998 cyanobacteria are monitored through the florida department of environmental

by researchers metcalf et al 2018 doering 1996 and citizens as the cause of the cyanobacterial blooms and enterococci exceedances others implicate septic tanks lapointe et al 2015 lapointe et al 2012 research by donahue et al 2017 further indicated that florida beaches with rivers within a 600 m distance of sampling sites had statistically higher fib exceedances compared to those without riverine influence two of the highest exceedances in the state were sampled at roosevelt bridge on the st lucie river connected to lake okeechobee and dubois park on the loxahatchee river not connected to lake okeechobee donahue et al 2017 given the observations of cyanobacteria blooms in lake okeechobee havens et al 2003 and the st lucie river kramer et al 2018 as well as the enterococci exceedances at coastal beaches downstream we hypothesized that water from lake okeechobee may be contributing to cyanobacteria blooms and elevated enterococci within both lake okeechobee and the st lucie river furthermore we anticipated that the drivers of both the blooms and enterococci exceedances may be related the objectives of this study were to evaluate the correlations between chlorophyll a measure of microalgae biomass and enterococci with surface water quality measures and to conduct experiments to evaluate the influence of the water s source on bacterial abundance and algal biomass to explore this we 1 analyzed long term data on selected water quality and environmental measures 2 conducted a year long monthly field sampling study and 3 completed microcosm studies in the laboratory of note a confirmed cyanobacteria bloom which resulted in a state of emergency declaration for seven florida counties occurred in our study areas at lake okeechobee and east of the lake in palm beach and martin counties during the last three months of the year long field study june august 2018 see supplemental table 2 the year long monthly field sampling study provides a unique data set prior to the 2018 cyanobacteria bloom confirmed as microcystis aeruginosa 2 study site description monthly field sampling sites for the year long study included canal point on lake okeechobee roosevelt bridge east

evaluation of physical chemical data and environmental conditions 3 and a series of four laboratory based microcosm studies of chlorophyll a and enterococci using different sources of water and or sediments 3 1 long term data and analysis long term data were combined from two primary databases sfwmd s dbhydro environmental database and the doh s fhbp dbhydro was used for chlorophyll a nutrient physical chemical and hydrologic data whereas the doh fhbp was used for enterococci and environmental data collected at the time of doh sample collection as the databases are collected by different agencies and are used for different purposes not all of the variables nutrients physical chemical or hydrologic data are available throughout the entire period of study most notably chlorophyll a could not be used for the multiple regression analysis due to the data gaps no doh enterococci data was available for areas within lake okeechobee thus canal point could not be included in the long

quantitative data included enterococci levels and quantitative environmental data rainfall 24 h before collection rainfall 3 days before collection rainfall in the last week before collection air temperature and water temperature qualitative data included categorized environmental data non quantitative descriptions of weather conditions tides and current conditions these data were collected by doh environmental specialists on a weekly basis within the st lucie river roosevelt bridge and the loxahatchee river dubois park and corresponded to conditions at the time that enterococci samples were collected statistical analysis for long term doh data included linear regression and analysis of variance anova linear regression was used to evaluate enterococci with respect to quantitative environmental data rainfall air temperature water temperature while anova using statistical analysis system sas was used to evaluate categorical environmental data weather sunny cloudy rainy tidal conditions a high medium low tidal conditions b ebb flood slack current direction a still north south east west current direction b along shore left to right along shore right to left neither and current strength strong moderate weak 3 1 3 analysis of dbhydro nutrient and hydrologic data and doh enterococci data enterococci doh were analyzed against nutrient and hydrologic data dbhydro statistical analysis was conducted using multiple regression and factor analysis as described above additionally within lake okeechobee s308 some of the flows were recorded as negative numbers which corresponded to back pumping a practice in which water is pumped out of the st lucie canal into lake okeechobee the opposite direction of normal flow t tests were performed on the doh roosevelt bridge enterococci and dbhydro s308 hydrologic flow data positive versus negative values to identify significant differences p 0 05 in enterococci levels at roosevelt bridge based on flow direction building on this hydrologic flow data from s308 and s80 was also analyzed against roosevelt bridge enterococci and chlorophyll a levels along with other physical chemical parameters from s80 chlorophyll a enterococci nutrients and turbidity levels were analyzed during periods where both s308 and s80 flow was positive measuring lake and downstream watershed contribution and when flow from s308 was zero and s80 was positive measuring st lucie canal watershed contribution only these are the only analyses in which dbhydro data and doh data are evaluated against each other 3 2 year long field study data and analysis to evaluate the potential drivers of the microalgae blooms and enterococci exceedances a year long study of monthly field measurements was conducted at sites within lake okeechobee canal point the st lucie river roosevelt bridge and the loxahatchee river dubois park during each monthly visit surface 0 3 m water samples were collected and physical chemical measures and local meteorological conditions were recorded in the field water samples were collected and then analyzed for chlorophyll a pheophytin enterococci nutrients nitrate nitrite total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn orthophosphorus and total phosphorus and turbidity brief descriptions of the analysis methods used for these measures are provided in the supplemental text physical chemical measurements of sampling depth water temperature ph salinity and dissolved oxygen do were recorded via field meter hydrolab surveyor 4 with hydrotech compact minisonde 4a meteorological conditions including air temperature wind and humidity were recorded via the navclock for iphone app version 3 3 5 split rail inc which reports these measurements from the nearest weather station based on gps location to assess relationships with rainfall rainfall data were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s national centers for environmental information ncei formerly the national climatic data center ncdc ncei rainfall data came from weather stations near canal point usc00081276 s308 us1flmt0016 roosevelt bridge usc00088620 and dubois park usc00084461 analysis for the year long monthly field sampling data included time series analysis at each site and multiple regression following the same methods outlined above of sampled chlorophyll a and enterococci against individual nutrients and physical chemical data to mirror the analysis of the rainfall data collected by doh and analyzed in this long term study regression analysis was performed on the ncei rainfall data using similar time periods rainfall amounts one month one week three days and 24 h before the collection dates against the chlorophyll a and enterococci data collected in the monthly field sampling study 3 3 microcosms the microcosm studies were designed to evaluate the impacts from lake okeechobee water and sediment on microalgae indicated by chlorophyll a and enterococci surface water samples were collected from lake okeechobee canal point the st lucie river roosevelt bridge and the loxahatchee river dubois park sediments were collected from lake okeechobee canal point and the loxahatchee river dubois park dubois park water and sediments were used as controls as the loxahatchee river is not connected to lake okeechobee yet experiences high levels of enterococci four laboratory based microcosm experiments were conducted at the university of miami department of marine biology and ecology laboratory all microcosms were conducted without replication for all microcosms water was analyzed for chlorophyll a and enterococci every 12 h for a 36 h period following sample collection chlorophyll a and enterococci were measured over time under two conditions water only and water with sediment to isolate the impacts from lake okeechobee microcosms considered 1 surface water only from lake okeechobee cp the st lucie river rb and the loxahatchee river dp collected june 2018 2 surface water deionized di water 2 1 dilution from lake okeechobee canal point and the loxahatchee river dubois park collected september 2017 3 surface water sediment from lake okeechobee canal point collected november 2017 and 4 lake okeechobee canal point surface water with either lake okeechobee sediments canal point or loxahatchee dubois park sediments collected january 2018 light and temperature were designed for microalgae or enterococci growth conditions used for microalgae growth were 19 c with alternating light and dark cycles for enterococci growth conditions were 41 c under dark conditions epa 2009 microcosms with sediment involved the lowering or raising of a sediment tray into or out of the water every 12 h to simulate wetting and drying cycles supplementary fig s1 the first experiment which evaluated water only at all three sites consisted of six individual 1 l clear plastic bottle microcosms all six of the microcosms in the first experiment were kept in algae room conditions 19 c light dark three microcosms consisted of water bottles collected directly from lake okeechobee canal point the st lucie river roosevelt bridge and the loxahatchee river dubois park the other three microcosms consisted of water from the same sites the waters for these microcosms were filtered following the normal procedure for total suspended solids borosilicate filter 1 5 μm nominal pore size the second experiment analyzed surface water from lake okeechobee canal point and the loxahatchee river dubois park considering pure samples and 2 1 di water dilutions six 1l microcosms were created one set 3 samples of the collected water was maintained in the algae culture room 19 c light dark the second set of 3 was incubated under conditions recommended for enterococci growth 41 c dark microcosms in the algae room were housed in clear glass bottles those in the incubator conditions were housed in brown nalgene sampling bottles all caps were vented the water combinations included 1 500 ml dubois park 500 ml canal point 2 500 ml dubois park 500 ml di and 3 500 ml canal point 500 ml di the third experiment evaluated only the lake okeechobee environment the microcosms were composed of water and sediment two microcosms were created one for each condition algae culture room or enterococci incubator a double tray system was developed to allow the sediment to have periods of exposure as well as to be covered by water sediment was placed in a tray upper tray at the bottom of a larger tray filled with water lower tray the upper tray was raised or lowered at each sampling interval every 12 h to simulate wetting and drying cycles brakenhoff et al 2018 feng et al 2015 marchant et al 2017 typically observed at the coast due to tides measurements were taken before and after the tray was moved measurements taken after are designated by a 0 1 after the hour it was collected e g 12 1 the fourth experiment evaluated the effect of sediment source two microcosms were created one consisted of lake okeechobee water canal point and loxahatchee river dubois park sediments and the other consisted of lake okeechobee canal point water and lake okeechobee canal point sediments both microcosms were kept in algae culture room conditions 19 c light dark using the double tray system as in the third experiment with the tray raised or lowered every 12 h lake okeechobee sediment consisted of mixed rock shell fill collected from the littoral zone from canal point loxahatchee river sediment consisted of beach sand collected at dubois park grain size distributions were measured for general categorization of sediment types using the standard test method for particle size analysis of soils astm 2007 see supplementary table s4 for detailed results of grain size distributions 4 results 4 1 long term study data 4 1 1 dbhydro multiple regression of chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci against nutrient physical chemical meteorological and hydrologic data analysis was conducted in two parts the first part table 1 analyzed dependent variables chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci against nutrients and physical chemical measures i e independent predictor variables at lake okeechobee s308 the st lucie canal s80 and the st lucie river se03 fig 1 table 1 the second table 2 analyzed enterococci levels at roosevelt bridge against the hydrologic data at lake okeechobee s308 and the st lucie canal s80 among both data sets the only significant correlations p 0 05 were observed at the st lucie river se03 and the st lucie canal s80 none were observed in lake okeechobee s308 at se03 when evaluating chlorophyll a through multiple regression the strongest model included pheophytin tkn water temperature and salinity n 139 f 15 8 p 0 0001 r2 0 30 table 1 individually chlorophyll a significantly correlated with pheophytin parameter estimate 1 12 p 0 0001 and tkn parameter estimate 6 92 p 0 008 as independent variables table 1 the model for pheophytin at se03 included chlorophyll a nitrate nitrite tkn total phosphorus water temperature and salinity through multiple regression n 139 f 12 0 p 0 0001 r2 0 32 table 1 individually pheophytin was significantly correlated with chlorophyll a only parameter estimate 0 18 p 0 0001 table 1 the strongest enterococci model at se03 included chlorophyll a pheophytin nitrate nitrite tkn total phosphorus orthophosphorus turbidity water temperature salinity and do n 39 f 19 2 p 0 0001 r2 0 83 table 1 individually enterococci demonstrated significant correlations with nitrate nitrite tkn total phosphorus orthophosphorus and turbidity individual p values 0 05 table 1 for s80 enterococci doh roosevelt bridge data the strongest multiple regression model included tkn total phosphorus turbidity ph and do n 49 f 13 8 p 0 0001 r2 0 57 table 1 individually enterococci correlated significantly with tkn and turbidity individual p values 0 05 table 1 for the hydrologic data table 2 multiple regression models indicated that at s80 enterococci levels were correlated with flow gate stage rain and gage height p 0 0005 r2 0 23 individually enterococci correlated significantly with stage rain and gate height individual p values 0 05 at s308 lake okeechobee the enterococci model included flow gate stage and rain although the model was not significant p 0 3 r2 0 008 table 2 with no individual variables correlating significantly with hydrologic data overall multiple regression results suggest that tkn is an important predictor of chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci enterococci also demonstrated significant associations with total phosphorus orthophosphorus and turbidity 4 1 2 dbhydro lake okeechobee s308 and st lucie canal s80 flow and doh st lucie river roosevelt bridge enterococci data results from a t test performed to distinguish differences in enterococci by flow direction show that there was a statistically significant difference in enterococci levels p 0 001 at roosevelt bridge when freshwater was flowing downstream from lake okeechobee into the st lucie river mean enterococci 49 7 cfu 100 ml n 733 versus when it was reporting a negative flow from the st lucie river into lake okeechobee mean enterococci 17 8 cfu 100 ml n 95 these findings suggest that flow from the lake may be a contributor to enterococci at roosevelt bridge serving as a direct bacterial source indirectly promoting conditions that allow enterococci to proliferate or as a covariate of rainfall see figs 2a 3a and 3 b building on this hydrologic flow data from s308 and s80 was also analyzed against roosevelt bridge chlorophyll a enterococci nutrient levels and physical chemical parameters the number of data points for chlorophyll a was small a total of seven so not all of the analyses could be performed for this parameter hydrologic conditions were divided into four categories depending upon whether flow in s308 or s80 was positive these conditions included 1 s308 greater than zero and s80 flow at zero no contribution to roosevelt bridge 2 both s308 and s80 flow greater than zero lake plus st lucie canal watershed contribution 3 both s308 and s80 flow at zero or less only s308 has back pumping or negative flows no contribution to roosevelt bridge and 4 s308 flow is zero s80 is greater than zero contribution from st lucie canal watershed given the small sample size chlorophyll a could not be divided into all four categories it was divided into categories 1 and 3 the means were highest under condition 1 7 50 μg l followed by condition 3 5 80 μg l for enterococci the means were highest under condition 2 74 3 cfu 100 ml followed by condition 4 44 7 cfu 100 ml condition 1 30 0 cfu 100 ml and then condition 3 26 0 cfu 100 ml the means for orthophosphorus followed the same pattern with their highest values under conditions 2 both lake and watershed contributing followed by condition 4 watershed only contributing table 3 for tkn and total phosphorus condition 4 was higher followed by condition 2 for nitrate nitrite the means were nearly the same in both conditions to further evaluate lake versus watershed contributions condition 2 was evaluated in terms of the relative contributions from the lake versus the watershed when flow through s308 lake okeechobee contribution was higher than through s80 st lucie canal watershed contribution the enterococci mean was 58 9 cfu 100 ml when flow through s80 was higher the enterococci levels averaged 93 3 cfu 100 ml at roosevelt bridge for nutrients and physical chemical parameters the mean concentrations did not differ significantly in terms of whether flows through s308 versus s80 were higher with the exception of turbidity the turbidity when s308 had more flow mean of 21 0 ntu was statistically higher than the turbidity when s80 had more flow mean of 3 8 ntu 4 1 3 linear regression and anova for analysis of doh enterococci and environmental data in the st lucie and loxahatchee rivers when quantitative environmental values were considered linear regression showed that enterococci at the st lucie river roosevelt bridge was significantly correlated with rainfall during all periods tested although the correlations were relatively weak with low r2 values r2 0 04 supplementary table s5 similarly in the loxahatchee river at dubois park correlations between enterococci and rainfall were significant although r2 values were weak r2 0 002 enterococci at roosevelt bridge showed significant positive correlations with air and water temperatures enterococci did not correlate significantly with temperatures at dubois park supplementary table s5 when the categorical environmental variables were considered table 4 at roosevelt bridge enterococci levels did not show a significant difference when sorted by weather p 0 05 at dubois park enterococci levels when sorted by different weather were statistically different n 729 f value 12 55 p 0 0001 with a strong difference in enterococci levels between weather observed to be sunny 1 versus cloudy 2 versus rainy 3 conditions table 4 enterococci did not show significant differences with tidal conditions a or b at either site however at dubois park enterococci levels differed statistically by tidal conditions b n 607 f value 5 33 p value 0 005 with a strong difference between tide observed as ebb tide 1 versus flood 2 and slack 3 tide enterococci levels did not significantly differ by current direction a at either site current direction b was statistically significant at roosevelt bridge n 582 f value 5 7 p value 0 004 and at dubois park f value 5 3 p value 0 04 the current strength categories showed no significant differences at either site overall rainfall was associated with enterococci at both roosevelt bridge and dubois park temperature and current direction b were important at roosevelt bridge while weather and tidal conditions b were factors significantly influencing enterococci levels at dubois park table 4 4 2 year long monthly field sampling data and analysis in the st lucie river water quality parameters at the roosevelt bridge site changed according to the tides during flood tides the field meter readings of water quality parameters were similar to those found in the loxahatchee river at dubois park whereas during ebb tides the field meter readings were similar to parameters measured in lake okeechobee at canal point supplementary table s8 meteorological data demonstrated that the wind and humidity increased and the air temperature dropped supplementary table s6 toward the coast for the physical chemical measures salinity increased and turbidity decreased toward the coast the complete set of all of the observations is available in the supplement supplementary tables s7 and s8 4 2 1 time series analysis for each site in general chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci decreased during the dry season november april and increased during the wet season may october as shown in the corresponding rainfall records of each site figs 2 4 in lake okeechobee at canal point fig 2 rainfall appeared to coincide with elevated chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci from may through august in march total nitrogen tkn and phosphorus coincided with increased enterococci in the st lucie river at roosevelt bridge fig 3 chlorophyll a and pheophytin demonstrated a peak during january 2018 enterococci remained low 100 cfu 100 ml or below for most of the study until june 1 020 cfu 100 ml when rainfall total nitrogen tkn total phosphorus and orthophosphate increased elevated levels were observed in all measures shown from may until august in the loxahatchee river at dubois park fig 4 rainfall did not appear to have as much of an impact on chlorophyll a pheophytin or enterococci at the beginning of the study as it did at the end chlorophyll a was elevated for this site at the beginning of the study as was total nitrogen tkn and phosphorus for the remainder of the field sampling period chlorophyll a and pheophytin remained at a low level both around 3 μg l or below while enterococci increased in march 200 cfu 100 ml up from 40 cfu 100 ml in february along with increasing total nitrogen and tkn enterococci increased again in may 330 cfu 100 ml up from 30 cfu 100 ml in april coinciding with the wet season overall all concentrations tended to decrease from lake okeechobee canal point to the st lucie roosevelt bridge to the loxahatchee dubois park figs 2 4 chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci generally increased with rainfall and nutrients 4 2 2 multiple regression of chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci against nutrient physical chemical and meteorological data multiple regression analysis of the data collected during the year long field sampling table 5 showed that for lake okeechobee at canal point the model for chlorophyll a included ph salinity and sample depth n 12 f 3 9 p 0 05 r2 0 45 independently there were no significant correlations between chlorophyll a and any of the independent variables individual p 0 05 the model for pheophytin included chlorophyll a and enterococci total phosphorus water temperature salinity do sample depth and wave height n 12 f 9 8 p 0 04 r2 0 86 independently significant correlations were observed with chlorophyll a and do individual p 0 05 the model for enterococci included nitrate nitrate tkn orthophosphorus salinity and do but was not significant n 12 f 1 2 p 0 4 r2 0 08 enterococci did not correlate significantly with any of the independent variables individual p 0 05 in the st lucie river at roosevelt bridge the chlorophyll a model included pheophytin enterococci tkn ph salinity and tide n 11 f 63 9 p 0 0006 r2 0 99 independently only pheophytin was significant parameter estimate 0 68 p 0 0003 the pheophytin model included chlorophyll a enterococci nitrite nitrate orthophosphorus and salinity n 8 f 32 6 p 0 03 r2 0 96 independently there were no significant associations the multiple regression model for enterococci included chlorophyll a pheophytin orthophosphorus ph salinity and sample depth n 8 f 37 0 p 0 10 r2 0 99 independently there were no significant associations in the loxahatchee river at dubois park the model for chlorophyll a included total phosphorus and salinity n 12 f 4 83 p 0 04 r2 0 41 the pheophytin model included turbidity and salinity n 12 f 2 28 p 0 16 r2 0 19 and the enterococci model included total phosphorus salinity and sample depth n 12 f 3 79 p 0 06 r2 0 43 independently there were no significant associations for any of the variables individual p 0 05 overall for the monthly data salinity was a parameter identified for all models but as an independent variable it was not significant at the st lucie river roosevelt bridge the model for chlorophyll a included pheophytin and enterococci the model for pheophytin included chlorophyll a and enterococci and the model for enterococci included chlorophyll a and pheophytin 4 2 3 rainfall data and monthly field sampling for chlorophyll a and enterococci for the analysis with ncei rainfall data table 6 enterococci showed site specific correlations on all time scales rainfall 24 h before 3 days before week before and month before in lake okeechobee chlorophyll a and pheophytin showed significant correlations at the month time scale table 6 correlations between chlorophyll a and pheophytin with rainfall at shorter time scales were not consistent thus enterococci appears to respond to rainfall at multiple time scales both long and short while chlorophyll a and pheophytin respond on longer time scales 4 3 microcosms results from the microcosms suggest that the presence of sediment from lake okeechobee canal point may have an influence on the proliferation of enterococci and may contribute to increased chlorophyll a levels in the first and second microcosm experiments supplementary figs s2 and s3 evaluating water from all of the sites enterococci persisted at about the same normalized level or dropped by 24 h after the experiment started chlorophyll a after 24 h had increased the high and persistent levels of chlorophyll was expected since this water was collected during a period of enterococci exceedance cyanobacteria bloom and high turbidities in lake okeechobee and the st lucie river however dubois park in the loxahatchee river did not have any indication of cyanobacteria at the time of initial sample collection in the third and fourth microcosm experiments figs 5 and 6 with lake okeechobee sediment enterococci persisted through 36 h when dubois park sediment was used enterococci concentrations did not persist and dropped after 12 h fig 6 chlorophyll a and enterococci followed a cyclical pattern in both the microcosm in the algae room and in the incubator this pattern may be in response to the raising and lowering of the sediment tray every 12 h the stirring up of the water and sediment may have caused the difference between the lower measurement at 24 h made before the tray was moved and the higher measurement at 24 1 h made after the tray was moved 5 discussion this study was designed to analyze microalgae and enterococci in three watersheds in association with environmental and water quality parameters that are known to be important to both dependent variables there have been few studies documenting the water quality environmental parameters of both enterococci and microalgae together most of what is known about microalgae or about enterococci has been discovered through studies of either microalgae or enterococci along with the known drivers for that specific variable associations between chlorophyll a pheophytin and nutrients are well known dolman et al 2012 paerl et al 2008 havens et al 2003 kramer et al 2018 khare et al 2019 and monitoring programs typically analyze for these nutrients as part of their standard protocol additionally for cyanobacteria studies have also noted the influence of tides currents wind driven waves and shoreline conditions soontiens et al 2018 naja et al 2017 rosen and st amand 2015 for enterococci as consistent with other studies wright et al 2011 enns et al 2012 barreras et al 2019 dila et al 2018 mclellan and roguet 2019 mclellan et al 2015 environmental factors such as tide rainfall and temperature have been associated with the levels of enterococci as observed in the current study few studies exist that have evaluated associations between environmental enterococci and nutrient levels cloutier et al 2015 most studies that evaluate specifically the effects of nutrients on fibs were conducted at wastewater treatment plants where nitrogen and phosphorus are also typically measured lechevallier et al 1991 derry and attwater 2014 in this study we found that rainfall temperature flows and nutrients were significant independent predictor variables for both chlorophyll a and enterococci most of what is known about growth factors for enterococci originates from the medical field with studies on environmental enterococci rapidly increasing in evaluating enterococci within the intestinal tract of mammals ramsey et al 2014 noted that enterococci use the process of phosphorylation the addition of a phosphoryl group po3 to provide adenosinetriphosphate atp to the cell in a comparative genomic analysis of enterococcus some of the type strains were found to have 15 strain specific genes for nitrogen metabolism and 18 core genes and one strain specific gene for phosphorus metabolism zhong et al 2017 this may indicate that enterococci can use nutrients in the extraenteric environment which seems to be in opposition to findings that indicated they require complex nutrients lebreton et al 2014 enterococci may also be protected in oligotrophic environments due to their thick peptidoglycan wall and their use of biofilm both of which are known to offer protective barriers in extraenteric environments chang et al 2018 the closest study of correlation between microalgae and enterococci simultaneously revealed that enterococci may be highly concentrated in plankton which included cyanobacteria and associated particles especially summer and fall months mote et al 2012 other studies echo the association between enterococci and plankton asserting that enterococci survive because they adhere to the plankton maugeri et al 2004 which serve as reservoirs for enterococci signoretto et al 2004 byappanahalli et al 2012 recommended further study of ecological factors on the survival of enterococci recognizing the influence of other organisms in controlling enterococci populations despite the similarities of potential drivers there have been few studies documenting the water quality environmental parameters of both fib and microalgae together it is important to note that this study began immediately following hurricane irma which made landfall in south florida in september 2017 producing large amounts of rainfall at the lake and both rivers hurricane irma may have impacted the watersheds examined in the current study and subsequently may have been an important factor in the cyanobacterial bloom and enterococci exceedances measured during our year long study in 2018 increases in enterococci levels immediately after hurricanes has been documented roca et al 2019 but such increases are not necessarily noticeable for cyanobacteria for example after hurricanes katrina and rita elevated levels of enterococci were noted in the lake pontchartrain area for a period of up to two months after the storm whereas no evidence of a cyanobacterial bloom was noted sinigalliano et al 2007 in the longer term the timing of the year long monthly sampling study was very fortunate when it comes to the evaluation of enterococci and chlorophyll a as it coincided with a fdep confirmed 2018 cyanobacterial bloom and the declared state of emergency in southeastern florida in spring 2018 during this study the wet season began with heavy rains the wet season a time of increased rain and high temperatures has also proven to be a time of increased nutrients e g lapointe et al 2012 enterococci spikes were reported at both roosevelt bridge and dubois park following the rain and blue green algae cyanobacteria was documented by fdep near roosevelt bridge this increase in dependent variables and the nutrients together during the wet season was detected in the time series analysis influencing both enterococci and cyanobacteria levels results from the microcosms suggested that the presence and or resuspension of sediments fine material from lake okeechobee may have an influence on the proliferation of enterococci and may contribute to increased chlorophyll a levels chlorophyll is known to maintain a diurnal cycle in response to light and darkness leypunskiy et al 2017 yet we observed the cycling of both chlorophyll and enterococci in both the algae culture room and the incubator peaks at 0 and 24 h fig 5 it is difficult to determine whether the cycling is due to circadian patterns or the action of raising and lowering the sediment tray which also occurred every 12 h and may have initiated resuspension the importance of resuspension has been noted at recreational beaches where enterococci proliferate in sediments and with wave action are released from these sediments into the water column ferguson et al 2005 desmarais et al 2002 verhougstraete and rose 2014 whitman et al 2014 feng et al 2016 moreover wind driven resuspension has been previously noted in lake okeechobee maceina and soballe 1990 and can be a precursor to cyanobacteria blooms paerl 1988 here the lake okeechobee sediments were classified as poorly graded gravels see supplemental table s4 yet we observed a fine black material present in the lake okeechobee sediments field observations this study in contrast to dubois park s sandy sediments supplemental table s4 typically gravels can promote a buildup of fine organic material in pore spaces increasing localized resuspension koiter et al 2015 whereas a low fraction of fine particles present in sands can stabilize sediments bartzke et al 2013 thus it is possible that even a small fraction of fine material present in lake okeechobee sediments could have a disproportionate impact on water quality 6 conclusions the results from this study demonstrate that excess nutrients are associated with elevated chlorophyll a and enterococci levels while the correlations between nutrients chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci were similar across sites the driving physical chemical environmental and meteorological variables were site specific we found that enterococci levels may be influenced by flow from lake okeechobee into the st lucie river as seen through the analysis of long term hydrologic data when flow at s308 was reversed enterococci levels dropped significantly at roosevelt bridge at dubois park we also observed the importance of tidal conditions and short term rainfall this may indicate that chlorophyll a and enterococci levels change based on a combination of the available nutrients and the physical chemical environmental and meteorological conditions at each site when hydrologic flow data from s308 and s80 was analyzed against roosevelt bridge enterococci and chlorophyll a nutrient levels and turbidity at s80 we found that the means for almost every parameter measured was highest for condition 2 where both lake okeechobee and the st lucie canal had flows greater than zero both lake and watershed contributions and then for condition 4 where only the st lucie canal had flows greater than zero watershed contribution this supports the hypothesis that both the lake and downstream watershed contribute to the chlorophyll a enterococci and physical chemical parameters at receiving waters downstream the highly significant turbidity response when flows were high from the lake again implicates that both the lake and downstream watershed are contributing to water quality perhaps enhanced through fine sediment transport out of the lake and into the st lucie canal overall similarities were observed in the relationships of chlorophyll a and enterococci with nutrients regardless of a lake okeechobee connection this suggests that both nutrient rich lake water and untreated runoff contribute to the microalgae blooms and enterococci exceedances in southeast florida these similarities in response to nutrients and hydrologic conditions may explain the coincidence of both cyanobacteria blooms and bacterial exceedances observed during the summer of 2018 downstream of the st lucie river future work is necessary to evaluate the possible connections between cyanobacteria and enterococci and to fully understand the biogeochemistry of areas that have blooms and exceedances these studies should focus on the evaluation and characterization of the nutrients specific to each watershed as well as the native sediment organic matter and local hydrodynamics this should include work on the effects of environmental conditions such as rainfall and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes further studies on enterococci levels and the direction of flows near the roosevelt bridge sampling area should also be included these studies will provide greater understanding as to whether sediments could be contributing to blooms and exceedances in the st lucie river especially after periods of heavy rainfall an understanding of the influence of weather events on blooms and exceedances may lead to the eventual forecasting of blooms and or exceedances declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this

occurring in florida s recreational waterways for years more recently this has become a management concern as microalgae blooms have been attributed to potentially toxic cyanobacteria and enterococci exceedances link to human infection illness since both the microalgal blooms and bacterial exceedances occur in regions that receive managed freshwater releases from lake okeechobee we hypothesized that both the blooms and exceedances are related to excess nutrients from the lake two experimental sites on lake okeechobee and the st lucie river downstream of the lake plus a control site on the loxahatchee river which does not receive lake flow were evaluated the hypothesis was evaluated through three study components 1 analysis of available long term data from local environmental databases 2 a year long monthly sampling and analysis of chlorophyll a enterococci nutrients and physical chemical data and 3 microcosm experiments with altered water sediment conditions results support the hypothesis that excess nutrients play a role in both chlorophyll a and enterococci levels for the st lucie river analyses indicate that chlorophyll a correlated significantly with total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn r2 0 30 p 0 008 and the strongest model for enterococci included nitrate nitrite tkn total phosphorus orthophosphorus and turbidity in our long term analysis n 39 r2 0 83 p 0 001 the microcosm results indicated that chlorophyll a and enterococci only persisted for 36 h in water from all sources and that sediments from lake okeechobee may have allowed for sustained levels of chlorophyll a and enterococci levels overall similarities were observed in chlorophyll a and enterococci relationships with nutrient concentrations regardless of a lake okeechobee connection as underscored by a study of flow out of the lake and downstream areas this suggests that both nutrient rich lake water and untreated surface water runoff contribute to microalgae blooms and enterococci exceedances in southeast florida graphical abstract image 1 keywords enterococci cyanobacteria chlorophyll blue green algae total kjeldahl nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction in south florida there has been an abundance of coastal cyanobacteria blooms and exceedances of the fecal indicator bacteria fib enterococci in 2018 a confirmed cyanobacteria bloom resulted in a state of emergency issued for seven counties across the state of florida which lasted from july until november 2018 fdep 2018 during the same period enterococci exceedances instances when the number of enterococci bacteria was higher than 70 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml occurred at beaches in these same counties fdoh 2018 while some studies have included both chlorophyll a and fib measurements rarely have they been evaluated simultaneously under the same monitoring program cyanobacteria are a type of microalgae referred to as blue green algae due to their color but are technically bacteria that use photosynthesis parmar et al 2011 there are various groups and species of microalgae present across florida but cyanobacteria a majority of which have historically been identified as microcystis spp typically dominate the microalgal blooms in lakes and rivers throughout the region burns 2008 these microalgae are a concern since they have the ability to produce toxins such as cyanotoxins the most commonly encountered microcystin which can be an irritant to humans can result in hemorrhage of the liver see dawson 1998 cyanobacteria are monitored through the florida department of environmental protection fdep algal bloom monitoring and response program along with the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission fwc these agencies identify the species of microalgae the concentrations and test for toxicity the florida department of health doh determines if an identified bloom presents a risk to human health and issues beach advisories fdep 2018 bacterial exceedances particularly fibs such as enterococci are monitored at coastal beaches some of which are downstream of rivers and lakes the beaches are monitored for fibs by the doh s florida healthy beaches program fhbp a fib monitoring database that extends from 2000 to the current date water quality parameters including chlorophyll a and nutrient levels as well as flows of freshwater in lakes and rivers in florida such as lake okeechobee the st lucie river and the loxahatchee river are recorded through the efforts of the south florida water management district sfwmd the us army corps of engineers usace and as part of the comprehensive everglades restoration program cerp 1999 water quality in the loxahatchee river a designated wild and scenic river is also monitored by the loxahatchee river district lrd stoner and arrington 2017 lake okeechobee waters discharge to the st lucie river to the east of the lake through the st lucie canal to control flooding in the region near the lake these discharges are cited by researchers metcalf et al 2018 doering 1996 and citizens as the cause of the cyanobacterial blooms and enterococci exceedances others implicate septic tanks lapointe et al 2015 lapointe et al 2012 research by donahue et al 2017 further indicated that florida beaches with rivers within a 600 m distance of sampling sites had statistically higher fib exceedances compared to those without riverine influence two of the highest exceedances in the state were sampled at roosevelt bridge on the st lucie river connected to lake okeechobee and dubois park on the loxahatchee river not connected to lake okeechobee donahue et al 2017 given the observations of cyanobacteria blooms in lake okeechobee havens et al 2003 and the st lucie river kramer et al 2018 as well as the enterococci exceedances at coastal beaches downstream we hypothesized that water from lake okeechobee may be contributing to cyanobacteria blooms and elevated enterococci within both lake okeechobee and the st lucie river furthermore we anticipated that the drivers of both the blooms and enterococci exceedances may be related the objectives of this study were to evaluate the correlations between chlorophyll a measure of microalgae biomass and enterococci with surface water quality measures and to conduct experiments to evaluate the influence of the water s source on bacterial abundance and algal biomass to explore this we 1 analyzed long term data on selected water quality and environmental measures 2 conducted a year long monthly field sampling study and 3 completed microcosm studies in the laboratory of note a confirmed cyanobacteria bloom which resulted in a state of emergency declaration for seven florida counties occurred in our study areas at lake okeechobee and east of the lake in palm beach and martin counties during the last three months of the year long field study june august 2018 see supplemental table 2 the year long monthly field sampling study provides a unique data set prior to the 2018 cyanobacteria bloom confirmed as microcystis aeruginosa 2 study site description monthly field sampling sites for the year long study included canal point on lake okeechobee roosevelt bridge east of the lake on the st lucie river and dubois park on the loxahatchee river which is east of the lake and south of the st lucie river and does not receive discharges from lake okeechobee fig 1 gps coordinates in supplementary table s1 the canal point site was selected as it was the closest public access point to the lake located within 13 km of water control structure s308 and within 250 m of s352 where water quality data were regularly collected by sfwmd fig 1 roosevelt bridge is located 110 m east of a sfwmd water quality monitoring site se03 and 11 km east of water control structure s80 fig 1 thus data were collected from sites s352 s308 and canal point within lake okeechobee s80 se03 and roosevelt bridge within the st lucie river and dubois park within the loxahatchee river control site no connection to lake okeechobee fig 1 water quality and hydrologic data collected by sfwmd were used in the long term analysis as was enterococci and environmental data collected by doh 3 methods the study was conducted in three parts 1 long term 2000 2018 data trend analysis for chlorophyll a enterococci and nutrients along with an evaluation of physical chemical data hydrologic measures and environmental conditions 2 a year long field sampling campaign from september 2017 until august 2018 documenting chlorophyll a pheophytin enterococci and nutrients along with an evaluation of physical chemical data and environmental conditions 3 and a series of four laboratory based microcosm studies of chlorophyll a and enterococci using different sources of water and or sediments 3 1 long term data and analysis long term data were combined from two primary databases sfwmd s dbhydro environmental database and the doh s fhbp dbhydro was used for chlorophyll a nutrient physical chemical and hydrologic data whereas the doh fhbp was used for enterococci and environmental data collected at the time of doh sample collection as the databases are collected by different agencies and are used for different purposes not all of the variables nutrients physical chemical or hydrologic data are available throughout the entire period of study most notably chlorophyll a could not be used for the multiple regression analysis due to the data gaps no doh enterococci data was available for areas within lake okeechobee thus canal point could not be included in the long term evaluation of doh enterococci 3 1 1 dbhydro nutrient and hydrologic data and analysis dbhydro is an online database updated by the sfwmd that stores hydrologic and water quality data www sfwmd gov from dbhydro data for chlorophyll a and its degradation product pheophytin nutrients nitrate nitrite total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn orthophosphorus phosphorus physical chemical data turbidity water temperature ph salinity and dissolved oxygen do and hydrologic data flow gate stage rain gage height were obtained these data were collected from the monitoring stations within lake okeechobee s352 and s308 along the st lucie canal s80 and within the st lucie river se03 they were evaluated using multiple linear regressions the dependent variables namely chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci doh were regressed on independent variables specific nutrients physical chemical measures and hydrologic conditions to identify which combination of independent predictor variables significantly p 0 05 influenced the dependent variables exploratory factor analysis principal axis factoring analysis was used to both identify underlying covariance between predictor variables and select independent variables for model inclusion costello and osborne 2005 factor analysis was accomplished through proc factor where variables were scored principal component method and latent weighted ordinary least squares co variance extracted as a vector based on a varimax orthogonal rotation o rourke and hatcher 2013 results report the rate and direction of individual relationships positive or negative rate of change as parameter estimates i e regression coefficients with associated p values the final adjusted r2 values were used to account for the number of predictor variables included in the models all statistics were conducted using statistical analysis system sas sas 9 4 sas institute cary north carolina version 9 4 normality of data was assessed using residual plots and data were not transformed 3 1 2 doh enterococci and environmental data and analysis the doh collects and stores data through the fhbp and data is publicly available on the fhbp website florida department of health 2018 the doh fhbp data consisted of enterococci and environmental data collected at the time of sampling by the doh these data were separated into two types quantitative numeric and qualitative categorical quantitative data included enterococci levels and quantitative environmental data rainfall 24 h before collection rainfall 3 days before collection rainfall in the last week before collection air temperature and water temperature qualitative data included categorized environmental data non quantitative descriptions of weather conditions tides and current conditions these data were collected by doh environmental specialists on a weekly basis within the st lucie river roosevelt bridge and the loxahatchee river dubois park and corresponded to conditions at the time that enterococci samples were collected statistical analysis for long term doh data included linear regression and analysis of variance anova linear regression was used to evaluate enterococci with respect to quantitative environmental data rainfall air temperature water temperature while anova using statistical analysis system sas was used to evaluate categorical environmental data weather sunny cloudy rainy tidal conditions a high medium low tidal conditions b ebb flood slack current direction a still north south east west current direction b along shore left to right along shore right to left neither and current strength strong moderate weak 3 1 3 analysis of dbhydro nutrient and hydrologic data and doh enterococci data enterococci doh were analyzed against nutrient and hydrologic data dbhydro statistical analysis was conducted using multiple regression and factor analysis as described above additionally within lake okeechobee s308 some of the flows were recorded as negative numbers which corresponded to back pumping a practice in which water is pumped out of the st lucie canal into lake okeechobee the opposite direction of normal flow t tests were performed on the doh roosevelt bridge enterococci and dbhydro s308 hydrologic flow data positive versus negative values to identify significant differences p 0 05 in enterococci levels at roosevelt bridge based on flow direction building on this hydrologic flow data from s308 and s80 was also analyzed against roosevelt bridge enterococci and chlorophyll a levels along with other physical chemical parameters from s80 chlorophyll a enterococci nutrients and turbidity levels were analyzed during periods where both s308 and s80 flow was positive measuring lake and downstream watershed contribution and when flow from s308 was zero and s80 was positive measuring st lucie canal watershed contribution only these are the only analyses in which dbhydro data and doh data are evaluated against each other 3 2 year long field study data and analysis to evaluate the potential drivers of the microalgae blooms and enterococci exceedances a year long study of monthly field measurements was conducted at sites within lake okeechobee canal point the st lucie river roosevelt bridge and the loxahatchee river dubois park during each monthly visit surface 0 3 m water samples were collected and physical chemical measures and local meteorological conditions were recorded in the field water samples were collected and then analyzed for chlorophyll a pheophytin enterococci nutrients nitrate nitrite total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn orthophosphorus and total phosphorus and turbidity brief descriptions of the analysis methods used for these measures are provided in the supplemental text physical chemical measurements of sampling depth water temperature ph salinity and dissolved oxygen do were recorded via field meter hydrolab surveyor 4 with hydrotech compact minisonde 4a meteorological conditions including air temperature wind and humidity were recorded via the navclock for iphone app version 3 3 5 split rail inc which reports these measurements from the nearest weather station based on gps location to assess relationships with rainfall rainfall data were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s national centers for environmental information ncei formerly the national climatic data center ncdc ncei rainfall data came from weather stations near canal point usc00081276 s308 us1flmt0016 roosevelt bridge usc00088620 and dubois park usc00084461 analysis for the year long monthly field sampling data included time series analysis at each site and multiple regression following the same methods outlined above of sampled chlorophyll a and enterococci against individual nutrients and physical chemical data to mirror the analysis of the rainfall data collected by doh and analyzed in this long term study regression analysis was performed on the ncei rainfall data using similar time periods rainfall amounts one month one week three days and 24 h before the collection dates against the chlorophyll a and enterococci data collected in the monthly field sampling study 3 3 microcosms the microcosm studies were designed to evaluate the impacts from lake okeechobee water and sediment on microalgae indicated by chlorophyll a and enterococci surface water samples were collected from lake okeechobee canal point the st lucie river roosevelt bridge and the loxahatchee river dubois park sediments were collected from lake okeechobee canal point and the loxahatchee river dubois park dubois park water and sediments were used as controls as the loxahatchee river is not connected to lake okeechobee yet experiences high levels of enterococci four laboratory based microcosm experiments were conducted at the university of miami department of marine biology and ecology laboratory all microcosms were conducted without replication for all microcosms water was analyzed for chlorophyll a and enterococci every 12 h for a 36 h period following sample collection chlorophyll a and enterococci were measured over time under two conditions water only and water with sediment to isolate the impacts from lake okeechobee microcosms considered 1 surface water only from lake okeechobee cp the st lucie river rb and the loxahatchee river dp collected june 2018 2 surface water deionized di water 2 1 dilution from lake okeechobee canal point and the loxahatchee river dubois park collected september 2017 3 surface water sediment from lake okeechobee canal point collected november 2017 and 4 lake okeechobee canal point surface water with either lake okeechobee sediments canal point or loxahatchee dubois park sediments collected january 2018 light and temperature were designed for microalgae or enterococci growth conditions used for microalgae growth were 19 c with alternating light and dark cycles for enterococci growth conditions were 41 c under dark conditions epa 2009 microcosms with sediment involved the lowering or raising of a sediment tray into or out of the water every 12 h to simulate wetting and drying cycles supplementary fig s1 the first experiment which evaluated water only at all three sites consisted of six individual 1 l clear plastic bottle microcosms all six of the microcosms in the first experiment were kept in algae room conditions 19 c light dark three microcosms consisted of water bottles collected directly from lake okeechobee canal point the st lucie river roosevelt bridge and the loxahatchee river dubois park the other three microcosms consisted of water from the same sites the waters for these microcosms were filtered following the normal procedure for total suspended solids borosilicate filter 1 5 μm nominal pore size the second experiment analyzed surface water from lake okeechobee canal point and the loxahatchee river dubois park considering pure samples and 2 1 di water dilutions six 1l microcosms were created one set 3 samples of the collected water was maintained in the algae culture room 19 c light dark the second set of 3 was incubated under conditions recommended for enterococci growth 41 c dark microcosms in the algae room were housed in clear glass bottles those in the incubator conditions were housed in brown nalgene sampling bottles all caps were vented the water combinations included 1 500 ml dubois park 500 ml canal point 2 500 ml dubois park 500 ml di and 3 500 ml canal point 500 ml di the third experiment evaluated only the lake okeechobee environment the microcosms were composed of water and sediment two microcosms were created one for each condition algae culture room or enterococci incubator a double tray system was developed to allow the sediment to have periods of exposure as well as to be covered by water sediment was placed in a tray upper tray at the bottom of a larger tray filled with water lower tray the upper tray was raised or lowered at each sampling interval every 12 h to simulate wetting and drying cycles brakenhoff et al 2018 feng et al 2015 marchant et al 2017 typically observed at the coast due to tides measurements were taken before and after the tray was moved measurements taken after are designated by a 0 1 after the hour it was collected e g 12 1 the fourth experiment evaluated the effect of sediment source two microcosms were created one consisted of lake okeechobee water canal point and loxahatchee river dubois park sediments and the other consisted of lake okeechobee canal point water and lake okeechobee canal point sediments both microcosms were kept in algae culture room conditions 19 c light dark using the double tray system as in the third experiment with the tray raised or lowered every 12 h lake okeechobee sediment consisted of mixed rock shell fill collected from the littoral zone from canal point loxahatchee river sediment consisted of beach sand collected at dubois park grain size distributions were measured for general categorization of sediment types using the standard test method for particle size analysis of soils astm 2007 see supplementary table s4 for detailed results of grain size distributions 4 results 4 1 long term study data 4 1 1 dbhydro multiple regression of chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci against nutrient physical chemical meteorological and hydrologic data analysis was conducted in two parts the first part table 1 analyzed dependent variables chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci against nutrients and physical chemical measures i e independent predictor variables at lake okeechobee s308 the st lucie canal s80 and the st lucie river se03 fig 1 table 1 the second table 2 analyzed enterococci levels at roosevelt bridge against the hydrologic data at lake okeechobee s308 and the st lucie canal s80 among both data sets the only significant correlations p 0 05 were observed at the st lucie river se03 and the st lucie canal s80 none were observed in lake okeechobee s308 at se03 when evaluating chlorophyll a through multiple regression the strongest model included pheophytin tkn water temperature and salinity n 139 f 15 8 p 0 0001 r2 0 30 table 1 individually chlorophyll a significantly correlated with pheophytin parameter estimate 1 12 p 0 0001 and tkn parameter estimate 6 92 p 0 008 as independent variables table 1 the model for pheophytin at se03 included chlorophyll a nitrate nitrite tkn total phosphorus water temperature and salinity through multiple regression n 139 f 12 0 p 0 0001 r2 0 32 table 1 individually pheophytin was significantly correlated with chlorophyll a only parameter estimate 0 18 p 0 0001 table 1 the strongest enterococci model at se03 included chlorophyll a pheophytin nitrate nitrite tkn total phosphorus orthophosphorus turbidity water temperature salinity and do n 39 f 19 2 p 0 0001 r2 0 83 table 1 individually enterococci demonstrated significant correlations with nitrate nitrite tkn total phosphorus orthophosphorus and turbidity individual p values 0 05 table 1 for s80 enterococci doh roosevelt bridge data the strongest multiple regression model included tkn total phosphorus turbidity ph and do n 49 f 13 8 p 0 0001 r2 0 57 table 1 individually enterococci correlated significantly with tkn and turbidity individual p values 0 05 table 1 for the hydrologic data table 2 multiple regression models indicated that at s80 enterococci levels were correlated with flow gate stage rain and gage height p 0 0005 r2 0 23 individually enterococci correlated significantly with stage rain and gate height individual p values 0 05 at s308 lake okeechobee the enterococci model included flow gate stage and rain although the model was not significant p 0 3 r2 0 008 table 2 with no individual variables correlating significantly with hydrologic data overall multiple regression results suggest that tkn is an important predictor of chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci enterococci also demonstrated significant associations with total phosphorus orthophosphorus and turbidity 4 1 2 dbhydro lake okeechobee s308 and st lucie canal s80 flow and doh st lucie river roosevelt bridge enterococci data results from a t test performed to distinguish differences in enterococci by flow direction show that there was a statistically significant difference in enterococci levels p 0 001 at roosevelt bridge when freshwater was flowing downstream from lake okeechobee into the st lucie river mean enterococci 49 7 cfu 100 ml n 733 versus when it was reporting a negative flow from the st lucie river into lake okeechobee mean enterococci 17 8 cfu 100 ml n 95 these findings suggest that flow from the lake may be a contributor to enterococci at roosevelt bridge serving as a direct bacterial source indirectly promoting conditions that allow enterococci to proliferate or as a covariate of rainfall see figs 2a 3a and 3 b building on this hydrologic flow data from s308 and s80 was also analyzed against roosevelt bridge chlorophyll a enterococci nutrient levels and physical chemical parameters the number of data points for chlorophyll a was small a total of seven so not all of the analyses could be performed for this parameter hydrologic conditions were divided into four categories depending upon whether flow in s308 or s80 was positive these conditions included 1 s308 greater than zero and s80 flow at zero no contribution to roosevelt bridge 2 both s308 and s80 flow greater than zero lake plus st lucie canal watershed contribution 3 both s308 and s80 flow at zero or less only s308 has back pumping or negative flows no contribution to roosevelt bridge and 4 s308 flow is zero s80 is greater than zero contribution from st lucie canal watershed given the small sample size chlorophyll a could not be divided into all four categories it was divided into categories 1 and 3 the means were highest under condition 1 7 50 μg l followed by condition 3 5 80 μg l for enterococci the means were highest under condition 2 74 3 cfu 100 ml followed by condition 4 44 7 cfu 100 ml condition 1 30 0 cfu 100 ml and then condition 3 26 0 cfu 100 ml the means for orthophosphorus followed the same pattern with their highest values under conditions 2 both lake and watershed contributing followed by condition 4 watershed only contributing table 3 for tkn and total phosphorus condition 4 was higher followed by condition 2 for nitrate nitrite the means were nearly the same in both conditions to further evaluate lake versus watershed contributions condition 2 was evaluated in terms of the relative contributions from the lake versus the watershed when flow through s308 lake okeechobee contribution was higher than through s80 st lucie canal watershed contribution the enterococci mean was 58 9 cfu 100 ml when flow through s80 was higher the enterococci levels averaged 93 3 cfu 100 ml at roosevelt bridge for nutrients and physical chemical parameters the mean concentrations did not differ significantly in terms of whether flows through s308 versus s80 were higher with the exception of turbidity the turbidity when s308 had more flow mean of 21 0 ntu was statistically higher than the turbidity when s80 had more flow mean of 3 8 ntu 4 1 3 linear regression and anova for analysis of doh enterococci and environmental data in the st lucie and loxahatchee rivers when quantitative environmental values were considered linear regression showed that enterococci at the st lucie river roosevelt bridge was significantly correlated with rainfall during all periods tested although the correlations were relatively weak with low r2 values r2 0 04 supplementary table s5 similarly in the loxahatchee river at dubois park correlations between enterococci and rainfall were significant although r2 values were weak r2 0 002 enterococci at roosevelt bridge showed significant positive correlations with air and water temperatures enterococci did not correlate significantly with temperatures at dubois park supplementary table s5 when the categorical environmental variables were considered table 4 at roosevelt bridge enterococci levels did not show a significant difference when sorted by weather p 0 05 at dubois park enterococci levels when sorted by different weather were statistically different n 729 f value 12 55 p 0 0001 with a strong difference in enterococci levels between weather observed to be sunny 1 versus cloudy 2 versus rainy 3 conditions table 4 enterococci did not show significant differences with tidal conditions a or b at either site however at dubois park enterococci levels differed statistically by tidal conditions b n 607 f value 5 33 p value 0 005 with a strong difference between tide observed as ebb tide 1 versus flood 2 and slack 3 tide enterococci levels did not significantly differ by current direction a at either site current direction b was statistically significant at roosevelt bridge n 582 f value 5 7 p value 0 004 and at dubois park f value 5 3 p value 0 04 the current strength categories showed no significant differences at either site overall rainfall was associated with enterococci at both roosevelt bridge and dubois park temperature and current direction b were important at roosevelt bridge while weather and tidal conditions b were factors significantly influencing enterococci levels at dubois park table 4 4 2 year long monthly field sampling data and analysis in the st lucie river water quality parameters at the roosevelt bridge site changed according to the tides during flood tides the field meter readings of water quality parameters were similar to those found in the loxahatchee river at dubois park whereas during ebb tides the field meter readings were similar to parameters measured in lake okeechobee at canal point supplementary table s8 meteorological data demonstrated that the wind and humidity increased and the air temperature dropped supplementary table s6 toward the coast for the physical chemical measures salinity increased and turbidity decreased toward the coast the complete set of all of the observations is available in the supplement supplementary tables s7 and s8 4 2 1 time series analysis for each site in general chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci decreased during the dry season november april and increased during the wet season may october as shown in the corresponding rainfall records of each site figs 2 4 in lake okeechobee at canal point fig 2 rainfall appeared to coincide with elevated chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci from may through august in march total nitrogen tkn and phosphorus coincided with increased enterococci in the st lucie river at roosevelt bridge fig 3 chlorophyll a and pheophytin demonstrated a peak during january 2018 enterococci remained low 100 cfu 100 ml or below for most of the study until june 1 020 cfu 100 ml when rainfall total nitrogen tkn total phosphorus and orthophosphate increased elevated levels were observed in all measures shown from may until august in the loxahatchee river at dubois park fig 4 rainfall did not appear to have as much of an impact on chlorophyll a pheophytin or enterococci at the beginning of the study as it did at the end chlorophyll a was elevated for this site at the beginning of the study as was total nitrogen tkn and phosphorus for the remainder of the field sampling period chlorophyll a and pheophytin remained at a low level both around 3 μg l or below while enterococci increased in march 200 cfu 100 ml up from 40 cfu 100 ml in february along with increasing total nitrogen and tkn enterococci increased again in may 330 cfu 100 ml up from 30 cfu 100 ml in april coinciding with the wet season overall all concentrations tended to decrease from lake okeechobee canal point to the st lucie roosevelt bridge to the loxahatchee dubois park figs 2 4 chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci generally increased with rainfall and nutrients 4 2 2 multiple regression of chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci against nutrient physical chemical and meteorological data multiple regression analysis of the data collected during the year long field sampling table 5 showed that for lake okeechobee at canal point the model for chlorophyll a included ph salinity and sample depth n 12 f 3 9 p 0 05 r2 0 45 independently there were no significant correlations between chlorophyll a and any of the independent variables individual p 0 05 the model for pheophytin included chlorophyll a and enterococci total phosphorus water temperature salinity do sample depth and wave height n 12 f 9 8 p 0 04 r2 0 86 independently significant correlations were observed with chlorophyll a and do individual p 0 05 the model for enterococci included nitrate nitrate tkn orthophosphorus salinity and do but was not significant n 12 f 1 2 p 0 4 r2 0 08 enterococci did not correlate significantly with any of the independent variables individual p 0 05 in the st lucie river at roosevelt bridge the chlorophyll a model included pheophytin enterococci tkn ph salinity and tide n 11 f 63 9 p 0 0006 r2 0 99 independently only pheophytin was significant parameter estimate 0 68 p 0 0003 the pheophytin model included chlorophyll a enterococci nitrite nitrate orthophosphorus and salinity n 8 f 32 6 p 0 03 r2 0 96 independently there were no significant associations the multiple regression model for enterococci included chlorophyll a pheophytin orthophosphorus ph salinity and sample depth n 8 f 37 0 p 0 10 r2 0 99 independently there were no significant associations in the loxahatchee river at dubois park the model for chlorophyll a included total phosphorus and salinity n 12 f 4 83 p 0 04 r2 0 41 the pheophytin model included turbidity and salinity n 12 f 2 28 p 0 16 r2 0 19 and the enterococci model included total phosphorus salinity and sample depth n 12 f 3 79 p 0 06 r2 0 43 independently there were no significant associations for any of the variables individual p 0 05 overall for the monthly data salinity was a parameter identified for all models but as an independent variable it was not significant at the st lucie river roosevelt bridge the model for chlorophyll a included pheophytin and enterococci the model for pheophytin included chlorophyll a and enterococci and the model for enterococci included chlorophyll a and pheophytin 4 2 3 rainfall data and monthly field sampling for chlorophyll a and enterococci for the analysis with ncei rainfall data table 6 enterococci showed site specific correlations on all time scales rainfall 24 h before 3 days before week before and month before in lake okeechobee chlorophyll a and pheophytin showed significant correlations at the month time scale table 6 correlations between chlorophyll a and pheophytin with rainfall at shorter time scales were not consistent thus enterococci appears to respond to rainfall at multiple time scales both long and short while chlorophyll a and pheophytin respond on longer time scales 4 3 microcosms results from the microcosms suggest that the presence of sediment from lake okeechobee canal point may have an influence on the proliferation of enterococci and may contribute to increased chlorophyll a levels in the first and second microcosm experiments supplementary figs s2 and s3 evaluating water from all of the sites enterococci persisted at about the same normalized level or dropped by 24 h after the experiment started chlorophyll a after 24 h had increased the high and persistent levels of chlorophyll was expected since this water was collected during a period of enterococci exceedance cyanobacteria bloom and high turbidities in lake okeechobee and the st lucie river however dubois park in the loxahatchee river did not have any indication of cyanobacteria at the time of initial sample collection in the third and fourth microcosm experiments figs 5 and 6 with lake okeechobee sediment enterococci persisted through 36 h when dubois park sediment was used enterococci concentrations did not persist and dropped after 12 h fig 6 chlorophyll a and enterococci followed a cyclical pattern in both the microcosm in the algae room and in the incubator this pattern may be in response to the raising and lowering of the sediment tray every 12 h the stirring up of the water and sediment may have caused the difference between the lower measurement at 24 h made before the tray was moved and the higher measurement at 24 1 h made after the tray was moved 5 discussion this study was designed to analyze microalgae and enterococci in three watersheds in association with environmental and water quality parameters that are known to be important to both dependent variables there have been few studies documenting the water quality environmental parameters of both enterococci and microalgae together most of what is known about microalgae or about enterococci has been discovered through studies of either microalgae or enterococci along with the known drivers for that specific variable associations between chlorophyll a pheophytin and nutrients are well known dolman et al 2012 paerl et al 2008 havens et al 2003 kramer et al 2018 khare et al 2019 and monitoring programs typically analyze for these nutrients as part of their standard protocol additionally for cyanobacteria studies have also noted the influence of tides currents wind driven waves and shoreline conditions soontiens et al 2018 naja et al 2017 rosen and st amand 2015 for enterococci as consistent with other studies wright et al 2011 enns et al 2012 barreras et al 2019 dila et al 2018 mclellan and roguet 2019 mclellan et al 2015 environmental factors such as tide rainfall and temperature have been associated with the levels of enterococci as observed in the current study few studies exist that have evaluated associations between environmental enterococci and nutrient levels cloutier et al 2015 most studies that evaluate specifically the effects of nutrients on fibs were conducted at wastewater treatment plants where nitrogen and phosphorus are also typically measured lechevallier et al 1991 derry and attwater 2014 in this study we found that rainfall temperature flows and nutrients were significant independent predictor variables for both chlorophyll a and enterococci most of what is known about growth factors for enterococci originates from the medical field with studies on environmental enterococci rapidly increasing in evaluating enterococci within the intestinal tract of mammals ramsey et al 2014 noted that enterococci use the process of phosphorylation the addition of a phosphoryl group po3 to provide adenosinetriphosphate atp to the cell in a comparative genomic analysis of enterococcus some of the type strains were found to have 15 strain specific genes for nitrogen metabolism and 18 core genes and one strain specific gene for phosphorus metabolism zhong et al 2017 this may indicate that enterococci can use nutrients in the extraenteric environment which seems to be in opposition to findings that indicated they require complex nutrients lebreton et al 2014 enterococci may also be protected in oligotrophic environments due to their thick peptidoglycan wall and their use of biofilm both of which are known to offer protective barriers in extraenteric environments chang et al 2018 the closest study of correlation between microalgae and enterococci simultaneously revealed that enterococci may be highly concentrated in plankton which included cyanobacteria and associated particles especially summer and fall months mote et al 2012 other studies echo the association between enterococci and plankton asserting that enterococci survive because they adhere to the plankton maugeri et al 2004 which serve as reservoirs for enterococci signoretto et al 2004 byappanahalli et al 2012 recommended further study of ecological factors on the survival of enterococci recognizing the influence of other organisms in controlling enterococci populations despite the similarities of potential drivers there have been few studies documenting the water quality environmental parameters of both fib and microalgae together it is important to note that this study began immediately following hurricane irma which made landfall in south florida in september 2017 producing large amounts of rainfall at the lake and both rivers hurricane irma may have impacted the watersheds examined in the current study and subsequently may have been an important factor in the cyanobacterial bloom and enterococci exceedances measured during our year long study in 2018 increases in enterococci levels immediately after hurricanes has been documented roca et al 2019 but such increases are not necessarily noticeable for cyanobacteria for example after hurricanes katrina and rita elevated levels of enterococci were noted in the lake pontchartrain area for a period of up to two months after the storm whereas no evidence of a cyanobacterial bloom was noted sinigalliano et al 2007 in the longer term the timing of the year long monthly sampling study was very fortunate when it comes to the evaluation of enterococci and chlorophyll a as it coincided with a fdep confirmed 2018 cyanobacterial bloom and the declared state of emergency in southeastern florida in spring 2018 during this study the wet season began with heavy rains the wet season a time of increased rain and high temperatures has also proven to be a time of increased nutrients e g lapointe et al 2012 enterococci spikes were reported at both roosevelt bridge and dubois park following the rain and blue green algae cyanobacteria was documented by fdep near roosevelt bridge this increase in dependent variables and the nutrients together during the wet season was detected in the time series analysis influencing both enterococci and cyanobacteria levels results from the microcosms suggested that the presence and or resuspension of sediments fine material from lake okeechobee may have an influence on the proliferation of enterococci and may contribute to increased chlorophyll a levels chlorophyll is known to maintain a diurnal cycle in response to light and darkness leypunskiy et al 2017 yet we observed the cycling of both chlorophyll and enterococci in both the algae culture room and the incubator peaks at 0 and 24 h fig 5 it is difficult to determine whether the cycling is due to circadian patterns or the action of raising and lowering the sediment tray which also occurred every 12 h and may have initiated resuspension the importance of resuspension has been noted at recreational beaches where enterococci proliferate in sediments and with wave action are released from these sediments into the water column ferguson et al 2005 desmarais et al 2002 verhougstraete and rose 2014 whitman et al 2014 feng et al 2016 moreover wind driven resuspension has been previously noted in lake okeechobee maceina and soballe 1990 and can be a precursor to cyanobacteria blooms paerl 1988 here the lake okeechobee sediments were classified as poorly graded gravels see supplemental table s4 yet we observed a fine black material present in the lake okeechobee sediments field observations this study in contrast to dubois park s sandy sediments supplemental table s4 typically gravels can promote a buildup of fine organic material in pore spaces increasing localized resuspension koiter et al 2015 whereas a low fraction of fine particles present in sands can stabilize sediments bartzke et al 2013 thus it is possible that even a small fraction of fine material present in lake okeechobee sediments could have a disproportionate impact on water quality 6 conclusions the results from this study demonstrate that excess nutrients are associated with elevated chlorophyll a and enterococci levels while the correlations between nutrients chlorophyll a pheophytin and enterococci were similar across sites the driving physical chemical environmental and meteorological variables were site specific we found that enterococci levels may be influenced by flow from lake okeechobee into the st lucie river as seen through the analysis of long term hydrologic data when flow at s308 was reversed enterococci levels dropped significantly at roosevelt bridge at dubois park we also observed the importance of tidal conditions and short term rainfall this may indicate that chlorophyll a and enterococci levels change based on a combination of the available nutrients and the physical chemical environmental and meteorological conditions at each site when hydrologic flow data from s308 and s80 was analyzed against roosevelt bridge enterococci and chlorophyll a nutrient levels and turbidity at s80 we found that the means for almost every parameter measured was highest for condition 2 where both lake okeechobee and the st lucie canal had flows greater than zero both lake and watershed contributions and then for condition 4 where only the st lucie canal had flows greater than zero watershed contribution this supports the hypothesis that both the lake and downstream watershed contribute to the chlorophyll a enterococci and physical chemical parameters at receiving waters downstream the highly significant turbidity response when flows were high from the lake again implicates that both the lake and downstream watershed are contributing to water quality perhaps enhanced through fine sediment transport out of the lake and into the st lucie canal overall similarities were observed in the relationships of chlorophyll a and enterococci with nutrients regardless of a lake okeechobee connection this suggests that both nutrient rich lake water and untreated runoff contribute to the microalgae blooms and enterococci exceedances in southeast florida these similarities in response to nutrients and hydrologic conditions may explain the coincidence of both cyanobacteria blooms and bacterial exceedances observed during the summer of 2018 downstream of the st lucie river future work is necessary to evaluate the possible connections between cyanobacteria and enterococci and to fully understand the biogeochemistry of areas that have blooms and exceedances these studies should focus on the evaluation and characterization of the nutrients specific to each watershed as well as the native sediment organic matter and local hydrodynamics this should include work on the effects of environmental conditions such as rainfall and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes further studies on enterococci levels and the direction of flows near the roosevelt bridge sampling area should also be included these studies will provide greater understanding as to whether sediments could be contributing to blooms and exceedances in the st lucie river especially after periods of heavy rainfall an understanding of the influence of weather events on blooms and exceedances may lead to the eventual forecasting of blooms and or exceedances declaration of competing

18229,intense pressure on water resources has led to efforts to reuse reclaimed processing wastewater for cleaning purposes in food processing plants the milk industry produces considerable amounts of wastewater which can be used for cleaning of equipment after appropriate treatment however due to naturally occurring microbiological contamination in raw milk the wastewater is often contaminated and therefore the reuse of reclaimed wastewater is perceived as risky this study aims to quantify the risks of listeria monocytogenes infection and associated disease burden when wastewater reclaimed from milk processing operations is used in cleaning in place cip systems for pasteurized fluid milk production following a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach furthermore this study aims to inform risk based tolerable limits for levels of contamination in cip water based on a public health target of 10 6 daly per person annually the suggested model investigates the passage of l monocytogenes throughout the fluid milk chain from receipt of raw milk at the plant to the point of consumption and covering storage in receiving and storage tanks pasteurization and storage at retail and at home risk and disease burden estimates are simulated for general younger than 65 years elderly 65 years and older and pregnant population subgroups additional scenarios covering the effect of using clean water using water with different levels of contamination and using reclaimed wastewater modeled as recovered from cheese whey after membrane filtration reclaimed water scenario are considered to estimate a risk based limit of contamination and simulate a real life example the tolerable limit of contamination in cip water was estimated as 2 log10 cfu ml to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable subgroup pregnant women while higher limits were estimated for the elderly and general subgroups under the reclaimed water scenario the annual number of listeriosis cases was estimated as 3 36 5 67 and 0 15 for the general elderly and pregnant population subgroups respectively while in the clean water scenario the estimates were 3 33 5 56 and 0 15 respectively in both scenarios the daly estimates were lower than the tolerable limit the results indicate that reclaimed water can be an alternative to potable water for cip applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative microbial risk assessment cleaning in place microbiological limits daly wastewater reuse 1 introduction dairy industry operations require considerable amounts of freshwater and produce high strength wastewater estimates indicate that overall wastewater output is 2 5 times greater than the amount of milk processed and approximately 70 of freshwater used is released as wastewater slavov 2017 sanitation consumes more than half of freshwater used in the dairy industry and the use of reclaimed wastewater for cleaning purposes in processing plants provides an opportunity to relieve this intense pressure on freshwater resources adams 2018 the codex alimentarius 1999 defines reclaimed water as water that was originally a constituent of a food has been removed from the food by a process step and has been subsequently reconditioned when necessary such that it may be reused in a subsequent manufacturing operation the performance economy and safety of cleaning in place cip systems using reclaimed wastewater have been demonstrated for water recovered from cheese whey by ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro meneses and flores 2016a b due to the increasing focus on water conservation the performance of wastewater treatment approaches such as ro or forward osmosis membrane distillation uf nanofiltration and their combinations has been studied extensively primarily with a focus on improving physical chemical indicators aydiner et al 2014 balannec et al 2002 however studies considering the microbiological quality of reclaimed water especially pathogen contamination are limited therefore the microbial risk of reclaimed water is often questioned creating a negative risk perception of its potential hazardous health impact among dairy processors legislators and the public and highlighting the need for risk based microbiological specifications for safe wastewater reuse casani et al 2005 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a systematic approach to estimate public health risks attributable to the exposure to a microbiological pathogen that comprises stages of hazard identification exposure assessment hazard characterization and risk characterization qmra provides science based information to support decision making processes for the development of regulatory standards and guidelines identifying and evaluating different risk management alternatives and prioritizing risk and research needs parkin 2007 qmra has been endorsed internationally as a powerful tool for the determination of risk based microbiological criteria for setting performance objectives for individual food industries to achieve national food safety and public health protection goals andersen et al 2015 usda fsis and epa 2012 van schothorst et al 2009 who and fao 2009 several qmra models investigating public health risks due to the consumption of ready to eat meals and milk have been documented in the literature and qmra frameworks were offered by fda and usda 2003 and by who and fao 2004 however none has been applied to setting standards for safe reuse of reclaimed wastewater in the food processing industry listeria monocytogenes is a constant concern in dairy products due to the high frequency of detection in raw milk and various environmental niches on dairy farms and at processing plants kabuki et al 2004 van kessel et al 2011 although the incidence of invasive listeriosis is relatively low the disease burden is highly significant compared to other foodborne diseases due to high mortality rates and the vulnerability of pregnant women the annual number of listeriosis cases in the united states is estimated as 1591 90 cri 557 3161 and 230 90 cri 80 470 of these cases are associated with pregnancy scallan et al 2011 2015 however the disease burdens for pregnancy associated and non pregnancy associated cases are estimated to be the same i e 4400 90 cri 1500 8400 and 4400 90 cri 300 13100 disability adjusted life years daly corresponding to 3 23 and 19 13 daly per case respectively scallan et al 2015 according to the interagency food safety analytics collaboration 45 3 of listeriosis cases are attributed to dairy product consumption but the exact share attributable to pasteurized fluid milk the most consumed dairy product is uncertain ifsac 2018 comprehensive surveys indicate that the presence of listeria in pasteurized milk is fairly low globally frye and donnelly 2005 thanks to effective control of microbial contamination by pasteurization however low levels of listeria are reported to be persistent in processing equipment and other post processing environments in processing facilities leading to possible contamination after pasteurization oliver et al 2005 among potential contamination sources in dairy processing facilities the use of contaminated water in cleaning systems may introduce the possibility of recontamination and therefore the risks associated with such systems should be evaluated in this study a probabilistic qmra model was developed to address the introduction of l monocytogenes contamination from cip cleaning water during milk processing and to establish critical limits for contamination in cip cleaning water to achieve an appropriate level of public health protection specifically this study aims to 1 predict the impact of reuse of water recovered from cheese whey for cip operations in dairy processing facilities on total disease burden attributable to fluid milk consumption and 2 inform risk based tolerable maximum l monocytogenes levels in reclaimed water for cip that can meet the public health target of 10 6 daly per person per year as offered by who 2017 the model presented in this study provides a qmra framework to investigate possible contamination routes due to water recycling during fluid milk processing and to provide scientific evidence to risk managers and policy makers in terms of safe use of reclaimed water in the food industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview l monocytogenes contamination throughout the fluid milk processing line was modeled using probabilistic inputs for passage of raw milk received at the processing plant and stored in receiving tanks pasteurization storage after pasteurization partitioning storage at distribution and consumers homes and consumption the dose of l monocytogenes per serving at the point of consumption was then used as an input to the dose response model to predict the annual number of listeriosis cases and associated disease burden expressed as daly among the whole population and separate population subgroups in the united states three population subgroups were evaluated in this model considering age and life stage related differences in sensitivity to the consumption of contaminated products the general population younger than 65 years excluding pregnant women the elderly 65 years and older and pregnant women these three groups were selected as representative of the total population because in the dose response model developed by pouillot et al 2015 which considered 11 population subgroups the general population the elderly and the pregnant encompassed approximately 90 of the total population the structure of the conceptual model is presented in fig 1 the initial source of contamination was modeled as originating from raw milk raw milk is stored in receiving tanks where there is a possibility of introducing more contamination from the tank surface to the milk two potential sources of contamination on the inner surface of the receiving tanks are considered in this model the previous batch of raw milk held by the tank and cleaning with possibly contaminated cip water the raw milk is then pasteurized and the pasteurized milk is stored in another storage tank which could also be contaminated by pathogens that survived the heat treatment in the current batch of milk the previous batch of milk held in the tank and contaminated cip water used for the cleaning process the pasteurized milk is then partitioned into standard milk bottles 1 us gal 3 79 l and distributed within a cold chain the bottled milk is portioned into servings at the time of consumption serving size 1 us cup 237 ml the probability of invasive listeriosis per serving consumed is then calculated by a dose response model inputs to the model were sourced from laboratory experiments to describe the transfer of bacteria from reclaimed water to the tank surfaces and then to the batch of milk to be processed sections 2 2 1 2 2 2 table 1 other inputs describing initial levels of contamination and changes in contamination measured as prevalence and concentration during processing were sourced from the relevant literature table 2 throughout the model the prevalence of contaminated units was expressed as the ratio of the number of contaminated units to the number of all units and the concentration of contaminated units was expressed as log10 cfu ml a one dimensional monte carlo simulation with latin hypercube sampling was conducted with 500 000 iterations using risk version 7 6 palisade corporation new york usa to run different scenarios the random seed was set to 1 to ensure that the resulting changes were due to changing levels of inputs in a specific scenario rather than randomness 2 2 determination of key input parameters by experimental procedures 2 2 1 cleaning efficiency the parameters for the cleaning efficiency of the simulated system were derived from a previous study investigating the attachment of pseudomonas aeruginosa to stainless steel coupons representing the surface of a typical milk storage tank assuming similar attachment properties as l monocytogenes meneses and flores 2016a although significant variation in the surface attachment characteristics of various l monocytogenes strains has been observed harvey et al 2007 p aeruginosa was reported to have a similar range of biofilm formation as l monocytogenes in a microtiter plate assay overhage et al 2007 the efficiency ratio er was defined as the proportional change in the probability of contamination of coupons with l monocytogenes before and after cip application representing the change in prevalence of contaminated areas of the tank inner surface the efficiency factor ef was defined as the change in the number of cells on contaminated coupons due to cip cleaning as the log10 cfu difference representing the change in concentration on contaminated areas er and ef were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 1 e r p a f t 1 p b f p b f 1 p a f t 2 e f c a f t c b f where p bf and p aft are the probabilities of a coupon being contaminated before and after cip respectively and c bf and c aft are the concentrations on contaminated coupons before and after cip respectively the corresponding distributions of p bf p aft c bf and c aft are given in table 1 before and after prevalence and concentration parameters were modeled as correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0 5 to ensure that higher contamination greater values of prevalence and concentration before cip would be more likely to result in higher contamination after the process the choice of the correlation factor was made based on a positive correlation assumption however due to the lack of information on the strength of the correlation the factor was set to 0 5 to account for the uncertainty 2 2 2 transfer rates of l monocytogenes from reclaimed water to tank surfaces and subsequently to milk transfer rates were determined by challenge experiments conducted in a laboratory scale biofilm reactor biosurface technologies corp bozeman mt containing 16 sterile stainless steel coupons the reactor was operated under standardized conditions as reported by astm international 2012 the biofilm reactor was used to mimic the dynamics in a milk tank such as attachment of l monocytogenes cells to the stainless steel surface and detachment of surface contamination into milk during storage briefly pasteurized milk confirmed to be free of listeria spp was stored in the biofilm reactor for 24 h at 7 c absence of listeria spp was confirmed by a rapidchek listeria lateral flow kit romer labs getzersdorf at after storage a cip regimen consisting of an initial 5 min water rinse at 25 c a 10 min wash with caustic cleaner 30 g l 65 1 c spartan a 5 min water rinse at 25 c a 10 min wash with an acidic solution 6 g l 65 1 c spartan and a final 5 min water rinse at 25 c was applied although cip parameters may vary slightly depending on the process characteristics the above regimen is similar to the standard cip regimen in the dairy industry which consists of rinsing with water cleaning with alkaline solution rinsing with warm water cleaning with an acidic reagent and final rinsing with warm water thomas and sathian 2014 the water used in the cip regimen originated from contaminated reclaimed water containing 3 log10 cfu ml of l monocytogenes cells this level of contamination was selected because it allows for the detection of surviving bacteria without creating an unrealistic scenario e g 6 log10 cfu ml after cip two sets of eight coupons were aseptically removed from the holders in the reactor one of the sets was tested immediately after cip to measure the initial concentration on coupons c ini transferred from the contaminated cip water and the second set was placed in 9 ml of pasteurized milk and tested after 24 h of storage in milk at 7 c to measure the concentration on the coupons after release of the contamination from the surface to milk after a 24 h storage c 24h the bacteria remaining on the coupons were recovered by immersion in 9 ml of water in dilution tubes to eliminate any planktonic bacteria the coupons were then immediately transferred to new dilution tubes containing 9 ml of water and sonicated at room temperature for 4 min using an ultrasonic cleaner brason 1210 marshall scientific to remove the cells from the surface samples containing cells recovered from the coupons were tested by the three tube most probable number mpn method with a detection limit of 3 mpn ml the samples were serially diluted in peptone water 100 101 102 and 1 ml from each dilution was transferred to each of three test tubes containing university of vermont modified uvm listeria enrichment broth neogen lansing mi and incubated at 30 c for 24 h after incubation 0 1 ml from each uvm tube was transferred to each of three tubes containing fraser broth neogen lansing mi and incubated at 35 c for 48 h the presence of l monocytogenes in positive tubes identified by blackening of the medium was confirmed by streaking one loopful of enrichment culture onto selective modified oxford mox plates neogen lansing mi the plates were incubated at 35 c for 48 h the number of confirmed positive tubes was recorded and the mpn values were determined using the statistical tables suggested by fda 2015 the procedures in the biofilm reactor were replicated 3 times and the values of c ini and c 24h were used to calculate coefficients for transfer from water to the surface t ws and from the surface to milk t sm according to eqs 3 and 4 3 t w s 10 c i n i 10 c e x p 4 t s m 10 c i n i 10 c 24 h 10 c i n i where c ini is the initial concentration on the coupons in log10 cfu m2 immediately after the cip process c exp is the concentration of water used in the cip regimen 3 log10 cfu ml and c 24h is the concentration on the coupons after 24 h of storage in log10 cfu m2 according to this formulation t ws was defined as the ratio of the initial concentration on the tank surface to the experimental concentration in the cip water and t sm was defined as the ratio of the change of concentration on the tank surface during milk storage to the initial concentration these two coefficients were employed in the model as transfer coefficients predicting tank surface contamination based on the initial concentration in the cip water and predicting the contamination transferred to milk from the surface during storage in the tank the corresponding distributions are provided in table 1 2 3 exposure assessment 2 3 1 reclaimed water used for the cip process a hypothetical natural contamination and water treatment scenario named reclaimed water was tested as the baseline to evaluate the public health impact of the usage of reclaimed water for cleaning food contact surfaces in dairy processing plants wastewater obtained from unpasteurized cheese whey production was considered to be contaminated with l monocytogenes from raw milk the expected difference between contamination levels in raw milk and whey was modeled as a uniform distribution from 0 91 to 2 78 log10 cfu lr mw uniform 0 91 2 78 as reported by ryser and marth 1987 1989 to estimate the distribution of the concentration of l monocytogenes in whey c whey starting from the concentration in raw milk c rawmilk wastewater was then modeled to be treated with either ro or uf which can lead to a reduction in the contamination by 1 5 4 2 log10 cfu lr trt uniform 1 5 4 2 as described by meneses and flores 2016a without any other treatment or additives uf and ro are usually combined to remove pollutants from dairy processing wastewater since uf removes larger molecules fat and proteins and ro removes smaller particles lactose and minerals in the following sections input variables and calculations are described based on the reclaimed water scenario alternative scenarios of the water used for the cip process were also tested to link the quality of cip water with public health impact and establish the microbiological specification of cip water which is addressed in section 2 5 2 2 3 2 initial contamination in raw milk the initial contamination in raw milk was described by the prevalence p rawmilk and concentration c rawmilk originating from raw milk surveys in the literature as described in table 2 van kessel et al 2011 reported 75 listeria positive samples out of 538 samples from raw milk operations accordingly p rawmilk was parametrized to follow a beta distribution in the form of beta s 1 n s 1 where s denotes the number of positive samples and n denotes the total number of samples a beta distribution is widely used in qmra models as an input distribution for prevalence in order to describe the uncertainty around proportion estimates vose 2008 jackson et al 2012 provided concentration data for raw milk in the united states as a minimum of 0 0055 cfu ml maximum of 29 cfu ml and median of 0 0092 cfu ml therefore c rawmilk was parameterized as pert 0 0055 0 0092 29 in the proposed model raw milk is expected to introduce contamination to the final product in three ways as described in the conceptual model in fig 1 first l monocytogenes may survive if improper pasteurization of the product occurs second the contamination introduced from the previous batch of milk may attach to the surface of the tank remain after the cip process and transfer to the current batch finally contamination in raw milk can be introduced to cip water reclaimed from whey if improper storage or treatment of water occurs therefore increased contamination levels in raw milk are expected to increase contamination levels in the final product 2 3 3 raw milk tank cip and storage for raw milk stored in a receiving tank l monocytogenes contamination is possible from raw milk in the current batch organisms attached to the tank surface via cip and raw milk in the previous batch therefore the prevalence and concentration of l monocytogenes in the previous and current batches of milk were simulated by the same distributions but independently by the variables p rawmilk pre p rawmilk c rawmilk pre and c rawmilk assuming that the processing plant receives raw milk from providers who are able to maintain microbial quality within a stable range but that the contamination of l monocytogenes may vary by batch the microbial kinetics of l monocytogenes in raw milk during storage in the receiving tank was not considered as the initial inputs for the model p rawmilk and c rawmilk were taken from studies reporting the prevalence and concentration of l monocytogenes in raw milk in the receiving tanks before pasteurization which reflects the resulting contamination after storage in order to estimate surface contamination on milk storage tanks the surface area was modeled as hypothetical swab areas 50 cm2 each to express the prevalence before cip application p swab bf in accordance with the data source doijad et al 2011 the prevalence of positive swabs p swab aft and the concentration on positive swabs c swab aft were calculated by incorporating er and ef from equations 1 and 2 respectively and the total number of l monocytogenes cells on the tank surface tc swab aft was estimated by multiplying the prevalence concentration and total number of hypothetical swab areas in a tank as summarized in table 2 attachment of l monocytogenes from raw milk to the tank surface was modeled by the transfer coefficient from raw milk to the tank surface t rs normal 3 89 2 24 log10 cfu cm2 which relates the contamination in the previous batch of raw milk c rawmilk pre to the concentration on the swabs before cip c swab bf as described in tables 1 and 2 2 3 4 pasteurization common practice for the milk industry is to achieve a 5 log reduction in contamination by high temperature short time htst pasteurization where milk is held at approximately 72 c for 15 s piyasena et al 1998 reported that estimated average reductions of up to 28 log with a lower bound of the 95 confidence interval of 11 log can be achieved at 72 c for 15 s for l monocytogenes therefore the effect of pasteurization was conservatively described in the model as a uniform distribution with a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of another uniform distribution from a 5 to 11 log reduction 2 3 5 pasteurized milk storage tank cip storage and packaging transfers occurring in the pasteurized milk tank were modeled similarly to the raw milk tank contamination in the pasteurized milk can originate from l monocytogenes cells surviving the pasteurization treatment surface contamination caused by cip with possibly contaminated water and remaining surface contamination from holding a previous batch of pasteurized milk the prevalence of hypothetical swab areas on the pasteurized milk storage tank surface was reported as 0 of 33 samples by doijad et al 2011 therefore in this model prevalence p swab bf2 was defined as a beta 1 34 distribution and concentration c swab bf2 was defined as a uniform 0 3 distribution in log10 cfu m2 in order to reflect a 3 mpn limit of detection prevalence p swab aft2 and concentration c swab aft2 after the cip regimen were calculated using er and ef similarly to the raw milk tank and transfer from the surface to milk was calculated by using t sm modelling post pasteurization cross contamination is out of the scope of this study due to lack of information hence the estimated contamination in pasteurized milk held in storage tank is assumed the same as that in packaged milk 2 3 6 distribution and storage at home growth of l monocytogenes under cold temperature was modeled based on the listeria risk assessment of who and fao 2004 with adjustment as given in table 3 the suggested growth model includes a temperature dependent maximum growth rate μ t based on the growth rate in milk at 5 c μ 5 storage temperature t str and time t str growth was limited by a minimum growth temperature t min with a distribution of uniform 2 1 and maximum growth limits μ lim of 7 log10 cfu for temperatures less than 5 c 7 5 log10 cfu for temperatures between 5 and 7 c and 8 log10 cfu for temperatures higher than 7 c were employed complementary to the who fao model a lag phase t lag was also implemented in the model the duration of the lag phase was defined by a uniform distribution with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 1 day since the minimum duration was observed as 1 day when pasteurized milk was stored at 8 c rosenow and marth 1987 2 3 7 consumption different fluid milk consumption patterns were considered for the three population subgroups addressed in the model as summarized in table 4 average daily amounts of milk consumption data are available from sebastian et al 2010 for different age groups the average daily consumption rate was estimated as 0 82 cups per day for the general population and 0 61 for the elderly pregnant women were not reported in the study by sebastian et al therefore the average daily consumption for this subgroup was assumed to be equal to 0 82 as for the general population however it should be noted that due to increased nutrient intake by pregnant women this figure can be expected to be higher the sizes of the population subgroups were estimated as 269 7 million for the general subgroup 52 7 million for the elderly subgroup and 6 6 million for the pregnant subgroup in the world factbook of cia n d consumption and population characteristics were then used to estimate the population risk and disease burden originating from dose per serving d through the dose response model 2 4 dose response assessment the lognormal poisson dose response model suggested by pouillot et al 2015 was used to calculate the probability of invasive listeriosis per serving of fluid milk as shown in table 4 the probability of developing invasive listeriosis due to the ingestion of one cell of l monocytogenes r dose i was described by a log10normal distribution with different geometric means for the population subgroups where i denotes the corresponding population subgroup 1 general 2 elderly 3 pregnant the probability of listeriosis per serving of fluid milk p ill was calculated using the exponential dose response model in eq 5 5 p i l l d r d o s e i 1 exp r d o s e i d 2 5 risk characterization 2 5 1 risk estimates by population characteristics per serving risks were estimated as p ill while population risks were concluded as the annual number of invasive listeriosis cases and associated disease burden estimated by daly for the overall u s population and each of the three subgroups the annual number of cases was estimated based on the estimated per serving risk per capita fluid milk annual consumption data for each population subgroup reported by sebastian et al 2010 and sizes of subgroups recorded in the world factbook central intelligence agency n d scallan et al 2015 estimated annual daly for l monocytogenes in the united states as 8 800 of which 4400 90 cri 1500 8400 are associated with pregnancy and 4400 90 cri 300 13100 are not the reported point estimates for daly were used to calculate daly per case by dividing the daly values by the annual number of cases for each population subgroup reported by scallan et al 2011 in the cited study health states for invasive listeriosis were defined as including meningitis bacteremia and neurological disorders abortion stillbirth and neonatal death for pregnancy associated cases and meningitis bacteremia and death for non pregnancy associated cases the subgroup specific daly per case values were then used to estimate the disease burden of listeriosis for each subgroup associated with the consumption of fluid milk the daly estimates for these subgroups were also summed to obtain an overall estimate for the whole population the annual daly per person daly p y was then calculated by dividing each estimate by the corresponding population size the calculations and parameters related to risk and disease burden estimates are given in table 4 the eligibility and reasons for limiting daly estimates in the three population subgroups general elderly and pregnant are as follows first estimates based on these three populations will be reasonably representative of the whole population according to pouillot et al 2015 these three populations cover approximately 90 of the whole second daly estimates for other population groups are not possible due to a lack of information in addition to the three subgroups considered in this study estimates of r dose i are available for eight other populations with various health conditions pouillot et al 2015 but corresponding daly per case estimates are not available in the study by scallan et al 2015 therefore risks and disease burdens were only estimated for the general elderly and pregnant population subgroups in this study 2 5 2 alternative scenarios of water used for the cip process to test the validity of the model contamination in the cip water was set to 0 cfu ml transformed as 999 log10 cfu ml while keeping all other input variables unchanged clean water scenario this scenario is expected to describe current practices in the industry assuming potable water is primarily used for cip and thus risk estimates from this scenario are able to capture current product contamination and public health impact for the purpose of model validation the contamination in pasteurized fluid milk at the time of consumption estimated as an intermediate model output and annual number of listeriosis cases related to milk as another model output were both compared with the data on contamination and annual number of cases in reality all scenarios covered in the current model are summarized in table 5 with the corresponding distributions of lr mw and lr trt and calculation of c cipwtr another scenario was simulated to capture the raw wastewater scenario if no water treatment was applied to the wastewater in this scenario the log reduction achieved by water treatment lr trt was set to zero as shown in table 5 contamination of the cip water was modeled as originating from a milk production operation where a certain proportion of contamination in raw milk is transferred to whey with a relation described by transfer of l monocytogenes from raw milk to whey lr mw as shown in table 5 different from the reclaimed water scenario there is no treatment of wastewater from whey all contamination in the wastewater is introduced to the system by cip operations to evaluate the impact of the microbiological quality of the water used for the cip process on public health the bacterial concentration in the cip water c cipwtr was set at 5 4 3 2 1 and 0 log10 cfu ml and the daly was estimated accordingly through this practice the risk based microbiological limits for the contamination of cip water were determined by ensuring that the acceptable risk limit of 10 6 daly per person per year was not exceeded the determination of microbiological limits was achieved by interpolation from the plot of daly estimates in fig 6 for all three population subgroups 2 5 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted to rank the input parameters by their relative effects on the output mean daly p y and annual number of cases sensitivity analysis was conducted by using the built in risk function risksensitivitystatchange which returns the change in output statistic values corresponding to the highest and lowest values for a given input parameter sample divided into 20 equally sized bins outputs of this function were then used to plot a tornado chart using ggplot2 wickham 2016 in r 3 4 r core team 2017 to describe the ranking and absolute effect of the input parameters at their extreme values 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results surface attachment during milk storage was quantified by the concentration and prevalence on coupons initially before filling the bioreactor with milk and immediately after cip with contaminated water 12 of 24 coupons were l monocytogenes positive with concentrations ranging from 5 03 to 5 91 log10 cfu m2 c ini therefore the initial prevalence p ini was described by a beta 13 13 distribution and initial concentration c ini by setting the observed range as an upper limit of a uniform distribution with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of uniform 5 03 5 91 log10 cfu m2 after 24 h of milk storage in the bioreactor 2 of 24 coupons were listeria positive and therefore p 24 was described by a beta 3 23 distribution the concentration on positive coupons after 24 h c 24h varied within a range of 5 03 5 42 log10 cfu m2 then c 24h was incorporated into the model as a uniform distribution with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of uniform 5 03 5 42 log10 cfu m2 transfer of l monocytogenes from surfaces to milk was then calculated by the difference between c 24 and c ini 3 2 risk estimation and model validation 3 2 1 reclaimed water scenario pubic health risk estimates and contamination changes along the chain in the reclaimed water scenario cip water was modeled as originating from whey as a bi product of cheese production after treatment with ro and uf simulated contamination in the reclaimed water was observed as 4 21 2 5th percentile 6 33 97 5th percentile 2 21 log10 cfu ml under these conditions the annual number of cases was estimated as 3 36 95 ci 0 23 to 6 50 for the general 5 67 95 ci 0 35 to 11 00 for the elderly and 0 15 95 ci 0 12 to 0 19 for the pregnant population subgroups with a total of 9 18 cases per year due to consumption of fluid milk pasteurized in facilities applying the suggested reclaimed water treatment system as shown in table 6 under these conditions disease burden estimates for none of the population subgroups exceeded the acceptable risk limit of 10 6 daly p y for the raw milk held in the receiving tank the predominant sources of contamination were naturally occurring l monocytogenes in raw milk and tank surface contamination from the previous batch of milk and possibly contaminated cip water based on our simulation results substantial l monocytogenes contamination at this step primarily originated from the raw milk 7 10 log10 cfu per tank or 1 01 log10 cfu ml on average while the contribution from the tank surface was not substantial 0 23 log10 cfu per tank or 7 87 log10 cfu ml on average the contamination in milk immediately after pasteurization but before holding in the storage tank was then effectively reduced to a mean level of 1 47 log10 cfu per tank 6 64 log10 cfu ml while held in the storage tank the mean contamination in pasteurized milk was simulated as 0 23 log10 cfu per tank 7 87 log10 cfu ml originating from the surface and 1 47 log10 cfu per tank 6 64 log10 cfu ml originating from the pasteurized milk after pasteurization the milk was considered to be equally distributed to 1 us gal 3 79 l bottles therefore the concentration of bacteria was modeled to be uniform among all bottles growth was considered after the milk was proportioned into bottles and stored for distribution and consumption the mean growth was simulated as 1 log10 cfu under the currently common storage time and temperature conditions resulting in a mean concentration of 6 56 log10 cfu ml or 4 32 log10 cfu serving serving size 237 ml after the storage phase 3 2 2 clean water scenario for model validation to validate the proposed model a clean water scenario was simulated and the results were compared with the current distribution of l monocytogenes in milk based on surveys and the incidence of listeriosis due to consumption of pasteurized fluid milk an intermediate output l monocytogenes contamination in fluid milk was first used to validate the proposed model a histogram plot describing the concentration distribution is given in fig 2 the probability of a single serving containing 1 cfu or more was estimated as 0 018 1 8 in a similar exposure assessment by fda and usda 2003 the percentage of pasteurized fluid milk servings containing listeria was estimated to range from 0 1 to 2 2 5th and 95th percentiles with a median of 0 3 in addition to simulated contamination in pasteurized fluid milk the estimated number of annual cases of listeriosis due to consumption of contaminated pasteurized fluid milk was considered in the clean water scenario 3 33 95 ci 0 20 to 6 45 annual cases due to the consumption of pasteurized fluid milk were estimated for the general population 5 56 95 ci 0 24 to 10 88 annual cases for the elderly population subgroup and 0 15 95 ci 0 12 to 0 18 annual cases for the pregnant population subgroup estimates of annual cases under these conditions yielded daly estimates lower than the suggested acceptable risk limits 10 6 daly p y as shown in table 6 scallan et al 2011 estimated the total number of domestically acquired foodborne listeriosis cases as 1591 90 cri 557 to 3161 based on the 2006 u s population however this estimate considers cases caused by all food sources batz et al 2012 reported source estimates for listeria from dairy products as 30 0 based on foodborne outbreaks and 23 6 based on expert elicitation similarly davidson et al 2011 attributed 26 7 28 6 of l monocytogenes cases to dairy products in a canadian expert elicitation survey these values combined with the disease estimates correspond to an annual estimate of dairy related listeriosis of 365 477 cases nevertheless the exact attribution of listeriosis to pasteurized fluid milk is uncertain the total number of reported illnesses due to pasteurized fluid milk between the years 1993 and 2006 was 2098 according to langer et al 2012 corresponding to 161 4 cases per year langer et al also implied that only 3 of cases were associated with l monocytogenes indicating 4 84 reported cases of listeriosis due to consumption of pasteurized fluid milk considering some degree of underreporting and underdiagnosis the results of this study appear consistent with the true number of annual cases the results of the clean water scenario were similar to the results of the reclaimed scenario since the concentration in raw milk received at the plant is independent of surface contamination the contributions of raw milk to overall contamination were the same in the two scenarios however slight differences in surface contamination were estimated when reclaimed water was introduced to the cip system for the receiving tank approximately 2 03 log10 cfu tank 10 14 log10 cfu ml originated from the surface while for the pasteurized milk storage tanks 5 5 log10 cfu tank 13 61 log10 cfu ml originated from the tank surface therefore low levels of contamination in cip water as modeled in the reclaimed water scenario did not result in significant changes in the overall contamination levels and risk estimates these results indicate that when a sterile water source is used for cleaning the predominant cause of contamination originates from the raw milk in both the raw and pasteurized milk storage tanks 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis provides a ranking of the relative importance of the input parameters used in a qmra model by evaluating input distributions at their extremes and observing the change in the target output statistic values were generated under the reclaimed water scenario with a slight change in lr trt which was set to uniform 0 6 in order to capture a wider range of possible log reduction values for different types of interventions the tornado chart presented in fig 3 provides the rankings for 15 of the most important input distributions storage temperature t str and time t str were the top two inputs affecting the disease burden and annual case estimates koutsoumanis et al 2010 also reported the importance of storage temperatures on the growth of l monocytogenes and suggested a 2 c reduction in storage temperature under average domestic refrigeration temperatures to ensure minimum growth the current practice of pasteurized milk storage is carried out under refrigeration temperatures with a suggested shelf life of approximately 7 days fig 4 shows the simulated values of daly p y corresponding to storage times of less than or equal to 7 days and temperatures less than or equal to 5 c in the reclaimed water scenario under these conditions daly p y estimates did not exceed 0 5 daly per million and remained lower than the acceptable risk limit in the importance rankings dose response parameters initial contamination parameters processing conditions and growth model parameters followed storage conditions the efficacy of water treatment in mitigating l monocytogenes contamination lr trt seems to be less important in this case however the initial concentration in the wastewater is the limiting factor for the efficiency of treatment if the concentrations in wastewater were higher the observed effect of lr trt would be more profound the dose response parameters for the specific population subgroups r dose1 r dose2 r dose3 were considered as uncertainty variables due to the lack of knowledge on the real life dose response relationship which can be improved over time with the addition of new knowledge the dose response model in our study was adopted from the study by pouillot et al 2015 and is the latest and most up to date dose response relationship for l monocytogenes for different sub populations this dose response model which is an improvement over previously developed models can be improved in the future by others the microbial growth kinetic parameters t min and μ 5 can also be regarded as uncertainty parameters as numerous important factors such as the physiological state of growing cells the exact composition of each batch of milk and previous temperature history are unknown and are not explained completely by the variation the results of the analysis indicate that to ensure the safety of pasteurized fluid milk storage and processing conditions should be effectively controlled and the initial microbiological quality of raw milk should be improved by taking effective measures against infection at the farm and harvest levels if reclaimed water suspected to be contaminated with l monocytogenes is used in cleaning applications proper treatment will ensure the safety of the final product only the first three parameters shown in fig 3 seem to affect the output to exceed the acceptable risk limit however it should be noted that the other parameters were kept at their original distributions when a specific parameter was evaluated hence if less than ideal conditions are present in several of these steps the cumulative effects could inflate the disease burden estimate 3 4 scenario analysis and acceptable levels of contamination several scenarios were tested in order to determine acceptable levels of contamination in cip water and to test the behavior of the model in hypothetical contamination scenarios in addition to scenarios with l monocytogenes concentrations varying from 5 to 1 log10 cfu ml a raw wastewater scenario where no interventions were applied a reclaimed water scenario where ro and uf were applied to the wastewater and a clean water scenario were evaluated as summarized in table 6 all scenarios tested here are also visualized in fig 5 on a basis of cases per million population and daly per person per year increasing trends were predicted in the number of cases and daly estimates as the contamination in cip water increased figs 4 and 5 in this model the concentration in clean water was set as 999 log10 cfu ml representing a water source without contamination and no difference in risk estimates was observed when the level of contamination in cip water was increased from that in clean water to 4 log10 cfu ml as the contamination increased above 4 log10 cfu ml a more considerable increase in risk began to appear for example the mean concentration in water in the raw wastewater scenario was simulated as 1 36 2 5th percentile 0 08 97 5th percentile 2 94 log10 cfu ml resulting in a daly estimate for the whole population 38 times higher than that in the clean water scenario 9 60 10 8 to 3 78 10 6 daly p y however the use of reclaimed water in cip seems able to maintain the same level of public health protection as the use of clean water the mean concentration in water in the reclaimed water scenario was simulated as 4 21 2 5th percentile 6 33 97 5th percentile 2 21 log10 cfu ml resulting in an increase in the whole population daly of only 2 9 60 10 8 to 9 75 10 8 daly p y of that in clean water scenario in an attempt to determine acceptable levels of l monocytogenes contamination in cip water concentrations varying from 5 to 1 log10 cfu ml were simulated to determine cutoff points where 10 6 daly p y is exceeded as shown in fig 6 based on table 6 for the overall population the acceptable risk limit of 10 6 was exceeded at a level of 0 5 log10 cfu ml the limit was exceeded at 1 and 0 5 log10 cfu ml contamination levels for the elderly and general subgroups respectively however the acceptable risk limit was exceeded at a lower contamination level 1 5 log10 cfu ml among pregnant women a more vulnerable population group to obtain more accurate estimates of contamination cutoffs the intersections between the trending lines and the line of acceptable risk limit were estimated by linear interpolation for the combined overall population the acceptable risk limit was exceeded at a level of contamination in the cip solution of 0 65 log10 cfu ml however this limit was still considered unacceptable for the more vulnerable pregnant and elderly subgroups where the acceptable risk limit was exceeded at 1 82 and 1 52 log10 cfu ml respectively however the higher bound of the 95 confidence interval was observed to exceed the limit at 2 log10 cfu ml for the pregnant women subgroup table 6 therefore the cutoff for the maximum tolerable contamination can be set as 2 log10 cfu ml l monocytogenes in the water used for cip cleaning purposes to ensure that the risk posed to the most vulnerable population is controlled below the acceptable level of risk based on this study wastewater reclaimed from cheese whey production by ro and uf treatment can comply with the proposed microbiological criteria and be used for cip while maintaining a similar level of microbial food safety and public health protection as potable water the results of the scenario analysis indicate that using reclaimed wastewater for tank cleaning purposes in fluid milk processing plants is possible as long as suitable performance targets are set for the level of contamination in cip water under current natural contamination conditions with typical water treatment options acceptable risk limits can be achieved for the suggested system however in fail situations the risks could be beyond the acceptable or tolerable limits therefore it is necessary to develop hazard analysis and critical control points haccp plans for the safety management of reclaimed wastewater qmra allows the identification and evaluation of potential risks in a defined scenario while also offering key information to develop robust haccp systems however while qmra is a methodical tool widely applied in different food sectors it has rarely been introduced in the reuse of reclaimed water together with previous work meneses and flores 2016a the results of this study provide valuable information for designing a haccp plan following the generic model proposed by casani and knøchel 2002 furthermore the integration of qmra in the design of prevention and control strategies for the safe management of reclaimed water may create opportunities for the implementation of water reuse in the food industry thereby contributing to sustainable food system approaches 3 5 limitations of the model data gaps in the current literature led to some assumptions during the modeling and validation processes although these assumptions are not expected to affect the simulated outcomes significantly the risk assessment process can provide suggestions for future researchers by informing about knowledge gaps this study provides an overview of a typical fluid processing chain but different characteristics of individual processing chains such as tank sizes expected prevalence and concentration from raw milk suppliers and processing parameters should be considered carefully before implementing the suggested strategy furthermore this study focused on only a single pathogenic microorganism whereas the natural flora of milk is diverse therefore the risks associated with other microorganisms should also be considered in the experimental section of this study a moderate level of l monocytogenes 3 log10 cfu ml was chosen and the simulated contamination was estimated proportionally to this value however lower levels of contaminations have been estimated and using transfer rates calculated from moderate levels of contamination may exaggerate the overall effect resulting in a more conservative modeling approach 4 conclusions reclaimed wastewater with proper treatment can be used for cip operations in pasteurized milk processing to meet suggested tolerable limits for all population subgroups the results of this study are expected to aid further efforts in water reuse for sustainable processing operations and provide guidance for the development and implementation of haccp of water use in food processing facilities the methods explored in this study can provide an incentive to establish qmra frameworks in risk based decision making and criteria setting for possible applications of wastewater reuse in other fields of the

18229,intense pressure on water resources has led to efforts to reuse reclaimed processing wastewater for cleaning purposes in food processing plants the milk industry produces considerable amounts of wastewater which can be used for cleaning of equipment after appropriate treatment however due to naturally occurring microbiological contamination in raw milk the wastewater is often contaminated and therefore the reuse of reclaimed wastewater is perceived as risky this study aims to quantify the risks of listeria monocytogenes infection and associated disease burden when wastewater reclaimed from milk processing operations is used in cleaning in place cip systems for pasteurized fluid milk production following a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach furthermore this study aims to inform risk based tolerable limits for levels of contamination in cip water based on a public health target of 10 6 daly per person annually the suggested model investigates the passage of l monocytogenes throughout the fluid milk chain from receipt of raw milk at the plant to the point of consumption and covering storage in receiving and storage tanks pasteurization and storage at retail and at home risk and disease burden estimates are simulated for general younger than 65 years elderly 65 years and older and pregnant population subgroups additional scenarios covering the effect of using clean water using water with different levels of contamination and using reclaimed wastewater modeled as recovered from cheese whey after membrane filtration reclaimed water scenario are considered to estimate a risk based limit of contamination and simulate a real life example the tolerable limit of contamination in cip water was estimated as 2 log10 cfu ml to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable subgroup pregnant women while higher limits were estimated for the elderly and general subgroups under the reclaimed water scenario the annual number of listeriosis cases was estimated as 3 36 5 67 and 0 15 for the general elderly and pregnant population subgroups respectively while in the clean water scenario the estimates were 3 33 5 56 and 0 15 respectively in both scenarios the daly estimates were lower than the tolerable limit the results indicate that reclaimed water can be an alternative to potable water for cip applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative microbial risk assessment cleaning in place microbiological limits daly wastewater reuse 1 introduction dairy industry operations require considerable amounts of freshwater and produce high strength wastewater estimates indicate that overall wastewater output is 2 5 times greater than the amount of milk processed and approximately 70 of freshwater used is released as wastewater slavov 2017 sanitation consumes more than half of freshwater used in the dairy industry and the use of reclaimed wastewater for cleaning purposes in processing plants provides an opportunity to relieve this intense pressure on freshwater resources adams 2018 the codex alimentarius 1999 defines reclaimed water as water that was originally a constituent of a food has been removed from the food by a process step and has been subsequently reconditioned when necessary such that it may be reused in a subsequent manufacturing operation the performance economy and safety of cleaning in place cip systems using reclaimed wastewater have been demonstrated for water recovered from cheese whey by ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro meneses and flores 2016a b due to the increasing focus on water conservation the performance of wastewater treatment approaches such as ro or forward osmosis membrane distillation uf nanofiltration and their combinations has been studied extensively primarily with a focus on improving physical chemical indicators aydiner et al 2014 balannec et al 2002 however studies considering the microbiological quality of reclaimed water especially pathogen contamination are limited therefore the microbial risk of reclaimed water is often questioned creating a negative risk perception of its potential hazardous health impact among dairy processors legislators and the public and highlighting the need for risk based microbiological specifications for safe wastewater reuse casani et al 2005 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a systematic approach to estimate public health risks attributable to the exposure to a microbiological pathogen that comprises stages of hazard identification exposure assessment hazard characterization and risk characterization qmra provides science based information to support decision making processes for the development of regulatory standards and guidelines identifying and evaluating different risk management alternatives and prioritizing risk and research needs parkin 2007 qmra has been endorsed internationally as a powerful tool for the determination of risk based microbiological criteria for setting performance objectives for individual food industries to achieve national food safety and public health protection goals andersen et al 2015 usda fsis and epa 2012 van schothorst et al 2009 who and fao 2009 several qmra models investigating public health risks due to the consumption of ready to eat meals and milk have been documented in the literature and qmra frameworks were offered by fda and usda 2003 and by who and fao 2004 however none has been applied to setting standards for safe reuse of reclaimed wastewater in the food processing industry listeria monocytogenes is a constant concern in dairy products due to the high frequency of detection in raw milk and various environmental niches on dairy farms and at processing plants kabuki et al 2004 van kessel et al 2011 although the incidence of invasive listeriosis is relatively low the disease burden is highly significant compared to other foodborne diseases due to high mortality rates and the vulnerability of pregnant women the annual number of listeriosis cases in the united states is estimated as 1591 90 cri 557 3161 and 230 90 cri 80 470 of these cases are associated with pregnancy scallan et al 2011 2015 however the disease burdens for pregnancy associated and non pregnancy associated cases are estimated to be the same i e 4400 90 cri 1500 8400 and 4400 90 cri 300 13100 disability adjusted life years daly corresponding to 3 23 and 19 13 daly per case respectively scallan et al 2015 according to the interagency food safety analytics collaboration 45 3 of listeriosis cases are attributed to dairy product consumption but the exact share attributable to pasteurized fluid milk the most consumed dairy product is uncertain ifsac 2018 comprehensive surveys indicate that the presence of listeria in pasteurized milk is fairly low globally frye and donnelly 2005 thanks to effective control of microbial contamination by pasteurization however low levels of listeria are reported to be persistent in processing equipment and other post processing environments in processing facilities leading to possible contamination after pasteurization oliver et al 2005 among potential contamination sources in dairy processing facilities the use of contaminated water in cleaning systems may introduce the possibility of recontamination and therefore the risks associated with such systems should be evaluated in this study a probabilistic qmra model was developed to address the introduction of l monocytogenes contamination from cip cleaning water during milk processing and to establish critical limits for contamination in cip cleaning water to achieve an appropriate level of public health protection specifically this study aims to 1 predict the impact of reuse of water recovered from cheese whey for cip operations in dairy processing facilities on total disease burden attributable to fluid milk consumption and 2 inform risk based tolerable maximum l monocytogenes levels in reclaimed water for cip that can meet the public health target of 10 6 daly per person per year as offered by who 2017 the model presented in this study provides a qmra framework to investigate possible contamination routes due to water recycling during fluid milk processing and to provide scientific evidence to risk managers and policy makers in terms of safe use of reclaimed water in the food industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview l monocytogenes contamination throughout the fluid milk processing line was modeled using probabilistic inputs for passage of raw milk received at the processing plant and stored in receiving tanks pasteurization storage after pasteurization partitioning storage at distribution and consumers homes and consumption the dose of l monocytogenes per serving at the point of consumption was then used as an input to the dose response model to predict the annual number of listeriosis cases and associated disease burden expressed as daly among the whole population and separate population subgroups in the united states three population subgroups were evaluated in this model considering age and life stage related differences in sensitivity to the consumption of contaminated products the general population younger than 65 years excluding pregnant women the elderly 65 years and older and pregnant women these three groups were selected as representative of the total population because in the dose response model developed by pouillot et al 2015 which considered 11 population subgroups the general population the elderly and the pregnant encompassed approximately 90 of the total population the structure of the conceptual model is presented in fig 1 the initial source of contamination was modeled as originating from raw milk raw milk is stored in receiving tanks where there is a possibility of introducing more contamination from the tank surface to the milk two potential sources of contamination on the inner surface of the receiving tanks are considered in this model the previous batch of raw milk held by the tank and cleaning with possibly contaminated cip water the raw milk is then pasteurized and the pasteurized milk is stored in another storage tank which could also be contaminated by pathogens that survived the heat treatment in the current batch of milk the previous batch of milk held in the tank and contaminated cip water used for the cleaning process the pasteurized milk is then partitioned into standard milk bottles 1 us gal 3 79 l and distributed within a cold chain the bottled milk is portioned into servings at the time of consumption serving size 1 us cup 237 ml the probability of invasive listeriosis per serving consumed is then calculated by a dose response model inputs to the model were sourced from laboratory experiments to describe the transfer of bacteria from reclaimed water to the tank surfaces and then to the batch of milk to be processed sections 2 2 1 2 2 2 table 1 other inputs describing initial levels of contamination and changes in contamination measured as prevalence and concentration during processing were sourced from the relevant literature table 2 throughout the model the prevalence of contaminated units was expressed as the ratio of the number of contaminated units to the number of all units and the concentration of contaminated units was expressed as log10 cfu ml a one dimensional monte carlo simulation with latin hypercube sampling was conducted with 500 000 iterations using risk version 7 6 palisade corporation new york usa to run different scenarios the random seed was set to 1 to ensure that the resulting changes were due to changing levels of inputs in a specific scenario rather than randomness 2 2 determination of key input parameters by experimental procedures 2 2 1 cleaning efficiency the parameters for the cleaning efficiency of the simulated system were derived from a previous study investigating the attachment of pseudomonas aeruginosa to stainless steel coupons representing the surface of a typical milk storage tank assuming similar attachment properties as l monocytogenes meneses and flores 2016a although significant variation in the surface attachment characteristics of various l monocytogenes strains has been observed harvey et al 2007 p aeruginosa was reported to have a similar range of biofilm formation as l monocytogenes in a microtiter plate assay overhage et al 2007 the efficiency ratio er was defined as the proportional change in the probability of contamination of coupons with l monocytogenes before and after cip application representing the change in prevalence of contaminated areas of the tank inner surface the efficiency factor ef was defined as the change in the number of cells on contaminated coupons due to cip cleaning as the log10 cfu difference representing the change in concentration on contaminated areas er and ef were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 1 e r p a f t 1 p b f p b f 1 p a f t 2 e f c a f t c b f where p bf and p aft are the probabilities of a coupon being contaminated before and after cip respectively and c bf and c aft are the concentrations on contaminated coupons before and after cip respectively the corresponding distributions of p bf p aft c bf and c aft are given in table 1 before and after prevalence and concentration parameters were modeled as correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0 5 to ensure that higher contamination greater values of prevalence and concentration before cip would be more likely to result in higher contamination after the process the choice of the correlation factor was made based on a positive correlation assumption however due to the lack of information on the strength of the correlation the factor was set to 0 5 to account for the uncertainty 2 2 2 transfer rates of l monocytogenes from reclaimed water to tank surfaces and subsequently to milk transfer rates were determined by challenge experiments conducted in a laboratory scale biofilm reactor biosurface technologies corp bozeman mt containing 16 sterile stainless steel coupons the reactor was operated under standardized conditions as reported by astm international 2012 the biofilm reactor was used to mimic the dynamics in a milk tank such as attachment of l monocytogenes cells to the stainless steel surface and detachment of surface contamination into milk during storage briefly pasteurized milk confirmed to be free of listeria spp was stored in the biofilm reactor for 24 h at 7 c absence of listeria spp was confirmed by a rapidchek listeria lateral flow kit romer labs getzersdorf at after storage a cip regimen consisting of an initial 5 min water rinse at 25 c a 10 min wash with caustic cleaner 30 g l 65 1 c spartan a 5 min water rinse at 25 c a 10 min wash with an acidic solution 6 g l 65 1 c spartan and a final 5 min water rinse at 25 c was applied although cip parameters may vary slightly depending on the process characteristics the above regimen is similar to the standard cip regimen in the dairy industry which consists of rinsing with water cleaning with alkaline solution rinsing with warm water cleaning with an acidic reagent and final rinsing with warm water thomas and sathian 2014 the water used in the cip regimen originated from contaminated reclaimed water containing 3 log10 cfu ml of l monocytogenes cells this level of contamination was selected because it allows for the detection of surviving bacteria without creating an unrealistic scenario e g 6 log10 cfu ml after cip two sets of eight coupons were aseptically removed from the holders in the reactor one of the sets was tested immediately after cip to measure the initial concentration on coupons c ini transferred from the contaminated cip water and the second set was placed in 9 ml of pasteurized milk and tested after 24 h of storage in milk at 7 c to measure the concentration on the coupons after release of the contamination from the surface to milk after a 24 h storage c 24h the bacteria remaining on the coupons were recovered by immersion in 9 ml of water in dilution tubes to eliminate any planktonic bacteria the coupons were then immediately transferred to new dilution tubes containing 9 ml of water and sonicated at room temperature for 4 min using an ultrasonic cleaner brason 1210 marshall scientific to remove the cells from the surface samples containing cells recovered from the coupons were tested by the three tube most probable number mpn method with a detection limit of 3 mpn ml the samples were serially diluted in peptone water 100 101 102 and 1 ml from each dilution was transferred to each of three test tubes containing university of vermont modified uvm listeria enrichment broth neogen lansing mi and incubated at 30 c for 24 h after incubation 0 1 ml from each uvm tube was transferred to each of three tubes containing fraser broth neogen lansing mi and incubated at 35 c for 48 h the presence of l monocytogenes in positive tubes identified by blackening of the medium was confirmed by streaking one loopful of enrichment culture onto selective modified oxford mox plates neogen lansing mi the plates were incubated at 35 c for 48 h the number of confirmed positive tubes was recorded and the mpn values were determined using the statistical tables suggested by fda 2015 the procedures in the biofilm reactor were replicated 3 times and the values of c ini and c 24h were used to calculate coefficients for transfer from water to the surface t ws and from the surface to milk t sm according to eqs 3 and 4 3 t w s 10 c i n i 10 c e x p 4 t s m 10 c i n i 10 c 24 h 10 c i n i where c ini is the initial concentration on the coupons in log10 cfu m2 immediately after the cip process c exp is the concentration of water used in the cip regimen 3 log10 cfu ml and c 24h is the concentration on the coupons after 24 h of storage in log10 cfu m2 according to this formulation t ws was defined as the ratio of the initial concentration on the tank surface to the experimental concentration in the cip water and t sm was defined as the ratio of the change of concentration on the tank surface during milk storage to the initial concentration these two coefficients were employed in the model as transfer coefficients predicting tank surface contamination based on the initial concentration in the cip water and predicting the contamination transferred to milk from the surface during storage in the tank the corresponding distributions are provided in table 1 2 3 exposure assessment 2 3 1 reclaimed water used for the cip process a hypothetical natural contamination and water treatment scenario named reclaimed water was tested as the baseline to evaluate the public health impact of the usage of reclaimed water for cleaning food contact surfaces in dairy processing plants wastewater obtained from unpasteurized cheese whey production was considered to be contaminated with l monocytogenes from raw milk the expected difference between contamination levels in raw milk and whey was modeled as a uniform distribution from 0 91 to 2 78 log10 cfu lr mw uniform 0 91 2 78 as reported by ryser and marth 1987 1989 to estimate the distribution of the concentration of l monocytogenes in whey c whey starting from the concentration in raw milk c rawmilk wastewater was then modeled to be treated with either ro or uf which can lead to a reduction in the contamination by 1 5 4 2 log10 cfu lr trt uniform 1 5 4 2 as described by meneses and flores 2016a without any other treatment or additives uf and ro are usually combined to remove pollutants from dairy processing wastewater since uf removes larger molecules fat and proteins and ro removes smaller particles lactose and minerals in the following sections input variables and calculations are described based on the reclaimed water scenario alternative scenarios of the water used for the cip process were also tested to link the quality of cip water with public health impact and establish the microbiological specification of cip water which is addressed in section 2 5 2 2 3 2 initial contamination in raw milk the initial contamination in raw milk was described by the prevalence p rawmilk and concentration c rawmilk originating from raw milk surveys in the literature as described in table 2 van kessel et al 2011 reported 75 listeria positive samples out of 538 samples from raw milk operations accordingly p rawmilk was parametrized to follow a beta distribution in the form of beta s 1 n s 1 where s denotes the number of positive samples and n denotes the total number of samples a beta distribution is widely used in qmra models as an input distribution for prevalence in order to describe the uncertainty around proportion estimates vose 2008 jackson et al 2012 provided concentration data for raw milk in the united states as a minimum of 0 0055 cfu ml maximum of 29 cfu ml and median of 0 0092 cfu ml therefore c rawmilk was parameterized as pert 0 0055 0 0092 29 in the proposed model raw milk is expected to introduce contamination to the final product in three ways as described in the conceptual model in fig 1 first l monocytogenes may survive if improper pasteurization of the product occurs second the contamination introduced from the previous batch of milk may attach to the surface of the tank remain after the cip process and transfer to the current batch finally contamination in raw milk can be introduced to cip water reclaimed from whey if improper storage or treatment of water occurs therefore increased contamination levels in raw milk are expected to increase contamination levels in the final product 2 3 3 raw milk tank cip and storage for raw milk stored in a receiving tank l monocytogenes contamination is possible from raw milk in the current batch organisms attached to the tank surface via cip and raw milk in the previous batch therefore the prevalence and concentration of l monocytogenes in the previous and current batches of milk were simulated by the same distributions but independently by the variables p rawmilk pre p rawmilk c rawmilk pre and c rawmilk assuming that the processing plant receives raw milk from providers who are able to maintain microbial quality within a stable range but that the contamination of l monocytogenes may vary by batch the microbial kinetics of l monocytogenes in raw milk during storage in the receiving tank was not considered as the initial inputs for the model p rawmilk and c rawmilk were taken from studies reporting the prevalence and concentration of l monocytogenes in raw milk in the receiving tanks before pasteurization which reflects the resulting contamination after storage in order to estimate surface contamination on milk storage tanks the surface area was modeled as hypothetical swab areas 50 cm2 each to express the prevalence before cip application p swab bf in accordance with the data source doijad et al 2011 the prevalence of positive swabs p swab aft and the concentration on positive swabs c swab aft were calculated by incorporating er and ef from equations 1 and 2 respectively and the total number of l monocytogenes cells on the tank surface tc swab aft was estimated by multiplying the prevalence concentration and total number of hypothetical swab areas in a tank as summarized in table 2 attachment of l monocytogenes from raw milk to the tank surface was modeled by the transfer coefficient from raw milk to the tank surface t rs normal 3 89 2 24 log10 cfu cm2 which relates the contamination in the previous batch of raw milk c rawmilk pre to the concentration on the swabs before cip c swab bf as described in tables 1 and 2 2 3 4 pasteurization common practice for the milk industry is to achieve a 5 log reduction in contamination by high temperature short time htst pasteurization where milk is held at approximately 72 c for 15 s piyasena et al 1998 reported that estimated average reductions of up to 28 log with a lower bound of the 95 confidence interval of 11 log can be achieved at 72 c for 15 s for l monocytogenes therefore the effect of pasteurization was conservatively described in the model as a uniform distribution with a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of another uniform distribution from a 5 to 11 log reduction 2 3 5 pasteurized milk storage tank cip storage and packaging transfers occurring in the pasteurized milk tank were modeled similarly to the raw milk tank contamination in the pasteurized milk can originate from l monocytogenes cells surviving the pasteurization treatment surface contamination caused by cip with possibly contaminated water and remaining surface contamination from holding a previous batch of pasteurized milk the prevalence of hypothetical swab areas on the pasteurized milk storage tank surface was reported as 0 of 33 samples by doijad et al 2011 therefore in this model prevalence p swab bf2 was defined as a beta 1 34 distribution and concentration c swab bf2 was defined as a uniform 0 3 distribution in log10 cfu m2 in order to reflect a 3 mpn limit of detection prevalence p swab aft2 and concentration c swab aft2 after the cip regimen were calculated using er and ef similarly to the raw milk tank and transfer from the surface to milk was calculated by using t sm modelling post pasteurization cross contamination is out of the scope of this study due to lack of information hence the estimated contamination in pasteurized milk held in storage tank is assumed the same as that in packaged milk 2 3 6 distribution and storage at home growth of l monocytogenes under cold temperature was modeled based on the listeria risk assessment of who and fao 2004 with adjustment as given in table 3 the suggested growth model includes a temperature dependent maximum growth rate μ t based on the growth rate in milk at 5 c μ 5 storage temperature t str and time t str growth was limited by a minimum growth temperature t min with a distribution of uniform 2 1 and maximum growth limits μ lim of 7 log10 cfu for temperatures less than 5 c 7 5 log10 cfu for temperatures between 5 and 7 c and 8 log10 cfu for temperatures higher than 7 c were employed complementary to the who fao model a lag phase t lag was also implemented in the model the duration of the lag phase was defined by a uniform distribution with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 1 day since the minimum duration was observed as 1 day when pasteurized milk was stored at 8 c rosenow and marth 1987 2 3 7 consumption different fluid milk consumption patterns were considered for the three population subgroups addressed in the model as summarized in table 4 average daily amounts of milk consumption data are available from sebastian et al 2010 for different age groups the average daily consumption rate was estimated as 0 82 cups per day for the general population and 0 61 for the elderly pregnant women were not reported in the study by sebastian et al therefore the average daily consumption for this subgroup was assumed to be equal to 0 82 as for the general population however it should be noted that due to increased nutrient intake by pregnant women this figure can be expected to be higher the sizes of the population subgroups were estimated as 269 7 million for the general subgroup 52 7 million for the elderly subgroup and 6 6 million for the pregnant subgroup in the world factbook of cia n d consumption and population characteristics were then used to estimate the population risk and disease burden originating from dose per serving d through the dose response model 2 4 dose response assessment the lognormal poisson dose response model suggested by pouillot et al 2015 was used to calculate the probability of invasive listeriosis per serving of fluid milk as shown in table 4 the probability of developing invasive listeriosis due to the ingestion of one cell of l monocytogenes r dose i was described by a log10normal distribution with different geometric means for the population subgroups where i denotes the corresponding population subgroup 1 general 2 elderly 3 pregnant the probability of listeriosis per serving of fluid milk p ill was calculated using the exponential dose response model in eq 5 5 p i l l d r d o s e i 1 exp r d o s e i d 2 5 risk characterization 2 5 1 risk estimates by population characteristics per serving risks were estimated as p ill while population risks were concluded as the annual number of invasive listeriosis cases and associated disease burden estimated by daly for the overall u s population and each of the three subgroups the annual number of cases was estimated based on the estimated per serving risk per capita fluid milk annual consumption data for each population subgroup reported by sebastian et al 2010 and sizes of subgroups recorded in the world factbook central intelligence agency n d scallan et al 2015 estimated annual daly for l monocytogenes in the united states as 8 800 of which 4400 90 cri 1500 8400 are associated with pregnancy and 4400 90 cri 300 13100 are not the reported point estimates for daly were used to calculate daly per case by dividing the daly values by the annual number of cases for each population subgroup reported by scallan et al 2011 in the cited study health states for invasive listeriosis were defined as including meningitis bacteremia and neurological disorders abortion stillbirth and neonatal death for pregnancy associated cases and meningitis bacteremia and death for non pregnancy associated cases the subgroup specific daly per case values were then used to estimate the disease burden of listeriosis for each subgroup associated with the consumption of fluid milk the daly estimates for these subgroups were also summed to obtain an overall estimate for the whole population the annual daly per person daly p y was then calculated by dividing each estimate by the corresponding population size the calculations and parameters related to risk and disease burden estimates are given in table 4 the eligibility and reasons for limiting daly estimates in the three population subgroups general elderly and pregnant are as follows first estimates based on these three populations will be reasonably representative of the whole population according to pouillot et al 2015 these three populations cover approximately 90 of the whole second daly estimates for other population groups are not possible due to a lack of information in addition to the three subgroups considered in this study estimates of r dose i are available for eight other populations with various health conditions pouillot et al 2015 but corresponding daly per case estimates are not available in the study by scallan et al 2015 therefore risks and disease burdens were only estimated for the general elderly and pregnant population subgroups in this study 2 5 2 alternative scenarios of water used for the cip process to test the validity of the model contamination in the cip water was set to 0 cfu ml transformed as 999 log10 cfu ml while keeping all other input variables unchanged clean water scenario this scenario is expected to describe current practices in the industry assuming potable water is primarily used for cip and thus risk estimates from this scenario are able to capture current product contamination and public health impact for the purpose of model validation the contamination in pasteurized fluid milk at the time of consumption estimated as an intermediate model output and annual number of listeriosis cases related to milk as another model output were both compared with the data on contamination and annual number of cases in reality all scenarios covered in the current model are summarized in table 5 with the corresponding distributions of lr mw and lr trt and calculation of c cipwtr another scenario was simulated to capture the raw wastewater scenario if no water treatment was applied to the wastewater in this scenario the log reduction achieved by water treatment lr trt was set to zero as shown in table 5 contamination of the cip water was modeled as originating from a milk production operation where a certain proportion of contamination in raw milk is transferred to whey with a relation described by transfer of l monocytogenes from raw milk to whey lr mw as shown in table 5 different from the reclaimed water scenario there is no treatment of wastewater from whey all contamination in the wastewater is introduced to the system by cip operations to evaluate the impact of the microbiological quality of the water used for the cip process on public health the bacterial concentration in the cip water c cipwtr was set at 5 4 3 2 1 and 0 log10 cfu ml and the daly was estimated accordingly through this practice the risk based microbiological limits for the contamination of cip water were determined by ensuring that the acceptable risk limit of 10 6 daly per person per year was not exceeded the determination of microbiological limits was achieved by interpolation from the plot of daly estimates in fig 6 for all three population subgroups 2 5 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted to rank the input parameters by their relative effects on the output mean daly p y and annual number of cases sensitivity analysis was conducted by using the built in risk function risksensitivitystatchange which returns the change in output statistic values corresponding to the highest and lowest values for a given input parameter sample divided into 20 equally sized bins outputs of this function were then used to plot a tornado chart using ggplot2 wickham 2016 in r 3 4 r core team 2017 to describe the ranking and absolute effect of the input parameters at their extreme values 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results surface attachment during milk storage was quantified by the concentration and prevalence on coupons initially before filling the bioreactor with milk and immediately after cip with contaminated water 12 of 24 coupons were l monocytogenes positive with concentrations ranging from 5 03 to 5 91 log10 cfu m2 c ini therefore the initial prevalence p ini was described by a beta 13 13 distribution and initial concentration c ini by setting the observed range as an upper limit of a uniform distribution with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of uniform 5 03 5 91 log10 cfu m2 after 24 h of milk storage in the bioreactor 2 of 24 coupons were listeria positive and therefore p 24 was described by a beta 3 23 distribution the concentration on positive coupons after 24 h c 24h varied within a range of 5 03 5 42 log10 cfu m2 then c 24h was incorporated into the model as a uniform distribution with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of uniform 5 03 5 42 log10 cfu m2 transfer of l monocytogenes from surfaces to milk was then calculated by the difference between c 24 and c ini 3 2 risk estimation and model validation 3 2 1 reclaimed water scenario pubic health risk estimates and contamination changes along the chain in the reclaimed water scenario cip water was modeled as originating from whey as a bi product of cheese production after treatment with ro and uf simulated contamination in the reclaimed water was observed as 4 21 2 5th percentile 6 33 97 5th percentile 2 21 log10 cfu ml under these conditions the annual number of cases was estimated as 3 36 95 ci 0 23 to 6 50 for the general 5 67 95 ci 0 35 to 11 00 for the elderly and 0 15 95 ci 0 12 to 0 19 for the pregnant population subgroups with a total of 9 18 cases per year due to consumption of fluid milk pasteurized in facilities applying the suggested reclaimed water treatment system as shown in table 6 under these conditions disease burden estimates for none of the population subgroups exceeded the acceptable risk limit of 10 6 daly p y for the raw milk held in the receiving tank the predominant sources of contamination were naturally occurring l monocytogenes in raw milk and tank surface contamination from the previous batch of milk and possibly contaminated cip water based on our simulation results substantial l monocytogenes contamination at this step primarily originated from the raw milk 7 10 log10 cfu per tank or 1 01 log10 cfu ml on average while the contribution from the tank surface was not substantial 0 23 log10 cfu per tank or 7 87 log10 cfu ml on average the contamination in milk immediately after pasteurization but before holding in the storage tank was then effectively reduced to a mean level of 1 47 log10 cfu per tank 6 64 log10 cfu ml while held in the storage tank the mean contamination in pasteurized milk was simulated as 0 23 log10 cfu per tank 7 87 log10 cfu ml originating from the surface and 1 47 log10 cfu per tank 6 64 log10 cfu ml originating from the pasteurized milk after pasteurization the milk was considered to be equally distributed to 1 us gal 3 79 l bottles therefore the concentration of bacteria was modeled to be uniform among all bottles growth was considered after the milk was proportioned into bottles and stored for distribution and consumption the mean growth was simulated as 1 log10 cfu under the currently common storage time and temperature conditions resulting in a mean concentration of 6 56 log10 cfu ml or 4 32 log10 cfu serving serving size 237 ml after the storage phase 3 2 2 clean water scenario for model validation to validate the proposed model a clean water scenario was simulated and the results were compared with the current distribution of l monocytogenes in milk based on surveys and the incidence of listeriosis due to consumption of pasteurized fluid milk an intermediate output l monocytogenes contamination in fluid milk was first used to validate the proposed model a histogram plot describing the concentration distribution is given in fig 2 the probability of a single serving containing 1 cfu or more was estimated as 0 018 1 8 in a similar exposure assessment by fda and usda 2003 the percentage of pasteurized fluid milk servings containing listeria was estimated to range from 0 1 to 2 2 5th and 95th percentiles with a median of 0 3 in addition to simulated contamination in pasteurized fluid milk the estimated number of annual cases of listeriosis due to consumption of contaminated pasteurized fluid milk was considered in the clean water scenario 3 33 95 ci 0 20 to 6 45 annual cases due to the consumption of pasteurized fluid milk were estimated for the general population 5 56 95 ci 0 24 to 10 88 annual cases for the elderly population subgroup and 0 15 95 ci 0 12 to 0 18 annual cases for the pregnant population subgroup estimates of annual cases under these conditions yielded daly estimates lower than the suggested acceptable risk limits 10 6 daly p y as shown in table 6 scallan et al 2011 estimated the total number of domestically acquired foodborne listeriosis cases as 1591 90 cri 557 to 3161 based on the 2006 u s population however this estimate considers cases caused by all food sources batz et al 2012 reported source estimates for listeria from dairy products as 30 0 based on foodborne outbreaks and 23 6 based on expert elicitation similarly davidson et al 2011 attributed 26 7 28 6 of l monocytogenes cases to dairy products in a canadian expert elicitation survey these values combined with the disease estimates correspond to an annual estimate of dairy related listeriosis of 365 477 cases nevertheless the exact attribution of listeriosis to pasteurized fluid milk is uncertain the total number of reported illnesses due to pasteurized fluid milk between the years 1993 and 2006 was 2098 according to langer et al 2012 corresponding to 161 4 cases per year langer et al also implied that only 3 of cases were associated with l monocytogenes indicating 4 84 reported cases of listeriosis due to consumption of pasteurized fluid milk considering some degree of underreporting and underdiagnosis the results of this study appear consistent with the true number of annual cases the results of the clean water scenario were similar to the results of the reclaimed scenario since the concentration in raw milk received at the plant is independent of surface contamination the contributions of raw milk to overall contamination were the same in the two scenarios however slight differences in surface contamination were estimated when reclaimed water was introduced to the cip system for the receiving tank approximately 2 03 log10 cfu tank 10 14 log10 cfu ml originated from the surface while for the pasteurized milk storage tanks 5 5 log10 cfu tank 13 61 log10 cfu ml originated from the tank surface therefore low levels of contamination in cip water as modeled in the reclaimed water scenario did not result in significant changes in the overall contamination levels and risk estimates these results indicate that when a sterile water source is used for cleaning the predominant cause of contamination originates from the raw milk in both the raw and pasteurized milk storage tanks 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis provides a ranking of the relative importance of the input parameters used in a qmra model by evaluating input distributions at their extremes and observing the change in the target output statistic values were generated under the reclaimed water scenario with a slight change in lr trt which was set to uniform 0 6 in order to capture a wider range of possible log reduction values for different types of interventions the tornado chart presented in fig 3 provides the rankings for 15 of the most important input distributions storage temperature t str and time t str were the top two inputs affecting the disease burden and annual case estimates koutsoumanis et al 2010 also reported the importance of storage temperatures on the growth of l monocytogenes and suggested a 2 c reduction in storage temperature under average domestic refrigeration temperatures to ensure minimum growth the current practice of pasteurized milk storage is carried out under refrigeration temperatures with a suggested shelf life of approximately 7 days fig 4 shows the simulated values of daly p y corresponding to storage times of less than or equal to 7 days and temperatures less than or equal to 5 c in the reclaimed water scenario under these conditions daly p y estimates did not exceed 0 5 daly per million and remained lower than the acceptable risk limit in the importance rankings dose response parameters initial contamination parameters processing conditions and growth model parameters followed storage conditions the efficacy of water treatment in mitigating l monocytogenes contamination lr trt seems to be less important in this case however the initial concentration in the wastewater is the limiting factor for the efficiency of treatment if the concentrations in wastewater were higher the observed effect of lr trt would be more profound the dose response parameters for the specific population subgroups r dose1 r dose2 r dose3 were considered as uncertainty variables due to the lack of knowledge on the real life dose response relationship which can be improved over time with the addition of new knowledge the dose response model in our study was adopted from the study by pouillot et al 2015 and is the latest and most up to date dose response relationship for l monocytogenes for different sub populations this dose response model which is an improvement over previously developed models can be improved in the future by others the microbial growth kinetic parameters t min and μ 5 can also be regarded as uncertainty parameters as numerous important factors such as the physiological state of growing cells the exact composition of each batch of milk and previous temperature history are unknown and are not explained completely by the variation the results of the analysis indicate that to ensure the safety of pasteurized fluid milk storage and processing conditions should be effectively controlled and the initial microbiological quality of raw milk should be improved by taking effective measures against infection at the farm and harvest levels if reclaimed water suspected to be contaminated with l monocytogenes is used in cleaning applications proper treatment will ensure the safety of the final product only the first three parameters shown in fig 3 seem to affect the output to exceed the acceptable risk limit however it should be noted that the other parameters were kept at their original distributions when a specific parameter was evaluated hence if less than ideal conditions are present in several of these steps the cumulative effects could inflate the disease burden estimate 3 4 scenario analysis and acceptable levels of contamination several scenarios were tested in order to determine acceptable levels of contamination in cip water and to test the behavior of the model in hypothetical contamination scenarios in addition to scenarios with l monocytogenes concentrations varying from 5 to 1 log10 cfu ml a raw wastewater scenario where no interventions were applied a reclaimed water scenario where ro and uf were applied to the wastewater and a clean water scenario were evaluated as summarized in table 6 all scenarios tested here are also visualized in fig 5 on a basis of cases per million population and daly per person per year increasing trends were predicted in the number of cases and daly estimates as the contamination in cip water increased figs 4 and 5 in this model the concentration in clean water was set as 999 log10 cfu ml representing a water source without contamination and no difference in risk estimates was observed when the level of contamination in cip water was increased from that in clean water to 4 log10 cfu ml as the contamination increased above 4 log10 cfu ml a more considerable increase in risk began to appear for example the mean concentration in water in the raw wastewater scenario was simulated as 1 36 2 5th percentile 0 08 97 5th percentile 2 94 log10 cfu ml resulting in a daly estimate for the whole population 38 times higher than that in the clean water scenario 9 60 10 8 to 3 78 10 6 daly p y however the use of reclaimed water in cip seems able to maintain the same level of public health protection as the use of clean water the mean concentration in water in the reclaimed water scenario was simulated as 4 21 2 5th percentile 6 33 97 5th percentile 2 21 log10 cfu ml resulting in an increase in the whole population daly of only 2 9 60 10 8 to 9 75 10 8 daly p y of that in clean water scenario in an attempt to determine acceptable levels of l monocytogenes contamination in cip water concentrations varying from 5 to 1 log10 cfu ml were simulated to determine cutoff points where 10 6 daly p y is exceeded as shown in fig 6 based on table 6 for the overall population the acceptable risk limit of 10 6 was exceeded at a level of 0 5 log10 cfu ml the limit was exceeded at 1 and 0 5 log10 cfu ml contamination levels for the elderly and general subgroups respectively however the acceptable risk limit was exceeded at a lower contamination level 1 5 log10 cfu ml among pregnant women a more vulnerable population group to obtain more accurate estimates of contamination cutoffs the intersections between the trending lines and the line of acceptable risk limit were estimated by linear interpolation for the combined overall population the acceptable risk limit was exceeded at a level of contamination in the cip solution of 0 65 log10 cfu ml however this limit was still considered unacceptable for the more vulnerable pregnant and elderly subgroups where the acceptable risk limit was exceeded at 1 82 and 1 52 log10 cfu ml respectively however the higher bound of the 95 confidence interval was observed to exceed the limit at 2 log10 cfu ml for the pregnant women subgroup table 6 therefore the cutoff for the maximum tolerable contamination can be set as 2 log10 cfu ml l monocytogenes in the water used for cip cleaning purposes to ensure that the risk posed to the most vulnerable population is controlled below the acceptable level of risk based on this study wastewater reclaimed from cheese whey production by ro and uf treatment can comply with the proposed microbiological criteria and be used for cip while maintaining a similar level of microbial food safety and public health protection as potable water the results of the scenario analysis indicate that using reclaimed wastewater for tank cleaning purposes in fluid milk processing plants is possible as long as suitable performance targets are set for the level of contamination in cip water under current natural contamination conditions with typical water treatment options acceptable risk limits can be achieved for the suggested system however in fail situations the risks could be beyond the acceptable or tolerable limits therefore it is necessary to develop hazard analysis and critical control points haccp plans for the safety management of reclaimed wastewater qmra allows the identification and evaluation of potential risks in a defined scenario while also offering key information to develop robust haccp systems however while qmra is a methodical tool widely applied in different food sectors it has rarely been introduced in the reuse of reclaimed water together with previous work meneses and flores 2016a the results of this study provide valuable information for designing a haccp plan following the generic model proposed by casani and knøchel 2002 furthermore the integration of qmra in the design of prevention and control strategies for the safe management of reclaimed water may create opportunities for the implementation of water reuse in the food industry thereby contributing to sustainable food system approaches 3 5 limitations of the model data gaps in the current literature led to some assumptions during the modeling and validation processes although these assumptions are not expected to affect the simulated outcomes significantly the risk assessment process can provide suggestions for future researchers by informing about knowledge gaps this study provides an overview of a typical fluid processing chain but different characteristics of individual processing chains such as tank sizes expected prevalence and concentration from raw milk suppliers and processing parameters should be considered carefully before implementing the suggested strategy furthermore this study focused on only a single pathogenic microorganism whereas the natural flora of milk is diverse therefore the risks associated with other microorganisms should also be considered in the experimental section of this study a moderate level of l monocytogenes 3 log10 cfu ml was chosen and the simulated contamination was estimated proportionally to this value however lower levels of contaminations have been estimated and using transfer rates calculated from moderate levels of contamination may exaggerate the overall effect resulting in a more conservative modeling approach 4 conclusions reclaimed wastewater with proper treatment can be used for cip operations in pasteurized milk processing to meet suggested tolerable limits for all population subgroups the results of this study are expected to aid further efforts in water reuse for sustainable processing operations and provide guidance for the development and implementation of haccp of water use in food processing facilities the methods explored in this study can provide an incentive to establish qmra frameworks in risk based decision making and criteria setting for possible applications of wastewater reuse in other fields of the
