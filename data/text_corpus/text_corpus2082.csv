10410,this paper presents a scheme for applying two stage explicit stochastic optimization to seasonal irrigation scheduling it is assumed that an ensemble of n s weather forecasts scenarios is available at each decision point during the season up to n s n s multi objective optimization problems are solved by assuming a specific scenario for the immediate decision period and all possible n s scenarios for the subsequent periods the irrigation schedule selected for implementation during the immediate decision period is the one that produces the highest worst case yield which mimics the traditional risk adverse farmers strategy the procedure is illustrated for a maize crop at davis ca modeled with dssat the optimization was performed for ten years using as forecasts the weather recorded on the previous 15 years the proposed approach yielded consistently results that were very close to truly optimal i e results that could have been obtained if perfect weather forecasts were available at the beginning of the season these results were better than those obtained with a deterministic approach that relied on the same data and decision rules but used only a single forecast that consisted of the average weather of the 15 previous years however these improved results came at the expense of a significant increase of the computation burden in addition to the overall improved performance in terms of yield a main advantage of the stochastic approach is that since the solution for implementation is selected from an ensemble of solutions it is possible to develop a selection strategy that mimics farmers traditional selection strategy this could prove a key factor toward the adoption of decision support tools that involve model based optimization keywords deficit irrigation dssat maize simulation optimization modeling 1 introduction irrigation is a critical input for a wide variety of crops and irrigation scheduling is one of the many management decisions that farmers have to make while facing significant uncertainties about several factors such as prices and most importantly weather farmers tend to be conservative in the sense that they implement strategies that reduce the risk of losses in poor years at the expense of overall reduced productivity jones et al 2000 it is generally accepted that improved weather forecasts both at the short term and long term seasonal levels are keys to improving irrigation management this claim was recently supported by the work of an vo et al 2019 who quantified the benefit that could be expected from using forecasts of different quality levels for managing sugarcane irrigation optimal or sub optimal irrigation schedules can be determined by the so called simulation optimization approach singh 2014 in which weather forecasts are combined with a mathematical model that describes the crop response to water availability and other environmental variables such as temperature sun radiation fertilizer availability etc most of the early works relied on custom models which were developed as part of the optimization study itself e g ahmed et al 1976 sunantara and ramírez 1997 ganji et al 2006 alizadeh and mousavi 2013 vico and porporato 2013 these models included only very crude representations of crop development and response to stress furthermore the validity of these models was not always established using experimental data in recent years irrigation optimization is increasingly conducted using much more complex soil crop atmosphere models that have been developed in unrelated studies and have been thoroughly tested and validated e g aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 rzwqm2 ma et al 2006 ceres dejonge et al 2012 both embedded in dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 stics brisson et al 1998 2003 swap kroes et al 2000 2009 this simulation optimization approach can be implemented using either deterministic e g wang and cai 2009 linker and sylaios 2016 linker et al 2018 or stochastic forecasts wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2018 2019 using deterministic forecasts has the obvious advantage of reducing drastically the computation burden and linker and sylaios 2016 and linker et al 2018 have shown that close to optimal results can be achieved still this approach is overly simplistic and as emphasized by pannell et al 2000 irrigation strategies that are optimal under average conditions may yield poor results in extreme years furthermore such an approach bears little resemblance to the risk advert strategies traditionally adopted by farmers by contrast as shown in the present study stochastic approaches are suitable for developing risk adverse management strategies which are conceptually much closer to farmers reasoning and are therefore more likely to be of practical interest stochastic approaches involve an ensemble of forecasts each forecast corresponding to a scenario jamal et al 2018 described three types of stochastic approaches relevant to irrigation management 1 the implicit approach according to which each of the n s scenarios is optimized independently and some heuristics is used to choose the best solution this approach is obviously the easiest to implement since it only requires solving n s deterministic problems independently of each other however this approach fails to represent adequately the true stochastic nature of the problem also the heuristics adopted to select the best solution is a critical factor which is left completely to the user discretion 2 the one stage explicit approach according to which a single set of decisions is sought for all n s scenarios simultaneously in other word this approach is seeking the solution that will be as good as possible regardless of which scenario actually materializes such an approach is required in applications where the user has to make all decisions at once and does not have the opportunity to update decisions as time unfolds with respect to irrigation management this approach is overly conservative since it is reasonable to expect that the farmer will revise his irrigation schedule throughout the season based on past weather and or updated forecasts 3 the two stage explicit approach which addresses the drawback of the explicit one stage approach by requiring that only the immediate decision be the same for all scenarios while future decisions can be scenario dependent this approach relies on the realistic assumption that at any given point in time although the farmer has an irrigation blueprint for the whole season he only needs to implement the immediate decision for instance the irrigation for the coming week while future decisions will be re adjusted at the next decision point if necessary jamal et al 2018 illustrated the superiority of the two stage explicit approach on a small case study with a chickpea crop the present work extends the work of jamal et al 2018 in three ways 1 while jamal et al 2018 considered single objective optimization problems maximizing profit in the present work we adopt a multi objective approach 2 the selection of the best strategy is inspired from risk analysis rather than average performance as in jamal et al 2018 and 3 the present study involves a much larger number of scenarios 15 vs 3 and the performance of the proposed approach is analyzed over 10 years rather than a single year 2 description of the procedure from a computation perspective the key element of the proposed procedure is a multi objective problem which is solved repeatedly using different forecasts a detailed description of the procedure can be found in linker and kisekka 2017 and only a brief description is provided here for completeness it is assumed that a mathematical model describing the crop development and soil water content such aquacrop dssat or swap is available the season is split into n d periods and irrigation is managed according to soil water depletion whenever the water content in the root zone falls below a certain level denoted θ i for period i a pre defined amount of water is supplied the n d irrigation thresholds are the decision variables of the optimization problem the objective being to maximize yield while minimizing irrigation or mathematically 1 minimize θ 1 θ 2 θ n d y n i where y denotes the yield predicted by the model and n i is the number of irrigation events which is a direct result of the thresholds θ 1 θ 2 θ n d adopted the optimization can be repeated several times during the season to account for the actual weather being different from the forecasts linker and sylaios 2016 compared to a simpler single objective approach e g profit such as in jamal et al 2018 this multi objective approach has the advantage that it does not require assumptions about the crop value or water price however solving 1 by itself does not provide an implementable solution and an additional criterion is needed for selecting one of the optimal solutions pareto combinations as the one for implementation as discussed in linker et al 2018 although one can select the solution corresponding to the highest yield or some desired target yield it is preferable to use marginal yield as selection criterion the solution selected is the one achieving the highest yield for which the marginal yield defined here as additional yield per mm of irrigation is above some predefined value the procedure outlined above provides an implementable solution in the deterministic case and the pseudo code of its extension to the stochastic case is shown in fig 1 it is assumed that an ensemble of n s weather forecasts is available corresponding to n s possible scenarios the concept is as follows i solve eq 1 using some scenario i as forecasts until the end of the season ii select the optimal irrigation threshold for the current decision period and extract the corresponding irrigation events iii implement the irrigation events obtained in ii over the current decision period assuming that the actual weather corresponds to some scenario j and re optimize the future decisions assuming this scenario j until the end of the season iv store the performance index of combination scenario i scenario j in element i j of matrix λ size n s n s whose entries can be interpreted as performance if the current decision is made assuming that scenario i will occur but in practice scenario j occurs the most obvious performance index consists of yield or water use efficiency but other user defined quantitative index would be equally suitable the whole procedure is repeated assuming another scenario in i until all scenarios have been exhausted v analyze the performance matrix λ in a row wise fashion to determine which is the best decision for the current period here rather than to base the selection on mean performance we suggest to implement a selection procedure inspired from risk analysis for instance select the decision which has the lowest probability of resulting in a performance index e g yield below a certain threshold or select the decision for which the cumulative probability corresponding to some performance index is the highest vi implement the irrigation events corresponding to the selected scenario for the current period and advance to the next decision point in the simulation example below this step consists of running a simulation with the model that represents the crop and the actual weather and irrigation events until the next decision point in practice the same irrigation events would be implemented in the field the procedure described above requires solving the multi objective optimization problem defined in eq 1 n s n s times which may become prohibitive computation wise each optimization requires about 1 min however it is possible to reduce significantly the number of optimizations actually performed by realizing that step iii can be bypassed if the current state of the system and previous decisions are similar to that of a scenario previously investigated for instance let us consider that when assuming scenario i for t k e n d the optimal decision is no irrigation during period t k and the expected system state at t k 1 is s i let us further assume that when assuming scenario j j i for t k e n d the optimal decision is also no irrigation during period t k and the expected state at t k 1 is s j s i in such a case the optimal decisions for periods t k 1 e n d will be the same regardless of which weather i or j is assumed for period t k in other words step iii does not need to be repeated and one can simply copy the performance indices stored in the ith row of λ into the jth row strictly speaking such bypass is valid only if s i and s j are strictly equal in practice this requirement can be relaxed and the computations are bypassed if s j is similar enough to s i obviously this requires that the user defines a similarity metric and a corresponding similarity threshold another issue that requires attention is how to define the system state again strictly speaking this includes all the variables described by differential equations in the model depending on the actual model this can include canopy related variables such canopy cover or leaf area index biomass or harvestable material as well as water content throughout the whole soil profile in practice for the purpose of the similarity test described above the system state can be defined in a less rigorous fashion considering for instance a single variable e g total available water content in root zone to describe the soil state this is further discussed in the example below 3 illustrative example 3 1 case study description the procedure is illustrated for a maize crop in davis ca the simulations were performed using dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 with the crop parameter values corresponding to cultivar pio3475 and a yolo soil see appendix a for details the sowing date was set to julian day 108 and 40 mm of water was applied at each irrigation event the simulations were performed using weather records retrieved from nasa prediction of worldwide energy resources repository https power larc nasa gov data access viewer for years 1991 2015 the proposed procedure was tested for years 2006 2015 using in each case the weather recorded in the previous 15 years as forecast scenarios n s 15 after solving the multi objective problem defined in eq 1 the optimal solution selected was that corresponding to a minimal yield of 14 t ha and marginal yield of 24 kg mm if yield of 14 t ha was not achievable the combination corresponding to the highest yield was selected step iii was by passed if the biomass soil extractable water and irrigation corresponding to the solution selected in step ii were within 5 of those obtained with a previous scenario yield was adopted as performance index in step iv and in step v the irrigation schedule selected for implementation was that of the scenario for which the expected worst case yield was the highest more specifically the following decision logic was implemented 1 construct the matrix λ s o r t e d by reordering in increasing order the yields excepted for each scenario each row of matrix λ 2 initialize q 1 3 scan the qth column of λ s o r t e d and extract the row s corresponding to the maximum value 4 if only one row is extracted in step 3 select the corresponding scenario otherwise eliminate from λ s o r t e d the rows that do not correspond to the maximum value increase q to q 1 and go back to step 3 unless the last column has been reached in which case select any of the remaining scenarios the decision points were selected by taking into account the growth stages defined in dssat as well as basic understanding of maize phenology more specifically the growth stages identifiable from the dssat outputs file opg are listed in table 1 although additional growth stages are reported in the dssat ome file these can not be readily identified in the opg file which reports only switching between the growth stages listed in table 1 and were not used in this study these switching points between growth stages are natural candidates as decision points since in dssat a specific irrigation threshold can be specified for each growth stage however using only these would have resulted in unreasonably long periods between adjustments in several cases up to 40 days therefore additional decision points were included dynamically throughout the season so that the interval between adjustments never exceeded 15 days between flower initiation and 75 silking growth stages 02 and 03 and after the beginning of grain filling growth stage 04 no optimization was performed during the last 20 days of the season all computations were performed in matlab using custom scripts that generated the inputs files required by dssat invoked ddsat and imported the output files generated by dssat technical details about the implementation can be found in appendix b the optimization problem formulated in eq 1 was solved using the procedure described in herrero et al 2007 3 2 detailed results for year 2006 this section presents some of the intermediate results in order to illustrate the decision process and the evolution of the expectations over time until day 142 fourth decision point the optimization was no irrigation regardless of the expected weather details not shown on day 142 assuming scenario 1 weather of 1991 until the end of the season led to planning irrigation on day 150 and day 156 and more beyond day 157 which was the next decision point with a corresponding seasonal irrigation of 600 mm and yield of 13 06 t ha the simulation was then advanced to day 157 using these irrigation events and the weather of scenario 2 and the optimization was re evaluated on day 157 assuming the weather of scenario 2 until the end of the season the expected seasonal irrigation and yield were 560 mm and 16 39 t ha respectively this process was repeated using the weather of scenarios 3 10 leading to the results summarized in table 2 after rolling back to day 142 the whole procedure was repeated assuming scenario 2 resp 3 4 10 from that day on the results were concatenated into the matrix λ expected yield which was sorted to create the matrix λ s o r t e d shown in table 3 notice that scenarios 11 and 15 let to decisions and states similar to scenario 7 so that the computations were by passed and the values of scenario 7 were simply copied in the corresponding rows for completeness it can be seen that the worst case scenario yield leftmost column was the highest if selecting the irrigation schedule of scenarios 1 or 3 according to the decision logic described above the analysis then progressed to the second column of λ s o r t e d considering only the non greyed out value this second to worst yield was not informative and the analysis progressed to the third column of λ s o r t e d here a single maximum was identified 14 14 t ha which led to selecting for implementation the irrigation schedule obtained assuming the weather of scenario 3 during the current decision period note that selecting the decision leading to the highest yield or highest average yield would have led to selecting a different irrigation schedule the one corresponding to scenario 14 and 4 respectively table 4 shows the matrix λ s o r t e d created at the next decision point day 157 notice that the computations were bypassed for five scenarios 6 7 10 14 and 15 which were similar to scenarios 2 4 5 3 and 12 respectively scanning λ s o r t e d as before led to selecting the irrigation schedule generated assuming the weather of scenario 5 for this decision period table 5 summarizes the results for the whole 2006 season and shows at each decision point the irrigation events that will be implemented as well as the ranges of expected yield and seasonal irrigation the actual final yield was 14 07 t ha and the corresponding irrigation was 560 mm in fig 2 a this final result indicated by symbol is shown relative to the approximated crop water productivity function obtained by applying the deterministic approach described in linker and kisekka 2017 with the actual weather symbols and solid line the symbol indicates the irrigation yield combination that would have been selected if perfect weather forecasts were available i e the perfect optimum that corresponds to yield of 14 t ha or more and marginal yield of 24 kg mm the result that would be obtained by implementing the same deterministic procedure using as forecasts the average weather of the 15 previous years is shown by the symbol the deterministic optimization was repeated at the same decision points as the stochastic procedure to ensure fair comparison it can be seen that the stochastic approach led to a irrigation yield combination almost identical to the perfect optimum while the deterministic approach yielded a result that was also very close to optimal but with a slightly lower yield this can be appreciated also in fig 2b and c that show the evolution of total biomass and yield as well as cumulative irrigation for all three cases non perfect weather forecasts caused the irrigation to start later than if perfect forecasts were available however when using the stochastic approach irrigation was increased during the second half of the season leading to closing the yield gap notice that total biomass was still lower than under perfect conditions when using the deterministic approach the irrigation remained lower throughout the season leading to a final lower yield 3 3 final results for all years the final results for years 2007 2015 are presented in fig 3 the results of deterministic optimization using the average weather and the estimated water productivity function for the same year are shown for comparison similarly to fig 2a the most striking feature is the strong influence of the actual weather on the estimated water productivity function which ranges from very low yield almost regardless of irrigation in 2013 to years in which increasing irrigation by 200 mm increases yield by almost 40 e g 2010 2014 despite this wide range of environmental conditions the proposed stochastic optimization scheme led consistently to results that were very close to optimal albeit in most cases not the optimal combination that would have been selected as optimal if perfect forecasts had been available vs symbols deterministic optimization using 15 year average weather as forecasts also yielded results that were very close to optimal which is consistent with the results reported in linker and sylaios 2016 however table 6 shows that compared to the benchmark solution obtained with perfect forecasts the deterministic approach resulted in a ten year average yield that was almost 1 t ha lower partially offset by an irrigation reduction of 32 mm on average by comparison the stochastic approach led to a ten year average yield that was 0 8 t ha higher than the benchmark with on average 64 mm additional irrigation due to both higher minimal yield and higher maximal yield 3 4 discussion although in the present study the irrigation schedule for implementation was selected automatically in order to enable fair comparison between the different methods it is crucial to remember that in practice the farmer would be involved in the decision process at each decision point the farmer would have access to the results of all the combinations that have been investigated i e the information presented in tables 3 and 4 and would be able to choose for implementation an irrigation schedule that differs from the recommended one if the recommendation does not seem satisfactory he she could also choose to set a different target yield and repeat the optimization procedure such decisions should be based at least partly on the expected outcome of the current strategy and the ability to predict accurately and reliably yield and total irrigation as early as possible is therefore of primary importance fig 4 shows at each decision point the range of the expected yield corresponding to the selected irrigation strategy box plot the symbol on the right axis denotes the actual yield for comparison the symbols show the expected yield obtained using the deterministic approach average weather used as forecasts and the symbol on the right axis denotes the final yield achieved with that approach fig 5 presents the information relative to irrigation in a similar fashion together with fig 3 these figures underscore that although in each year the final result obtained with the stochastic approach was very close to optimal estimating yield and irrigation requirements early in the season remained much more challenging only on three years 2008 2012 2015 was the final yield within or very close to the 25 75 percentiles interval predicted throughout the season on two years 2009 and 2013 yield was predicted correctly only from the 7th decision point around julian day 180 depending on the weather while on the other years yield was predicted accurately only very close to the end of the season the uncertainty in terms of irrigation was lower the extent of the 25 75 percentiles interval corresponds to two irrigation events or less most of the time but the final irrigation amount was rarely the one predicted early in the season figs 4 and 5 also show that overall the deterministic optimization symbols tended to overestimate yield and slightly underestimate irrigation requirements throughout the season 4 implementation opportunities and challenges the complexity of the proposed approach is without any doubt beyond what could be managed by even the most technology savvy farmers however it could be readily implemented as a service provided via a web based platform several companies already offer web based platforms that provide farmers with irrigation recommendations at the very least such platforms require that the farmer provides the field location and crop properties the field location is used by the platform to locate nearby weather stations that can be accessed remotely as well as to retrieve appropriate weather historical records and forecasts from third party providers the farmer may also be asked to provide information about the field s soil or alternatively the field location can be used to retrieve automatically soil properties from soil maps available in web repositories in order to provide irrigation recommendations most current platforms combine this static information with dynamic information such as past irrigation events either retrieved automatically from irrigation controllers or entered manually by the farmer and the crop status typically obtained by remote sensing and in some cases proximal sensing integrating dynamic crop models in the decision process would enable replacing the current approach which is purely responsive to observations by approaches that take into account how the crop is expected to respond to future irrigation decisions as mentioned in the introduction a number of dynamic crop models are available and these could be readily implemented in a web based platform these models typically come with sets of default parameter values for a wide variety of common crops which could be retrieved automatically based on the information provided by the farmer still such default parameter values are obviously only approximate and the main drawback of model based approaches is that modeling errors affect negatively the performance of the overall decision making process while in the past this seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle that precluded the use of models in real applications thanks to advances in sensing techniques in particular remote sensing and the development of so called data assimilation techniques it is now possible to improve models periodically throughout the season pauwels et al 2007 fang et al 2008 jégo et al 2012 ines et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 huang et al 2015 2019 linker and ioslovich 2017 making model based approaches much more attractive embedding such a data assimilation scheme within a model based optimization framework was beyond the scope of the present study but such work is currently in progress conceptually the idea is that when reaching the next decision point step vi in fig 1 all the soil water content and or canopy measurements available till that point are used together with the actual weather to improve the model before going back to step i and repeating the optimization the second drawback of model based approaches is that they require assumptions about the uncontrollable inputs that drive the system weather in the present case the present study focused on this issue namely dealing explicitly with the imperfectness of the weather forecasts in a stochastic fashion in terms of the information required from the farmer in order to implement a stochastic model based approach rather than a deterministic one the change would be minimal in particular the same basic input information would be required namely the field location crop type and preferably soil profile most of the changes would occur behind the scene unbeknownst to the farmer and without requiring his involvement rather than accessing a single weather forecast as in the deterministic case the platform would access a forecasts ensemble a common product of weather forecasting services or use several years of historical records as forecasts surrogates as done in the example above or a combination of both the farmer s involvement would be required only in order to define the criterion for selecting the decision for implementation step v in fig 1 which should be done at least once at the beginning of the season however as noted above the farmer would have access to the expected outcome of all the scenarios that were investigated and although this is not strictly required he she should be encouraged to review the platform recommendations in a critical fashion taking into account factors not included in the automated analysis compared to the deterministic approach the main drawback of the stochastic approach is its high computational cost whereas the deterministic approach requires solving the optimization problem defined in eq 1 only once at each decision point and could provide recommendations in a virtually instantaneous fashion straightforward implementation of the stochastic approach would require solving the same problem n s n s times 225 times in the example above the by passing procedure described above reduced this number by about half but the computing burden was still far from being comparable to that of the deterministic approach whether this additional complexity is justified in economic terms will have to be determined on a location crop combination basis still considering that the whole procedure runs unattended this is not a concern for the end user but rather for the service provider who should make sure that adequate computing resources are available if the platform is to provide the service to a large number of clients finally it must be noted that although this study was conducted having in mind farmers as end users the proposed approach could potentially be of interest for water managing authorities as well in this case the procedure could be used to estimate the water requirements of various crops under different weather scenarios assuming that all farmers would manage irrigation according to some pre defined strategy the computations could be repeated several times during the season not necessarily linked to specific crop developmental stages in order to reassess water requirements forecasts taking into account actual past weather and water use clearly this would be possible only for crops for which suitable models are available which unfortunately does not include tree crops at the moment furthermore having to perform the computations for a large number of crop soil combinations would present significant computational challenges that will need to be addressed in future studies 5 conclusion a scheme for applying two stage explicit stochastic optimization to seasonal irrigation scheduling has been developed and illustrated for a maize crop modeled with dssat this approach yielded consistently results that were very close to truly optimal results i e results that could have been obtained if perfect weather forecasts were available at the beginning of the season these results were better than those obtained with a deterministic approach that relied on the same data and decision rules but considered only a single weather forecast consisting of the previous 15 years average however these improved results came at the expense of a significant increase of the computation burden the trade off between improved performance in terms of irrigation management and yield on the one hand and computation burden on the other hand will be a function of the crop and location weather variability and deciding whether the improved performance is worth the additional burden will have to be determined on a case by case basis regardless of the improved performance in terms of yield a main advantage of the stochastic approach is that since the irrigation schedule for implementation is selected from an ensemble of solutions it is possible to develop a selection strategy that mimics farmers traditional selection strategy this could prove a key factor toward the adoption of decision support tools that involve model based optimization funding the

irrigation management the ones relevant to the present work being irrigation events on specific dates supplied by the user d mode or irrigation triggered at specific thresholds in the later case the amount of water supplied at each irrigation can be set a priori w mode or calculated to replenish soil water to a desired level p mode in both cases a specific irrigation threshold can be supplied for each growth stage this work used a slightly modified version of dssat provided by dr c porter in which user specified irrigation events and irrigation thresholds can be combined in p mode or w mode in this version the irrigation thresholds are ignored until the last user supplied irrigation event afterward irrigation is determined automatically based on the thresholds as in regular p and w modes since in dssat each threshold is associated with a specific growth stage but the optimization performed in this study was not restricted to take place at the beginning of growth stages a dummy 1 mm irrigation event was included on the day preceding the optimization day d o p t unless an actual irrigation event took place on that day in this manner the actual irrigation events were used until day d o p t 1 while irrigation thresholds were used for the rest of the season this is illustrated in fig a1 which shows an excerpt of a dssat snx file used for optimization on day 189 40 mm irrigation events were implemented on specific days until day 186 a dummy irrigation event was introduced on day 188 and starting on day 189 40 mm irrigation events were generated automatically according to the thresholds defined under the n irrigation header the dummy irrigation event was deleted after completing the optimization 
10410,this paper presents a scheme for applying two stage explicit stochastic optimization to seasonal irrigation scheduling it is assumed that an ensemble of n s weather forecasts scenarios is available at each decision point during the season up to n s n s multi objective optimization problems are solved by assuming a specific scenario for the immediate decision period and all possible n s scenarios for the subsequent periods the irrigation schedule selected for implementation during the immediate decision period is the one that produces the highest worst case yield which mimics the traditional risk adverse farmers strategy the procedure is illustrated for a maize crop at davis ca modeled with dssat the optimization was performed for ten years using as forecasts the weather

irrigation dssat maize simulation optimization modeling 1 introduction irrigation is a critical input for a wide variety of crops and irrigation scheduling is one of the many management decisions that farmers have to make while facing significant uncertainties about several factors such as prices and most importantly weather farmers tend to be conservative in the sense that they implement strategies that reduce the risk of losses in poor years at the expense of overall reduced productivity jones et al 2000 it is generally accepted that improved weather forecasts both at the short term and long term seasonal levels are keys to improving irrigation management this claim was recently supported by the work of an vo et al 2019 who quantified the benefit that could be expected from using

and have been thoroughly tested and validated e g aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 rzwqm2 ma et al 2006 ceres dejonge et al 2012 both embedded in dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 stics brisson et al 1998 2003 swap kroes et al 2000 2009 this simulation optimization approach can be implemented using either deterministic e g wang and cai 2009 linker and sylaios 2016 linker et al 2018 or stochastic forecasts wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 jamal et al 2018 2019 using deterministic forecasts has the obvious advantage of reducing drastically the computation burden and linker and sylaios 2016 and linker et al 2018 have shown that close to optimal results can be achieved still this approach is overly simplistic and as emphasized by pannell et al 2000 irrigation strategies that are optimal under average conditions may yield poor results in extreme years furthermore such an approach bears little resemblance to the risk advert strategies traditionally adopted by farmers by contrast as shown in the present study stochastic approaches are suitable for developing risk adverse management strategies which are conceptually much closer to farmers reasoning and are therefore more likely to be of practical interest stochastic approaches involve an ensemble of forecasts each forecast corresponding to a scenario jamal et al 2018 described three types of stochastic approaches relevant to irrigation management 1 the implicit approach according to which each of the n s scenarios is optimized independently and some heuristics is used to choose the best solution this approach is obviously the easiest to implement since it only requires solving n s deterministic problems independently of each other however this approach fails to represent adequately the true stochastic nature of the problem also the heuristics adopted to select the best solution is a critical factor which is left completely to the user discretion 2 the one stage explicit approach according to which a single set of decisions is sought for all n s scenarios simultaneously in other word this approach is seeking the solution that will be as good as possible regardless of which scenario actually materializes such an approach is required in applications where the user has to make all decisions at once and does not have the opportunity to update decisions as time unfolds with respect to irrigation management this approach is overly conservative since it is reasonable to expect that the farmer will revise his irrigation schedule throughout the season based on past weather and or updated forecasts 3 the two stage explicit approach which addresses the drawback of the explicit one stage approach by requiring that only the immediate decision be the same for all scenarios while future decisions can be scenario dependent this approach relies on the realistic assumption that at any given point in time although the farmer has an irrigation blueprint for the whole season he only needs to implement the immediate decision for instance the irrigation for the coming week while future decisions will be re adjusted at the next decision point if necessary jamal et al 2018 illustrated the superiority of the two stage explicit approach on a small case study with a chickpea crop the present work extends the work of jamal et al 2018 in three ways 1 while jamal et al 2018 considered single objective optimization problems maximizing profit in the present work we adopt a multi objective approach 2 the selection of the best strategy is inspired from risk analysis rather than average performance as in jamal et al 2018 and 3 the present study involves a much larger number of scenarios 15 vs 3 and the performance of the proposed approach is analyzed over 10 years rather than a single year 2 description of the procedure from a computation perspective the key element of the proposed procedure is a multi objective problem which is solved repeatedly using different forecasts a detailed description of the procedure can be found in linker and kisekka 2017 and only a brief description is provided here for completeness it is assumed that a mathematical model describing the crop development and soil water content such aquacrop dssat or swap is available the season is split into n d periods and irrigation is managed according to soil water depletion whenever the water content in the root zone falls below a certain level denoted θ i for period i a pre defined amount of water is supplied the n d irrigation thresholds are the decision variables of the optimization problem the objective being to maximize yield while minimizing irrigation or mathematically 1 minimize θ 1 θ 2 θ n d y n i where y denotes the yield predicted by the model and n i is the number of irrigation events which is a direct result of the thresholds θ 1 θ 2 θ n d adopted the optimization can be repeated several times during the season to account for the actual weather being different from the forecasts linker and sylaios 2016 compared to a simpler single objective approach e g profit such as in jamal et al 2018 this multi objective approach has the advantage that it does not require assumptions about the crop value or water price however solving 1 by itself does not provide an implementable solution and an additional criterion is needed for selecting one of the optimal solutions pareto combinations as the one for implementation as discussed in linker et al 2018 although one can select the solution corresponding to the highest yield or some desired target yield it is preferable to use marginal yield as selection criterion the solution selected is the one achieving the highest yield for which the marginal yield defined here as additional yield per mm of irrigation is above some predefined value the procedure outlined above provides an implementable solution in the deterministic case and the pseudo code of its extension to the stochastic case is shown in fig 1 it is assumed that an ensemble of n s weather forecasts is available corresponding to n s possible scenarios the concept is as follows i solve eq 1 using some scenario i as forecasts until the end of the season ii select the optimal irrigation threshold for the current decision period and extract the corresponding irrigation events iii implement the irrigation events obtained in ii over the current decision period assuming that the actual weather corresponds to some scenario j and re optimize the future decisions assuming this scenario j until the end of the season iv store the performance index of combination scenario i scenario j in element i j of matrix λ size n s n s whose entries can be interpreted as performance if the current decision is made assuming that scenario i will occur but in practice scenario j occurs the most obvious performance index consists of yield or water use efficiency but other user defined quantitative index would be equally suitable the whole procedure is repeated assuming another scenario in i until all scenarios have been exhausted v analyze the performance matrix λ in a row wise fashion to determine which is the best decision for the current period here rather than to base the selection on mean performance we suggest to implement a selection procedure inspired from risk analysis for instance select the decision which has the lowest probability of resulting in a performance index e g yield below a certain threshold or select the decision for which the cumulative probability corresponding to some performance index is the highest vi implement the irrigation events corresponding to the selected scenario for the current period and advance to the next decision point in the simulation example below this step consists of running a simulation with the model that represents the crop and the actual weather and irrigation events until the next decision point in practice the same irrigation events would be implemented in the field the procedure described above requires solving the multi objective optimization problem defined in eq 1 n s n s times which may become prohibitive computation wise each optimization requires about 1 min however it is possible to reduce significantly the number of optimizations actually performed by realizing that step iii can be bypassed if the current state of the system and previous decisions are similar to that of a scenario previously investigated for instance let us consider that when assuming scenario i for t k e n d the optimal decision is no irrigation during period t k and the expected system state at t k 1 is s i let us further assume that when assuming scenario j j i for t k e n d the optimal decision is also no irrigation during period t k and the expected state at t k 1 is s j s i in such a case the optimal decisions for periods t k 1 e n d will be the same regardless of which weather i or j is assumed for period t k in other words step iii does not need to be repeated and one can simply copy the performance indices stored in the ith row of λ into the jth row strictly speaking such bypass is valid only if s i and s j are strictly equal in practice this requirement can be relaxed and the computations are bypassed if s j is similar enough to s i obviously this requires that the user defines a similarity metric and a corresponding similarity threshold another issue that requires attention is how to define the system state again strictly speaking this includes all the variables described by differential equations in the model depending on the actual model this can include canopy related variables such canopy cover or leaf area index biomass or harvestable material as well as water content throughout the whole soil profile in practice for the purpose of the similarity test described above the system state can be defined in a less rigorous fashion considering for instance a single variable e g total available water content in root zone to describe the soil state this is further discussed in the example below 3 illustrative example 3 1 case study description the procedure is illustrated for a maize crop in davis ca the simulations were performed using dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 with the crop parameter values corresponding to cultivar pio3475 and a yolo soil see appendix a for details the sowing date was set to julian day 108 and 40 mm of water was applied at each irrigation event the simulations were performed using weather records retrieved from nasa prediction of worldwide energy resources repository https power larc nasa gov data access viewer for years 1991 2015 the proposed procedure was tested for years 2006 2015 using in each case the weather recorded in the previous 15 years as forecast scenarios n s 15 after solving the multi objective problem defined in eq 1 the optimal solution selected was that corresponding to a minimal yield of 14 t ha and marginal yield of 24 kg mm if yield of 14 t ha was not achievable the combination corresponding to the highest yield was selected step iii was by passed if the biomass soil extractable water and irrigation corresponding to the solution selected in step ii were within 5 of those obtained with a previous scenario yield was adopted as performance index in step iv and in step v the irrigation schedule selected for implementation was that of the scenario for which the expected worst case yield was the highest more specifically the following decision logic was implemented 1 construct the matrix λ s o r t e d by reordering in increasing order the yields excepted for each scenario each row of matrix λ 2 initialize q 1 3 scan the qth column of λ s o r t e d and extract the row s corresponding to the maximum value 4 if only one row is extracted in step 3 select the corresponding scenario otherwise eliminate from λ s o r t e d the rows that do not correspond to the maximum value increase q to q 1 and go back to step 3 unless the last column has been reached in which case select any of the remaining scenarios the decision points were selected by taking into account the growth stages defined in dssat as well as basic understanding of maize phenology more specifically the growth stages identifiable from the dssat outputs file opg are listed in table 1 although additional growth stages are reported in the dssat ome file these can not be readily identified in the opg file which reports only switching between the growth stages listed in table 1 and were not used in this study these switching points between growth stages are natural candidates as decision points since in dssat a specific irrigation threshold can be specified for each growth stage however using only these would have resulted in unreasonably long periods between adjustments in several cases up to 40 days therefore additional decision points were included dynamically throughout the season so that the interval between adjustments never exceeded 15 days between flower initiation and 75 silking growth stages 02 and 03 and after the beginning of grain filling growth stage 04 no optimization was performed during the last 20 days of the season all computations were performed in matlab using custom scripts that generated the inputs files required by dssat invoked ddsat and imported the output files generated by dssat technical details about the implementation can be found in appendix b the optimization problem formulated in eq 1 was solved using the procedure described in herrero et al 2007 3 2 detailed results for year 2006 this section presents some of the intermediate results in order to illustrate the decision process and the evolution of the expectations over time until day 142 fourth decision point the optimization was no irrigation regardless of the expected weather details not shown on day 142 assuming scenario 1 weather of 1991 until the end of the season led to planning irrigation on day 150 and day 156 and more beyond day 157 which was the next decision point with a corresponding seasonal irrigation of 600 mm and yield of 13 06 t ha the simulation was then advanced to day 157 using these irrigation events and the weather of scenario 2 and the optimization was re evaluated on day 157 assuming the weather of scenario 2 until the end of the season the expected seasonal irrigation and yield were 560 mm and 16 39 t ha respectively this process was repeated using the weather of scenarios 3 10 leading to the results summarized in table 2 after rolling back to day 142 the whole procedure was repeated assuming scenario 2 resp 3 4 10 from that day on the results were concatenated into the matrix λ expected yield which was sorted to create the matrix λ s o r t e d shown in table 3 notice that scenarios 11 and 15 let to decisions and states similar to scenario 7 so that the computations were by passed and the values of scenario 7 were simply copied in the corresponding rows for completeness it can be seen that the worst case scenario yield leftmost column was the highest if selecting the irrigation schedule of scenarios 1 or 3 according to the decision logic described above the analysis then progressed to the second column of λ s o r t e d considering only the non greyed out value this second to worst yield was not informative and the analysis progressed to the third column of λ s o r t e d here a single maximum was identified 14 14 t ha which led to selecting for implementation the irrigation schedule obtained assuming the weather of scenario 3 during the current decision period note that selecting the decision leading to the highest yield or highest average yield would have led to selecting a different irrigation schedule the one corresponding to scenario 14 and 4 respectively table 4 shows the matrix λ s o r t e d created at the next decision point day 157 notice that the computations were bypassed for five scenarios 6 7 10 14 and 15 which were similar to scenarios 2 4 5 3 and 12 respectively scanning λ s o r t e d as before led to selecting the irrigation schedule generated assuming the weather of scenario 5 for this decision period table 5 summarizes the results for the whole 2006 season and shows at each decision point the irrigation events that will be implemented as well as the ranges of expected yield and seasonal irrigation the actual final yield was 14 07 t ha and the corresponding irrigation was 560 mm in fig 2 a this final result indicated by symbol is shown relative to the approximated crop water productivity function obtained by applying the deterministic approach described in linker and kisekka 2017 with the actual weather symbols and solid line the symbol indicates the irrigation yield combination that would have been selected if perfect weather forecasts were available i e the perfect optimum that corresponds to yield of 14 t ha or more and marginal yield of 24 kg mm the result that would be obtained by implementing the same deterministic procedure using as forecasts the average weather of the 15 previous years is shown by the symbol the deterministic optimization was repeated at the same decision points as the stochastic procedure to ensure fair comparison it can be seen that the stochastic approach led to a irrigation yield combination almost identical to the perfect optimum while the deterministic approach yielded a result that was also very close to optimal but with a slightly lower yield this can be appreciated also in fig 2b and c that show the evolution of total biomass and yield as well as cumulative irrigation for all three cases non perfect weather forecasts caused the irrigation to start later than if perfect forecasts were available however when using the stochastic approach irrigation was increased during the second half of the season leading to closing the yield gap notice that total biomass was still lower than under perfect conditions when using the deterministic approach the irrigation remained lower throughout the season leading to a final lower yield 3 3 final results for all years the final results for years 2007 2015 are presented in fig 3 the results of deterministic optimization using the average weather and the estimated water productivity function for the same year are shown for comparison similarly to fig 2a the most striking feature is the strong influence of the actual weather on the estimated water productivity function which ranges from very low yield almost regardless of irrigation in 2013 to years in which increasing irrigation by 200 mm increases yield by almost 40 e g 2010 2014 despite this wide range of environmental conditions the proposed stochastic optimization scheme led consistently to results that were very close to optimal albeit in most cases not the optimal combination that would have been selected as optimal if perfect forecasts had been available vs symbols deterministic optimization using 15 year average weather as forecasts also yielded results that were very close to optimal which is consistent with the results reported in linker and sylaios 2016 however table 6 shows that compared to the benchmark solution obtained with perfect forecasts the deterministic approach resulted in a ten year average yield that was almost 1 t ha lower partially offset by an irrigation reduction of 32 mm on average by comparison the stochastic approach led to a ten year average yield that was 0 8 t ha higher than the benchmark with on average 64 mm additional irrigation due to both higher minimal yield and higher maximal yield 3 4 discussion although in the present study the irrigation schedule for implementation was selected automatically in order to enable fair comparison between the different methods it is crucial to remember that in practice the farmer would be involved in the decision process at each decision point the farmer would have access to the results of all the combinations that have been investigated i e the information presented in tables 3 and 4 and would be able to choose for implementation an irrigation schedule that differs from the recommended one if the recommendation does not seem satisfactory he she could also choose to set a different target yield and repeat the optimization procedure such decisions should be based at least partly on the expected outcome of the current strategy and the ability to predict accurately and reliably yield and total irrigation as early as possible is therefore of primary importance fig 4 shows at each decision point the range of the expected yield corresponding to the selected irrigation strategy box plot the symbol on the right axis denotes the actual yield for comparison the symbols show the expected yield obtained using the deterministic approach average weather used as forecasts and the symbol on the right axis denotes the final yield achieved with that approach fig 5 presents the information relative to irrigation in a similar fashion together with fig 3 these figures underscore that although in each year the final result obtained with the stochastic approach was very close to optimal estimating yield and irrigation requirements early in the season remained much more challenging only on three years 2008 2012 2015 was the final yield within or very close to the 25 75 percentiles interval predicted throughout the season on two years 2009 and 2013 yield was predicted correctly only from the 7th decision point around julian day 180 depending on the weather while on the other years yield was predicted accurately only very close to the end of the season the uncertainty in terms of irrigation was lower the extent of the 25 75 percentiles interval corresponds to two irrigation events or less most of the time but the final irrigation amount was rarely the one predicted early in the season figs 4 and 5 also show that overall the deterministic optimization symbols tended to overestimate yield and slightly underestimate irrigation requirements throughout the season 4 implementation opportunities and challenges the complexity of the proposed approach is without any doubt beyond what could be managed by even the most technology savvy farmers however it could be readily implemented as a service provided via a web based platform several companies already offer web based platforms that provide farmers with irrigation recommendations at the very least such platforms require that the farmer provides the field location and crop properties the field location is used by the platform to locate nearby weather stations that can be accessed remotely as well as to retrieve appropriate weather historical records and forecasts from third party providers the farmer may also be asked to provide information about the field s soil or alternatively the field location can be used to retrieve automatically soil properties from soil maps available in web repositories in order to provide irrigation recommendations most current platforms combine this static information with dynamic information such as past irrigation events either retrieved automatically from irrigation controllers or entered manually by the farmer and the crop status typically obtained by remote sensing and in some cases proximal sensing integrating dynamic crop models in the decision process would enable replacing the current approach which is purely responsive to observations by approaches that take into account how the crop is expected to respond to future irrigation decisions as mentioned in the introduction a number of dynamic crop models are available and these could be readily implemented in a web based platform these models typically come with sets of default parameter values for a wide variety of common crops which could be retrieved automatically based on the information provided by the farmer still such default parameter values are obviously only approximate and the main drawback of model based approaches is that modeling errors affect negatively the performance of the overall decision making process while in the past this seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle that precluded the use of models in real applications thanks to advances in sensing techniques in particular remote sensing and the development of so called data assimilation techniques it is now possible to improve models periodically throughout the season pauwels et al 2007 fang et al 2008 jégo et al 2012 ines et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 huang et al 2015 2019 linker and ioslovich 2017 making model based approaches much more attractive embedding such a data assimilation scheme within a model based optimization framework was beyond the scope of the present study but such work is currently in progress conceptually the idea is that when reaching the next decision point step vi in fig 1 all the soil water content and or canopy measurements available till that point are used together with the actual weather to improve the model before going back to step i and repeating the optimization the second drawback of model based approaches is that they require assumptions about the uncontrollable inputs that drive the system weather in the present case the present study focused on this issue namely dealing explicitly with the imperfectness of the weather forecasts in a stochastic fashion in terms of the information required from the farmer in order to implement a stochastic model based approach rather than a deterministic one the change would be minimal in particular the same basic input information would be required namely the field location crop type and preferably soil profile most of the changes would occur behind the scene unbeknownst to the farmer and without requiring his involvement rather than accessing a single weather forecast as in the deterministic case the platform would access a forecasts ensemble a common product of weather forecasting services or use several years of historical records as forecasts surrogates as done in the example above or a combination of both the farmer s involvement would be required only in order to define the criterion for selecting the decision for implementation step v in fig 1 which should be done at least once at the beginning of the season however as noted above the farmer would have access to the expected outcome of all the scenarios that were investigated and although this is not strictly required he she should be encouraged to review the platform recommendations in a critical fashion taking into account factors not included in the automated analysis compared to the deterministic approach the main drawback of the stochastic approach is its high computational cost whereas the deterministic approach requires solving the optimization problem defined in eq 1 only once at each decision point and could provide recommendations in a virtually instantaneous fashion straightforward implementation of the stochastic approach would require solving the same problem n s n s times 225 times in the example above the by passing procedure described above reduced this number by about half but the computing burden was still far from being comparable to that of the deterministic approach whether this additional complexity is justified in economic terms will have to be determined on a location crop combination basis still considering that the whole procedure runs unattended this is not a concern for the end user but rather for the service provider who should make sure that adequate computing resources are available if the platform is to provide the service to a large number of clients finally it must be noted that although this study was conducted having in mind farmers as end users the proposed approach could potentially be of interest for water managing authorities as well in this case the procedure could be used to estimate the water requirements of various crops under different weather scenarios assuming that all farmers would manage irrigation according to some pre defined strategy the computations could be repeated several times during the season not necessarily linked to specific crop developmental stages in order to reassess water requirements forecasts taking into account actual past weather and water use clearly this would be possible only for crops for which suitable models are available which unfortunately does not include tree crops at the moment furthermore having to perform the computations for a large number of crop soil combinations would present significant computational challenges that will need to be addressed in future studies 5 conclusion a scheme for applying two stage explicit stochastic optimization to seasonal irrigation scheduling has been developed and illustrated for a maize crop modeled with dssat this approach yielded consistently results that were very close to truly optimal results i e results that could have been obtained if perfect weather forecasts were available at the beginning of the season these results were better than those obtained with a deterministic approach that relied on the same data and decision rules but considered only a single weather forecast consisting of the previous 15 years average however these improved results came at the expense of a significant increase of the computation burden the trade off between improved performance in terms of irrigation management and yield on the one hand and computation burden on the other hand will be a function of the crop and location weather variability and deciding whether the improved performance is worth the additional burden will have to be determined on a case by case basis regardless of the improved performance in terms of yield a main advantage of the stochastic approach is that since the irrigation schedule for implementation is selected from an ensemble of solutions it is possible to develop a selection strategy that mimics farmers traditional selection strategy this could prove a key factor toward the adoption of decision support tools that involve model based optimization funding the

irrigation management the ones relevant to the present work being irrigation events on specific dates supplied by the user d mode or irrigation triggered at specific thresholds in the later case the amount of water supplied at each irrigation can be set a priori w mode or calculated to replenish soil water to a desired level p mode in both cases a specific irrigation threshold can be supplied for each growth stage this work used a slightly modified version of dssat provided by dr c porter in which user specified irrigation events and irrigation thresholds can be combined in p mode or w mode in this version the irrigation thresholds are ignored until the last user supplied irrigation event afterward irrigation is determined automatically based on the thresholds as in regular p and w modes since in dssat each threshold is associated with a specific growth stage but the optimization performed in this study was not restricted to take place at the beginning of growth stages a dummy 1 mm irrigation event was included on the day preceding the optimization day d o p t unless an actual irrigation event took place on that day in this manner the actual irrigation events were used until day d o p t 1 while irrigation thresholds were used for the rest of the season this is illustrated in fig a1 which shows an excerpt of a dssat snx file used for optimization on day 189 40 mm irrigation events were implemented on specific days until day 186 a dummy irrigation event was introduced on day 188 and starting on day 189 40 mm irrigation events were generated automatically according to the thresholds defined under the n irrigation header the dummy irrigation event was deleted after completing the optimization

applied by drip fertigation no n as the control ck on grain yield water use efficiency wue n use efficiency nue and n loss in wheat and maize a total of 250 kg n ha 1 and 205 5 kg n ha 1 were split into six and four applications and applied by drip fertigation at key growth stages during the wheat and maize growing seasons respectively the results showed that urea and calcium nitrate produced higher yields p 0 05 than ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate in the first year of the study in both wheat and maize whereas in subsequent years ammonium sulfate increased the yield of wheat by 11 3 25 1 13 7 46 1 and 16 4 32 7 compared with urea ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate respectively urea and ammonium sulfate averagely produced higher maize yields than ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate but no significant difference in maize yield was found between urea and ammonium sulfate similar trends in wue and nue were recorded in both crops ammonium sulfate contributed to higher wue and nue in wheat compared to the other n fertilizers except in the first year while urea contributed to higher wue and nue in maize the total apparent n loss in urea was 13 9 15 4 and 15 8 lower p 0

maize is mainly practiced in a cereal cultivation area of 30 million ha in the north china plain ncp that contributes 50 and 33 of the total wheat and maize production in china respectively wang et al

than 20 years of learning training and demonstration the application area of drip irrigation has increased dramatically from approximately 1 9 104 ha to 527 0 104 ha from 1991 to 2015 fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2012 icid international commission on irrigation and drainage 2018 currently it is becoming a common practice for field crops in china because of its high potential for enhancing water and n use efficiency the chinese government also advocated extending drip fertigation from cash crops to staple foods such as wheat and maize especially in the ncp mara 2016 n is an element that is most frequently applied in the drip irrigation system the principal sources of n for fertigation are urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate calcium nitrate and so on goyal 2013 most previous studies have focused on the comparison of nitrate and ammonium sources under broadcast application or in hydroponic culture conditions carlisle et al 2012 wang et al 2015 although some studies conducted in the ncp have reported the responses of wheat to nitrate n and ammonium n wang et al 2015 2016 all these researchers used the conventional surface application method while quaggio et al 2014 showed that the application of nutrients via fertigation alters the dynamics of n fertilizers applied to the soil compared to the conventional application practice in nonfertigated wheat to an extent that could drastically affect the reactions of nutrient ions in the soil laher and avnimelech 1980 for instance the conversion of nh4 to no3 under drip fertigation in the soil does not occur to the same extent as observed in traditional production systems where fertilizers are broadcast onto the soil surface souza et al 2006 thus the ways in which n forms under drip fertigation affect grain yield wue nue and n loss under field conditions are not fully understood given these considerations a four year field experiment was conducted in the ncp four n

september 2014 and 3 october 2015 at a seeding rate of 300 kg ha 1 with 0 15 m row spacing after harvesting the winter wheat the summer maize cultivar zhengdan 958 was sown in the same permanent plots at a density of 55 000 plants ha 1 on 28 june 2013 13 june 2014 and 15 june 2015 the crop varieties and planting densities were selected according to local agricultural practices in this area pesticides and herbicides were applied as needed 2 3 irrigation and fertilization the surface drip fertigation system consisted of independent lateral drip pipes netaﬁm inc israel a sand filter a

n 11 8 mg l 1 total phosphorus p 6 7 mg l 1 and total arsenic as 0 06 mg l 1 all the treatments were designed to have the same irrigation schedule in this study i e all treatment plots received the same volume of irrigation water at the same time based on the crop growth stage and the soil water content status we used a plot from the urea treatment to monitor the soil water status to determine the amount of dripped water calculated as follows chen et al 1995 1 i h θ u p θ 0 p w η where i is the application amount mm h is the target depth of soil wetting layer mm θup is the volumetric water

is the percentage of wetted area 60 and η η is the application efficiency 90 p and k in the form single superphosphate and potassium sulfate were applied as basal fertilizers by manual broadcasting on the soil surface at typical local rates 165 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 165 kg k2o ha 1 for winter wheat and 67 5 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 67 5 kg k2o ha 1 for summer maize respectively to all treatments prior to planting in each season the local farmers practice was set at a single or twice fertilization rate of 325 kg n ha 1 and 263 kg n ha 1 before planting or jointing for wheat and maize respectively which is typical for the study region ju et al 2009 under drip fertigation a 30 reduction in the n fertilizer level in this region can still maintain high crop yields because of higher water and n use efficiencies zhang et al 2019 therefore n in the form of urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate was dissolved in irrigation water and applied through the surface drip fertigation system at 250 kg n ha 1 and 205 5 kg n ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively for all the n fertilized treatments the proportions of total n fertilizer applied at each key growth stage were as follows yu 2003 8 seedling 14 tillering 13 overwintering 13 regreening 37 jointing and 15 heading in the wheat season and 10 seedling 35 jointing 35 tasseling and 20 grain filling in the maize season the specific n amount and irrigation volume applied to each treatment at the different growth stages were given in table 2 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 yield and yield attributes the wheat grain yield was determined from three separate sampling areas each 1 m2 in the middle of each plot the grains were oven dried and weighed after threshing by hand the kernel number per ear was also counted the number of ears in wheat was recorded at maturity in two adjoining rows of 1 m in length at two randomly selected spots within each plot and the data are recorded as ear density ha 1 the maize grain yield was determined by harvesting all plants at maturity within a sampling area of 5 m along a row in length 1 8 m in width four rows at the center of each plot twenty plants in each plot were chosen for the determination of the following parameters mean weight of 1000 seeds mean number of rows per cob and mean number of kernels per row 2 4 2 plant analysis for n at maturity three rows of wheat plants with a length of 0 2 m were randomly selected from each plot and separated into culms leaves and grain at maize harvest five plants from each plot were sampled and separated into culms

content the upper profile of soil is the main root distribution area wang et al 2014 therefore four soil samples 15 cm increments from 0 to 60 cm were taken in each plot before planting and after harvest and returned to the lab for analysis these samples were sealed immediately in separate marked plastic bags before determining the soil water and the no3 n and nh4 n contents the fresh soil samples were thoroughly mixed and the soil gravimetric moisture contents were measured by oven drying at 105 c for 24 h the soil nitrate n was extracted from 10 g subsamples ground to pass through a 2

statistical analyses the effects of drip fertigation with different n forms on grain yield yield components water utilization and n balance were analyzed by analysis of variance anova using the glm procedure in sas version 9 2 software sas institute 2010 two way anova was used to investigate the interaction between fertilizer treatment and year the differences were analyzed by the least

the three seasons the grain yield of maize receiving urea was 7 8 2 8 and 3 7 higher than that of ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate respectively but the difference between urea and ammonium sulfate was not significant p 0 05 n fertilizer significantly p 0 0001 affected three of the yield components ear number kernel number per ear and 1000 kernel weight table 3 in the winter wheat season the 4 year average ear number and kernel number per ear significantly decreased by 24 3 26 9 and 34 9 41 6 respectively in the ck treatment compared to those in the fertilized treatments the 4 year average 1000 kernel weight of ammonium sulfate was 7 4 6 9 6 6 and 2 3 higher than that of ck urea ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate respectively while the difference between ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate was not significant for summer maize the fertilized treatments significantly increased the 3 year average kernel number per ear ear number and 1000 kernel weight by 3 8 9 4 7 6 11 8 and 5 7 7 5 respectively compared to those in ck 3 2 water use efficiency the wues of winter wheat and summer maize were significantly influenced p 0 0001 by n fertilizer year and the interaction between year and n fertilizer table 4 during the winter wheat season the wue under all the fertilized treatments ranged from 5 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 20 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the wue of the ck treatment was significantly lower than those of fertilized treatments except for that receiving ammonium nitrate in 2015 2016 table 4 the urea and calcium nitrate treatments achieved the highest wues at 8 1 and 8 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively in the 2012 2013 growing season whereas ammonium sulfate achieved the highest wues at 16 0 20 0 and 15 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively during the summer maize season the wues of all the treatments were highest in 2014 followed by those in 2015 and the wues were lowest in 2013 compared with ck urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate increased the wue of maize by 38 2 48 0 6 7 34 4 14 8 40 4 and 20 5 32 5 respectively during 2013 2015 among the n fertilizer treatments urea attained the highest wue in the three years but there were no significant differences between urea ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate in 2015 3 3 nitrogen use efficiency both the ren and aen of wheat were significantly affected p 0 01 by the n fertilizer the year and the interaction between year and n fertilizer table 5 the ren and aen of wheat in 2014 2015 were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in other years across the four growing seasons the ren and aen of wheat were significantly higher in the urea and ammonium sulfate treatments than in the ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate treatments for summer maize the urea treatment also achieved the highest annual average ren and aen while no significant difference was found with calcium nitrate and ammonium sulfate respectively the ren and aen of maize in 2013 were significantly lower than those in other years except in the ammonium nitrate treatment the ren of maize was significantly affected p 0 05 by n fertilizer and year but not by the year and n fertilizer interaction the aen was significantly affected p 0 01 by n fertilizer year and the interaction between year and n fertilizer table 5 3 4 nitrogen balance in all growth seasons of wheat the largest n input factor was fertilizer application except in 2013 2014 when the input of n through the previous maize residues 236 0 352 4 kg n ha 1 exceeded the amount of n applied through fertilizer the highest total n input was observed in the winter wheat vegetation period of 2013 2014 under urea treatment when a maximum input of 553 5 kg n ha 1 was brought into the field the maximum n output was determined to be 431 2 kg n ha 1 for urea treatment in the winter wheat period of 2015 2016 the minimum n output was determined to be 80 8 kg n ha 1 for ck in the winter wheat period of 2015 2016 in the 2012 2013 wheat growth season the apparent n losses in the ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate treatments were significantly higher than those in the following winter wheat seasons except for ammonium sulfate in 2013 2014 fig 4 the largest apparent n loss in urea occurred in the 2013 2014 wheat growth season while the lowest value was found in 2015 2016 during the 2015 2016 winter wheat growing season the apparent n losses amounted to only 4 7 and 21 0 kg n ha 1 in urea and ammonium sulfate treatments respectively but increased to 199 4 and 137 7 kg n ha 1 for ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate treatments respectively fig 4 for summer maize fertilizers were the main source of n input accounting for 43 6 48 2 of the total n inputs in addition to fertilizer n mineralization was also a significant input in the first period of summer maize in 2013 the apparent net n mineralization rate was highest at 230 5 kg n ha 1 but was reduced in the following periods showing rates of 116 5 and 119 7 kg n ha 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the apparent n losses in urea and ammonium sulfate treatments increased over the years and their largest n losses were observed in 2015 while the largest n losses in ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate treatments occurred in 2014 after three cycles of the rotation 2012 2015 the total apparent n loss in urea treatments was 13 9 15 4 and 15 8 lower than that of ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate treatment respectively p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 impact of n fertilizer form on grain yield and wue as no3 has been reported as the preferred mineral n source for wheat and maize anderson et al 1991 liu et al 2019 providing an n supply that is predominantly no3 has been hypothesized as a means of increasing n recovery and crop yield however conflicting results such as greater yields and biomass under mixed n nutrition than under either nh4 or no3 alone wang and below 1995 have also been reported our results showed that the wheat yield under ammonium sulfate treatment was greater than that of the other three n fertilization treatments while the maize yields under urea and ammonium sulfate treatments were higher than those of the other two n fertilization treatments during the seven consecutive growing seasons these different results demonstrated that the concept of n source preference cannot be easily defined but depends on the crop genotype e g rooting architecture relationships with rhizospheric microorganisms root uptake kinetics transport and storage in plant cells and assimilation capacity to no3 and environment factors e g temperature ph humidity and relative abundances of n forms boudsocq et al 2012 and is valid only for the combination of conditions under which n was experimentally applied including the plant variety and the developmental stage britto and kronzucker 2013 for example spratt and gasser 1970 suggest that in semiarid climates ammoniacal n fertilizer for wheat may be as good as or better than nitrate but in humid climates nitrates may be better provided they are not lost by leaching or denitrification the reason for these different effects may be related to the plant metabolism the energy utilized for n assimilation inside the plant the rhizosphere ph and the possible solubilization of other minerals in the soil houlton et al 2007 showed that some tropical plant species can switch their dominant n source nh4 no3 or dissolved organic n in response to changes in precipitation by taking up the most available form of n in our study the differences in weather conditions and planting time in these four years may be the reasons for the variations in yield in the 1st season the planting times for wheat and maize were in late october and june respectively which negatively affected seed germination for winter wheat the highest yields occurred in the 3rd season when the mean temperature was highest 9 31 c while the lowest yields occurred in the 1st season when the mean temperature was lowest 6 93 c lower temperatures lead to the lower total production of tillers in winter wheat meanwhile the rainfall in april and may during the 3rd season was higher than that in the 1st 2nd and 4th seasons which contributed to wheat growth at the reviving and elongation stages and to yield formation at the grain filling stage previous experiments conducted in the ncp have shown that the wheat responses to nitrate n were much better and the yield increase from nitrate n was much higher than that from ammonium n under conventional surface application wang et al 2015 these findings that differ from our results may be explained by the different distribution of ammonium ions in the space of the plant roots between the two n fertilizer application methods marschner 1995 indeed some researchers laher and avnimelech 1980 have observed that nitrification can be inhibited in the saturated zone immediately below the emitter which can result in significant fertigated ammonium accumulation below the emitter additionally previous research doerge and gardner 1985 found that acidification prolonged the use of ammonium containing or ammonium forming fertilizers these effects can be magnified under fertigation because the fertilizer application is concentrated in relatively small volumes of soil rather than being evenly spread over the soil surface on the other hand the decline in soil ph associated with the application of ammonium sulfate might favor nutrient availability and uptake by plants in slightly alkaline soils ph 8 8 in this experimental site gülser 2005 while the application of urea may not be suitable for wheat cultivation under sandy soil conditions elwan and abd el hamed 2011 the higher maize yield in urea treatment may be related to the higher urea hydrolysis rate in summer the two crops also differed in the response of their yield components to the n form for wheat the enhanced kernel weight was the main component for higher yields under ammonium sulfate treatment similar results were also reported by haynes and gob 1978 who observed that ammonium nutrition can stimulate flowering li et al 2013 also found that wheat mainly takes up nh4 n after flowering therefore ammonium could play a critical role in improving the plant growth rate at the grain filling stage and enhancing the accumulation and distribution of shoot biomass leading to increased grain yield ma et al 2015 under drip fertigation however the kernel numbers of maize were relatively higher in the urea and ammonium sulfate treatment than that of the other two n fertilizer treatments in addition our results showed that ammonium sulfate increased the wue of wheat by 11 2 25 5 and 12 4 respectively compared with urea ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate for maize urea increased wue by 16 2 10 5 and 11 2 respectively compared with ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate the differences in wheat wue among different n fertilizer treatments were due to the relatively higher evapotranspiration of amide fed wheat as well as the relatively higher grain yield of ammonium fed wheat in maize these differences were due to a relatively lower evapotranspiration by amide fed maize as well as a relatively higher grain yield by ammonium fed maize 4 2 impact of n fertilizer forms on n loss and nue nue can vary depending on the form of n taken up and utilized thus to maximize nue a thorough understanding of the effects of the different forms of n on crop plants and n loss is required ammoniacal forms can cause soil acidification which in turn limits nitrification and therefore increases nh4 availability in the soil souza et al 2012 as a result a greater absorption of nh4 by the plant occurs after fertigation with ammoniacal n forms neilsen et al 1993 the long term nutrition of plants with nh4 is assumed to be ensured by high concentrations of nh4 that inhibit nitrification wetselaar et al 1972 petersen et al 2004 our results also showed that both urea and ammonium sulfate averagely produced higher ren and aen of wheat and aen of maize than ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate due to the higher crop n uptake and lower n loss our results indicated that in average the wheat n uptake of urea and ammonium sulfate treatments were 169 9 kg n ha 1 and 179 3 kg n ha 1 respectively which were higher than that of ammonium nitrate 139 9 kg n ha 1 and calcium nitrate 151 6 kg n ha 1 treatments while the n loss of urea 170 6 kg n ha 1 and ammonium sulfate treatments 127 8 kg n ha 1 during the wheat growing season were lower than that of ammonium nitrate 185 5 kg n ha 1 and calcium nitrate 185 2 kg n ha 1 treatments this may be due to the inhibition of nitrification by ammonium sulfate and urea fertilizers under the fertigation another possible explanation for the relatively lower n losses under ammonium sulfate and urea treatments might be that the plants may take up nh4 more efficiently than no3 resulting in a low no3 concentration in subsoil under ammonium sulfate and urea treatments piwpuan et al 2013 therefore the high retention time of nh4 in the soil may delay the immediate transformation into no3 by nitrifying bacteria and reduce the potential n losses from leaching ippolito et al 2011 resulting in a higher nue for maize fertigation with urea averagely increased n uptake by 16 2 12 6 7 3 and reduced n loss by 72 2 77 3 and 68 5 compared with ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate treatments respectively however the maize n loss of ammonium sulfate treatment average of 142 0 kg n ha 1 was much higher than that of urea 32 3 kg n ha 1 ammonium nitrate 116 1 kg n ha 1 and calcium nitrate 102 5 kg n ha 1 treatments the increase in n loss of ammonium sulfate could be due to the loss of nh3 by volatilization at increasing temperature in summer paramasivam and alva 1997 in our study ren of wheat and maize were averagely 37 0 96 3 and 15 4 92 3 higher than that of conventionally fertilized wheat 0 27 kg kg 1 and maize 0 13 kg kg 1 in the ncp respectively hartmann et al 2015 for winter wheat the ren on average ranged from 0 37 to 0 53 kg kg 1 while among all fertilized treatments the ren under ammonium sulfate treatment showed the maximum fluctuation ranging from 0 21 kg kg 1 1st season to 0 90 kg kg 1 3rd season this variation in ren with the use of ammonium sulfate could be explained in terms of differences in the n loss varying from 4 5 kg n ha 1 3rd season to 260 2 kg n ha 1 1st season which was possibly caused by variance in the climate condition for summer maize the high mineralization of n was observed in the ck treatment during the summer maize growing season fig 4 this may be the reason for the high maize n uptake in the ck treatment resulting in the relatively low ren of all fertilized treatments especially in the 1st season this finding is in accordance with the previous studies ladha et al 2005 hartmann et al 2015 according to the above mentioned as a possible alternative n source to urea for drip fertigated wheat ammonium sulfate shows great profit in terms of grain yield and n use efficiency additionally the price of ammonium sulfate is almost the same with urea per unit n so it is likely that ammonium sulfate will be widely used in drip fertigation systems in the ncp because farmers would not suffer the financial loss by using this environment friendly fertilizer 5 conclusion in summary both n form and year significantly affect p 0 05 yield and yield components as well as water and n use efficiencies in drip fertigated wheat and maize the average yields of wheat and maize were increased by ammonium sulfate in this study but in differing ways wheat responded to ammonium sulfate by producing higher kernel weight while maize produced more kernels beneficial environmental effects higher resource use efficiency and higher crop yields were achieved sustainably in ammonium sulfate and urea for wheat and maize respectively over the 4 year study period these results have important implications for agriculture in the ncp where the intensive agriculture system requires urgent improvements declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10411,fertigated areas of wheat and maize in the north china plain ncp have grown rapidly during recent years but little information is available on the effects of different nitrogen n fertilizers applied through drip fertigation on wheat and maize a field experiment was conducted in the ncp during 2012 2016 to evaluate the effects of urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate applied by drip fertigation no n as the control ck on grain yield water use efficiency wue n use efficiency nue and n loss in wheat and maize a total of 250 kg n ha 1 and 205 5 kg n ha 1 were split into six and four applications and applied by drip fertigation at key growth stages during the wheat and maize growing seasons respectively the results showed that urea and calcium nitrate produced higher yields p 0 05 than ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate in the first year of the study in both wheat and maize whereas in subsequent years ammonium sulfate increased the yield of wheat by 11 3 25 1 13 7 46 1 and 16 4 32 7 compared with urea ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate respectively urea and ammonium sulfate averagely produced higher maize yields than ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate but no significant difference in maize yield was found between urea and ammonium sulfate similar trends in wue and nue were recorded in both crops ammonium sulfate contributed to higher wue and nue in wheat compared to the other n fertilizers except in the first year while urea contributed to higher wue and nue in maize the total apparent n loss in urea was 13 9 15 4 and 15 8 lower p 0 05 than those in ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate after three cycles of the rotation 2012 2015 respectively considering both yield and nue and based on the results of apparent n loss for the four n fertilizers under field conditions ammonium sulfate was recommended as the superior n source for wheat under drip fertigation while urea was the optimal n source for maize under drip fertigation keywords ammonium nitrate urea preferential nitrogen fertilizer nitrogen loss 1 introduction an intensive double cropping system of flood irrigated winter wheat and rain fed summer

irrigation water use lamm et al 1995 lamm and trooien 2003 and n fertilizer need lamm et al 2001 modernized drip fertigation was brought to china from developed countries in the early 1990s after more than 20 years of learning training and demonstration the application area of drip irrigation has increased dramatically from approximately 1 9 104 ha to 527 0 104 ha from 1991 to 2015 fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2012 icid international commission on irrigation and drainage 2018 currently it is becoming a common practice for field crops in china because of its high potential for enhancing water and n use efficiency the chinese government also advocated extending drip fertigation from cash crops to staple foods such as wheat and maize especially in the ncp mara 2016 n is an element that is most frequently applied in the drip irrigation system the principal sources of n for fertigation are urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate calcium nitrate and so on goyal 2013 most previous studies have focused on the comparison of nitrate and ammonium sources under broadcast application or in hydroponic culture conditions carlisle et al 2012 wang et al 2015 although some studies conducted in the ncp have reported the responses of wheat to nitrate n and ammonium n wang et al 2015 2016 all these researchers used the conventional surface application method while quaggio et al 2014 showed that the application of nutrients via fertigation alters the dynamics of n fertilizers applied to the soil compared to the conventional application practice in nonfertigated wheat to an extent that could drastically affect the reactions of nutrient ions in the soil laher and avnimelech 1980 for instance the conversion of nh4 to no3 under drip fertigation in the soil does not occur to the same extent as observed in traditional production systems where fertilizers are broadcast onto the soil surface souza et al 2006 thus the ways in which n forms under drip fertigation affect grain yield wue nue and n loss under field conditions are not fully understood given these considerations a four year field experiment was conducted in the ncp four n fertilizers urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate were applied by using drip fertigation at key growth stages during seven consecutive growing seasons from 2012 2016 and a non nitrogen drip irrigation was used as a control the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the effect of different n fertilizers on the grain yield wue nue and n loss under drip fertigation in the ncp during the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons and ii determine the optimal n fertilization form for winter wheat and summer maize under drip fertigation in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and conditions field experiments on the winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l system were conducted for seven consecutive growing seasons 2012 2016 at

forms of n fertilizers urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate calcium nitrate and a control no n fertilizer application ck the experimental treatment plots with three replications were arranged in a randomized block design each individual plot was 42 m2 6 7 m and the plots were separated by 2 m wide buffers the winter wheat cultivar langyan43 was planted on 17 october 2012 6 october 2013 29 september 2014 and 3 october 2015 at a seeding rate of 300 kg ha 1 with 0 15 m row spacing after harvesting the winter wheat the summer maize cultivar zhengdan 958 was sown in the same permanent plots at a density of 55 000 plants ha 1 on 28 june 2013 13 june 2014 and 15 june 2015 the crop varieties and planting densities were selected according to local agricultural practices in this area pesticides and herbicides were applied as needed 2 3 irrigation and fertilization the surface drip fertigation system consisted of independent lateral drip pipes netaﬁm inc israel a sand filter a screen filter a flow meter a control valve and a liquamatic piston fertilizer pump mixrite 2504h tefen israel to control the n and water application lateral drip pipes with in line emitters drippers of 1 9 l h 1 flow rate at 0 3 m apart spaced at 0 6 m intervals were laid parallel to the crop rows the layout of the drip fertigation system was given in fig 2 the source of irrigation was good

n 11 8 mg l 1 total phosphorus p 6 7 mg l 1 and total arsenic as 0 06 mg l 1 all the treatments were designed to have the same irrigation schedule in this study i e all treatment plots received the same volume of irrigation water at the same time based on the crop growth stage and the soil water content status we used a plot from the urea treatment to monitor the soil water status to determine the amount of dripped water calculated as follows chen et al 1995 1 i h θ u p θ 0 p w η where i is the application amount mm h is the target depth of soil wetting layer mm θup is the volumetric water

is the percentage of wetted area 60 and η η is the application efficiency 90 p and k in the form single superphosphate and potassium sulfate were applied as basal fertilizers by manual broadcasting on the soil surface at typical local rates 165 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 165 kg k2o ha 1 for winter wheat and 67 5 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 67 5 kg k2o ha 1 for summer maize respectively to all treatments prior to planting in each season the local farmers practice was set at a single or twice fertilization rate of 325 kg n ha 1 and 263 kg n ha 1 before planting or jointing for wheat and maize respectively which is typical for the study region ju et al 2009 under drip fertigation a 30 reduction in the n fertilizer level in this region can still maintain high crop yields because of higher water and n use efficiencies zhang et al 2019 therefore n in the form of urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate was dissolved in irrigation water and applied through the surface drip fertigation system at 250 kg n ha 1 and 205 5 kg n ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively for all the n fertilized treatments the proportions of total n fertilizer applied at each key growth stage were as follows yu 2003 8 seedling 14 tillering 13 overwintering 13 regreening 37 jointing and 15 heading in the wheat season and 10 seedling 35 jointing 35 tasseling and 20 grain filling in the maize season the specific n amount and irrigation volume applied to each treatment at the different growth stages were given in table 2 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 yield and yield attributes the wheat grain yield was determined from three separate sampling areas each 1 m2 in the middle of each plot the grains were oven dried and weighed after threshing by hand the kernel number per ear was also counted the number of ears in wheat was recorded at maturity in two adjoining rows of 1 m in length at two randomly selected spots within each plot and the data are recorded as ear density ha 1 the maize grain yield was determined by harvesting all plants at maturity within a sampling area of 5 m along a row in length 1 8 m in width four rows at the center of each plot twenty plants in each plot were chosen for the determination of the following parameters mean weight of 1000 seeds mean number of rows per cob and mean number of kernels per row 2 4 2 plant analysis for n at maturity three rows of wheat plants with a length of 0 2 m were randomly selected from each plot and separated into culms leaves and grain at maize harvest five plants from each plot were sampled and separated into culms leaves cobs subtending leaves and grain the samples were heated to 105 c for 30 min dried at 75 c for 48 h to a constant weight and then weighed and ground to pass through a 0 25 mm sieve to measure the n concentrations the total n in the plant dry matter was determined using the micro kjeldahl method after digestion in a mixture of concentrated h2so4 and h2o2 2 4 3 soil water and nitrate n content the upper profile of soil is the main root distribution area wang et al 2014 therefore four soil samples 15 cm increments from 0 to 60 cm were taken in each plot before planting and after harvest and returned to the lab for analysis these samples were sealed immediately in separate marked plastic bags before determining the soil water and the no3 n and nh4 n contents the fresh soil samples were thoroughly mixed and the soil gravimetric moisture contents were measured by oven drying at 105 c for 24 h the soil nitrate n was extracted from 10 g subsamples ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve using 50 ml of 2 mol l 1 kcl solution and shaking for 1 h after filtration the extracts were tested immediately to determine the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations using a continuous flow analyzer aa3 bran luebbe germany 2 4 4 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency the evapotranspiration of the crop was calculated using the following equation zhang et al 2017 2 e t c i p δ s r d

statistical analyses the effects of drip fertigation with different n forms on grain yield yield components water utilization and n balance were analyzed by analysis of variance anova using the glm procedure in sas version 9 2 software sas institute 2010 two way anova was used to investigate the interaction between fertilizer treatment and year the differences were analyzed by the least

the three seasons the grain yield of maize receiving urea was 7 8 2 8 and 3 7 higher than that of ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate respectively but the difference between urea and ammonium sulfate was not significant p 0 05 n fertilizer significantly p 0 0001 affected three of the yield components ear number kernel number per ear and 1000 kernel weight table 3 in the winter wheat season the 4 year average ear number and kernel number per ear significantly decreased by 24 3 26 9 and 34 9 41 6 respectively in the ck treatment compared to those in the fertilized treatments the 4 year average 1000 kernel weight of ammonium sulfate was 7 4 6 9 6 6 and 2 3 higher than that of ck urea ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate respectively while the difference between ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate was not significant for summer maize the fertilized treatments significantly increased the 3 year average kernel number per ear ear number and 1000 kernel weight by 3 8 9 4 7 6 11 8 and 5 7 7 5 respectively compared to those in ck 3 2 water use efficiency the wues of winter wheat and summer maize were significantly influenced p 0 0001 by n fertilizer year and the interaction between year and n fertilizer table 4 during the winter wheat season the wue under all the fertilized treatments ranged from 5 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 20 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the wue of the ck treatment was significantly lower than those of fertilized treatments except for that receiving ammonium nitrate in 2015 2016 table 4 the urea and calcium nitrate treatments achieved the highest wues at 8 1 and 8 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively in the 2012 2013 growing season whereas ammonium sulfate achieved the highest wues at 16 0 20 0 and 15 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively during the summer maize season the wues of all the treatments were highest in 2014 followed by those in 2015 and the wues were lowest in 2013 compared with ck urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate increased the wue of maize by 38 2 48 0 6 7 34 4 14 8 40 4 and 20 5 32 5 respectively during 2013 2015 among the n fertilizer treatments urea attained the highest wue in the three years but there were no significant differences between urea ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate in 2015 3 3 nitrogen use efficiency both the ren and aen of wheat were significantly affected p 0 01 by the n fertilizer the year and the interaction between year and n fertilizer table 5 the ren and aen of wheat in 2014 2015 were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in other years across the four growing seasons the ren and aen of wheat were significantly higher in the urea and ammonium sulfate treatments than in the ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate treatments for summer maize the urea treatment also achieved the highest annual average ren and aen while no significant difference was found with calcium nitrate and ammonium sulfate respectively the ren and aen of maize in 2013 were significantly lower than those in other years except in the ammonium nitrate treatment the ren of maize was significantly affected p 0 05 by n fertilizer and year but not by the year and n fertilizer interaction the aen was significantly affected p 0 01 by n fertilizer year and the interaction between year and n fertilizer table 5 3 4 nitrogen balance in all growth seasons of wheat the largest n input factor was fertilizer application except in 2013 2014 when the input of n through the previous maize residues 236 0 352 4 kg n ha 1 exceeded the amount of n applied through fertilizer the highest total n input was observed in the winter wheat vegetation period of 2013 2014 under urea treatment when a maximum input of 553 5 kg n ha 1 was brought into the field the maximum n output was determined to be 431 2 kg n ha 1 for urea treatment in the winter wheat period of 2015 2016 the minimum n output was determined to be 80 8 kg n ha 1 for ck in the winter wheat period of 2015 2016 in the 2012 2013 wheat growth season the apparent n losses in the ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate treatments were significantly higher than those in the following winter wheat seasons except for ammonium sulfate in 2013 2014 fig 4 the largest apparent n loss in urea occurred in the 2013 2014 wheat growth season while the lowest value was found in 2015 2016 during the 2015 2016 winter wheat growing season the apparent n losses amounted to only 4 7 and 21 0 kg n ha 1 in urea and ammonium sulfate treatments respectively but increased to 199 4 and 137 7 kg n ha 1 for ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate treatments respectively fig 4 for summer maize fertilizers were the main source of n input accounting for 43 6 48 2 of the total n inputs in addition to fertilizer n mineralization was also a significant input in the first period of summer maize in 2013 the apparent net n mineralization rate was highest at 230 5 kg n ha 1 but was reduced in the following periods showing rates of 116 5 and 119 7 kg n ha 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the apparent n losses in urea and ammonium sulfate treatments increased over the years and their largest n losses were observed in 2015 while the largest n losses in ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate treatments occurred in 2014 after three cycles of the rotation 2012 2015 the total apparent n loss in urea treatments was 13 9 15 4 and 15 8 lower than that of ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate treatment respectively p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 impact of n fertilizer form on grain yield and wue as no3 has been reported as the preferred mineral n source for wheat and maize anderson et al 1991 liu et al 2019 providing an n supply that is predominantly no3 has been hypothesized as a means of increasing n recovery and crop yield however conflicting results such as greater yields and biomass under mixed n nutrition than under either nh4 or no3 alone wang and below 1995 have also been reported our results showed that the wheat yield under ammonium sulfate treatment was greater than that of the other three n fertilization treatments while the maize yields under urea and ammonium sulfate treatments were higher than those of the other two n fertilization treatments during the seven consecutive growing seasons these different results demonstrated that the concept of n source preference cannot be easily defined but depends on the crop genotype e g rooting architecture relationships with rhizospheric microorganisms root uptake kinetics transport and storage in plant cells and assimilation capacity to no3 and environment factors e g temperature ph humidity and relative abundances of n forms boudsocq et al 2012 and is valid only for the combination of conditions under which n was experimentally applied including the plant variety and the developmental stage britto and kronzucker 2013 for example spratt and gasser 1970 suggest that in semiarid climates ammoniacal n fertilizer for wheat may be as good as or better than nitrate but in humid climates nitrates may be better provided they are not lost by leaching or denitrification the reason for these different effects may be related to the plant metabolism the energy utilized for n assimilation inside the plant the rhizosphere ph and the possible solubilization of other minerals in the soil houlton et al 2007 showed that some tropical plant species can switch their dominant n source nh4 no3 or dissolved organic n in response to changes in precipitation by taking up the most available form of n in our study the differences in weather conditions and planting time in these four years may be the reasons for the variations in yield in the 1st season the planting times for wheat and maize were in late october and june respectively which negatively affected seed germination for winter wheat the highest yields occurred in the 3rd season when the mean temperature was highest 9 31 c while the lowest yields occurred in the 1st season when the mean temperature was lowest 6 93 c lower temperatures lead to the lower total production of tillers in winter wheat meanwhile the rainfall in april and may during the 3rd season was higher than that in the 1st 2nd and 4th seasons which contributed to wheat growth at the reviving and elongation stages and to yield formation at the grain filling stage previous experiments conducted in the ncp have shown that the wheat responses to nitrate n were much better and the yield increase from nitrate n was much higher than that from ammonium n under conventional surface application wang et al 2015 these findings that differ from our results may be explained by the different distribution of ammonium ions in the space of the plant roots between the two n fertilizer application methods marschner 1995 indeed some researchers laher and avnimelech 1980 have observed that nitrification can be inhibited in the saturated zone immediately below the emitter which can result in significant fertigated ammonium accumulation below the emitter additionally previous research doerge and gardner 1985 found that acidification prolonged the use of ammonium containing or ammonium forming fertilizers these effects can be magnified under fertigation because the fertilizer application is concentrated in relatively small volumes of soil rather than being evenly spread over the soil surface on the other hand the decline in soil ph associated with the application of ammonium sulfate might favor nutrient availability and uptake by plants in slightly alkaline soils ph 8 8 in this experimental site gülser 2005 while the application of urea may not be suitable for wheat cultivation under sandy soil conditions elwan and abd el hamed 2011 the higher maize yield in urea treatment may be related to the higher urea hydrolysis rate in summer the two crops also differed in the response of their yield components to the n form for wheat the enhanced kernel weight was the main component for higher yields under ammonium sulfate treatment similar results were also reported by haynes and gob 1978 who observed that ammonium nutrition can stimulate flowering li et al 2013 also found that wheat mainly takes up nh4 n after flowering therefore ammonium could play a critical role in improving the plant growth rate at the grain filling stage and enhancing the accumulation and distribution of shoot biomass leading to increased grain yield ma et al 2015 under drip fertigation however the kernel numbers of maize were relatively higher in the urea and ammonium sulfate treatment than that of the other two n fertilizer treatments in addition our results showed that ammonium sulfate increased the wue of wheat by 11 2 25 5 and 12 4 respectively compared with urea ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate for maize urea increased wue by 16 2 10 5 and 11 2 respectively compared with ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate the differences in wheat wue among different n fertilizer treatments were due to the relatively higher evapotranspiration of amide fed wheat as well as the relatively higher grain yield of ammonium fed wheat in maize these differences were due to a relatively lower evapotranspiration by amide fed maize as well as a relatively higher grain yield by ammonium fed maize 4 2 impact of n fertilizer forms on n loss and nue nue can vary depending on the form of n taken up and utilized thus to maximize nue a thorough understanding of the effects of the different forms of n on crop plants and n loss is required ammoniacal forms can cause soil acidification which in turn limits nitrification and therefore increases nh4 availability in the soil souza et al 2012 as a result a greater absorption of nh4 by the plant occurs after fertigation with ammoniacal n forms neilsen et al 1993 the long term nutrition of plants with nh4 is assumed to be ensured by high concentrations of nh4 that inhibit nitrification wetselaar et al 1972 petersen et al 2004 our results also showed that both urea and ammonium sulfate averagely produced higher ren and aen of wheat and aen of maize than ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate due to the higher crop n uptake and lower n loss our results indicated that in average the wheat n uptake of urea and ammonium sulfate treatments were 169 9 kg n ha 1 and 179 3 kg n ha 1 respectively which were higher than that of ammonium nitrate 139 9 kg n ha 1 and calcium nitrate 151 6 kg n ha 1 treatments while the n loss of urea 170 6 kg n ha 1 and ammonium sulfate treatments 127 8 kg n ha 1 during the wheat growing season were lower than that of ammonium nitrate 185 5 kg n ha 1 and calcium nitrate 185 2 kg n ha 1 treatments this may be due to the inhibition of nitrification by ammonium sulfate and urea fertilizers under the fertigation another possible explanation for the relatively lower n losses under ammonium sulfate and urea treatments might be that the plants may take up nh4 more efficiently than no3 resulting in a low no3 concentration in subsoil under ammonium sulfate and urea treatments piwpuan et al 2013 therefore the high retention time of nh4 in the soil may delay the immediate transformation into no3 by nitrifying bacteria and reduce the potential n losses from leaching ippolito et al 2011 resulting in a higher nue for maize fertigation with urea averagely increased n uptake by 16 2 12 6 7 3 and reduced n loss by 72 2 77 3 and 68 5 compared with ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate treatments respectively however the maize n loss of ammonium sulfate treatment average of 142 0 kg n ha 1 was much higher than that of urea 32 3 kg n ha 1 ammonium nitrate 116 1 kg n ha 1 and calcium nitrate 102 5 kg n ha 1 treatments the increase in n loss of ammonium sulfate could be due to the loss of nh3 by volatilization at increasing temperature in summer paramasivam and alva 1997 in our study ren of wheat and maize were averagely 37 0 96 3 and 15 4 92 3 higher than that of conventionally fertilized wheat 0 27 kg kg 1 and maize 0 13 kg kg 1 in the ncp respectively hartmann et al 2015 for winter wheat the ren on average ranged from 0 37 to 0 53 kg kg 1 while among all fertilized treatments the ren under ammonium sulfate treatment showed the maximum fluctuation ranging from 0 21 kg kg 1 1st season to 0 90 kg kg 1 3rd season this variation in ren with the use of ammonium sulfate could be explained in terms of differences in the n loss varying from 4 5 kg n ha 1 3rd season to 260 2 kg n ha 1 1st season which was possibly caused by variance in the climate condition for summer maize the high mineralization of n was observed in the ck treatment during the summer maize growing season fig 4 this may be the reason for the high maize n uptake in the ck treatment resulting in the relatively low ren of all fertilized treatments especially in the 1st season this finding is in accordance with the previous studies ladha et al 2005 hartmann et al 2015 according to the above mentioned as a possible alternative n source to urea for drip fertigated wheat ammonium sulfate shows great profit in terms of grain yield and n use efficiency additionally the price of ammonium sulfate is almost the same with urea per unit n so it is likely that ammonium sulfate will be widely used in drip fertigation systems in the ncp because farmers would not suffer the financial loss by using this environment friendly fertilizer 5 conclusion in summary both n form and year significantly affect p 0 05 yield and yield components as well as water and n use efficiencies in drip fertigated wheat and maize the average yields of wheat and maize were increased by ammonium sulfate in this study but in differing ways wheat responded to ammonium sulfate by producing higher kernel weight while maize produced more kernels beneficial environmental effects higher resource use efficiency and higher crop yields were achieved sustainably in ammonium sulfate and urea for wheat and maize respectively over the 4 year study period these results have important implications for agriculture in the ncp where the intensive agriculture system requires urgent improvements declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

agricultural production in two case study areas the aspara and isfara river basins the methodology applied is based on analysis of temperature indicators and current cropping calendars in target locations combined with hydrological simulations by the process based soil and water integrated model swim of the two river basins the selected climate change projections comprise the moderate and high emissions scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the results reveal that climate change will create unfavourable conditions for irrigated spring crops due to decrease of discharge during the vegetation period on the other hand the projected shift of peak discharge to an earlier date offers benefits for irrigated winter cereals providing more water for irrigation in spring results suggest that there is an opportunity to adapt the irrigated agricultural production in the selected regions by fitting the cropping calendars to changing vegetation periods and to the timing of peak discharges keywords central asia hydrological modelling climate change adaptation adaptation options irrigated agriculture 1 introduction the agricultural sector in central asia ca is of significant importance for the economies of the region it employs one third to one half depending on the country of the total population and constitutes between 15 25 of gdp of tajikistan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan turkmenistan and 5 of gdp of kazakhstan mpra 2018 in general the temperature conditions in ca are suitable for growing many different crops like wheat corn cotton rice fruits vegetables etc however the agricultural production in this region is constrained by an uneven spatial distribution of water resources ineffective irrigation systems and low productivity of agricultural practices the ca region is one of the most vulnerable to climate change and one of the least studied in this context region in the world the average warming rates in the region are already now exceeding the global average values almost two times ipcc 2014 and the future climate projections suggest further dramatic for some ca sub regions increases in the temperature even under the moderate global warming scenarios hattermann et al subm reyer et al 2017 the impacts of the projected climate change could become an additional stressor next to already existing challenges such as the developing economic state of the countries in the region strong dependence of the economies on scarce and unevenly distributed water resources competition between the countries and different economic sectors for water resources within the region those issues have already hampered economic stability inflamed social unrest and diplomatic tensions in the region and the future projected climatic shifts are likely to have strong negative effects on the food security health and water resources in the region lioubimtseva 2015 the understanding of the past climatic changes and trends in the area including the retreat of glaciers is restricted by the data scarcity in the region especially after the ussr breakdown in 1990 chevallier et al 2014 based on analysis of long term observational time series until 1990 of temperature discharge snow and glacier covers in the mountains of tajikistan reported homogenous rise in temperature and associated changes in the snow cover dynamics in this region bolch 2007 and earlier aizen and aizen 1997 reported an increase of temperatures at the mountainous stations and a decrease of snow resources and glacier extent by more than 30 derived from observations between 1955 1999 in the northern tien shan sorg et al 2012 described the past observed decreases of glaciers in the tien shan mountains and associated with that observed seasonal changes in discharge of several rivers the number of studies looking at the future climate change impacts and in particular climate impacts on agriculture in central asia has been increasing over the last years several recent studies on the impacts of climate change have indicated possible future shifts in the discharge of several central asian rivers associated with the increase in temperatures see agaltseva et al 2011 changkun et al 2015 gan et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2012 radchenko et al 2017 saibnazarova 2015 savitskiy et al 2008 white et al 2014 still there are knowledge gaps on the impacts of climate change on water resources and agricultural activities in the region which consequently lead to a research gap in needed adaptation measures in the region ford et al 2015 one of the recent studies by sommer et al 2013 showed possible increases in wheat yields in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan and tajikistan under projected climate change the authors suggest that adaptive changes in the sowing dates might lead to even further increases in wheat productivity further aleksandrova and gain 2016 showed that proper adaptation policies for land and water management can reduce the vulnerability of a lowland region in uzbekistan to climate change stulina and usmanov 2002 and stulina et al 2019 discussed the potential positive impacts of climate change on the crop yields in central asia through prolongation of the vegetation periods and accelerated accumulation of effective temperatures leading to faster phenological development nevertheless acquiring benefits from prospective positive effects would be only possible upon undertaking properly developed adaptation strategies since the risks associated with heat events may outweigh the positive effects entirely leading to serious losses in the crop yields stulina and usmanov 2002 this study aims at assessing prospective negative impacts but also opportunities for irrigated agricultural production in highland river basins in central asia under moderate rcp4 5 and high emissions rcp8 5 scenarios until the end of the century the selected territories the isfara and aspara river basins represent foothill areas of central asia in terms of cropping patterns and climatic conditions the applied methodology is based on the analysis of projected changes in hydrological and crop relevant temperature indices against current irrigation and cropping calendars in the pilot locations the hydrological indices are represented by the discharge values in a given month and are obtained by the application of an ecohydrological model soil and water integrated model swim krysanova et al 1998 in the aspara and isfara river basins the crop relevant temperature indices are represented by the duration of vegetation periods and by the number of extremely hot days per year which may harm the phenological development and decrease the crop yields 2 case study areas the two pilot territories considered in this study the aspara and isfara river basins are presented in fig 1 the major characteristics of the selected case study areas are summarized in table 1 2 1 aspara river basin the aspara river is a transboundary river shared by kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan it has a length of around 108 km and the catchment area of 1292 km2 with 78 of the catchment area situated on the territory of kazakhstan and 22 on the territory of kyrgyzstan the river is predominantly snow and glacier fed and has an extensive water management infrastructure which includes the big chuiskiy channel and the tarty reservoir carec 2014a the development of the agricultural sector is of a high priority for economies of both countries however in recent years the cropland area in the basin has been decreasing mainly due to an insufficient amount of water for irrigation carec 2014b the crop types grown in the basin differ depending on location however the main part of cropland in both countries is occupied by cereals about 56 following cereals the next important crops occupying large areas are oil and industrial crops the area under corn vegetables and potatoes represent a smaller fraction of arable land in this basin kazakhstan s part of the basin had also seen a growth in sugar beet production over the last years which is supported by subsidies from the state carec 2014b the cereals are irrigated only to 26 of the total cereal area in kazakhstan and to 35 in kyrgyzstan whereas other crops are fully irrigated in both countries the winter cereals in the basin are usually planted in september november the oleiferous crops and spring cereals in april and vegetables in may the irrigation for spring crops usually starts in may june and winter cereals are irrigated in september november and march april only one crop is planted per vegetation season 2 2 isfara river basin isfara is a mesoscale catchment in the basin of the syr darya river shared by kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan and has a total drainage area is about 5000 km2 the mean annual discharge is 15 m3 s and the length of the river is approximately 170 km the river is fed by snow and glacier melt water resources are used primarily for irrigation and domestic water supply the catchment is shared by kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan due to the high seasonality of river flow and extensive irrigational activities there is a wide ranging water management infrastructure with some large water management installations e g the tortkul dam and the big fergana channel carec 2014c approximately 75 of the local population is involved in agricultural production in the tajikistan part 60 of cropland is occupied by cereals and cotton followed by industrial crops vegetables and fruits in the uzbekistan part mainly cereals and cotton are occupying the arable land followed by fruits in the case of kyrgyzstan mainly fruits are produced followed by tilled crops according to estimations up to 80 of cereals and 100 of fruits in the basin are irrigated carec 2014d over the last years there is a tendency to decrease of cropland due to lack of water resources for irrigation e g the cropland area within the catchment belonging to kyrgyzstan has decreased by 2 2 3 data and methods 3 1 the swim model the deterministic eco hydrological process based soil and water integrated model swim was developed based on two previously created models swat arnold et al 1998 and matsalu krysanova et al 1989 and it is described in krysanova et al 1998 the main physical processes of the hydrological cycle and other catchment scale processes vegetation crop growth nutrient cycling and erosion are represented within the model through the three main modules hydrological biogeochemical and plant growth the processes are described using physically based and semi empirical mathematical equations the swim model employs three steps spatial disaggregation scheme river basin subbasins hydrotropes or hydrological response units hrus the model operates on a daily time step and uses climatic land use topographic and soil datasets as input additional integrated modules within the model allow simulating operation of dams and reservoirs within the catchment including simulations of hydropower generation koch et al 2013 irrigation processes huang et al 2015 water re allocation impacts through water transfer infrastructure lobanova et al 2017 and modelling of glaciological processes wortmann et al 2019 3 2 input data for hydrological modelling the following data covering the pilot regions which are needed for set up and application of the swim model were retrieved from the global databases the digital elevation model dem for the isfara and aspara river basins was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar database cgiar csi 2017 the ministry of science and technology of china s land cover dataset contains land cover information over the entire globe with a resolution of 30 x 30 m chen et al 2014 national geomatics center of china 2014 which was used in this study soil information for the pilot territories with a resolution of 1000 x 1000 m was obtained from the harmonized world soil database fao70 hwsd panagos et al 2012 the missing soil parameters which are necessary for swim simulation were estimated using the method of pedotransfer functions the regional or local soil map and parametrization were not available for this study swim uses daily precipitation average minimum and maximum temperatures solar radiation and relative humidity as meteorological input data the watch forcing data based on era 40 reanalysis weedon et al 2010 was used as meteorological input for model calibration and validation as the in situ observations from meteorological stations were absent additionally an advantage of using this data was that the selected for this study climate projections from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip frieler et al 2016 were bias adjusted using watch forcing data no regional discharge data for both river basins were available at the time of the study the database of the global runoff data centre grdc grdc 2017 contained data only for one station in the middle of the isfara catchment tash kurgan which was used for the swim model calibration and validation the data available at this gauging station with the monthly time step embrace the period 1933 1991 for the swim model adjustment the period 1965 1980 was selected and for the model validation the period 1981 1991 was used for the aspara river no observed discharge data were available due to the absence of data on the design and operation of the extended network of irrigational channels and existing reservoirs in both river basins it was not possible to include those into the current swim model set up also the biggest part of extensive irrigation channels and the major reservoir tortkul are located in the downstream section of the isfara river below the tash kurgan gauge see carec 2004a at which the calibration of the model was carried out 3 3 calibration of the swim model the calibration of a hydrological model is needed to adjust the unknown model parameters e g saturated conductivity or snowmelt rates at the next step to ensure that the calibrated values of the unknown parameters are correct the hydrological model validation is performed for another period the swim model for the isfara river basin was calibrated over 1965 1980 and validated over 1981 1991 at the tash kurgan gauging station using the three model performance criteria nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and relative volume error rve rve is a total deviation in the volume of discharged water expressed in percent the nse is an efficiency coefficient which relates a sum of squared differences between the observed and simulated discharges to the variance of the observed discharge the kge efficiency criteria was developed by gupta et al 2009 and provide fitting of the three nse components namely correlation bias and variability between observed and simulated data during the calibration process nine model parameters were adjusted the baseflow factor the evapotranspiration coefficient the routing coefficients for surface and subsurface flow two curve numbers regulating runoff and three snowmelt parameters the threshold temperatures of snowfall and snowmelt and the snowmelt rate due to the absence of observed discharge time series in the aspara river basin it was not possible to perform the calibration validation process for this river basin and the values of unknown parameters were transferred from the isfara river 3 4 climate data the climate data was obtained from the cmip5 climate model intercomparison project phase 5 global climate models gcm simulations which were bias adjusted within the isi mip project further referred to as isi mip scenarios the isi mip scenarios were derived from five cmip5 gcm simulations by bi linear interpolation to the 0 5 degree resolution and bias adjustment to the watch era40 using trend preserving quantile mapping approach hempel et al 2013 the biases in precipitation and temperature between the isi mip scenarios and watch era40 are presented in fig a3 of the supplementary material three future time slices selected for this study are 2011 2040 further referred to as the near future 2041 2070 as intermediate future and 2071 2100 as far future the period between 1981 2000 was selected as a reference period 3 5 data on the crop management patterns the risk and adaptation assessment requires information on major crops their planting and harvesting dates and months when irrigation activities are taking place table a2 of the supplementary material includes such information for the two pilot areas which was supplied by local stakeholders in the case of isfara river no information on the types of fruits their shares and irrigation schedules was available the information available on the aspara basin did not specify types of industrial crops cultivated in the basin therefore the analysis did not cover fruits and industrial plants besides no information on the planting and harvesting dates as well as on the start and end of irrigation activities for cotton was available for the isfara river missing information on cotton planting harvesting dates for the isfara basin was transferred from another region located at the downstream reaches of amu darya river where data was available from the local farmers this information is also provided in table a2 supplementary material 3 6 temperature indicators for estimation of the risks and opportunities for agricultural production associated with changes in temperature the following indicators were selected and calculated for each case study area i starting and ending dates of the vegetation periods for c3 wheat cotton barley beet etc and c4 e g corn sorghum crops ii total duration of the vegetation periods and iii the number of days per year when the daily maximum temperature exceeds 40 c the starting and ending dates of the vegetation period are the onset and the offset date of the period during which the crops can be grown usually it is estimated for c3 crops as the date when the mean daily temperature trespasses the threshold of 5 c for 6 consecutive days the 5 c is an important threshold temperature at which vegetation processes start or end on pastures and major vegetables are being planted in this study also another vegetation period is considered for c4 crops which starts ends at 10 c for 6 consecutive days indicator for the planting of e g sorghum the temperature threshold of 40 c indicates undesirable temperature conditions for crops which can adversely affect plant growth maximum daily temperatures above 40 c can lead to failures in the cotton yield itc 2011 the duration of the vegetation period indicates the number of days per year between the start and the end date of the vegetation period for c3 or c4 crops 3 7 hydrological indicators though some rain fed crop cultivation exists in the study areas the current study focuses on irrigated agriculture the discharge rates of the isfara and aspara river basins during the vegetation period when the water demand for irrigation is highest were selected as hydrological indicators for water availability future changes in the monthly discharge of the focus river basins were obtained from the simulations of the swim model driven by the isi mip climate scenarios the changes were estimated as relative differences expressed as a percentage of change between the long term mean average monthly discharge values in the three future periods to the historical period of climate projections 4 results this section presents the results of the swim model adjustment for the isfara river basin temperature and precipitation projections in the region projections of the selected temperature indicators results of simulation of future discharge patterns in the two river basins and analysis of current cropping and irrigation calendars against projected changes in temperature and discharge 4 1 calibration and validation of the swim model the model calibration validation results for the isfara river basin at the tash kurgan station show a fair approximation of the observed data which is reflected by the nse kge and rve values summarized in table 2 according to the model performance evaluation guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 satisfactory model performance corresponds to nse values between 0 5 and 0 65 and rve 15 and 25 fig 2 presents a comparison of the simulated monthly discharge over the entire period of simulation 1960 1991 and the long term average seasonal dynamics with the observed data at the tash kurgan gauging station within the swim model a basic representation of the glacier processes is included during the calibration phase it was observed that the model is very sensitive to the parametrization of snow glacier melt processes namely the temperature thresholds at which snowfall and snowmelt processes are starting in the model have a strong influence on discharge and timing of peaks one can observe in the seasonal dynamics graphs in fig 2 right that the peak discharge which occurs in july is sharper in the simulated discharge curve than in the observed one besides the snowmelt process is simulated to start earlier and finish earlier by the swim model this indicates that the snowmelt in the model may happen slightly faster than in reality for the aspara river due to the absence of observed discharge data it was decided to apply the same swim parametrization as obtained for the isfara river after calibration of the model 4 2 climate change projections in the case study areas figs 3 and 4 below present the projected anomalies in the annual average precipitation and temperature until the end of the century under two different global warming scenarios for the aspara and isfara river basins under consideration for the aspara basin the multi model means of climate change projections under all emissions scenarios indicate a small increase in precipitation from 2 to 7 5 under the rcp8 5 scenario until the end of the century as presented in fig 3 on the contrary for the isfara river fig 4 the gcm models exhibit no notable changes in precipitation ranging from 2 5 to 4 for the case study areas the temperature increase is projected to reach 6 7 c degrees on average under the high emissions scenario rcp8 5 and up to 3 8 c degrees on average under the moderate global warming scenario rcp4 5 by the end of the century the projected warming rate in the case study areas exceeds the anticipated global temperature growth rate by almost two times the strong warming trends translate directly into the temperature related indicators which are discussed in the next section 4 3 temperature indicators table 3 summarizes the starting and ending dates of the c3 and c4 vegetation period as well as the number of days per year with temperature exceeding the 40 c threshold for the case study locations as indicated by the multi model means under two rcp scenarios and across four time slices due to the projected strong increase in temperature the vegetation periods in the pilot areas are expected to increase in the future in particular the starting date is expected to be shifted to an earlier date and the ending date to a later date towards winter months the magnitude of the anticipated shifts strongly depends on the global warming scenario considered when looking at the far future e g changes under rcp4 5 are less pronounced than those triggered by rcp8 5 scenario the starting dates of the c3 and c4 crops vegetation periods in the aspara river basin are projected to be shifted earlier by 3 days under the rcp4 5 scenario and by 5 8 days under the rcp8 5 scenario in the near future the largest shift by 26 28 days earlier is projected under the rcp8 5 scenario by the end century the vegetation period ending dates show a similar trend in the near future projected shift by 3 4 days to a later date under the moderate climate scenario and by 5 days under the rcp8 5 scenario and in the far future by approximately 10 days under the moderate scenario and 20 to 27 days under the rcp8 5 scenario the starting and ending dates of the vegetation periods of c3 and c4 crops in the isfara river basin are exhibiting similar trends shifts by approximately one month under the high emissions scenario and 15 20 days under the moderate climate scenario in the far future the largest projected shift in the starting date is projected by approximately 43 days for c3 plants and for the ending date the expected shift is up to 32 days by the end of the century under the rcp8 5 scenario given these shifts in the starting and ending dates the total duration of the vegetation period in the case study locations will extend accordingly figs 5 and 6 present the expected duration of the c3 and c4 crops vegetation periods in the isfara river basin by the end of the century under the two climate projections and figs a4 and a5 of the supplementary material present those for the aspara river basin the increase in the duration of the vegetation periods for two locations is portrayed to be substantial under both global warming scenarios by the end of the century reaching more than 300 days per year for c3 plants and more than 250 days per year for c4 plants in the isfara figs 5 and 6 under the rcp8 5 scenario by the end of the century one can observe that the projected increase in the c3 vegetation period is stronger than that for c4 crops under the rcp8 5 climate scenario the number of extreme heat days in the isfara basin may reach up to 46 per year by the end of the century in the aspara river basin the projected increase in the number of days with extreme temperatures is moderate only by 7 days more on average for the far future time slice under the high emissions scenario 4 4 discharge projections figs 7 and 8 depict the simulated by swim changes in the long term mean seasonal discharge patterns of the isfara and aspara basins under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios for three future periods the changes are expressed relative to the reference period i e in of change between the mean values of monthly discharge in the future time slices and the reference period for the aspara river basin the projections indicate increasing discharge up to 50 in april may from the mid future time slice on under rcp4 5 scenario and by almost 100 under the rcp8 5 this is associated with earlier snowmelt in the headwaters part due to increased temperatures due to that the high flow period currently observed in summer will shift towards spring and discharge in july august and september is expected to decrease across all future time slices under both rcps the multi model spread shows the highest values in the far future time slice in particular under rcp8 5 scenario where the deviations of some single model projections from the multi model mean range from 30 to more than 500 for the isfara river the general trend under rcp4 5 indicated by the multi model means is similar to that projected for the aspara river increase in march earlier than for the aspara and decrease all other months as shown in fig 8 the projected discharge under the rcp4 5 scenario shows an increase only for march followed by a decrease for all remaining months in the case of the rcp8 5 scenario a reduction in the discharge volume is simulated along all months and decrease will likely become more pronounced by the end century period the respective uncertainty ranges are becoming higher for the winter months by the end of the century under rcp8 5 overall a decrease in the summer flow is projected to be stronger in the isfara river basin compared to the projections for the aspara basin 4 5 analysis of current irrigation calendars against projected changes in temperature and discharge table 4 compares the current irrigation calendar for the main crops with the projected temporal changes in the rivers discharge and duration of the vegetation period by month for the aspara and isfara basins as discussed in section 4 4 the results of simulations by the process based hydrological model swim driven by different sets of climate scenarios for the aspara and isfara show an increase in discharge in some of the spring months march may and decrease in the summer months june september under all global warming scenarios except for the high emission scenario in the isfara under the rcp8 5 scenario for the isfara river basin an overall decrease in discharge throughout the year is projected looking at the agricultural activities summarized in table a2 according to the available data provided in table a2 of supplementary material one can distinguish two types of cropping patterns in the pilot areas winter crops cereals and spring crops including spring cereals cotton rice vegetables industrial crops and fruits for the winter cereals the irrigation activities start from the time of planting in autumn october november in the aspara and isfara basins stop over wintertime and continue in spring until mid of may according to the local information collected the irrigation of fields under all other crops in the isfara and aspara river basins starts from may june and continues along the vegetation period until the end of august for the cotton planted in isfara the irrigation starts in mid june and continues to the mid of august estimations provided in table 4 suggest that the spring cereals and other crops planted in april may and irrigated in may august will likely adversely affected by climate change this is particularly relevant for cotton which requires irrigation in june august the projected decrease of rivers flow during the intensive irrigation period accompanied by an increase in temperature and hence increased evaporation and transpiration rates would impose challenges to the cultivation of spring crops in both catchments on the contrary the production of winter cereals in both catchments may benefit from the future climate conditions the shift of the discharge peak to an earlier date matches better the irrigation period of winter crops which starts in spring and ends in mid may offering an increased water availability for these crops 5 discussion the assessment of climate impacts in this study was based on the application of the isi mip climate dataset this dataset is characterized by a coarser spatial resolution which may be not sufficient when looking at such rather small catchments as those considered in this study in particular because the isi mip dataset is derived from the gcms simulations with resolution up to 300 km it represents in reality a much coarser resolution than 0 5 degree furthermore the technique used to spatially downscale and bias correct the original gcm simulations may also introduce additional uncertainty from fig a1 in the supplementary material the actual scale mismatch between the spatial resolution of the climate models simulations and the size of the basins under consideration is evident overall the scale mismatch between the resolution of the climate models and the sizes of the pilot areas is probably one of the major sources of uncertainty in this study in the future higher resolution rcm simulations e g from cordex database or more advanced statistical downscaling techniques should be employed to provide climate model projections with finer resolutions on the other hand the performance of the reference dataset watch era40 cannot be judged properly for this area since no observational data were available during the time of this study for direct comparison according to the climate projections the temperature increase in the two study basins is expected to be dramatic reaching up to 6 7 c under the high emissions scenario whilst the precipitation patterns will likely not see strong changes under both rcps such changes will likely lead to an increase in the crop water demands and evapotranspiration rates in the region and hence to a decrease in discharge in lowland areas as discussed by immerzeel et al 2012 the future melting of glaciers associated with higher temperatures may also lead to a temporary increase in the discharge of the central asian rivers by mid century followed by a decrease later by the end of the century as the annual precipitation does not exhibit significant changes in the future the expected changes in hydrological patterns of the isfara and aspara river basins are mainly temperature driven in such cases the application of a hydrological model like in this case swim model is critical as it can represent interplay and feedbacks between different hydrological processes like snowmelt and evapotranspiration at the catchment scale and provide reliable projections on the direction of change in the hydrological cycle even though the swim model showed satisfactory fitting of simulated discharge values to the observed ones during the calibration for the isfara the simulated increase in the discharge associated with snowmelt during spring was simulated a bit earlier than the observed one this uncertainty should be taken into account when assessing the results the projected changes in discharge of the isfara and aspara rivers i e shift of peak discharge to an earlier date potentially offer more beneficial irrigation conditions for the winter cereals in both catchments if the crop management calendars won t be changed much in the future this however is not the case for the rcp8 5 scenario in the isfara river catchment where all cereal types and other crops will be negatively affected by an overall reduction of water availability especially in the mid and far future periods the projected decrease in discharge during summer months will adversely affect all spring crops in both basins and especially cotton which irrigation period happens exactly during the months with the strongest projected discharge reduction this accompanied by a strong increase in temperature would create very unfavourable conditions for crops potentially already existing and planned infrastructure in the river basins may alleviate to a certain extent the problem of water availability decrease in summer months in case if additional water coming in spring months would be stored during peak discharges and released later for irrigation in summer however in the case of the isfara river basin under the rcp8 5 scenario it is not the case as an overall decrease of discharge is projected throughout the year as presented in section 4 4 and table a3 in supplementary material both the c3 and c4 vegetation periods are expected to extend in the case study basins as a direct consequence of the temperature increase this potentially offers a possibility for earlier planting of the spring crops in the region and shifting of the irrigation period to earlier dates to match the projected changes in discharge in both rivers however this adaptation opportunity should be explored more in depth since e g for the aspara river basin discharge is projected to be shifted by one month earlier on average already in the near future under both climate scenarios whereas the vegetation period for this period is projected to start only several days earlier than in the reference period another factor that needs to be explored is the anticipated increase in temperature that can also lead to higher sums of effective temperatures for plants thus shortening the phenological development of different crops and consequently the irrigation period stulina et al 2019 the trade offs between the shortening of the ripening stage of the plants earlier starting of vegetation period increased irrigation demand due to higher evapotranspiration rates as in the study of stulina et al 2019 should be analyzed together with the changes in rivers discharge in the future studies besides it is not clear how increased temperature in spring months would affect the dynamics of plant development as it may potentially contribute to e g faster development of winter cereals or serve as an additional stressor due to extremely high temperatures teixeira et al 2013 the number of days with extreme heat that may significantly harm the crop yields are expected to increase significantly in the isfara river basin under the high emissions scenario for the aspara river basin on the contrary the number of extreme heat days does not increase much under both climate change scenarios the trends in discharge reported in this paper for the isfara and aspara rivers are similar to those reported by several previously conducted studies for other river basins in the region agaltseva et al 2011 changkun et al 2015 gan et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2012 radchenko et al 2017 saibnazarova 2015 savitskiy et al 2008 white et al 2014 6 conclusions this study conducted a rapid assessment of risks imposed by climate change to irrigated agricultural production in two pilot locations in central asia we analyzed the projected future changes in the hydrological regimes of the two river basins the isfara and aspara together with changes in crop relevant temperature indicators under two climate change scenarios the methodology included the application of an eco hydrological model swim selection of the crop relevant temperature indicators and analysis of the current cropping and irrigation schedules together with the projected changes in river discharge in the focus areas first there are minor increasing trends projected for precipitation in the aspara but the projected temperature increases are dramatic for both locations the isi mip derived scenarios suggest the highest increase of up to 6 7 c by the end of the century under the rcp8 5 scenario second the simulation of future hydrological responses in the aspara river under both climate scenarios and for the isfara river under moderate climate scenario suggests common trends increase of discharge in spring months and decrease during the summer months this is associated with an earlier onset of the snowmelt processes due to expected higher warming rates furthermore this trend appears to be common for the rivers in central asia as other authors reported similar impacts in other parts of the region under the rcp8 5 scenario the discharge of the isfara river is projected to decrease throughout the year third the decrease in discharge during the vegetation period from june to september will impose serious challenges to agricultural production of spring crops in both catchments and under both climate change scenarios on the other hand the irrigated winter cereals may benefit from the projected increase in discharge during the spring months due to increasing water availability for irrigation as there is an additional stressor to agricultural production the number of days with temperatures exceeding 40 c which increases in the isfara basin under the rcp8 5 scenario this may lead to more frequent crop failures in the future one can see an important adaptation potential when considering the shifts in the hydrological patterns together with the potential prolongation of the vegetation period and faster ripening of the crops due to faster accumulation of effective temperatures however this should be explored in depth within an integrated modelling framework and include crop and hydrological models to tackle the interplay between the changes in the phenological processes and changes in the components of the hydrological cycle another adaptation option to amend the problem of decreased water availability in the summer months could be the development and operation of new and existing reservoirs in the river basins in this case one should also explore how the water losses due to evaporation from the reservoir s surface will develop given the projected changes in climate and which environmental consequences the operation of reservoirs may have fourth the magnitudes of projected changes should be treated with caution due to large uncertainty ranges as indicated by the multi model spreads and several other limitations of this study discussed in section 5 some additional effects like the co2 fertilization due to the increase of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were not considered in this study but can also have a significant influence on the crop yields further assessments could also consider a dynamic representation of the glacier and snowmelt dynamics in the model as was shown by wortmann et al 2019 as well as to integrate the irrigation infrastructure and reservoirs into the modelling framework the isi mip scenarios which were bias corrected to watch era40 dataset using the trend preserving method by hempel et al 2013 were used to conduct the climate impact assessment the dataset resolution 0 5 degree was not optimal for the case study locations characterized by complex orography and can be considered as a limitation of this study finally yet ultimately important the central asian region as was discussed before is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change and at the same time least explored in the context of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies it is very important that the global and local scientific community sheds more light on how climate change will manifest in the region and suggests effective adaptation

10412,understanding of future climate change impacts and successful planning of adaptation measures are of vital importance for central asia given the region s economic vulnerability dependence on scarce water resources and observed above global average warming rates this paper analyses how impacts of climate change on the hydrological regimes and temperature patterns could affect the irrigated agricultural production in two case study areas the aspara and isfara river basins the methodology applied is based on analysis of temperature indicators and current cropping calendars in target locations combined with hydrological simulations by the process based soil and water integrated model swim of the two river basins the selected climate change projections comprise the moderate and high emissions scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the results reveal that climate change will create unfavourable conditions for irrigated spring crops due to decrease of discharge during the vegetation period on the other hand the projected shift of peak discharge to an earlier date offers benefits for irrigated winter cereals providing more water for irrigation in spring results suggest that there is an opportunity to adapt the irrigated agricultural production in the selected regions by fitting the cropping calendars to changing vegetation periods and to the timing of peak discharges keywords central asia hydrological modelling climate change adaptation adaptation options irrigated agriculture 1 introduction the agricultural sector in central asia ca is of significant importance for the economies of the region it employs one third to one half depending on the country of the total population and constitutes between 15 25 of gdp of tajikistan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan turkmenistan and 5 of gdp of kazakhstan mpra 2018 in general the temperature conditions in ca are suitable for growing many different crops like wheat corn cotton rice fruits vegetables etc however the agricultural production in this region is constrained by an uneven spatial distribution of water resources ineffective irrigation systems and low productivity of agricultural practices the ca region is one of the most vulnerable to climate change and one of the least studied in this context region in the world the average warming rates in the region are already now exceeding the global average values almost two times ipcc 2014 and the future climate projections suggest further dramatic for some ca sub regions increases in the temperature even under the moderate global warming scenarios hattermann et al subm reyer et al 2017 the impacts of the projected climate change could become an additional stressor next to already existing challenges such as the developing economic state of the countries in the region strong dependence of the economies on scarce and unevenly distributed water resources competition between the countries and different economic sectors for water resources within the region those issues have already hampered economic stability inflamed social unrest and diplomatic tensions in the region and the future projected climatic shifts are likely to have strong negative effects on the food security health and water resources in the region lioubimtseva 2015 the understanding of the past climatic changes and trends in the area including the retreat of glaciers is restricted by the data scarcity in the region especially after the ussr breakdown in 1990 chevallier et al 2014 based on analysis of long term observational time series until 1990 of temperature discharge snow and glacier covers in the mountains of tajikistan reported homogenous rise in temperature and associated changes in the snow cover dynamics in this region bolch 2007 and earlier aizen and aizen 1997 reported an increase of temperatures at the mountainous stations and a decrease of snow resources and glacier extent by more than 30 derived from observations between 1955 1999 in the northern tien shan sorg et al 2012 described the past observed decreases of glaciers in the tien shan mountains and associated with that observed seasonal changes in discharge of several rivers the number of studies looking at the future climate change impacts and in particular climate impacts on agriculture in central asia has been increasing over the last years several recent studies on the impacts of climate change have indicated possible future shifts in the discharge of several central asian rivers associated with the increase in temperatures see agaltseva et al 2011 changkun et al 2015 gan et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2012 radchenko et al 2017 saibnazarova 2015 savitskiy et al 2008 white et al 2014 still there are knowledge gaps on the impacts of climate change on water resources and agricultural activities in the region which consequently lead to a research gap in needed adaptation measures in the region ford et al 2015 one of the recent studies by sommer et al 2013 showed possible increases in wheat yields in kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan and tajikistan under projected climate change the authors suggest that adaptive changes in the sowing dates might lead to even further increases in wheat productivity further aleksandrova and gain 2016 showed that proper adaptation policies for land and water management can reduce the vulnerability of a lowland region in uzbekistan to climate change stulina and usmanov 2002 and stulina et al 2019 discussed the potential positive impacts of climate change on the crop yields in central asia through prolongation of the vegetation periods and accelerated accumulation of effective temperatures leading to faster phenological development nevertheless acquiring benefits from prospective positive effects would be only possible upon undertaking properly developed adaptation strategies since the risks associated with heat events may outweigh the positive effects entirely leading to serious losses in the crop yields stulina and usmanov 2002 this study aims at assessing prospective negative impacts but also opportunities for irrigated agricultural production in highland river basins in central asia under moderate rcp4 5 and high emissions rcp8 5 scenarios until the end of the century the selected territories the isfara and aspara river basins represent foothill areas of central asia in terms of cropping patterns and climatic conditions the applied methodology is based on the analysis of projected changes in hydrological and crop relevant temperature indices against current irrigation and cropping calendars in the pilot locations the hydrological indices are represented by the discharge values in a given month and are obtained by the application of an ecohydrological model soil and water integrated model swim krysanova et al 1998 in the aspara and isfara river basins the crop relevant temperature indices are represented by the duration of vegetation periods and by the number of extremely hot days per year which may harm the phenological development and decrease the crop yields 2 case study areas the two pilot territories considered in this study the aspara and isfara river basins are presented in fig 1 the major characteristics of the selected case study areas are summarized in table 1 2 1 aspara river basin the aspara river is a transboundary river shared by kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan it has a length of around 108 km and the catchment area of 1292 km2 with 78 of the catchment area situated on the territory of kazakhstan and 22 on the territory of kyrgyzstan the river is predominantly snow and glacier fed and has an extensive water management infrastructure which includes the big chuiskiy channel and the tarty reservoir carec 2014a the development of the agricultural sector is of a high priority for economies of both countries however in recent years the cropland area in the basin has been decreasing mainly due to an insufficient amount of water for irrigation carec 2014b the crop types grown in the basin differ depending on location however the main part of cropland in both countries is occupied by cereals about 56 following cereals the next important crops occupying large areas are oil and industrial crops the area under corn vegetables and potatoes represent a smaller fraction of arable land in this basin kazakhstan s part of the basin had also seen a growth in sugar beet production over the last years which is supported by subsidies from the state carec 2014b the cereals are irrigated only to 26 of the total cereal area in kazakhstan and to 35 in kyrgyzstan whereas other crops are fully irrigated in both countries the winter cereals in the basin are usually planted in september november the oleiferous crops and spring cereals in april and vegetables in may the irrigation for spring crops usually starts in may june and winter cereals are irrigated in september november and march april only one crop is planted per vegetation season 2 2 isfara river basin isfara is a mesoscale catchment in the basin of the syr darya river shared by kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan and has a total drainage area is about 5000 km2 the mean annual discharge is 15 m3 s and the length of the river is approximately 170 km the river is fed by snow and glacier melt water resources are used primarily for irrigation and domestic water supply the catchment is shared by kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan due to the high seasonality of river flow and extensive irrigational activities there is a wide ranging water management infrastructure with some large water management installations e g the tortkul dam and the big fergana channel carec 2014c approximately 75 of the local population is involved in agricultural production in the tajikistan part 60 of cropland is occupied by cereals and cotton followed by industrial crops vegetables and fruits in the uzbekistan part mainly cereals and cotton are occupying the arable land followed by fruits in the case of kyrgyzstan mainly fruits are produced followed by tilled crops according to estimations up to 80 of cereals and 100 of fruits in the basin are irrigated carec 2014d over the last years there is a tendency to decrease of cropland due to lack of water resources for irrigation e g the cropland area within the catchment belonging to kyrgyzstan has decreased by 2 2 3 data and methods 3 1 the swim model the deterministic eco hydrological process based soil and water integrated model swim was developed based on two previously created models swat arnold et al 1998 and matsalu krysanova et al 1989 and it is described in krysanova et al 1998 the main physical processes of the hydrological cycle and other catchment scale processes vegetation crop growth nutrient cycling and erosion are represented within the model through the three main modules hydrological biogeochemical and plant growth the processes are described using physically based and semi empirical mathematical equations the swim model employs three steps spatial disaggregation scheme river basin subbasins hydrotropes or hydrological response units hrus the model operates on a daily time step and uses climatic land use topographic and soil datasets as input additional integrated modules within the model allow simulating operation of dams and reservoirs within the catchment including simulations of hydropower generation koch et al 2013 irrigation processes huang et al 2015 water re allocation impacts through water transfer infrastructure lobanova et al 2017 and modelling of glaciological processes wortmann et al 2019 3 2 input data for hydrological modelling the following data covering the pilot regions which are needed for set up and application of the swim model were retrieved from the global databases the digital elevation model dem for the isfara and aspara river basins was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar database cgiar csi 2017 the ministry of science and technology of china s land cover dataset contains land cover information over the entire globe with a resolution of 30 x 30 m chen et al 2014 national geomatics center of china 2014 which was used in this study soil information for the pilot territories with a resolution of 1000 x 1000 m was obtained from the harmonized world soil database fao70 hwsd panagos et al 2012 the missing soil parameters which are necessary for swim simulation were estimated using the method of pedotransfer functions the regional or local soil map and parametrization were not available for this study swim uses daily precipitation average minimum and maximum temperatures solar radiation and relative humidity as meteorological input data the watch forcing data based on era 40 reanalysis weedon et al 2010 was used as meteorological input for model calibration and validation as the in situ observations from meteorological stations were absent additionally an advantage of using this data was that the selected for this study climate projections from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip frieler et al 2016 were bias adjusted using watch forcing data no regional discharge data for both river basins were available at the time of the study the database of the global runoff data centre grdc grdc 2017 contained data only for one station in the middle of the isfara catchment tash kurgan which was used for the swim model calibration and validation the data available at this gauging station with the monthly time step embrace the period 1933 1991 for the swim model adjustment the period 1965 1980 was selected and for the model validation the period 1981 1991 was used for the aspara river no observed discharge data were available due to the absence of data on the design and operation of the extended network of irrigational channels and existing reservoirs in both river basins it was not possible to include those into the current swim model set up also the biggest part of extensive irrigation channels and the major reservoir tortkul are located in the downstream section of the isfara river below the tash kurgan gauge see carec 2004a at which the calibration of the model was carried out 3 3 calibration of the swim model the calibration of a hydrological model is needed to adjust the unknown model parameters e g saturated conductivity or snowmelt rates at the next step to ensure that the calibrated values of the unknown parameters are correct the hydrological model validation is performed for another period the swim model for the isfara river basin was calibrated over 1965 1980 and validated over 1981 1991 at the tash kurgan gauging station using the three model performance criteria nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and relative volume error rve rve is a total deviation in the volume of discharged water expressed in percent the nse is an efficiency coefficient which relates a sum of squared differences between the observed and simulated discharges to the variance of the observed discharge the kge efficiency criteria was developed by gupta et al 2009 and provide fitting of the three nse components namely correlation bias and variability between observed and simulated data during the calibration process nine model parameters were adjusted the baseflow factor the evapotranspiration coefficient the routing coefficients for surface and subsurface flow two curve numbers regulating runoff and three snowmelt parameters the threshold temperatures of snowfall and snowmelt and the snowmelt rate due to the absence of observed discharge time series in the aspara river basin it was not possible to perform the calibration validation process for this river basin and the values of unknown parameters were transferred from the isfara river 3 4 climate data the climate data was obtained from the cmip5 climate model intercomparison project phase 5 global climate models gcm simulations which were bias adjusted within the isi mip project further referred to as isi mip scenarios the isi mip scenarios were derived from five cmip5 gcm simulations by bi linear interpolation to the 0 5 degree resolution and bias adjustment to the watch era40 using trend preserving quantile mapping approach hempel et al 2013 the biases in precipitation and temperature between the isi mip scenarios and watch era40 are presented in fig a3 of the supplementary material three future time slices selected for this study are 2011 2040 further referred to as the near future 2041 2070 as intermediate future and 2071 2100 as far future the period between 1981 2000 was selected as a reference period 3 5 data on the crop management patterns the risk and adaptation assessment requires information on major crops their planting and harvesting dates and months when irrigation activities are taking place table a2 of the supplementary material includes such information for the two pilot areas which was supplied by local stakeholders in the case of isfara river no information on the types of fruits their shares and irrigation schedules was available the information available on the aspara basin did not specify types of industrial crops cultivated in the basin therefore the analysis did not cover fruits and industrial plants besides no information on the planting and harvesting dates as well as on the start and end of irrigation activities for cotton was available for the isfara river missing information on cotton planting harvesting dates for the isfara basin was transferred from another region located at the downstream reaches of amu darya river where data was available from the local farmers this information is also provided in table a2 supplementary material 3 6 temperature indicators for estimation of the risks and opportunities for agricultural production associated with changes in temperature the following indicators were selected and calculated for each case study area i starting and ending dates of the vegetation periods for c3 wheat cotton barley beet etc and c4 e g corn sorghum crops ii total duration of the vegetation periods and iii the number of days per year when the daily maximum temperature exceeds 40 c the starting and ending dates of the vegetation period are the onset and the offset date of the period during which the crops can be grown usually it is estimated for c3 crops as the date when the mean daily temperature trespasses the threshold of 5 c for 6 consecutive days the 5 c is an important threshold temperature at which vegetation processes start or end on pastures and major vegetables are being planted in this study also another vegetation period is considered for c4 crops which starts ends at 10 c for 6 consecutive days indicator for the planting of e g sorghum the temperature threshold of 40 c indicates undesirable temperature conditions for crops which can adversely affect plant growth maximum daily temperatures above 40 c can lead to failures in the cotton yield itc 2011 the duration of the vegetation period indicates the number of days per year between the start and the end date of the vegetation period for c3 or c4 crops 3 7 hydrological indicators though some rain fed crop cultivation exists in the study areas the current study focuses on irrigated agriculture the discharge rates of the isfara and aspara river basins during the vegetation period when the water demand for irrigation is highest were selected as hydrological indicators for water availability future changes in the monthly discharge of the focus river basins were obtained from the simulations of the swim model driven by the isi mip climate scenarios the changes were estimated as relative differences expressed as a percentage of change between the long term mean average monthly discharge values in the three future periods to the historical period of climate projections 4 results this section presents the results of the swim model adjustment for the isfara river basin temperature and precipitation projections in the region projections of the selected temperature indicators results of simulation of future discharge patterns in the two river basins and analysis of current cropping and irrigation calendars against projected changes in temperature and discharge 4 1 calibration and validation of the swim model the model calibration validation results for the isfara river basin at the tash kurgan station show a fair approximation of the observed data which is reflected by the nse kge and rve values summarized in table 2 according to the model performance evaluation guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 satisfactory model performance corresponds to nse values between 0 5 and 0 65 and rve 15 and 25 fig 2 presents a comparison of the simulated monthly discharge over the entire period of simulation 1960 1991 and the long term average seasonal dynamics with the observed data at the tash kurgan gauging station within the swim model a basic representation of the glacier processes is included during the calibration phase it was observed that the model is very sensitive to the parametrization of snow glacier melt processes namely the temperature thresholds at which snowfall and snowmelt processes are starting in the model have a strong influence on discharge and timing of peaks one can observe in the seasonal dynamics graphs in fig 2 right that the peak discharge which occurs in july is sharper in the simulated discharge curve than in the observed one besides the snowmelt process is simulated to start earlier and finish earlier by the swim model this indicates that the snowmelt in the model may happen slightly faster than in reality for the aspara river due to the absence of observed discharge data it was decided to apply the same swim parametrization as obtained for the isfara river after calibration of the model 4 2 climate change projections in the case study areas figs 3 and 4 below present the projected anomalies in the annual average precipitation and temperature until the end of the century under two different global warming scenarios for the aspara and isfara river basins under consideration for the aspara basin the multi model means of climate change projections under all emissions scenarios indicate a small increase in precipitation from 2 to 7 5 under the rcp8 5 scenario until the end of the century as presented in fig 3 on the contrary for the isfara river fig 4 the gcm models exhibit no notable changes in precipitation ranging from 2 5 to 4 for the case study areas the temperature increase is projected to reach 6 7 c degrees on average under the high emissions scenario rcp8 5 and up to 3 8 c degrees on average under the moderate global warming scenario rcp4 5 by the end of the century the projected warming rate in the case study areas exceeds the anticipated global temperature growth rate by almost two times the strong warming trends translate directly into the temperature related indicators which are discussed in the next section 4 3 temperature indicators table 3 summarizes the starting and ending dates of the c3 and c4 vegetation period as well as the number of days per year with temperature exceeding the 40 c threshold for the case study locations as indicated by the multi model means under two rcp scenarios and across four time slices due to the projected strong increase in temperature the vegetation periods in the pilot areas are expected to increase in the future in particular the starting date is expected to be shifted to an earlier date and the ending date to a later date towards winter months the magnitude of the anticipated shifts strongly depends on the global warming scenario considered when looking at the far future e g changes under rcp4 5 are less pronounced than those triggered by rcp8 5 scenario the starting dates of the c3 and c4 crops vegetation periods in the aspara river basin are projected to be shifted earlier by 3 days under the rcp4 5 scenario and by 5 8 days under the rcp8 5 scenario in the near future the largest shift by 26 28 days earlier is projected under the rcp8 5 scenario by the end century the vegetation period ending dates show a similar trend in the near future projected shift by 3 4 days to a later date under the moderate climate scenario and by 5 days under the rcp8 5 scenario and in the far future by approximately 10 days under the moderate scenario and 20 to 27 days under the rcp8 5 scenario the starting and ending dates of the vegetation periods of c3 and c4 crops in the isfara river basin are exhibiting similar trends shifts by approximately one month under the high emissions scenario and 15 20 days under the moderate climate scenario in the far future the largest projected shift in the starting date is projected by approximately 43 days for c3 plants and for the ending date the expected shift is up to 32 days by the end of the century under the rcp8 5 scenario given these shifts in the starting and ending dates the total duration of the vegetation period in the case study locations will extend accordingly figs 5 and 6 present the expected duration of the c3 and c4 crops vegetation periods in the isfara river basin by the end of the century under the two climate projections and figs a4 and a5 of the supplementary material present those for the aspara river basin the increase in the duration of the vegetation periods for two locations is portrayed to be substantial under both global warming scenarios by the end of the century reaching more than 300 days per year for c3 plants and more than 250 days per year for c4 plants in the isfara figs 5 and 6 under the rcp8 5 scenario by the end of the century one can observe that the projected increase in the c3 vegetation period is stronger than that for c4 crops under the rcp8 5 climate scenario the number of extreme heat days in the isfara basin may reach up to 46 per year by the end of the century in the aspara river basin the projected increase in the number of days with extreme temperatures is moderate only by 7 days more on average for the far future time slice under the high emissions scenario 4 4 discharge projections figs 7 and 8 depict the simulated by swim changes in the long term mean seasonal discharge patterns of the isfara and aspara basins under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios for three future periods the changes are expressed relative to the reference period i e in of change between the mean values of monthly discharge in the future time slices and the reference period for the aspara river basin the projections indicate increasing discharge up to 50 in april may from the mid future time slice on under rcp4 5 scenario and by almost 100 under the rcp8 5 this is associated with earlier snowmelt in the headwaters part due to increased temperatures due to that the high flow period currently observed in summer will shift towards spring and discharge in july august and september is expected to decrease across all future time slices under both rcps the multi model spread shows the highest values in the far future time slice in particular under rcp8 5 scenario where the deviations of some single model projections from the multi model mean range from 30 to more than 500 for the isfara river the general trend under rcp4 5 indicated by the multi model means is similar to that projected for the aspara river increase in march earlier than for the aspara and decrease all other months as shown in fig 8 the projected discharge under the rcp4 5 scenario shows an increase only for march followed by a decrease for all remaining months in the case of the rcp8 5 scenario a reduction in the discharge volume is simulated along all months and decrease will likely become more pronounced by the end century period the respective uncertainty ranges are becoming higher for the winter months by the end of the century under rcp8 5 overall a decrease in the summer flow is projected to be stronger in the isfara river basin compared to the projections for the aspara basin 4 5 analysis of current irrigation calendars against projected changes in temperature and discharge table 4 compares the current irrigation calendar for the main crops with the projected temporal changes in the rivers discharge and duration of the vegetation period by month for the aspara and isfara basins as discussed in section 4 4 the results of simulations by the process based hydrological model swim driven by different sets of climate scenarios for the aspara and isfara show an increase in discharge in some of the spring months march may and decrease in the summer months june september under all global warming scenarios except for the high emission scenario in the isfara under the rcp8 5 scenario for the isfara river basin an overall decrease in discharge throughout the year is projected looking at the agricultural activities summarized in table a2 according to the available data provided in table a2 of supplementary material one can distinguish two types of cropping patterns in the pilot areas winter crops cereals and spring crops including spring cereals cotton rice vegetables industrial crops and fruits for the winter cereals the irrigation activities start from the time of planting in autumn october november in the aspara and isfara basins stop over wintertime and continue in spring until mid of may according to the local information collected the irrigation of fields under all other crops in the isfara and aspara river basins starts from may june and continues along the vegetation period until the end of august for the cotton planted in isfara the irrigation starts in mid june and continues to the mid of august estimations provided in table 4 suggest that the spring cereals and other crops planted in april may and irrigated in may august will likely adversely affected by climate change this is particularly relevant for cotton which requires irrigation in june august the projected decrease of rivers flow during the intensive irrigation period accompanied by an increase in temperature and hence increased evaporation and transpiration rates would impose challenges to the cultivation of spring crops in both catchments on the contrary the production of winter cereals in both catchments may benefit from the future climate conditions the shift of the discharge peak to an earlier date matches better the irrigation period of winter crops which starts in spring and ends in mid may offering an increased water availability for these crops 5 discussion the assessment of climate impacts in this study was based on the application of the isi mip climate dataset this dataset is characterized by a coarser spatial resolution which may be not sufficient when looking at such rather small catchments as those considered in this study in particular because the isi mip dataset is derived from the gcms simulations with resolution up to 300 km it represents in reality a much coarser resolution than 0 5 degree furthermore the technique used to spatially downscale and bias correct the original gcm simulations may also introduce additional uncertainty from fig a1 in the supplementary material the actual scale mismatch between the spatial resolution of the climate models simulations and the size of the basins under consideration is evident overall the scale mismatch between the resolution of the climate models and the sizes of the pilot areas is probably one of the major sources of uncertainty in this study in the future higher resolution rcm simulations e g from cordex database or more advanced statistical downscaling techniques should be employed to provide climate model projections with finer resolutions on the other hand the performance of the reference dataset watch era40 cannot be judged properly for this area since no observational data were available during the time of this study for direct comparison according to the climate projections the temperature increase in the two study basins is expected to be dramatic reaching up to 6 7 c under the high emissions scenario whilst the precipitation patterns will likely not see strong changes under both rcps such changes will likely lead to an increase in the crop water demands and evapotranspiration rates in the region and hence to a decrease in discharge in lowland areas as discussed by immerzeel et al 2012 the future melting of glaciers associated with higher temperatures may also lead to a temporary increase in the discharge of the central asian rivers by mid century followed by a decrease later by the end of the century as the annual precipitation does not exhibit significant changes in the future the expected changes in hydrological patterns of the isfara and aspara river basins are mainly temperature driven in such cases the application of a hydrological model like in this case swim model is critical as it can represent interplay and feedbacks between different hydrological processes like snowmelt and evapotranspiration at the catchment scale and provide reliable projections on the direction of change in the hydrological cycle even though the swim model showed satisfactory fitting of simulated discharge values to the observed ones during the calibration for the isfara the simulated increase in the discharge associated with snowmelt during spring was simulated a bit earlier than the observed one this uncertainty should be taken into account when assessing the results the projected changes in discharge of the isfara and aspara rivers i e shift of peak discharge to an earlier date potentially offer more beneficial irrigation conditions for the winter cereals in both catchments if the crop management calendars won t be changed much in the future this however is not the case for the rcp8 5 scenario in the isfara river catchment where all cereal types and other crops will be negatively affected by an overall reduction of water availability especially in the mid and far future periods the projected decrease in discharge during summer months will adversely affect all spring crops in both basins and especially cotton which irrigation period happens exactly during the months with the strongest projected discharge reduction this accompanied by a strong increase in temperature would create very unfavourable conditions for crops potentially already existing and planned infrastructure in the river basins may alleviate to a certain extent the problem of water availability decrease in summer months in case if additional water coming in spring months would be stored during peak discharges and released later for irrigation in summer however in the case of the isfara river basin under the rcp8 5 scenario it is not the case as an overall decrease of discharge is projected throughout the year as presented in section 4 4 and table a3 in supplementary material both the c3 and c4 vegetation periods are expected to extend in the case study basins as a direct consequence of the temperature increase this potentially offers a possibility for earlier planting of the spring crops in the region and shifting of the irrigation period to earlier dates to match the projected changes in discharge in both rivers however this adaptation opportunity should be explored more in depth since e g for the aspara river basin discharge is projected to be shifted by one month earlier on average already in the near future under both climate scenarios whereas the vegetation period for this period is projected to start only several days earlier than in the reference period another factor that needs to be explored is the anticipated increase in temperature that can also lead to higher sums of effective temperatures for plants thus shortening the phenological development of different crops and consequently the irrigation period stulina et al 2019 the trade offs between the shortening of the ripening stage of the plants earlier starting of vegetation period increased irrigation demand due to higher evapotranspiration rates as in the study of stulina et al 2019 should be analyzed together with the changes in rivers discharge in the future studies besides it is not clear how increased temperature in spring months would affect the dynamics of plant development as it may potentially contribute to e g faster development of winter cereals or serve as an additional stressor due to extremely high temperatures teixeira et al 2013 the number of days with extreme heat that may significantly harm the crop yields are expected to increase significantly in the isfara river basin under the high emissions scenario for the aspara river basin on the contrary the number of extreme heat days does not increase much under both climate change scenarios the trends in discharge reported in this paper for the isfara and aspara rivers are similar to those reported by several previously conducted studies for other river basins in the region agaltseva et al 2011 changkun et al 2015 gan et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2012 radchenko et al 2017 saibnazarova 2015 savitskiy et al 2008 white et al 2014 6 conclusions this study conducted a rapid assessment of risks imposed by climate change to irrigated agricultural production in two pilot locations in central asia we analyzed the projected future changes in the hydrological regimes of the two river basins the isfara and aspara together with changes in crop relevant temperature indicators under two climate change scenarios the methodology included the application of an eco hydrological model swim selection of the crop relevant temperature indicators and analysis of the current cropping and irrigation schedules together with the projected changes in river discharge in the focus areas first there are minor increasing trends projected for precipitation in the aspara but the projected temperature increases are dramatic for both locations the isi mip derived scenarios suggest the highest increase of up to 6 7 c by the end of the century under the rcp8 5 scenario second the simulation of future hydrological responses in the aspara river under both climate scenarios and for the isfara river under moderate climate scenario suggests common trends increase of discharge in spring months and decrease during the summer months this is associated with an earlier onset of the snowmelt processes due to expected higher warming rates furthermore this trend appears to be common for the rivers in central asia as other authors reported similar impacts in other parts of the region under the rcp8 5 scenario the discharge of the isfara river is projected to decrease throughout the year third the decrease in discharge during the vegetation period from june to september will impose serious challenges to agricultural production of spring crops in both catchments and under both climate change scenarios on the other hand the irrigated winter cereals may benefit from the projected increase in discharge during the spring months due to increasing water availability for irrigation as there is an additional stressor to agricultural production the number of days with temperatures exceeding 40 c which increases in the isfara basin under the rcp8 5 scenario this may lead to more frequent crop failures in the future one can see an important adaptation potential when considering the shifts in the hydrological patterns together with the potential prolongation of the vegetation period and faster ripening of the crops due to faster accumulation of effective temperatures however this should be explored in depth within an integrated modelling framework and include crop and hydrological models to tackle the interplay between the changes in the phenological processes and changes in the components of the hydrological cycle another adaptation option to amend the problem of decreased water availability in the summer months could be the development and operation of new and existing reservoirs in the river basins in this case one should also explore how the water losses due to evaporation from the reservoir s surface will develop given the projected changes in climate and which environmental consequences the operation of reservoirs may have fourth the magnitudes of projected changes should be treated with caution due to large uncertainty ranges as indicated by the multi model spreads and several other limitations of this study discussed in section 5 some additional effects like the co2 fertilization due to the increase of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were not considered in this study but can also have a significant influence on the crop yields further assessments could also consider a dynamic representation of the glacier and snowmelt dynamics in the model as was shown by wortmann et al 2019 as well as to integrate the irrigation infrastructure and reservoirs into the modelling framework the isi mip scenarios which were bias corrected to watch era40 dataset using the trend preserving method by hempel et al 2013 were used to conduct the climate impact assessment the dataset resolution 0 5 degree was not optimal for the case study locations characterized by complex orography and can be considered as a limitation of this study finally yet ultimately important the central asian region as was discussed before is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change and at the same time least explored in the context of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies it is very important that the global and local scientific community sheds more light on how climate change will manifest in the region and suggests effective adaptation

10413,the limited water resources have forced the use of unconventional water such as urban wastewater in agriculture however using these water resources requires the consideration of their impact on water soil human and environment inthis study the suitability of using urban treated wastewater as irrigation water has been investigated using geographic information system gis and multi criteria decision making mcdm to do this the decision making criteria were extracted after a literature review irrigation water availability techno economic distance from the wastewater treatment plant and suitability of farmlands for crop cultivation were considered as techno economic sub criteria while the quality of irrigation water soil and crop as well as aquifer vulnerability were considered as environmental sub criteria in the decision structure the data of two wastewater treatment plants i e bandar gaz and kordkoy located in west of golestan province iran were used to implement the model for 10 common crops topography land use soil depth and technical allowable distance were considered as limiting factors in urban wastewater use in the area after the preparation of the base maps appropriate areas were determined for model implementation the maps associated with the criteria were prepared in the gis software environment and then classified according to the available standards analytic hierarchy process ahp was used to calculate the weight of the criteria the results of the sensitivity analysis showed the high sensitivity of aquifer vulnerability and microbial contamination the comparison of the suitability of cultivation using the treated wastewater revealed the better performance of bandar gaz plant in some effective criteria such as aquifer vulnerability nitrate contamination burden and suitability for crop cultivation keywords ahp gis multi criteria decision making waste water reuse 1 introduction concern about future water use sustainability is a strong motivation for understanding the importance of using unconventional water resources in agriculture given that these water resources are rich in nutrients they have a special place in food supply and production mojiri 2011 urban treated wastewater one of the unconventional water resources that have been introduced as an alternative for irrigation in arid regions with high competition among water users has been applied because of its acceptable quality zhang and shen 2019 khalid et al 2018 the effects of using urban treated wastewater have always been of interest to researchers focusing on the effects of short and long term wastewater irrigation on soil physicochemical properties plant production pollution levels and surface and groundwater resources currently the use of treated wastewater in agriculture is not only considered as a solution for the disposal of wastewater but is also a solution for sustainable agriculture especially in regions facing freshwater scarcity duan et al 2010 the results of using treated wastewater on plant production have shown the importance of this water resource in arid and semi arid regions since its nutrients can increase crop production and prevent unnecessary chemical fertilization zhang and shen 2019 wastewater contains three essential macronutrients i e nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and several micronutrients required for plant growth this can remarkably reduce the use of chemical fertilization in farmlands jiménez et al 2011 murtaza et al 2010 however wastewater irrigation depending on its quality can have negative effects on human health crop production and soil physicochemical characteristics these include diseases because of the exposure to microbial contamination increased soil salinity and the ratio of sodium absorption changes in soil hydraulic conductivity nutrient accumulation and plant toxicity shoushtarian and negahban azar 2020 muyen et al 2011 andrews et al 2016 for example levy et al 2011 reported that salinity sodium absorption and organic matter available in treated wastewater had complex effect on the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and these effects were depended on the treated wastewater quality and soil characteristics in general the use of wastewater increases soil organic matter and improves soil structure which leads to an increase in the soil hydraulic conductivity eight year irrigation of olive trees with urban treated wastewater in arid areas showed an increase in soil nitrogen phosphorus potassium and salinity erel et al 2019 however the annual increase in soil salinity did not affect the sodium concentration in plant leaves toxicity and yield they reported that the main reason for preventing the excessive salinity increment was the tolerance of the olive tree seasonal rainfall and adequate soil drainage nevertheless their results showed a steady rise in the ratio of sodium absorption and subsequently an increase in the soil s exchangeable sodium content other studies have reported that increasing the amount of sodium exchangeable content in soil due to the high absorption ratio of sodium in urban treated wastewater leads to the degradation of soil structure soil permeability and hydraulic conductivity reduction and finally undesirable effects on the root development environment soudakouré et al 2013 paudel et al 2016 yalin et al 2017 similar studies on humid region soils showed that both the ratio of sodium absorption and soil salinity increased by long term wastewater irrigation while no significant effect was observed on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity andrews et al 2016 however continuous monitoring of the soil physicochemical characteristics and wastewater parameters is required for long term sustainable agriculture in a comprehensive view the environmental and social effects of the use of treated wastewater are complex multi dimensional processes gomez 2009 that include several criteria and sub criteria about its impact on water resources soil human health the environment and many technical limitations and spatial requirements paul et al 2020 elsheikh et al 2013 al dabbash et al 2018 hadipour et al 2016 this complexity necessitates the use of appropriate decision support tools such as multi criteria decision making mcdm chen and khan 2010 al dabbash et al 2018 mcda provides a rich collection of techniques and procedures for structuring decision problems by designing evaluating and prioritizing the alternatives malczewski 2010 the mcdm techniques have been applied for agriculture and water resources management systems in orojloo et al 2018 srinivasa rao et al 2019 sulewski et al 2018 and environment peng et al 2020 tian et al 2020 in many study cases the combination of mcdm in the gis framework provides a particular capacity to manage and analyze spatial data resulting in various spatial decisions alizade et al 2018 ahp is a popular flexible and structured approach by using qualitative data based on pairwise data comparison saaty 1980 deng 1999 boroushaki and malczewski 2008 also application of the ahp method as a powerful decision support tool to handle the complexities of extensive systems assessment leads to a systematic and step by step framework to decision making orojloo et al 2018 srdjevic and medeiros 2008 wang et al 2007 norouzi et al 2015 maleki et al 2017 the mcdm gis specially ahp gis integrated approach has been increasingly used in recent years as a powerful spatial decision support system in various fields including suitability assessment of agricultural lands kazemi and akinci 2018 akıncıet al 2013 irrigation feizizadeh and blaschke 2013 aquaculture hadipour et al 2014 and environmental problems bunruamkaew and murayam 2011 özkan et al 2020 2019 the use of this method for wastewater recycling for agriculture has also been considered in some studies summary of literature is shown in table 1 reviewed literature generally used methods to locate or rank or identify suitable areas for the use of waste water as irrigation but the considered criteria have not been comprehensive to consider the effects and interactions of wastewater quality environmental conditions as soil water table depth land suitability human health and crop type parameters related to tolerance and sensitivities due to plant type and economic income as one of the important and main factors of farmers reluctance to cultivate were also parameters that were not given enough attention in this study ahp was implemented in a gis environment to assess the feasibility of using urban treated wastewater in agriculture considering the least damage to all environments that accept the effects of using wastewater in agriculture since the proposed model depends on environmental conditions the data of kordkoy and bandargaz wastewater treatment plants located in the north of iran golestan province were used and the effects of criteria were studied on the data of these treatment plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area golestan province is located in the northern part of iran 36 44 38 5 n 53 51 56 14 e the study area covered the regions including kordkoy and bandar gaz treatment plants located in the west of the province the area of feasibility for these treatment plants was considered according to the limiting factors in a distance with a radius of 10 km from the treatment plants fig 1 the data of wastewater quality of the treatment plants were provided by the golestan province regional water organization which are brought in table 2 2 2 methodology overview the use of ahp in gis software environment for a feasibility study of treated wastewater use includes the following five steps where were performed separately for each treatment plant anan et al 2012 1 selecting criteria sub criteria and limiting factors 2 constructing a hierarchical decision making structure and determining the weight of each criterion 3 extracting geographical layers related to each sub criterion and limiting factor using gis 4 standardizing each sub criterion for their combination and calculating the composite decision value cdv and finally 5 extracting the most suitable areas based on the cdvs and the required area in this study as shown in fig 2 a model based on ahp was prepared to use urban treated wastewater then considering the common crops of the province the areas suitable for the cultivation of each crop were determined using the gis software environment afterward their effectiveness was examined by comparing the effects of studied criteria on obtained results 2 3 selection of criteria limiting factors data collection and processing to determine the limiting factors for the feasibility analysis of using urban treated wastewater of each treatment plant after a literature review elevation from sea level land slope soil depth allowable technical distance and land use were considered as limiting criteria the information on topography and land slope was provided by the digital elevation model dem 30 m of golestan province while the information on land use and soil depth was provided by the jihad agriculture organization of golestan the allowed technical distance was considered after consulting with experts in the field previous studies have shown that the environment i e soil plant surface and groundwater resources on one hand and techno economic issues related to the necessary mechanism for water consumption on the other hand are two important factors in the use of unconventional waters in this study the criteria for using urban treated wastewater as an unconventional water source in agriculture were selected based on previous studies abedi koupai 2006 bozdağ 2015 anane et al 2012 neji and turki 2015 as well as the comments from the experts and water management specialists as follows a techno economic criteria including the availability of irrigation water economic distance and the land suitability for each crop and b environmental criteria including wastewater quality soil characteristics aquifer vulnerability and crop sensitivity table 3 shows the selected criteria and the method of preparing the required information layer for the ahp since some of the criteria were related to the crops 10 commonly cultivated crops in golestan province including canola cotton barley wheat soybean maize alfalfa berseem clover rice and common bean were selected and all the model steps were performed for each crop 2 4 multi criteria decision analysis mcdm ahp involves three main steps 1 coinciding with the main objective of the decision making problem as a hierarchical decomposition several criteria including techno economic requirements and environmental hazard were considered to establish the hierarchical structure of the main goals of the feasibility of treated wastewater irrigation then the criteria were divided into several sub criteria saaty and vargas 2012 bozdag 2015 2 level by level creation of the decision table in every hierarchical level all the elements are compared with the corresponding elements in the next higher level for pairwise comparison rezaei moghaddam and karami 2008 in this study pairwise comparisons for each criteria were carried out based on the comments from 20 experts using a questionnaire according to the saaty s nine point scale the expert choice software v 11 was used to determine the overall ranking of the alternatives by solving a comparison matrix consistency ratio cr which measures low allowable changes saaty 1980 duc 2006 was calculated in this study where cr values lower than 0 1 ensure the consistency of the comparison matrix 3 multiplying the value of each creation and its weight to obtain a weighted summation 2 5 model description to study the feasibility of using urban treated wastewater in agriculture modeling was performed to meet the environmental and techno economic requirements for sustainable agriculture to determine the criteria and sub criteria of the model and create a hierarchical structure environmental technical and economic requirements for the sustainable use of wastewater in agriculture were developed through a comprehensive review of previous studies and the comments from the experts the data required for each criterion was collected and processed in the arcgis software environment and the layers were prepared as 90 m raster layers according to the utmwgs 84 coordinate system table 4 shows the classification of the layers the selected expert was included from the agricultural research centers the golestan regional water organization and university professors in the fields of irrigation water and sewage water resources management and agronomy these opinions were collected by ahp questionnaire that based on pairwise comparison of criteria the weight of the criteria and sub criteria was combined and determined using the expert choice software var 11 and its overall inconsistency was investigated and sensivity analysis was performed to measure the effect of each criterion then the weight obtained for each criterion was assigned to the corresponding raster layer in the arcgis environment followed by performing the overlapping operation of the layers using weight analysis with the help of a raster calculator tool in this stage feasibility maps were produced and classified into five categories namely completely suitable suitable moderately suitable unsuitable and completely unsuitable the results of the process for the two treatment plants were compared to each other to investigate the effects of the criteria on feasibility maps and to determine the suitable crops for cultivation with wastewater of each treatment plant 3 results and discussion 3 1 ahp results the results of ahp shows that wastewater quality plays an important role in its application in agriculture according to the comments from the experts microbial contamination salinity aquifer vulnerability and nitrate concentration gained more weight compared to other criteria microbial contamination and br toxicity received the highest and lowest weights respectively fig 3 furthermore among the economic criteria irrigation water availability was of higher importance the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the aquifer vulnerability and br toxicity had the highest and lowest sensitivity respectively similarly the results of anane et al 2012 on using ahp gis to rank suitable areas for treated wastewater irrigation showed that aquifer vulnerability received the second place in importance after the social criterion which shows the high importance of aquifer vulnerability furthermore cr was obtained equal to 0 02 which indicates the optimal consistency among the criteria 3 2 modeling results the results showed low suitability for using the treated wastewater of kordkoy plant as agricultural irrigation water inlands near the treatment plant canola and cotton were obtained to have the highest and common beans to have the lowest suitable cultivation area in these lands however the results of using the treated wastewater of bandar gaz treatment plant showed a high level of suitability in agricultural lands near the treatment plant where 90 of the evaluated crops had cultivation suitability of over 70 of the area barley corn wheat canola and soybean had the highest and alfalfa had the lowest suitable area for cultivation in this region fig 4 shows the result of implementing the model in agricultural lands allowed for cultivation with treated wastewater of both treatment plants the results of implementing the model for the treatment plants and the study of the effects of decision criteria on feasibility maps show a remarkable difference between the percentage of the suitable area for cultivation of each crop fig 5 the reason for this difference is the impact of the criteria used in the decision model in general the effective criteria in the analysis can be classified into three categories the description and the effectiveness of each have been discussed separately 3 2 1 independent qualitative criteria these criteria included nitrate phosphate and microbial contamination of applied wastewater their effects are on the health of human and water resources and therefore they did not affect the location and type of cultivated crops according to international statistics up to 80 of the diseases reported in less developed countries are related to their poor water quality because of entering wastewater to drinking water resources wyatt 1987 obeidat et al 2007 collected 248 groundwater samples from 16 wells in al hashemiyah jordan and concluded that there is a strong relationship between water nitrate concentration and treated wastewater according to the undesirable effects of nitrate and microbial contamination on groundwater resources as well as considering the high concentration of nitrate in the wastewater of kordkoy treatment plant and the high microbial contamination in both treatment plants using the treated wastewater of bandar gaz plant is less environmentally hazardous compared to that of the kordkoy plant s wastewater performing various methods of nitrate removal and disinfection is necessary to reduce the microbial effects of wastewater 3 2 2 environment related criteria these criteria which include soil class and texture aquifer vulnerability and irrigation water availability affect the feasibility maps and are independent of the crop type fig 6 shows the geospatial results of these criteria for each treatment plant an investigation on environment based criteria shows that although the suitability of availability of irrigation water was preferred to bandar gaz treatment plant s area due to the relatively low quality of groundwater aquifer in parts of the study area for kordkoy treatment plant ca 80 of the study area of kordkoy treatment plant was completely unsuitable in terms of aquifer vulnerability criteria which this criterion was ca 65 in bandar gaz treatment plant area the studies of tomer et al 2019 on the vulnerability of the delhi aquifer revealed the important role of the groundwater level in aquifer vulnerability therefore the high groundwater level in kordkoy and bandar gaz areas is an effective factor in reducing the suitability of land for using treated wastewater due to the considerable weight of the aquifer vulnerability criterion although studies by wang et al 2007 have shown that many wastewater contaminants are significantly reduced after passing through the soil profile the high level of the water table in the area increases the risk of nitrate and or microbial contamination of groundwater resources this is more critical for the areas of the kordkoy treatment plant than that of bandar gaz plant on the other hand the texture and the chemical class of the soil have improved the suitability of using treated wastewater irrigation within the areas of bandargaz plant therefore in terms of environmental criteria the lands within the bandar gaz treatment plant had higher suitability for the use of treated wastewater irrigation since the drainage network has an effective role in improving the soil physicochemical properties the use of treated wastewater from the studied treatment plants especially in kordkoy is not recommended before drainage operations 3 2 3 plant criteria these criteria which depend on the crop type include fertility economic distance ec tolerance sar na and br toxicity and the hygienic limitations of cultivation by wastewater table 5 shows the quality criteria related to crop types based on the degree of desirability for each crop from 1 to 5 it can be seen that the cultivation of different crops is more suitable using the treated wastewater of bandar gaz plant compared to that of the kordkoy plant furthermore cotton had the highest suitability for kordkoy plant wastewater while cotton and corn had the highest suitability for the wastewater of bandar gaz plant the treated wastewater of bandar gaz plant contains significant amounts of potassium 15 g m 3 ha phosphorus 7 81 g m 3 ha and nitrate 2 91 g m 3 ha which covers40 of the total macro nutrient fertilization costs of farming economic analysis showed that the cultivation of alfalfa rice wheat corn soybean barley canola cotton and common bean in the study area had economic benefits respectively however the ecological studies of kazemi et al 2015 showed the cultivation suitability of only rice corn and clover in the area of bandar gaz plant the treated wastewater of the kordkoy plant also contains significant amounts of potassium 15 9 g m 3 ha phosphorus 3 g m 3 ha and nitrate 65 8 g m 3 ha covering 57 of total fertilizer costs economic analysis also showed that the cultivation of alfalfa clover rice soybean wheat canola corn cotton barley and common bean in the kordkoy plant area had economic benefits respectively kazemi et al 2015 studied the agricultural ecological suitability of rice corn and berseem cultivation on 68 of the southern parts of the area while cultivating alfalfa soybean canola and cotton on 32 of the northern parts of the area the showed the undesirability of cultivating wheat barley and common bean near the kordkoy treatment plant fig 7 shows the results of the economic analysis of the crops investigated in this study so far there have been several studies on the use of wastewater in agriculture all of which have emphasized increasing crop yields the studies of saffari and saffari 2013 on treated wastewater irrigation showed an improvement in soil properties and common bean s yield and plant growth furthermore although some nutrients such as n p k fe cu zn mn and ni increased in soil compared to control no soil contamination and plant toxicity were observed el moussaoui et al 2019 reported the significant effects of water quality on soil parameters they highlighted a significant increase in organic matter om and the concentration of some soil nutrients such as kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total phosphorus tp when irrigating with urban treated wastewater emphasizing the economic savings of fertilizer use in crop cultivation their study on alfalfa cultivation showed significant effects on yield and macro and microelements concentrations of a plant it should be noted that the use of wastewater in sandy and other coarse textured soils increases the risk of pollution of shallow groundwater aquifers said gemail 2012 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of using urban treated wastewater by analyzing the effective criteria in decision making for two wastewater treatment plants with different qualitative and environmental conditions and examining the role of each criterion separately on several types of crops due to the desirable effects of wastewater irrigation on crop yield the improvement of criteria that had the highest effects on the suitability of using wastewater can play an effective role in reducing environmental and health hazards the high groundwater level and its low quality was a major problem in both study areas which results in soil drainage and salinization and limits the possibility of wastewater irrigation in this research the assumption was not that all criteria were completely independent it is clear that there was a possible dependency influence in the decision making process so might be a dependency between some of the decision criteria but we to simplification and avoidance of complexity hypothesized this related were minimum it is suggested that other decision analysis methods such as anp can be applied to consider the potential dependency in decision criteria and sub criteria declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

measures low allowable changes saaty 1980 duc 2006 was calculated in this study where cr values lower than 0 1 ensure the consistency of the comparison matrix 3 multiplying the value of each creation and its weight to obtain a weighted summation 2 5 model description to study the feasibility of using urban treated wastewater in agriculture modeling was performed to meet the environmental and techno economic requirements for sustainable agriculture to determine the criteria and sub criteria of the model and create a hierarchical structure environmental technical and economic requirements for the sustainable use of wastewater in agriculture were developed through a comprehensive review of previous studies and the comments from the experts the data required for each criterion was collected and processed in the arcgis software environment and the layers were prepared as 90 m raster layers according to the utmwgs 84 coordinate system table 4 shows the classification of the layers the selected expert was included from the agricultural research centers the golestan regional water organization and university professors in the fields of irrigation water and sewage water resources management and agronomy these opinions were collected by ahp questionnaire that based on pairwise comparison of criteria the weight of the criteria and sub criteria was combined and determined using the expert choice software var 11 and its overall inconsistency was investigated and sensivity analysis was performed to measure the effect of each criterion then the weight obtained for each criterion was assigned to the corresponding raster layer in the arcgis environment followed by performing the overlapping operation of the layers using weight analysis with the help of a raster calculator tool in this stage feasibility maps were produced and classified into five categories namely completely suitable suitable moderately suitable unsuitable and completely unsuitable the results of the process for the two treatment plants were compared to each other to investigate the effects of the criteria on feasibility maps and to determine the suitable crops for cultivation with wastewater of each treatment plant 3 results and discussion 3 1 ahp results the results of ahp shows that wastewater quality plays an important role in its application in agriculture according to the comments from the experts microbial contamination salinity aquifer vulnerability and nitrate concentration gained more weight compared to other criteria microbial contamination and br toxicity received the highest and lowest weights respectively fig 3 furthermore among the economic criteria irrigation water availability was of higher importance the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the aquifer vulnerability and br toxicity had the highest and lowest sensitivity respectively similarly the results of anane et al 2012 on using ahp gis to rank suitable areas for treated wastewater irrigation showed that aquifer vulnerability received the second place in importance after the social criterion which shows the high importance of aquifer vulnerability furthermore cr was obtained equal to 0 02 which indicates the optimal consistency among the criteria 3 2 modeling results the results showed low suitability for using the treated wastewater of kordkoy plant as agricultural irrigation water inlands near the treatment plant canola and cotton were obtained to have the highest and common beans to have the lowest suitable cultivation area in these lands however the results of using the treated wastewater of bandar gaz treatment plant showed a high level of suitability in agricultural lands near the treatment plant where 90 of the evaluated crops had cultivation suitability of over 70 of the area barley corn wheat canola and soybean had the highest and alfalfa had the lowest suitable area for cultivation in this region fig 4 shows the result of implementing the model in agricultural lands allowed for cultivation with treated wastewater of both treatment plants the results of implementing the model for the treatment plants and the study of the effects of decision criteria on feasibility maps show a remarkable difference between the percentage of the suitable area for cultivation of each crop fig 5 the reason for this difference is the impact of the criteria used in the decision model in general the effective criteria in the analysis can be classified into three categories the description and the effectiveness of each have been discussed separately 3 2 1 independent qualitative criteria these criteria included nitrate phosphate and microbial contamination of applied wastewater their effects are on the health of human and water resources and therefore they did not affect the location and type of cultivated crops according to international statistics up to 80 of the diseases reported in less developed countries are related to their poor water quality because of entering wastewater to drinking water resources wyatt 1987 obeidat et al 2007 collected 248 groundwater samples from 16 wells in al hashemiyah jordan and concluded that there is a strong relationship between water nitrate concentration and treated wastewater according to the undesirable effects of nitrate and microbial contamination on groundwater resources as well as considering the high concentration of nitrate in the wastewater of kordkoy treatment plant and the high microbial contamination in both treatment plants using the treated wastewater of bandar gaz plant is less environmentally hazardous compared to that of the kordkoy plant s wastewater performing various methods of nitrate removal and disinfection is necessary to reduce the microbial effects of wastewater 3 2 2 environment related criteria these criteria which include soil class and texture aquifer vulnerability and irrigation water availability affect the feasibility maps and are independent of the crop type fig 6 shows the geospatial results of these criteria for each treatment plant an investigation on environment based criteria shows that although the suitability of availability of irrigation water was preferred to bandar gaz treatment plant s area due to the relatively low quality of groundwater aquifer in parts of the study area for kordkoy treatment plant ca 80 of the study area of kordkoy treatment plant was completely unsuitable in terms of aquifer vulnerability criteria which this criterion was ca 65 in bandar gaz treatment plant area the studies of tomer et al 2019 on the vulnerability of the delhi aquifer revealed the important role of the groundwater level in aquifer vulnerability therefore the high groundwater level in kordkoy and bandar gaz areas is an effective factor in reducing the suitability of land for using treated wastewater due to the considerable weight of the aquifer vulnerability criterion although studies by wang et al 2007 have shown that many wastewater contaminants are significantly reduced after passing through the soil profile the high level of the water table in the area increases the risk of nitrate and or microbial contamination of groundwater resources this is more critical for the areas of the kordkoy treatment plant than that of bandar gaz plant on the other hand the texture and the chemical class of the soil have improved the suitability of using treated wastewater irrigation within the areas of bandargaz plant therefore in terms of environmental criteria the lands within the bandar gaz treatment plant had higher suitability for the use of treated wastewater irrigation since the drainage network has an effective role in improving the soil physicochemical properties the use of treated wastewater from the studied treatment plants especially in kordkoy is not recommended before drainage operations 3 2 3 plant criteria these criteria which depend on the crop type include fertility economic distance ec tolerance sar na and br toxicity and the hygienic limitations of cultivation by wastewater table 5 shows the quality criteria related to crop types based on the degree of desirability for each crop from 1 to 5 it can be seen that the cultivation of different crops is more suitable using the treated wastewater of bandar gaz plant compared to that of the kordkoy plant furthermore cotton had the highest suitability for kordkoy plant wastewater while cotton and corn had the highest suitability for the wastewater of bandar gaz plant the treated wastewater of bandar gaz plant contains significant amounts of potassium 15 g m 3 ha phosphorus 7 81 g m 3 ha and nitrate 2 91 g m 3 ha which covers40 of the total macro nutrient fertilization costs of farming economic analysis showed that the cultivation of alfalfa rice wheat corn soybean barley canola cotton and common bean in the study area had economic benefits respectively however the ecological studies of kazemi et al 2015 showed the cultivation suitability of only rice corn and clover in the area of bandar gaz plant the treated wastewater of the kordkoy plant also contains significant amounts of potassium 15 9 g m 3 ha phosphorus 3 g m 3 ha and nitrate 65 8 g m 3 ha covering 57 of total fertilizer costs economic analysis also showed that the cultivation of alfalfa clover rice soybean wheat canola corn cotton barley and common bean in the kordkoy plant area had economic benefits respectively kazemi et al 2015 studied the agricultural ecological suitability of rice corn and berseem cultivation on 68 of the southern parts of the area while cultivating alfalfa soybean canola and cotton on 32 of the northern parts of the area the showed the undesirability of cultivating wheat barley and common bean near the kordkoy treatment plant fig 7 shows the results of the economic analysis of the crops investigated in this study so far there have been several studies on the use of wastewater in agriculture all of which have emphasized increasing crop yields the studies of saffari and saffari 2013 on treated wastewater irrigation showed an improvement in soil properties and common bean s yield and plant growth furthermore although some nutrients such as n p k fe cu zn mn and ni increased in soil compared to control no soil contamination and plant toxicity were observed el moussaoui et al 2019 reported the significant effects of water quality on soil parameters they highlighted a significant increase in organic matter om and the concentration of some soil nutrients such as kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total phosphorus tp when irrigating with urban treated wastewater emphasizing the economic savings of fertilizer use in crop cultivation their study on alfalfa cultivation showed significant effects on yield and macro and microelements concentrations of a plant it should be noted that the use of wastewater in sandy and other coarse textured soils increases the risk of pollution of shallow groundwater aquifers said gemail 2012 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of using urban treated wastewater by analyzing the effective criteria in decision making for two wastewater treatment plants with different qualitative and environmental conditions and examining the role of each criterion separately on several types of crops due to the desirable effects of wastewater irrigation on crop yield the improvement of criteria that had the highest effects on the suitability of using wastewater can play an effective role in reducing environmental and health hazards the high groundwater level and its low quality was a major problem in both study areas which results in soil drainage and salinization and limits the possibility of wastewater irrigation in this research the assumption was not that all criteria were completely independent it is clear that there was a possible dependency influence in the decision making process so might be a dependency between some of the decision criteria but we to simplification and avoidance of complexity hypothesized this related were minimum it is suggested that other decision analysis methods such as anp can be applied to consider the potential dependency in decision criteria and sub criteria declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

10414,this study reviews the abundant research on fao56 crop coefficients published following introduction of the fao56 paper in 1998 the primary goal was to evaluate update and consolidate the mid season and end season single k c and basal k cb crop coefficients tabulated for many field crops in fao56 the review found that the prevalent approach for estimating crop evapotranspiration et c is the fao56 k c et o approach i e the product of the k c and reference evapotranspiration et o the fao56 k c et o approach requires use of the fao56 pm et o grass reference equation with appropriate crop specific k c and or k cb reviewed research provided various approaches to determine k c and k cb and used a variety of actual crop et etc act measurements significant attention was placed on accessing the accuracy of the field measurements and models used in these studies accuracy requirements upper limits for k c values and related causal errors are discussed conceptual approaches relative to k c transferability requirements are provided with focus on standard crop conditions and use of the fao56 segmented k c curve papers selected to update k c k cb used the fao56 pm et o provided accurate measurements to determine and partition etc act and satisfied transferability requirements selected observed k c and k cb values were converted to standard sub humid climate as adopted in fao56 observed values with respect to tabulated fao56 k c and k cb were used in consolidating updated values for crops within general categories of grain legumes fiber crops oil crops sugar crops small grain cereals maize and sorghum and rice ancillary data e g maximum root depth and crop height were also collected from selected literature and tabulated results showed good agreement between updated and original tabulated fao56 k c and k cb confirming the reliability of the fao56 values this indicates change in the k c et c et o ratio of crops has not occurred due to climate change during the past sixty years new k c k cb data for crops not included in fao56 are also now presented for several oil crops and pseudo cereals the approach adopted for rice differs from fao56 because consideration was given to the numerous rice water management practices currently used and thus k c k cb values for the initial season of rice were also presented the review also observed that many research papers did not satisfy the adopted requirements in terms of et o method and or the accuracy of etc act determinations and therefore could not be used thus emphasis is placed on adopting improved accuracy and quality control in future research aimed at determining k c data comparable to presented values the transferability of standard k c and k cb has been assured for the values tabulated herein improved future applications of the fao56 k c et o method should consider remote sensing observations when available particularly in defining crop growth stages at given locations keywords transferability of standard k c upper limits to k c research accuracy requirements grain legumes fiber and oil crops sugar crops cereals rice 1 introduction in the field agricultural practice crop evapotranspiration et c is computed or modeled using weather data and algorithms that describe the aerodynamic characteristics of the vegetation and surface energy driving et c one of the most adopted computational procedures is the one proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 as recently reviewed by pereira et al 2015a and relative to the use of models by pereira et al 2020a the fao method uses the k c et o approach where et c is the product of a crop coefficient k c by the grass reference evapotranspiration et o et o represents the primary weather induced effects on the evapotranspiration rate of the grass reference crop and the crop coefficient k c scales the reference et o to account for crop specific influences on et c resulting from the differences in aerodynamic and surface resistances between the considered crop and the reference grass crop allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 during the crop growing season the et o mm d 1 is defined as the evapotranspiration rate of the grass reference crop which is assumed as a hypothetical grass crop with a height of 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing adequately watered and completely shading the ground allen et al 1998 daily et o is computed with the pm et o eq 1 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n g is the net balance of energy available at the surface mj m 2 d 1 t is the mean daily air temperature c at the reference height of 2 m e s e a represents the vapor pressure deficit vpd of air kpa at 2 m height u 2 is wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship at mean air temperature kpa o c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa o c 1 the most commonly used time step in the field practice and related water balance modeling pereira et al 2020a is daily because only vertical fluxes of heat and vapor are considered in the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1965 as parameterized for the grass reference crop to produce the pm et o in eq 1 advective heat energy fluxes are not considered in et o pereira et al 1999 defining k c as the ratio of et c to et o and expressing et c and et o in terms of the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1965 it becomes evident that k c varies throughout the crop season with the aerodynamic and surface resistance of the crop and the reference crop pereira et al 1999 2 k c e t c e t o δ c r n c g c ρ a c p e s e a c r a c δ c γ 1 r s c r a c δ o r n o g o ρ a c p e s e a o r a o δ o γ 1 r s o r a o where r n g e s e a δ and γ were defined above ρ a is air density c p is specific heat of air r a is aerodynamic resistance to heat and vapor transport from the surface to z height and r s is bulk surface resistance the subscripts c and o are respectively for the actual crop vegetation in the numerator and the grass reference crop in the denominator this ratio eq 2 allows visualizing that k c represents an integration of the effects of three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference 1 crop height that affects roughness and aerodynamic resistance 2 leaf area fraction of ground covered by the vegetation f c leaf age and condition degree of stomatal control and soil surface wetness which determine bulk crop soil surface resistance r s and 3 albedo of the crop soil surface which influences r n and depends upon by f c and soil surface conditions the derivation of k c is generally done using empirical approaches that must be consistent relative to the above presented theoretical background however this consistency is often not referred to in related crop coefficient literature two k c approaches are considered in fao56 fig 1 the time averaged single k c which includes multi day effects of soil evaporation in addition to plant transpiration and the dual k c consisting of a basal crop coefficient k cb and an evaporation coefficient k e defined respectively as k cb t c et o and k e e s et o with k c k cb k e where t c is crop transpiration and e s is soil evaporation considering eq 2 it is evident that k c varies throughout the crop season since parameters of the crop in the numerator will change with the growth of the crop until its maximum development and with crop maturation until harvest at the end season differently by definition the parameters of the reference crop in the denominator remain unchanged fao24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and later fao56 allen et al 1998 proposed to describe the time variation of k c using a segmented crop coefficient curve fig 1 it applies to both the single time averaged k c and the basal k cb because e s depends upon the fraction of ground cover on the soil wettings amount of water in the evaporation layer of the soil as well as on soil hydrodynamic characteristics k e varies with these conditions showing peaks in relation to soil wetting events the k c and k cb curves consist of four linear segments representative of the four crop stages identified in fig 1 initial from planting to 10 cover crop development up to full development mid season until senescence starts and late season until end season i e harvesting to draw the segmented curves it is required to know only the values of k c at the initial mid season and end season respectively k c ini k c mid and k c end k c ini essentially depends upon e s since t c is then very small and its average may be represented by a horizontal segment during the mid season the ratio et c et o has relatively small changes and k c mid may also be approximated by a horizontal segment k c end corresponds just to the end of the whole crop cycle however not exactly that on the harvesting day but an approximate trend value when precipitation occurring just by that end day or close to it would increase disproportionally the k c end value the k c end value should not be confounded with the average k c for the entire late season stage because this would largely overestimate k c end though mainly when the crop is harvested dry or close to it as shown in fig 1b naturally this guideline refers to both k c and k cb the advantage of the segmented k c curve is that it just requires knowing three values those at the initial stage k c ini k cb ini at mid season k c mid k cb mid and at harvesting or end season k c end k cb end k c values during crop development and late season stages are then just linearly interpolated fig 1b however the fao k c curve is not adopted by many researchers particularly when the objective is obtaining k c values to be used with the local climate alternative usage to the fao56 curve structure consists of a monthly k c averages whose values are tied to the local climate and thus cannot be transferred to other locations b functions relating k c with time whose values cannot be transferred because they depend upon the local climate only c functions relating k c with f c or a similar indicator as reviewed by pereira et al 2020b relative to assessing k c from ground cover and height and d in addition to k c mid using average values for the crop development stage and the late season which then do not allow a means to estimate respectively k c ini and k c end as shown in fig 1b nevertheless when graphical representations of cases a b and or c are produced in papers a reader may then roughly estimate the values for k c ini k c mid and k c end to draw the k c curve fig 1 it is required to know the time durations of the crop stages respective indicative values for crops were tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 and in publications by allen et al 2007 and jensen and allen 2016 however those tabulated values are just indicative to be used in first step planning when field observations are not yet available those publications refer to the need for observing actual stage durations through field surveys thus users should refrain from using indicative durations which may deviate much from actual ones but use actual field observations alternatively for planning purposes time durations may be replaced by cumulative growing degree days cgdd characterizing the crop growth stages as earlier reported in many applications in literature namely as early proposed by sammis et al 1985 when adopting the dual k c approach it is essential that partitioning et into transpiration and soil evaporation be performed accurately various methods may be applied as reviewed by kool et al 2014 they report on methods that like fao56 are based upon the relationship between e s and f c allen et al 1998 2005a b as well methods that require the use of specific instrumentation adopt a double source model or use isotopes modeling plays a main role as in the case of using a soil water balance model like simdualkc rosa et al 2012a paredes et al 2014 pereira et al 2020a while the use of remote sensing vegetation indices allows accurate estimation of k cb hunsaker et al 2005a b 2007 french et al 2020 lópez urrea et al 2020 k c and k cb are subject to a large number of influencing factors as summarized in fig 2 for k c at each growth stage during the initial stage the variability of k c ini relates to soil evaporation and factors controlling it such as frequency of rainfall and irrigation wettings use of plastic mulches plastic tunnels organic mulching soil residues management frequency and depth of irrigation applications and fraction of soil wetted by irrigation with such a variety of influencing factors it is not possible to tabulate values for k c ini and it is not possible to derive related values from published papers fao56 provided indicative k c ini values corresponding to the most common conditions i e when surface irrigation was used and the soil was maintained bare however in many studies researchers considered indicative k c ini as recommended values and thus may have used them erroneously therefore tabulated k c ini values are not proposed herein instead the k c ini computational procedures proposed by allen et al 1998 pg 114 121 2005b are recommended for users simple models can be used for that purpose for the dual k c approach the value k cb ini 0 15 is recommended since it averages conditions from bare soil and fraction of ground cover f c up to 0 10 and it is assumed to include diffusive or residual evaporation from soil for potentially long periods following wetting allen et al 2005a however under dry conditions with long periods between wettings or during the non growing season k cb ini can be set much lower even close to 0 differently k e should be computed taking into consideration all the factors affecting soil evaporation as detailed by allen et al 1998 2005a fao56 allen et al 1998 adopted the concept of standard k c vs actual k c k c act in correspondence with potential crop et et c vs actual crop et et c act et c and k c refer to optimal well watered conditions and pristine cultivated crops while et c act and k c act refer to crop conditions that are often not pristine due to insufficient or non uniform irrigation rainfall failures soil and water salinity as well as non optimal soil and agronomic management practices including crop density planting date seed quality and weed and disease control in addition to these factors niaghi et al 2019 assessed impacts of controlled drainage and related sub irrigation on et c act and k c act of maize as expected from cultivation with high water table k c act k c optimal are reported naturally only standard k c and k cb values may be transferred to other sites and therefore be tabularized as presented in fao56 k c and k c act as well as k cb and k cb act are related through a stress coefficient k s depending upon the sufficiency of available soil water to maintain the crop et rate at potential thus it results 3 k c act k s k c k s k cb k e where it is evidenced that when the dual k c is adopted k s only applies to the transpiration coefficient k cb when referring to water insufficiency only k s is defined allen et al 1998 as 4a k s taw d r i taw raw if d r i raw 4b k s 1 if d r i raw where taw and raw are respectively the total and readily available soil water relative to the rooting depth mm with raw p taw p is the soil water depletion fraction for no water stress and d ri is the soil water depleted from the root zone at the end of day i mm when salinity also affects et allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 then 5 k s taw d r i taw raw 1 b k y 100 ec e ec e threshold where k y is the yield response factor describing the relationship between the relative yield decrease with the relative evapotranspiration deficit doorenbos and kassam 1979 ec e threshold ds m 1 is the soil ec e value from where crop production starts to be affected by salinity and b is the percent rate of yield decrease relative to the ec e excess relative to ec e threshold ds m 1 indicative values for those parameters are updated and tabularized by minhas et al 2020 eqs 4 and 5 above make it evident that k c act values cannot be transferred when a crop has an et rate inferior to potential due to crop and water management and or salinity impacts the standard fao56 tabularized k c mid k cb mid and k c end k cb end values refer to irrigation management and precipitation frequencies typical of a sub humid climate where minimum relative humidity and wind speed at 2 m height are respectively rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 as defined in fao56 allen et al 1998 under humid and calm conditions the k c mid for full cover crops generally exceed 1 0 by only 0 05 to 0 10 approximately because full cover crops and the reference crop behave similarly regarding absorption of short wave radiation the primary energy source for evaporation under humid and calm conditions allen et al 2011b differences in et caused by differences in the aerodynamic resistance r a between the agricultural and the reference crop are also small because the vpd is then small thus the values of k c are less dependent on differences between the aerodynamic components of et c and et o eq 2 on the contrary under arid conditions such differences in r a are more pronounced because the vpd is then large hence k c will be larger under arid conditions mainly for tall crops that are more subjected to wind effects in terms of replacing the saturated air close to the leaves with drier air thus accelerating evaporation fluxes then k c values may not exceed 1 0 by more than about 0 25 as discussed by allen et al 2011b a and in the companion paper pereira et al 2021 unless advection occurs adding energy for evaporation k c obtained under advective influences are much too large and therefore are not transferable during the last two decades much research has been performed to develop and update crop coefficients however with diverse objectives and using a variety of field methods and approaches to derive k c and k cb from research results it is therefore opportune to assess such research select recognized advances and results including when approaches were not in agreement with the fao56 methodologies thus the objectives of this study consist of evaluating the progress in deriving k c and k cb values for agricultural field crops updating standard k c and k cb values formerly tabulated in fao56 extending that information to other crops and crop conditions not previously made available such as for rice as well as update crop characteristics required when formulating a water balance for irrigation planning however the analysis will not include changes in k c due to modification of cropping practices such as the use of mulches residues cover and intercropping these aspects are dealt in a recent article that reviews the impacts of diverse management practices on k e and k c jovanovic et al 2020 another important objective of the current article is to provide k c and k cb information that could be used to determine the upper limit of crop evapotranspiration and therefore help establish a target for the amounts of irrigation water use and support developing water saving practices thus responding to current environment challenges the intention of this review is in providing recent and updated information from the literature on k c and k cb at mid season and end of season for field crops defining specific durations of crop stages for the various crops was not applicable to this paper s scope growth stage lengths for any crop can vary widely from one location to the next and that is why using local observations including remote sensing data such as vegetation index vi is a forefront in fao56 application e g hunsaker et al 2005a b while general recommendations for growth stage lengths were provided in fao56 for most crops many times these stage lengths have been used directly in local studies with resultant claims of poor et c agreement with measurements thus caution is needed consequently it is recommended here to refrain from using the indicative stage durations provided in fao56 but instead use the actual field observations of crop growth stage durations as a function of days past planting or cumulative growing degree days cgdd this section 1 introduction has presented the main concepts relative to crop coefficients that are the basis of the performed analysis and of the adoption of distinct concepts of standard and actual crop coefficients section 2 updates energy limits on et and k c values advection effects and limitations to transferability of k c data focusing on field methods used to determine crop evapotranspiration and therefore the k c and k cb values in addition section 2 updates the required adjustments to standard climate and the procedures and constraints on collecting and handling k c information from literature a review of published k c and k cb for field crops that satisfy the basic requisites for transferability consist of section 3 with crops grouped as grain legumes fiber crops oil crops sugar crops small grains maize and sorghum and rice section 4 presents the tabulated values of the k c mid k c end and k cb mid k cb end resulting from that review taking consideration of the fao56 tabulated values section 5 aims at presenting the consolidated main ancillary data for the same crops finally conclusions and recommendations are made in section 6 2 background for updating the standard single and basal crop coefficients 2 1 limits on maximum values for et and crop coefficients advection effects as previously referred the availability of energy incident at the surface constrains the potential evaporation rate and forces adherence to the law of conservation of energy the basic equation of the balance of energy 6 r n g λ et h shows that the available energy at the surface r n g is the source for both the latent and sensible heat flux respectively λ et and h all expressed in mj m 2 d 1 if λ et exceeds r n g it means that an additional energy is added via convective transfer through the equilibrium boundary layer of air above the surface allen et al 2011b that transfer requires the transport by wind of the required h to the surface to support the conversion to et de bruin et al 2005 thus there is an upper limit on et including under extreme advection due to limitations on aerodynamic transport and on equilibrium forces above a vegetation canopy allen et al 2011b that upper limit on et c is readily approximated by comparing against et o using the crop coefficient values for k c may approach 1 3 for tall dense crops under windy arid and semiarid conditions because of the smooth roughness and small lai of the grass reference crop cf eq 2 in humid climates et is dominated more by net radiation availability and less by aerodynamics and vpd because a grass reference crop has an albedo like that of most crops at full cover and because the primary energy constraint for the et process is net radiation the maximum k c cannot generally exceed 1 2 to 1 3 with added regional advection effects following allen et al 2011b in arid and semiarid climates differences in aerodynamic and surface conductances when coupled with potentially strong regional advection may cause k c to be as high as 1 2 to exceptionally high values of 1 4 for tall dense healthy and well watered vegetation as discussed by allen et al 2011b when et is measured from small expanses of vegetation the internal boundary layer above the vegetation may not be in equilibrium with the surface and may not have developed up to the height of any meteorological or flux instrumentation small expanses of vegetation surrounded by shorter or dry cover may cause a clothesline effect so et and k c may be significantly greater in those conditions than those in large fields this also happens with lysimeters since the vegetation inside the lysimeter may function as a clothesline allen et al 1991a if et estimates are to represent large expanses of vegetation or small stands of vegetation surrounded by mixtures of other vegetation having similar roughness and soil water conditions then k c values must generally be 1 2 1 4 for grass reference these aspects are more fully discussed in the companion paper pereira et al 2021 measured or reported k c above 1 2 in sub humid regions or above about 1 2 to 1 4 in arid regions should cause an intense scrutiny of the et measurements the weather data used to compute et o and the data collection and handling procedures that need for scrutiny is supported by the previously referred recommendations formulated by allen et al 2011b a 2 2 limitations to the transferability of k c due to experimental and reporting insufficiencies research developed in the last 20 years to derive crop coefficients is very abundant however objectives of such studies were diverse used research methods very different with variable accuracy often aiming to obtain k c for local use only in addition they are frequently published with insufficient information relative to methods and instrumentation used weather conditions or about the crops and the cropping practices used it resulted that much of the published material had serious limitations to transferability and hence could not be used in this review due to a variety of reasons 1 adoption of et o equations approaches different than the standard pm et o eq 1 defined in fao56 since a k c is defined as the ratio et c et o eq 2 if the et o equation changes the k c also changes by a value corresponding to the ratio between the selected et o equation and pm et o a good example is provided by shankar et al 2012 who reported disparate k c values for maize and mustard computed for seven et o equations the transferability of the research results is only possible when that ratio is well known 2 using a k c curve relationship different from the standard segmented fao k c curve which implies that only approximate estimations of k c mid and k c end can be made from the reported graphical data but generally not possible from tabulated information 3 using non standard cultivation conditions such as plastic mulches direct planting into crop residues or mulch and intercropping which change crop et and soil evaporation e s thus k c these field practices are obviously necessary to control e s and or to improve infiltration but their influences on k c have to be well documented if transferability is the goal however reported changes in k c are often quite disparate among research papers with the study by feng et al 2019 showing that impacts of plastic mulch on k c of maize may be relatively small 4 when crop management practices deviate from pristine conditions unless k c results could be corrected with the use of k s eqs 3 and 5 as it can often be done through modeling k c values cannot be directly transferred problems for transferability often result from conditions where k c experiments are developed managed and data are handled this is the common case in small size experimental plots inadequate setting and management of lysimeters reduced fetch of energy balance instrumentation towers and the lack of appropriate estimation of soil water fluxes through the boundaries of the control volume affecting the accuracy of the soil water balance swb e g the amount of water passing through the bottom boundary i e deep percolation and capillary rise another common problem relates to the use of remote sensing when using non calibrated vegetation indices and when applications are done without distinction of stressed and non stressed crops these aspects were reviewed by allen et al 2011b evett et al 2012a c and in the companion paper pereira et al 2021 in addition it is often observed that reported descriptions of the experiments are insufficient in terms of both the instrumentation and the approaches used that would provide evidence for the accuracy of measurements although recommendations by allen et al 2011b a could be helpful when the et measurements described in literature studies had questionable accuracy they were deemed to be unacceptable for the use and transfer of the reported k c values presented herein the main problems in achieving crop et accuracy and usable data were found for the following measurement approaches 1 inaccuracies in performing the soil water balance swb as analyzed by evett et al 2012b which include insufficient characterization of the soil hydraulic properties non consideration of the full root zone depth inadequate spacing and or frequency of measurements inaccuracies in measuring the soil water content and or the irrigation applications and rainfall poor estimation of deep percolation fluxes and or gains by capillary rise rough computational approaches and or using an inadequately calibrated and validated model 2 using lysimeters without respect to related requirements for accuracy allen et al 1991b a lópez urrea et al 2006 evett et al 2016 namely having differences in cropping conditions inside and outside of the lysimeter thus affecting vigor and growth of crop vegetation poor settings of the lysimeter without similar vegetation surrounding it thus causing local advection or clothesline effects lack of a fetch such that the equilibrium boundary layer of air cannot be fully adjusted above the lysimeter and or having a high exposed rim that favors advective effects 3 measuring et with the bowen ratio energy balance breb method having inaccuracies payero et al 2003 allen et al 2011b that include insufficient fetch insufficient elevation of instruments above the canopy and less representative measurement of r n and g 4 when measurements are performed with eddy covariance ec systems various corrections and precautions are required alfieri et al 2012 evett et al 2012c burba 2013 kutikoff et al 2019 problems arise when requirements are not respected which include a large fetch to establish an equilibrium boundary layer deeper than the instrument height sufficient elevation of instruments above the canopy performing appropriate data corrections including adjustments for the effects of advection and correcting data for the energy balance closure error rn g λ e h namely caring for the effects of advection 5 the use of remote sensing vegetation indices vis to estimate crop coefficients is now well established mainly with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi hunsaker et al 2005a b calera belmonte et al 2017 and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi glenn et al 2011 linear relationships between the ndvi and k c or k cb are mentioned in numerous studies some of which will be referred to later in the paper however more recently other vis have shown higher correlation with k c and may be more preferable when using images of the sentinel 2 satellite rozenstein et al 2018 a main difficulty for deriving k c or k cb from a vi is improper calibration of the index and also the possibility that vi observations in pixels do not correspond to the crop growing under an approximately pristine condition as for examples provided by hunsaker et al 2005a b 2007 remote sensing energy balance is rarely used to estimate et for deriving k c values but would have similar difficulties to those using vi approaches however good results on k c with energy balance have been obtained as reported by tasumi and allen 2007 reported information and field observations of the crop plant density height and vigor the crop growth stages and cultivation practices are often incomplete or missing thus making it impossible or at least quite difficult to properly assess the reported k c values moreover information on the weather variables during the experimental period is often undocumented in papers particularly so for minimum relative humidity rh min and wind speed at 2 m height u 2 thus making it difficult to adjust the reported k c to climate as proposed in fao56 where it is assumed that k c refers to a standard semi humid climate rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 when accuracy in measuring crop et and in computing et o is poor it often results in high k c values and high k c x et o products occur which largely exceed the energy available at the surface for evaporation as discussed in section 2 1 although very high daily values are possible when advection occurs values of k c above 1 3 may be observed for a few occasional days or over short periods but cannot be accepted as averages for large periods e g over a month or the entire mid season researchers should include the control of observed et through comparing it with the available r n g under advection h may be negative due to transport of heat into the location under study nevertheless k c values affected by advection reflect local conditions and are not transferable 2 3 adjustment to the standard climate fao56 allen et al 1998 assumed that the standard transferable k c mid and k c end as well as k cb mid and k cb end values refer to irrigation management and precipitation frequencies typical of a sub humid climate where rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 thus when local climatic conditions deviate from these values the observed k c values k c mid obs and k c end obs need to be adjusted to become standard k c values k c mid std and k c end std as 7a k c m i d s t d k c m i d o b s 0 04 u 2 m i d 2 0 004 r h min m i d 45 h 3 0 3 7b k c e n d s t d k c e n d o b s 0 04 u 2 l a t e 2 0 004 r h min l a t e 45 h 3 0 3 where u 2 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 rh min is the average daily minimum relative humidity and h is the average plant height m the subscripts mid and late indicate that those averages refer to data observed during the mid and late season respectively when crops senesce and dry out in the field k c end 0 45 no adjustment is necessary for k c end crop height should be observed in the field and tabulated h values often deviate from reality and should not replace field observations similar adjustments apply to k cb thus 8a k c b m i d s t d k c b m i d o b s 0 04 u 2 m i d 2 0 004 r h min m i d 45 h 3 0 3 8b k c b e n d s t d k c b e n d o b s 0 04 u 2 l a t e 2 0 004 r h min l a t e 45 h 3 0 3 papers were checked relative to containing the weather information required to perform the above adjustments to the standard climate climate descriptions were often insufficient and the papers presenting data on the variables used in eqs 7 and 8 i e rh min u 2 and crop height averages for the mid and end season were very rare when that information was not available but weather data relative to the experimental location or a nearby site could be accessed through websites then the reported k c or k cb values were adjusted to the standard climate it is evident that the approximate average climate values then used did not provide for an accurate adjustment but otherwise it would not be possible to perform any approximate adjustment for most of collected information in addition most papers also did not provide information on observed crop heights thus the maximum heights tabulated in fao56 were used for this purpose 2 4 procedures for updating k c and k c b limitations to transferability referred before and further analyzed in the companion paper pereira et al 2021 obliged to a careful review of published material to check when derived k c based upon research performed with adequate accuracy or reported k c values were only of local interest and or representing non standard experimental conditions only k c relative to recognizable potential evaporative crop conditions resulting from optimal pristine cropping practices could be considered selected references were checked to ensure that sufficient descriptions of the practices used to measure et data crop practices and related production environment were provided the reported k c and k cb obtained under non standard conditions such as with mulches crop residues and intercropping are only marginally referred herein were also checked to avoid potential computational flaws and shortcomings in data handling and or in model calibration and validation there is a good number of studies on deriving crop coefficients k c and k cb for field crops however much literature could not be used mainly when studies adopted a reference evapotranspiration different of the grass fao pm or the grass asce pm et o namely the pan et the fao24 penman the alfalfa reference et r or any other locally developed or selected et equation did not adopt the fao56 segmented crop coefficient curve namely when describing k c k cb as a non linear function of time or k c were averaged by month or shorter period in such conditions mainly without graphical presentation that it was not possible obtaining values characterizing the mid season and the end season were performed along a single crop season in climates when the variability of environmental characteristics could lead to varied influences on k c or k cb values lack of appropriate description of experimental agronomic conditions thus when it was not possible to assume that derived k c referred to a non stressed crop well adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions assessed papers refer to a variety of approaches to estimate et c act when methods were insufficiently described and did not allow assessing the sufficiency of quality of performed field work and related data analyses were insufficient papers were discarded the analysis of data included checking the upper values of k c as discussed before when information on lysimeter setting was not stating the area cropping around it or the care for limiting micro scale advection or clothesline effects or about determining the effective evaporation area high k c data were treated as influenced by advection or clothesline effects if various sources of k c for the same crop were available data were discarded if those sources were insufficient then k c or k cb values were reduced by 10 as a rule of tomb to correct excess k c due to less good lysimeter setting and management if k c end k c mid data were necessarily discarded if k c mid 1 40 without appropriate explanation data were discarded namely when lacking adequate description of procedures used with swb breb ec or else that could justify those high values a similar rule of tomb was used to correct k c mid or k cb mid when the reported k c or k cb adjusted for the standard climate produced season averaged 1 40 k c mid 1 25 and or 1 35 k cb mid 1 20 naturally end season values were reduced proportionally in addition to issues dealt above concerning published k c data the following limitations relative to the various methods used to estimate et c act are noted weighing lysimeters wl acceptable data refer to wl installed in large fields where it is possible to assume vertical vapor fluxes however when lysimeter methods were insufficient or when the average k c mid and k c end values largely exceeded those observed by other authors and or tabulated in fao56 related papers were discarded drainage or water table lysimeters dl and wtl data were used when soil moisture observations were performed complementarily to lysimeter observations and information provided was sufficient to assume that local advection or clothesline effects did not affect results as for wl if average k c mid and k c end were excessive related papers were also discarded energy balance from measurements of eddy covariance ec and or bowen ratio breb data were used when proper location of towers was indicated corrections were mentioned and closure error was discussed soil water balance swb data were selected when there was sufficient information on depth and frequency of observations deep percolation was considered and there was some kind of evidence that computed soil moisture dynamics followed that of observations in addition data were from plots having a minimum size to avoid local advection or clothesline effects swb models were selected when evidence of appropriate calibration and validation was given models considered included isareg popova et al 2006 cholpankulov et al 2008 popova and pereira 2011 saltmed silva et al 2013a pulvento et al 2013 2015 and simdualkc rosa et al 2012b 2016 zhao et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 the crop growth yield model aquacrop giménez et al 2017 was also considered data were used when obtained by remote sensing of ndvi or savi when at least two years of observations were performed information allowed an understanding that ndvi or savi were obtained for a non stressed crop and that the relationships between the crop coefficient and the vegetation index were properly calibrated tested 2 5 tabulating collected crop coefficients information it was considered essential to contribute only the best available information collected in other words an adequate identification of the selected studies the retained crop coefficients and the retained related ancillary data for ease in accessing that information sets of tables are used the subscript obs is adopted to identify the collected k c and k cb values reported in literature which were obtained from field observations of et c act aiming at transferability those collected crop coefficients were adjusted to the standard climate using eqs 7 and 8 and are identified with the subscript std thus indicating that such values are standard single or basal crop coefficients for all crops actual k c obs were more often reported than k cb obs likely because the derivation of the latter requires detailed partitioning of et c act performing that partition is quite demanding both in terms of field data collection and in the use of specific computation algorithms which may be incorporated in simulation models e g the simdualkc model collected information are presented in tables for all groups of crops including the common english name and the scientific name of the crop the reference of the selected paper the location where field data were collected which allows a perception of the type of climate the field method used to gather data aimed at estimating et c act as discussed before information on the k c mid obs and k c end obs or on the k cb mid obs and k cb end obs reported in literature and crop coefficient values adjusted to the standard climate thus k c mid std and k c end std or the k cb mid std and k cb end std additional tables are used to provide the collected field information on main ancillary crop parameters that are often used in water balance studies namely for irrigation scheduling purposes and that were consistently proposed in fao56 these parameters consist of maximum root depth z r max m maximum crop height h max m maximum leaf area index lai max m2 m 2 maximum fraction of ground cover f c max and soil water depletion fractions for no stress p at the initial mid season and end season p ini p mid and p end assuming et c 5 mm d 1 unfortunately for many crops that ancillary information is incomplete or even lacking interesting to note that most of ancillary data were provided by studies using a soil water balance approach or when a dual k c approach was adopted 3 review on derived single and basal crop coefficients for field crops 3 1 grain legumes there is a large number of papers reporting on k c of grain legume crops less on k cb it was possible to select a reasonable number of papers that report on the derivation of single and basal crop coefficients for use with the pm et o reference evapotranspiration equation with adequate accuracy most studies refer to soybean the main cropped grain legume more than one paper refers to dry bean chickpea cowpea and fababean while black gram groundnut and pea are the object of single papers unfortunately appropriate studies on k c for green gram and lentil were not available the selected papers mostly used sprinkler irrigation often center pivot systems as well as various surface irrigation methods table 1 selected papers using drip irrigation were found for only two chickpea studies and one soybean study therefore observed k c mostly refer to irrigation conditions where the soil surface is fully wetted however these legume crops generally fully shadow the ground by mid season thus limiting the energy available for soil evaporation there was no evidence of high e s impacts on observed k c mid obs when comparing to the k c mid std while observed differences in k c end std mostly depended on crop management decisions relative to harvesting difficulties relative to assuming an adequate value for k c end std also stem from the fact that k c for the end season was often replaced by a k c value relative to the late season or to maturity or that daily k c values were unexpectedly increased due to a rain event occurring near to the end season other related problems were described earlier in section 1 therefore it was generally more problematic for researchers to produce a proper interpretation of data in estimating k c end obs the actual crop evapotranspiration et c act was field observed through a variety of approaches table 1 drainage lysimeters dl associated with a swb using neutron probes were used by laike et al 2006 in their study on dry bean similarly patil and tiwari 2020 used dl and swb based on capacitance probes measurements for green gram weighing lysimeters wl were used by howell et al 2006 for soybean and by bastos et al 2008 and cavalcante junior et al 2016 for cowpea however results reported by bastos et al 2008 are likely affected by advection and consequently their k c mid obs was empirically reduced by 0 10 garofalo et al 2009 and pandey and pandey 2011 also used wl but in combination with soil water balances swb performed respectively with tdr and gravimetric measurements various studies estimated et c act by performing the swb with or without a simulation model simple swb computations were used by detar 2009 for cowpea with the soil water content swc observed with neutron probes suleiman et al 2013 for groundnuts with swc measured with tdr while zayton et al 2014 and alla jabow et al 2015 measured the swc with a gravimetric approach applied respectively to peanuts and to bean chickpea and fababean studies simulation models calibrated with swb data were reported by silva et al 2013a wei et al 2015 giménez et al 2017 and paredes et al 2017 silva et al 2013a used the saltmed model with swc measured with a capacitance probe while the others used the dual crop coefficient model simdualkc with calibration and validation performed with swc measurements by tdr neutron probes and capacitance sensors respectively other approaches used for determining et c act refer to eddy covariance ec the bowen ratio energy balance breb and remote sensing rs the latter used by tasumi and allen 2007 ec applications are reported by amayreh and al abed 2003 for fababean and by both suyker and verma 2009 and payero and irmak 2013 for soybean odhiambo and irmak 2012 and irmak et al 2013 used breb for the study of soybean the partition of et c act for calculating k cb was performed using diverse approaches most often by adopting the fao56 dual k c approach i e estimating k e from the fraction of ground covered by the crop f c when using simdualkc or saltmed models f c is used as input and k cb is obtained through model calibration as reported by silva et al 2013a for chickpea wei et al 2015 and giménez et al 2017 for soybean and paredes et al 2017 for pea direct applications of the dual k c approach were used by pandey and pandey 2011 with a swb for black gram and by odhiambo and irmak 2012 and irmak et al 2013 with breb applied to soybean the example of k cb and k c derivation for pea paredes et al 2017 illustrates well the usability of models to derive the crop coefficients fig 3 shows the differences between the daily k c values which resulted from the sum of the daily estimation of k cb and k e and the time averaged k c values as used for irrigation scheduling purposes the average k c values do not change along the season because due to frequent precipitation and irrigation a high k e value was observed which maintained k c k e k cb constant throughout the initial and the vegetative period differently during the mid season k e was only residual due to the high fraction of ground covered by the crop f c max 0 98 resulting that k c and k cb values were quite close because pea for industry is to be harvested fresh when the bottom leaves start to senesce the k cb mid and k cb end values are very similar to use the simdualkc model for estimating the pea crop evapotranspiration and related crop coefficients fig 3 the components of the soil water balance were measured taking into consideration the accuracy recommendations provided by allen et al 2011b observations included a the precipitation and net irrigation depths measured using rain gauges placed at the soil surface b the soil water content θ cm3 cm 3 measurements performed weekly throughout the crop season using a previously calibrated diviner 2000 probe sentek pty ltd australia from 0 10 m to a depth of 0 90 m after adequate treatment of collected data the swb model simdualkc was calibrated and validated using independent θ data sets i e one season was used for calibration while the remaining datasets relative to a different season were used for validation of the model in addition to recognizing the approaches used and their potential accuracy it is also important to note that the selected applications were made in a variety of climates and countries in various continents studies on soybean were within major world producing areas including the us central great plains the north china plain and western uruguay in south america the study on fresh pea for industry is from portugal while studies focusing on chickpea k c were also developed in the mediterranean region italy and portugal and in sudan the research on bean and gram is from central brazil ethiopia sudan india and the usa while that on cowpea is from california usa and northeast brazil the study on k c for peanuts comes from georgia usa and those for fababean are from jordan and sudan that variety of research origins helps to assume that the reported applications encompass and represent a large diversity of climates and socio economic management conditions ancillary data are provided by some of the selected studies table 2 however information is scarce but usable to update related data published in fao56 tables of particular interest is the information relative to the fraction p of soil water depletion without causing stress values of reported p indicate that in general soil water depletion for many crops can be relatively large before stress occurs up to 0 50 0 55 which then allows more efficient use of large application depths as made in surface irrigation and non mechanized sprinkler systems new information on root depths z r max for crops is somewhat scarce table 2 data on crop height are also scarce those providing maximum lai indicate that the studies were likely without stress except the chickpea study by silva et al 2013a which may have been under some water stress or had low plant density the values for f c max indicate that related crops covered the ground well except for the above referred case study on chickpea 3 2 fiber oil and sugar crops the review of the literature has shown that a large number of papers relative to deriving k c for fiber crops have been published in the past 20 years mainly for cotton however many of those papers did not assure the accuracy required although a good number could be selected unfortunately not a single paper was available for hemp jute and sisal there are studies relative to linseed however cropped as an oil crop but none referring this crop for fiber i e it was also not possible to update the flax k c and k cb tabulated in fao56 therefore the selected papers on fiber crops refer only to cotton table 3 shows the selected cotton papers that were deemed to satisfactorily provide published information on derived cotton k c as based on pm et o and that included the fao56 k c curve and crop stage data these studies used various irrigation methods mostly sprinkler and surface irrigation basin and furrow with only two papers reporting on subsurface drip irrigation sdi this method is quite expensive but has a large potential to control e s among other benefits several other papers reported using above ground drip irrigation studies on cotton were conducted in several countries kazakhstan uzbekistan brazil syria china israel and in semi arid and arid areas of usa thus referring to the primary producing areas of the world various approaches were used to derive k c from field observations kumar et al 2015 and ko et al 2009 derived k c for well watered cotton with et c act data obtained in weighing lysimeters it is notable to point out how similar the k c data for the mid season were in these two studies table 3 cholpankulov et al 2008 used an energy balance approach to measure et c act in a study area of kazakhstan and performed a swb to compute et c act for a study area in fergana uzbekistan for both cases they derived k c for optimal conditions through calibration and validation of the isareg model the k c values reported by cholpankulov et al 2008 were similar for both semi arid areas for k c mid but differed highly for k c end much lower in the steppe of kazakhstan and higher in fergana likely due to local management practices and high upflow from the shallow water table bezerra et al 2012 determined et c act for a semi arid area in brazil using the breb technique while anapalli et al 2020 and fong et al 2020 used eddy covariance in cotton studies performed in usa detar 2004 in california used five seasons of swb data to derive et c act of cotton under sdi farahani et al 2008 also computed et c act by performing a swb using neutron probe measurements for drip irrigated cotton in syria the study by han et al 2019 used drainage lysimeters combined with swb based on neutron probe observations of the swc and focused on comparing k c for plastic mulch and non mulch conditions the experiments were performed in an oasis and salinity effects on et were assessed with the water and salinity k s proposed in fao56 and analyzed by minhas et al 2020 the 3 year average show small differences in k c between mulch and non mulch table 3 rozenstein et al 2018 derived k c using a combination of field methods ec surface renewal and sap flow and various remote sensing vegetation indices this study provided the lowest cotton k c mid values in table 3 authors affirm that the crop was not water or nutrient stressed thus low values are most likely due to using drip irrigation the derivation of cotton basal crop coefficients k cb based on the fao56 dual k c approach was reported by hunsaker 1999 who performed a swb for a sandy loam soil in arizona usa hunsaker 1999 developed back calculation procedures and used tdr measured surface swc data to separate the soil evaporation and transpiration components from measured et c using the dual k c approach the derived k cb values k cb ini k cb mid and k cb end and the respective k cb curve from that study are shown in fig 4 with k cb mid and k cb end given also in table 3 hunsaker et al 2003 2005a using sdi and basin irrigation respectively provided additional measured cotton k cb data that were derived by swb at the same arid location and used to correlate k cb to ndvi data obtained by remote sensing similarly thorp et al 2017 derived cotton fao56 k cb mid at a nearby sprinkler location in arizona using a swb with neutron probe data howell et al 2004 determined et c act with weighing lysimeters used the fao56 dual k c approach to derive cotton k cb and took advection into consideration at this windy texas location field data used with the swb model isareg cholpankulov et al 2008 were also used by rosa et al 2012b with the simdualkc model which integrates the fao dual k c approach so allowing a derivation of k cb when calibrating the model there is a good number of studies reporting accurately on crop coefficients for oil crops however much of it is for sunflower selected k c and k cb for oil crops are presented in table 3 and include a few crops not previously considered in fao56 camelina linseed and mustard data on k c are much more abundant than those for k cb likely because the derivation of the latter requires et c act partitioning into t c and e s thus basal crop coefficients are only reported for camelina canola linseed and sunflower studies on oil crops refer to diverse environments in various countries reported studies on camelina were performed in arizona usa for canola in australia and spain for castorbean in ne brazil for linseed in india and italy for mustard in india for safflower in india and the usa and for sunflower in china italy india lebanon spain and the usa therefore the selected studies refer to the various main oil crop producing areas of the world most studies were performed using sprinkler and surface irrigation basin and furrow and only a couple of studies used drip irrigation the most common approach used to determine the actual crop et of oil crops is the swb in combination with other methods dl wl rs and breb table 3 for swb studies soil water contents were determined by neutron probe tdr resistance and gravimetric methods were used either solely or in combination e g hunsaker et al 2011 table 3 other selected studies for oil crops determined et strictly by ec or breb methods in addition to the referred studies by tyagi et al 2000a and gupta et al 2017 wl were also used by lópez urrea et al 2020 for canola and by lópez urrea et al 2014 howell et al 2015 and garofalo and rinaldi 2015 for sunflower shankar et al 2012 used drainage lysimeters for deriving k c for mustard and performed the swb with watermark sensors remote sensing was used by hunsaker et al 2013 to obtain k cb values for camelina supported by swb the partition of et c act and related computation of k cb was performed with the fao56 dual kc approach based upon the observation of the fraction of ground covered by the vegetation f c in the wl studies reported by lópez urrea et al 2020 for canola and lópez urrea et al 2014 and howell et al 2015 for sunflower the same approach is incorporated in the simdualkc model used by miao et al 2016 for sunflower where the k cb values result from the model calibration an example for the dynamics of k c k e and k cb for sunflower is presented in fig 5 sunflower et c act values were measured with a large weighing lysimeter lópez urrea et al 2014 daily et c act values were calculated as the difference between lysimeter mass losses from evapotranspiration and lysimeter mass gains from precipitation irrigation or dew divided by the lysimeter area no drainage from the lysimeter tank was recorded during the study period additionally the basal crop coefficient k cb was calculated from the lysimeter k c values described above minus the estimated evaporation component k e values calculated with the fao56 methodology i e based on observed fraction of ground cover f c results in fig 5 show that several irrigation and precipitation events occurred along the season which contributed to soil water evaporation particularly during the crop stages when the f c was small i e when the energy available at the soil surface was higher as observed in table 3 the reported values for k c mid std results for oil crops were very similar particularly when considering an individual crop which also suggests good accuracy in their determination the values for k c end std have a relatively larger variation which results from differences in crop management with harvesting at various maturation conditions the current review found 15 published papers presenting field information on sugarcane crop coefficients during the last twenty years however only four papers could be selected to provide updated k c values but not one was selected for updating k cb observed and adjusted crop coefficients are presented in table 3 the methods used for estimating et c act included weighing lysimeters olivier and singels 2012 surface renewal bastidas obando et al 2017 and breb inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 bastidas obando et al 2017 a swb was performed with the swc sensed with reflectometry probes by silva et al 2013b with capacitance sensors by bastidas obando et al 2017 and with gravimetric measurements by dingre and gorantiwar 2020 inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 collected data at one location in australia and another in swaziland however not covering a full crop season the first location was furrow irrigated and the second was drip irrigated but the respective k c mid values were equal likely because of crop residue mulch effects on k c silva et al 2013b reported on a one year sugarcane study in sao francisco valley brazil where sprinkler irrigation was used however olivier and singels 2012 developed a study in south africa comparing the year of planting and the following year called ratoon showing that k c are greater in the planting year relative to ratoon moreover they compared effects of cane residues mulch and bare soil and concluded that k c are greater by about 0 05 when the crop is cultivated in a bare soil relative to a mulched soil which relates with the control of e s by the organic mulch drip irrigation was used by olivier and singels 2012 another selected paper is that by bastidas obando et al 2017 who compared two locations in south africa where one was drip irrigated and the other was rainfed as expected the k c mid std was smaller by 7 for the rainfed crop observed sugarcane k c mid std were quite coherent namely decreasing with crop residues mulch and in rainfed conditions while the two k c end std values reported were quite similar studies on sugar beet k c are scarce selected studies refer to the use of remote sensing with the model metric tasumi and allen 2007 applied in idaho usa to the use of the swap model where the swb was performed with swc observed with a neutron probe in northern spain utset et al 2007 and to the recent study by wang et al 2021 using weighing lysimeters eddy covariance and remote sensing k cb mid was observed in two studies using ndvi from rs gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 wang et al 2021 and in a multi site swb study based on gravimetric measurements hauer et al 2015 however the selected tabulated data from the latter study refers only to the göttingen site germany table 4 provides for ancillary values relative to the crops whose k c and k cb are presented in table 3 these values are however limited but are usable for creating tabulated information that will help users to perform a swb or to parameterize models e g simdualkc the soil water depletion fraction p is used in fao56 procedures to define the allowable soil water depletion for a crop before water stress occurs the p value is essential for modeling the soil water balance taking into consideration a water stress coefficient k s fao56 however except for cotton and sunflower relatively few of the selected papers for other crops provided such values moreover the reported p values varied in a wide range with small values indicating that water stress was avoided and large ones indicating that water stress could have occurred reported z r max values vary largely on one hand these values tend to be larger when the soil is lighter on the other hand values depend on the accuracy of observation of the small roots with many studies referring to the maximum depth as that providing for most water uptake and others reporting on the effectively observed maximum root depth there is also a large variability of h max measurements may play a role but crop varieties and crop management certainly are of a great impact lai max and f c max certainly vary with crop management and cultivation practices their values denote good crop development i e do not indicate that experiments were subjected to crop stress these ancillary parameters were used later in this paper to update related values previously tabulated in fao56 3 3 small grain cereals in addition to small grain cereals the current review of literature included two pseudo cereals amaranth grain and quinoa not formerly considered in fao56 among the small grains wheat is the most studied crop studies relative to oats rye and millet were not available except as forage crops and therefore were not included herein the observed actual k c mid obs and k c end obs and the respective values adjusted to the standard climate k c mid std and k c end std are presented in table 5 most selected studies estimated k c and only a few reported on k cb values except in wheat wheat studies were grouped into winter and spring wheat since the crop cycles and varieties are quite different in addition the wheat crop studies were grouped according to the duration of the late season shorter when harvesting is performed with high grain moisture that is to give an opportunity for planting the following summer crop or longer when the grain is harvested with low moisture the k c end of the latter is generally smaller than at high harvest grain moisture the reported studies most often used basin furrow or sprinkler irrigation thus generally fully wetting the ground a few studies used drip or sdi as per the cases of amaranth grain quinoa and a few wheat studies the selected studies are from a large variety of countries and environmental conditions amaranth grain was studied in italy and barley in ethiopia the czech republic and portugal the latter country reporting on malt barley for industry quinoa studies were in bolivia and italy and the teff study in ethiopia studies for wheat are from china india iran syria north africa northern and southern europe and the usa that vast origin of studies for wheat allows the assumption that most of the main producing areas were accounted for herein the k c and k cb selected studies for small grain cereals used various approaches for measuring actual crop et the most common approach is the swb using assorted methods to measure the swc such as gravimetry neutron probes tdr capacitance probes and fdr pozníková et al 2014 used the breb method to estimate et c act and the fao56 dual k c approach for its partitioning to then derive k cb ec was used to estimate et c act in various studies namely duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 kjaersgaard et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 and french et al 2020 sánchez et al 2015 used two variations of a simple two source energy balance stseb approach to estimate et c act and its partitioning on e s and t c weighing lysimeters were used in experiments reported by garcia et al 2003 in their studies on quinoa in the bolivian altiplan tyagi et al 2000b focusing on wheat in punjab howell et al 2006 and ko et al 2009 in wheat studies in texas usa and lópez urrea et al 2009 and sánchez et al 2015 for spring wheat in castilla la mancha spain remote sensing was used in wheat k c studies by various authors duchemin et al 2006 and er raki et al 2007 compared respectively k c and k cb values obtained with ndvi with those resulting from ec measurements while hunsaker et al 2005b 2007 compared k cb obtained with ndvi with k cb obtained by the swb using neutronic and tdr measurements of swc drerup et al 2017 also used ndvi calibrated k cb results in comparison with k cb derived from a swb with fdr measurements differently pakparvar et al 2014 used the energy balance with the remote sensing model sebs to derive k c values for wheat chattaraj et al 2013 linked k c and k cb values based on several vis measured with a spectroradiometer to those measured with the swb using neutron probe for swc the recent study by french et al 2020 compared k c based on ec observations in commercial durum wheat fields to daily k cb derived by vi using sentinel 2 and venus satellites to map the vi time series for the entire cropping seasons a few studies with a swb approach used models under these circumstances k c or k cb values are obtained through the calibration of the particular model which eases the processing of field data when performing a soil water balance the first swb model used in this respect was the isareg model where the single k c approach was used for performing the swb simulations e g liu et al 1998 later models adopting the dual k c approach were developed thus where derivation of k cb mid and k cb end are the objects of the calibration the saltmed model was used by pulvento et al 2013 2015 for quinoa and the amaranth grain respectively while the simdualkc model was used for wheat in four papers and for one barley study simdualkc may use et c act as input as adopted by zhang et al 2013 data from zhang et al 2013 in fig 6 shows the results of the calibration of simdualkc model using et c act measured with ec equipment in a winter wheat field with frozen soil during the winter months large differences between the single daily and time averaged k c curves occur particularly during the initial stage which relates to the high soil water content and related k e values during the first half of that stage during the second half of the initial stage k e highly decreases while the availability of water in the evaporation layer also decreases thus daily k c values become closer to k cb values differently during the mid season k e is generally low due to fewer wetting events and higher fraction of ground covered by the crop f c max 0 85 thus k c and k cb time averaged values become even closer the k cb act curve is below the standard k cb curve for only a few days during the late season when water stress occurred when a dual k c simulation model was not used the partitioning of et c act was performed using the fao56 dual k c procedures thus the estimated evaporation component is based primarily upon the fraction of ground covered by vegetation f c and the soil water characteristics of the surface layer this was the approach used by liu and pereira 2000 hunsaker et al 2005b 2007 er raki et al 2007 lópez urrea et al 2009 chattaraj et al 2013 pozníková et al 2014 and drerup et al 2017 however each author developed different purposefully applied computational algorithms reported studies offer a variety of approaches that have appropriate computation accuracy so k c or k cb values vary from one study to another only in a limited range table 5 that variability is usually caused by crop management e g different irrigation methods and different crop varieties to illustrate the influence of the varieties table 5 includes k cb values for three wheat varieties studied at the same location by chattaraj et al 2013 the ancillary parameters reported in the studies referenced in table 5 are shown in table 6 these parameters reflect the management of the cereal crops and may be useful for water balance irrigation scheduling applications reported values for spring and winter wheat root depths z r max varied in a large range from 0 55 to 1 50 m while h max ranged from 0 60 to 1 30 m both ranges reflect the impact of varieties and crop management but z r max also varies with the soil texture and structure the same influences occur for other crops but are not apparent due to the limited number of studies lai max for wheat varied much from 3 5 to 7 1 m2 m 2 while f c max was relatively stable from 0 85 0 98 the soil water depletion fraction for no stress ranged from 0 45 0 80 3 4 maize and sorghum the studies on crop coefficients for maize developed throughout the last decades are very numerous and a large number satisfied the accuracy criteria indicated in section 2 reported k c and k cb values are presented in table 7 where those relative to sorghum are also shown a distinction is made for both maize and sorghum in terms of cropping for grain or for silage due to a very different duration of the late season sorghum studies include a third group referring to sweet sorghum cropped for green energy the main distinction among these distinct groups refers to the k c or k cb at end season with k c end values for silage near k c mid values since the nutritional value of the crop is higher before senescence develops similarly k c end values of sweet sorghum are near the k c mid values because the crop energy value decreases when maturation develops in addition grain maize studies were grouped according to the grain moisture at harvest low grain moisture 15 and high grain moisture 20 where the latter has a shorter late season and therefore a larger k c end than the former indicating differences in the time for the crop to dry out in the field there is also maize produced for human consumption at the table which have k c at harvesting close or very close to the k c mid however new literature on this type of maize cropping was not available as reported in table 7 maize studies originate from a very large number of regions and countries including the more important producing areas of the world differently studies relative to sorghum are more restrictive in terms of their geographical origin though study locations often coincided with some of the maize study areas the majority of reviewed papers reporting on the derivation of k c and k cb for maize used a swb approach and most of the selected papers used some form of modeling the derivation of k c using swb was commonly performed with various swc measurement equipment namely tdr fdr neutron and capacitance probes as well as by using gravimetric measurements examples of deriving k c with swb and not using models are those reported by cameira et al 2003 kar and verma 2005 and gao et al 2009 hou et al 2014 reported on k cb derived using a swb approach combined with transpiration measurements using sap flow sensors and e s measurements with micro lysimeters jiang et al 2014 derived k c through a study involving swb ec and micro lysimeters when swb models were used k c were determined through model calibration with field data followed by required validation using different data sets the model reported for k c derivation was the isareg model and that for k cb determination was the simdualkc model table 7 these applications were used in different climates in various regions of the world a complex approach was reported by ran et al 2017 on deriving k cb with simdualkc where swb data were combined with ec data and with microlysimeters measurements of soil evaporation and sap flow measurements of transpiration differently miao et al 2016 reported on the use of the simdualkc model for deriving k cb for maize both grown alone and intercropped with wheat and present a procedure to compute k cb for the intercropped management chauhdary et al 2020 used the saltmed model calibrated and validated with gravimetric swc measurements a single study was selected on deriving k c mid with a remote sensing energy balance model tasumi and allen 2007 an example on the use of simdualkc for deriving maize k cb and k c through model calibration and validation is given in fig 7 it shows that when the model is calibrated the standard k cb curve i e for optimal conditions fig 7b does not change when water stress occurs fig 7d although k cb act falls below the curve when water stress occurs results from this modeling study paredes et al 2014 determined a p value for non stress of 0 50 table 8 fig 7a shows an appropriate calibration of the model and fig 7c a validation of the model with another data set an earlier study on deriving maize k c using ec measurements was reported by suyker and verma 2009 zhang et al 2013 reported on the use of ec measurements to calibrate and validate the model simdualkc other studies relative to the use of ec data for assessing k c values are those by facchi et al 2013 alberto et al 2014 ding et al 2015 and gong et al 2017 where all but alberto et al 2014 using ec measurements associated with swb observations studies using weighing lysimeters include those by tyagi et al 2003 howell et al 2006 2008 piccinni et al 2009 and anapalli et al 2016 combining lysimeter data with soil moisture observations to better assess the total et partition ding et al 2013 included a swb sap flow measurements for transpiration and et data from weighing lysimeter observations studies on sorghum grain include those by tyagi et al 2000b and howell et al 2008 using weighing type lysimeters in combination with swb based on neutron probe measurements kato and kamichica 2006 studied the k cb and the k e curves in the sorghum grain using the two compartment model of shuttleworth and wallace s w model bashir et al 2008 estimated et of sorghum through remotely sensed data sweet sorghum crop coefficients were studied by piccinni et al 2009 using a wl and a similar approach with a wl was used by howell et al 2008 and lópez urrea et al 2016 differently shenkut et al 2013 used a dl performing the swb using neutron probe data martínez cruz et al 2015 studied four varieties of sweet sorghum using swb with tdr measurements rosa et al 2016 used swc observations with tdr to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model when the experiment with sorghum and with maize silage was developed using saline irrigation and the water and salinity stress coefficients were tested see minhas et al 2020 when studies reported on a range of k c mid std and or k c end std i e when authors did not select the most appropriate values for growth stages and causes for their variability were not identified average k c mid std and k c end std were estimated in addition derived k cb data were used to estimate the k c values in a few cases following the guidelines indicated in section 2 5 results for sorghum show a range of k c mid std values wider than for k cb mid std which likely are due to the effects of rainfall and irrigation on soil evaporation ancillary parameters characterizing both the maize and sorghum crops which are commonly used in related et soil water balance studies are given in table 8 z r max vary in a relatively large range for grain maize 0 6 to 1 5 m and a similar range for maize silage however there are no evident reasons for the extreme variations in values most commonly reported z r max values for maize fall within 0 70 to 1 00 m which compares to 1 0 1 70 m in the fao56 tables for maize grain sorghum z r max table 8 were more consistent than maize except for the lower depth for sweet sorghum reported h max for maize also vary widely which may be related to different crop varieties and water management practices more common reported maize values range from 2 50 to 3 00 m while more extreme height variation primarily depending upon crop varieties and cropping practices these and other factors could also explain the rather large differences in maximum height found for sorghum lai max generally varies from 5 0 to 7 0 m2 m 2 which may indicate that maize crops were not stressed whereas two low lai max values for sorghum may indicate the opposite most frequent f c max values varied from 0 80 to 0 95 which also indicate non stressed sparse crops however these values may be influenced by the measurement procedure the soil water depletion fraction for no stress are mostly around 0 45 0 55 for the mid season but much higher values for p end are reported in a few papers that probably refer to late season crop management issues 3 5 rice 3 5 1 rice irrigation water management practices rice oryza sativa l is a main staple food crop cultivated everywhere in the world when the climate provides for a warm hot crop season of about 4 to 5 months and where water availability is sufficiently abundant typically it is cultivated in flooded paddies but it is cropped in a variety of conditions from deep water with floating rice to aerobic sprinkler irrigation conditions that diversity of rice water management results from the wide range of environmental conditions where rice may be cropped and implies numerous different crop varieties able to respond to the unique environmental requirements and related water management issues a long review of literature is the basis of the current section most of literature on rice crop coefficients are for flooded paddies but k c for a variety of other conditions has been documented an exception is for deep floating rice water management issues considered refer to a permanent flooded paddies which may vary in terms of management of the depth of water in the paddies for saving water and because precise land leveling is often applied that water depth may be reduced from about 0 10 m to less than 0 05 m however that reduction also concerns the effects of paddy water in avoiding low temperature impacts on the crop thus its proper use depends upon the climate in addition to the ability of the irrigators that variability of water depths has little impact on crop et but has great effects on the amount of deep percolation through the root zone bottom and on seepage through the borders of the paddies particularly into the surface drainage system b flooded paddies with dry seeding this is a water saving practice aimed at reducing irrigation during the initial early stages of the crop which leads to reducing the initial crop et thus smaller k c ini however this does not impact lessen et for the remainder of the crop season the adoption of this practice can increase mechanization options for the farm operations since seeding often is performed using an airplane in large farms c flooded paddies with anticipated cutoff greatly reduces irrigation during the late season a water saving practice that also reduces crop et during that stage which generally leads to a low k c end unfortunately very few references to this practice were available and none referred to an appropriate estimation of k c end d intermittent irrigation of the paddies where flooded basin irrigation is applied intermittently to the paddies to keep the soil water content close to saturation this is a water saving practice developed in south china where ponded water is not required for temperature control this practice aims at controlling deep percolation and seepage by avoiding standing water in the paddies except during times when they are flooded since the soil water is maintained close to saturation impacts on et compared to permanent flooding are generally quite small except for the late season because the intermittent paddies dry easier which may lead to a reduced k c end e aerobic rice where rice is cropped like any other grain cereal such as wheat or barley but irrigation is practiced adopting a smaller management allowed depletion mad thus requiring more frequent irrigation applications however rice yields with this practice can be reduced compared to other methods the climate must be such that the temperature is warm enough to not affect growth therefore k c ini k c mid and k c end values approach those for grain crops but can vary depending on the frequency of irrigation events for rice generally higher when sprinkler irrigation is practiced when surface irrigation is used soil and water management practices differ for level vs sloping fields which also influence k c values f rainfed rice where rice is generally cropped in paddy basins which are essential to store all rainfall water and provide its infiltration into the cropped soil so it can be productively used by the rice crop that practice is typical of monsoon climates k c values may be high as for flooded paddies when rainfall helps to keep soil water above the field capacity and k c values become smaller when time intervals between rain wettings are large 3 5 2 review on applications to rice crop coefficient studies are quite numerous but only few studies respond to the exigencies for accuracy defined for this study earlier in this paper or in the companion paper by pereira et al 2021 the review focused on k c et o applications where the pm et o equation is used unfortunately many applications to rice use fao24 et o equations doorenbos and pruitt 1977 or pan evaporation et o without assessing their relationships with the pm et o in addition several studies did not adopt the four segments k c curve adopted in fao56 and preferred a non linear description of k c as a function of time after planting moreover when the fao k c curve was adopted some authors reported either numerically or graphically on a range of values for k c ini k c mid and k c end however if these studies were otherwise sound we were obliged to evaluate the data values interpreting at our best appropriately reported k c values we noticed that advection was rarely considered contrarily with studies developed 20 years ago two classical studies considering the influence of advection in paddies et are those by lourence and pruitt 1971 and peterschmitt and perrier 1991 the first paper refers to an application of the bowen ratio energy balance breb to flooded paddies in california as well as to a weighing lysimeter at davis california the second concerns the application of an energy balance approach to a paddy field at pondicherry india however they are rarely quoted in literature despite that they could be of much interest for more recent studies using breb or eddy covariance observations an earlier review on rice et by tomar and o toole 1979 also referred to impacts of advection these mentioned studies are among the few focusing on crop coefficients where advection effects were considered however these studies were developed prior to fao56 do not refer to the pm et o and their approach to k c follows different concepts therefore the reported k c values were not compared with those in the current literature review more recently a study by tsai et al 2007 on the energy balance of rice paddies in central taiwan reports that corrections of eddy covariance measurements should include a correction for advection and proposed the required procedure alberto et al 2011 suggested possible impacts of advection in flooded rice but their reported k c values are relatively small and do not denote large advection impacts for the los baños area in the philippines likely due to various field observation or data handling flaws many published studies reported k e values of about 1 50 or greater thus largely exceeding the expected values when only vertical heat and vapor fluxes occur such large values are likely due to horizontal advective transport of heat at local or regional scale so sensible heat fluxes h are converted into latent heat fluxes le these conditions can lead to several days with quite high crop et but unlikely to an average et where k c is above 1 40 a reasonable k c upper threshold for hot and windy climates as discussed by allen et al 2011b localized advective impacts also occur when lysimeters or small experimental plots are not well integrated in a vast equally cropped area or when the crop in the study plots develops more than that surrounding cropped area nevertheless increased le or et due to advection is not reported to make k c 1 50 or larger in the referred studies lourence and pruitt 1971 peterschmitt and perrier 1991 tsai et al 2007 alberto et al 2011 for that reason studies having such large k c were excluded from this review in addition to the cases where mid or late season k c are above the referred threshold rice studies were not retained when there was an insufficient or inexistent description of the lysimeter facilities used of the quality control measures adopted and of the data handling procedures applied in fact poor lysimeter settings and management are prone to local transport of heat from the surrounding area including the occurrence of clothesline effects lack of quality control allows that measurements and data handling become prone to errors all these aspects often cause crop coefficients that increase much above expected values allen et al 2011b evett et al 2012a thus reason why it is considered relevant to describe well the lysimeter facilities when reporting related research allen et al 2011a therefore an overestimation of k c may often occur poor or insufficient description of the soil water balance swb approaches used namely roughly known or lack of soil hydraulic characteristics of the location under study insufficient description of computational procedures adopted for each term of the swb as well as insufficient information about the equipment used the swc sensors placement and frequency of observations the corresponding need for information has been also stressed allen et al 2011b a swb inaccuracies cause inaccurate estimations of the water fluxes through the bottom boundary of the soil root zone namely causing underestimation of deep percolation and of lateral seepage which then lead to overestimation of crop et and k c the calibration and validation procedures of any model used to perform the swb are often insufficiently described or at the limit the swb is sometimes performed without reference to soil water observations for such et and k c may be over or underestimated with particular relevance for errors relative to percolation and seepage the description of eddy covariance and breb equipment and of its management and quality control of related observed data were lacking namely not referring to the closure error that is required to assure that accuracy of data was appropriate inaccurate estimation of et and k c may then result despite using good quality sensors et and k c may then be over or under estimated k c values reported in selected studies focusing on the derivation of k c for rice are summarized in table 9 however only two k cb studies were selected vories et al 2013 alberto et al 2014 and related k cb data are also included in table 9 most reported studies refer to flooded rice paddies adopting reduced water depths aimed at water saving tyagi et al 2000a mao et al 2004 vu et al 2005 alberto et al 2011 2014 arif et al 2012 kadiyala et al 2012 hatiye et al 2015 linquist et al 2015 djaman et al 2019 diaz et al 2019 three of those studies report on adopting dry seeding alberto et al 2014 in the philipines linquist et al 2015 in california diaz et al 2019 in brazil rainfed paddies are the object of a study developed in thailand intermittent flooding irrigation is reported in four asian studies agrawal et al 2004 arif et al 2012 hatiye et al 2015 oue and laban 2019 aerobic rice cropping is reported by asian researchers relative to surface irrigation alberto et al 2011 kadiyala et al 2012 choudhury et al 2013 and by europeans relative to sprinkler irrigation spanu et al 2009 moratiel and martínez cob 2013 which coincide with the dominant type of irrigation of rice in asia and europe respectively none of k c referred studies reported advection the occurrence of stress was generally not identified by the authors a variety of et estimation methods were used in the reported studies table 9 a paddy water balance pwb approach was adopted using pairs of microlysimeters with open and closed bottom for assessing deep percolation where twice studies adopted a simplified model with a darcy approach to consider the different behaviors of the plowed layer the compacted layer and the lower layer paulo et al 1995 mao et al 2004 hatiye et al 2015 choudhury et al 2013 also used microlysimeters in combination with the swb when studying intermittent irrigation the use of weighing lysimeters is reported by tyagi et al 2000a and of drainage lysimeters is referred by vu et al 2005 breb was used in the study with rainfed rice attarod et al 2006 more recent studies reported on the use of eddy covariance alberto et al 2011 2014 linquist et al 2015 diaz et al 2019 and surface renewal moratiel and martínez cob 2013 the model ais arkansas irrigation scheduling was adopted by vories et al 2013 who used watermark sensors data to assess soil water content values for rice k c table 9 are quite variable but there is good consistency in k c among many studies however the mid season k c reported by linquist et al 2015 is much lower than those presented by other authors for flooded paddies this was taken into consideration when defining the consolidated k c mid values later k c ini values depend upon various factors that influence evaporation from a free water surface as previously noted in fao56 k c ini tends to increase when climates are dry and windy nevertheless the set of values reported describe insufficiently that initial period and variability of k c ini among studies may relate to differences in defining the initial crop growth stage management may also influence k c ini for flooded rice with the referred exception all values for k c mid std are in a relatively narrow range from 1 11 to 1 29 however for k c end std the range 0 87 to 1 14 is greater due to different management approaches to drain the paddies which depend upon the harvesting practices utilized as well as the target grain moisture at harvesting k c values for non flooded rice vary with the practices adopted and in general standard k c ini and k c end values were lower than for flooded rice on the other hand standard k c mid values were not very different from those for flooded paddies with intermittent irrigation although they were lower in some aerobic rice studies for k c end variability in non flooded rice is also due to management related issues ancillary rice parameters are dealt insufficiently with in literature as per table 10 information on root depths was scarce but it would have been desirable to have comparisons about z r when studies compare intermittent irrigation or aerobic cropping with flooded paddies information about crop heights was also scarce but the available data showed h max to vary in a wide range similarly information on lai max varied much likely due to both management and the crop variety data on f c max was only for a single value relative to the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p a large insufficiency refers to aerobic rice for which no information is available this is unfortunate since a good estimate for p is highly needed to support the development of new irrigation management and cropping practices for rice 4 updated single and basal standard crop coefficients 4 1 grain legumes the updating and consolidation of k c and k cb values for grain legumes was performed comparing the literature reported crop coefficients adjusted to the standard sub humid climate rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 with the k c values tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 table 11 however for some crops appropriate k c observations were lacking and thus the standard fao56 values were either unchanged lentil and dry pea or slightly revised based on our analysis referred to below green bean green gram green cowpea and fresh fababean the available k c values for crops reported in table 1 are well in agreement with those tabulated in fao56 for k c mid from the related analysis mainly considering the literature reported values table 1 it resulted that the standard k c mid values were increased by 0 05 relative to those formerly tabulated in the case of black gram and cowpea but contrarily were decreased by 0 10 for dry bean and 0 05 for fababean k c end values having more complexity due to the variability of observed values and the difficulties in getting true values from literature were mostly unchanged relative to the tabulated ones the exceptions are for pea and soybean whose standard k c end decreased because all reported values were smaller than the tabulated ones in fao56 the available study on k c referred to pea harvested fresh for industry where strict cropping rules apply including for high planting density led to increase by 0 05 both k c mid and k c end reported k cb values from literature were quite limited but the few available generally confirmed the fao56 tabulated values as with k c mid the k cb mid for dry bean and faba bean were slightly decreased while those for black gram chickpea and cowpea were slightly increased an increase of 0 05 of both k cb mid and k cb end was adopted for pea harvested fresh for industry thus in agreement with changes in k c values referred above also the k cb mid values for crops that may be harvested green or dry were equalized since differences for mid season are not justified an exception is for fresh pea that in agreement with industry requirements has now both mid and end k cb values larger than for dry pea due to the disagreement of values observed for various crops for k cb end we could not find sufficient reason to alter them and therefore they were unchanged relative to the fao56 tables 4 2 fiber oil and sugar crops only data for cotton were obtained from literature relative to k c and k cb of fiber crops a sufficient number of reported k c and k cb values for cotton permitted a consolidation of both the mid season and end season values and to avoid the confusion of the former tabulated pairs of values relative to full or deficit water supplied since the latter does not correspond to pristine cultivation and standard crop coefficients viewing that much lower than former fao56 mid season k c were reported for drip irrigated cotton lowering the k c mid to 1 10 is considered appropriate table 12 it is also justifiable to lower k cb mid to 1 05 single values for k c end and k cb end are also assumed as 0 50 and 0 40 respectively which correspond to the lower values tabulated in fao56 however we bear in mind that end season values can vary much with the particular cotton variety and with harvesting opportunity decisions reported literature data on linseed for oil allowed a refinement of the k c mid and k cb mid values for the same crop for fiber denoted as flax in table 12 thus k c mid and k cb mid for flax were decreased by 0 05 but k c end and k cb end remained unchanged relative to sisal no data were available from literature considering the characteristics of this crop an indicative k c and k cb value was assumed corresponding to the average value of the previous fao56 tabulated values selected bibliography provided information on k c and k cb for three oil crops not handled in fao56 camelina linseed and mustard literature data for these crops have the appropriate accuracy requirements for defining the standard k c mid and k c end for all three crops also the new oil crops k c and k cb values were in good agreement with those of the other oil crops reviewed table 12 formerly fao56 tabulated values for canola safflower and sunflower consisted of pairs of k c mid values with the lower one for deficit irrigation which does not correspond to standard k c conditions literature data however allowed a selection of single k c mid values for these crops presumably cultivated under nearly pristine conditions particularly without water stress or low density those single values are slightly smaller by 0 05 than the former tabulated upper value in the case of canola and safflower differently for sunflower the various available studies confirmed the fao56 k c mid value of 1 15 and the k cb mid value of 1 10 the k c mid value for castorbean and sesame were decreased by 0 05 considering the reported data available the k c end values for the oil crops that were in fao56 were kept equal to the fao56 tabulated values since the reported information did not provide data that could justify changes an exception is sunflower in which the k c end value was decreased by 0 05 regarding oil crops basal crop coefficients consolidation options were similar to those for single k c the pairs of tabulated k cb mid values for canola safflower and sunflower were replaced by unique k cb mid values close to the former upper value i e the value representing pristine conditions the k cb mid value for castorbean and sesame were also decreased by 0 05 the k cb mid and k c end values for the newly considered linseed and mustard were obtained from the corresponding k c values following the related fao56 guidelines referred in section 2 above i e by subtracting 0 05 to the k c mid since both crops covered the ground well reducing e s and also by subtracting k c end by 0 05 to define k cb end because commonly there is no rain or irrigation towards the end of the crop season reported k cb data for camelina led to k cb values that would be close to those using the referred fao56 guidelines based on k c results for consolidated k c and k cb values for sugar crops are presented in table 12 the set of k c mid std and k c end std resulting from the bibliography are close to the fao56 tabulated values however the analysis led to decrease the standard k c mid by 0 10 of both sugarbeet and sugar cane and inversely increase by 0 05 the standard k c end of both crops observed basal coefficients are lacking for both crops thus k cb mid and k cb end were also changed similarly to the corresponding k c values the reported data indicated that k c values may be different in the planting and ratoon years smaller in the latter but information was not sufficient to tabulate different values for planting and ratoon years it may be remarked that mid season k c and k cb values for many of the above crops were often decreased relative to the previously tabulated ones this fact reflects the increasing use of drip irrigation thus producing water savings in crop water use that induces smaller mid season k c and k cb values compared to other irrigation systems 4 3 cereals the updated k c and k cb for the mid and end season values for cereals resulting from the previous review analysis are presented in table 13 together with the range of the observed values adjusted to the standard climate and the fao56 tabulated k c and k cb overall only small changes relative to the tabulated fao56 were required for updating the standard k c and k cb from those formerly tabulated data for amaranthus grain quinoa and teff were reported and therefore are newly tabulated based on the available information the most reported k c and k cb data are for the most highly cultivated crops wheat and maize as previously defined distinction is made when harvesting is made with low or high moisture grain while the consolidated wheat and maize k c and k cb values for mid season were the same as in fao56 some of the k c and k cb for the end season were updated depending on grain moisture it is important to note that various papers reporting high k c mid or k cb mid for wheat and maize did not refer to the possible influence of advection on their results thus consolidated values for k c mid or k cb mid of these cereal crops were not increased relative to fao56 because regional advection is likely to have occurred in the related dry and hot areas a recent study on maize in hetao a hot and arid irrigated area of the upper yellow river in northern china demonstrated an important advection occurrence wang et al 2020 silage maize has a lower k c mid than grain maize the same occurs for silage sorghum relative to grain sorghum differently k c end values for silage maize and silage sorghum were set closer to the k c mid values the same was set for sweet sorghum k cb values were in agreement or when not available were computed using the guidelines expressed in fao56 and presented in section 2 reported data for barley led to decrease the values of k c mid and k cb mid by 0 05 relative to fao56 for this reason these values are now slightly smaller than for wheat similarly k c mid and k cb mid were also decreased for oats relative to fao56 however k c end and k cb end of both barley and oats were kept equal to those values for wheat harvested with low grain moisture the k c values for rye were added on the basis of non cited material data were not available for pearl millet resulting that k c and k cb were not changed from fao56 4 4 rice the updated single and basal crop coefficients for the various types of rice irrigation methods are presented in table 14 respectively and the values can be compared with the k c and k cb values shown in round brackets in table 14 that were tabulated for flooded rice paddies in fao56 allen et al 1998 table 14 also includes the range of values observed in the cited field studies after adjustment to the standard climate rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 as seen in table 14 the updated k c values correspond well to those observed when the related papers were not limited in number the updated k c mid season values for flooded and intermittent irrigation methods are the same as for flooded paddies in fao56 but were decreased by 0 10 for aerobic and rainfed conditions the k c ini except in permanent flooding were decreased depending on irrigation method relative to the fao56 initial value however k c end are somewhat higher than the highest end value of 0 90 in fao56 except for rainfed rice related literature observations were lacking for all rice k cb values thus our updated k cb mid values table 14 were defined by assuming k cb k c 0 05 as was done in the fao56 k cb table while the fao56 table decreased k cb end by 0 15 0 20 from k c end updated values were decreased 0 10 0 15 below the k c end varying with irrigation method very differently because the fao56 tabulated value for k cb ini was exclusively dedicated to flooded paddies it was defined in such a way that the paddy water evaporation was not considered distinctively separate from the plant transpiration thus fao56 tabulated value was k cb ini 1 00 however at present various and different irrigation methods are considered namely dry seeding intermittent irrigation aerobic rice and rainfed paddies these approaches correspond to different amounts of water evaporation thus to different k e values users of k cb having an initial value of 0 15 are therefore advised to consider k e values that represent the paddy water evaporation and soil water evaporation for instance the fao56 tabulated value for flooded rice implies that k cb ini is 0 15 and k e would be equal to 0 90 thus resulting k c ini 1 05 a smaller k e should be considered for other irrigation methods depending on the amount and frequency of irrigation and rainfall events thus resulting in a smaller k c ini for dry seeding intermittent irrigation aerobic rice and rainfed paddies a rough estimation is that when wettings are frequent k e would be about 0 90 resulting in k c ini 1 05 and when wettings are less frequent k e would vary around 0 60 0 70 which translates to k c ini values ranging between 0 75 0 85 overall despite the limitations due to the diversity of conditions reported in literature present authors are convinced that the proposed crop coefficients can be very useful for further developments in the domain of rice evapotranspiration and water management unfortunately the absolute lack of data impeded any chance to characterize floating rice et 5 updated ancillary data values for ancillary crop data reported in the quoted studies were tabulated in tables 2 4 6 8 and 10 for grain legumes fiber oil and sugar crops small grain cereals maize and sorghum and rice respectively these tabulated values were then consolidated by crop and combined in table 15 for all the crops except rice whose data are provided in table 16 for each crop values are presented for the range of observed maximum root depths z r max crop heights h max ground cover fractions f c max and mid season p fraction of soil water depletion for no stress for rice table 16 the data are separated for three conditions flooded paddies intermittent irrigation and aerobic rice these ranges of reported values were compared with the fao56 tabulated z r max h max and p fractions therefore resulting in updated values for these three ancillary parameters which could be quite useful in characterizing crop conditions when performing a swb for irrigation planning and management when related observations are not available in general observed root depths were similar to the fao56 tabulated ones updated z r max values are given as a range with the smaller value more appropriate for heavy soils and more frequent irrigation and larger values for light soils and or larger intervals between irrigations differently updated maximum crop heights are mostly given with a single value however crop varieties may be very distinct in different parts of the world and for several crops a range of h max values is given the indicative values provided for z r max and h max should be used with care because they vary much with the crop variety environmental conditions and crop management single values are given to the p fractions which refer to the crop et of 5 mm d 1 and should be modified following the guidelines in table 22 of fao56 values in table 15 are indicative and should be compared with measured observations whenever possible updated values for rice are also based upon those proposed in fao56 and those reported in the current bibliography notably updated root depths are largest for aerobic rice however crop height is reduced for aerobic rice also considerably higher allowable soil water depletion higher p value is associated with the aerobic condition however users are called upon to make the necessary parameter modifications whenever necessary 6 conclusions and recommendations the first conclusion drawn from the present study is that the performed crop coefficient review essentially confirms the tabulated k c and k cb values in fao56 allen et al 1998 although the updates we propose often show small differences relative to fao56 secondly the review results added new k c and k cb data for several crops that were unavailable in the literature prior to fao56 publication this was the case for three important oil crops camelina linseed and mustard for two increasingly popular pseudo cereals amaranth and quinoa and for an emerging grain cereal teff clearly with so many new crops emerging in recent years reviews like the present one will be needed soon to help extend k c et o application to these crops greater differences between the fao56 rice k c values and those presently provided occur because our updated values unlike fao56 include various water management alternatives to continuous flooding that are generally aimed at water saving e g flooded paddies with dry seeding flooded paddies with anticipated cut off intermittent irrigation of paddies irrigation of aerobic rice by flooding furrows or sprinkling as well as rainfed rice in monsoon areas no data were available for floating rice relative to maize and sorghum crop coefficients a distinction has now been made between production for grain silage and energy uses relative to maize and wheat for grain k c distinctions are now made to characterize the late season water use differences in cases when harvest is made with high or low moisture thus with short or long duration of the late season and the consequent larger or smaller k c end value similarly for gram and cowpea legumes the distinction is also made relative to green and dry harvests because the latter have a longer late season and a k c end smaller than green the organization of the crop coefficient and ancillary data in the present study expands the knowledge base beyond that provided in fao56 on the one hand in addition to the consolidated k c and k cb values tables are also presented to show the standard values for the mid season and the end season obtained from the reviewed research after conversion to the standard sub humid climate with rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 this information allows readers to have a better perception of the different environmental conditions from which data used to consolidate k c and k cb values were obtained on the other hand ancillary data available from the cited literature are also tabulated in complement to the observed standardized k c values thus also allowing readers to have some however limited insight of the experiments the primary ancillary data refer to crop rooting depths crop heights and the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p for ease in transferring information to readers and users all consolidated table data are compared with the ranges of values observed in the reviewed literature and with the fao56 tabulated values in addition readers can easily identify in tables the various locations around the world where the crop coefficient research was conducted all k c and k cb values reported were obtained using the fao56 grass reference evapotranspiration definition and the consequent pm et o equation studies using any different et o equation and computational procedure were not used because results could likely deviate from those of the pm et o equation this constraint allowed the literature reported k c and k cb values to be compared for the same or similar crop and more importantly to be compared with the fao56 tabulated values since the field and computational research procedures of the related studies satisfied the basic requisites for accuracy in determining crop et from field research the reported k c could be appropriately computed and used to obtain the consolidated standard values tabulated herein therefore the k c and k cb values proposed in the current study consist of the best set of standard values for every crop relative to the mid season and end season that can be appropriately transferred and used worldwide transferring implies that the standard k c and k cb values need to be adjusted to the local climate eqs 7a through 8b and when the crop is not cultivated in pristine conditions their use also requires adoption of a stress coefficient e g eq 3 and or eq 5 the current review confirmed the appropriateness of clearly distinguishing actual from standard crop coefficients with the latter referring to crops cultivated in pristine conditions in which evapotranspiration may well be considered the potential et of the considered crop under given environmental conditions however there is very abundant literature not quoted where this distinction is not made and where the k c correspond to cultivation practices far from pristine due to water stress salinity stress or stresses produced by various insufficiencies of agronomic nature therefore making the observed to be not transferable k c the review particularly for papers not selected allowed perceiving that the distinction between actual and standard k c or between standard and potential et c is not adopted by many researchers this alone makes it inappropriate to transfer the research results from one location for use in another in addition the review has shown that differences between k c observed and those adjusted to the standard climate may be large particularly when observations are performed in arid and windy conditions for those reasons it is very important that k c papers include appropriate description of methods used and of the climate during experimentation the review has shown that use of well calibrated and validated swb simulation models e g the simdualkc model makes it possible to derive standard k c and k cb values despite the occurrence of water and salinity stress in the experiment more research with focus on the use of these swb models would be welcome since the current review found only relatively limited use of models such models in addition have been successfully applied for irrigation planning purposes and for real time irrigation scheduling and they can incorporate and utilize information based on remote sensing data remote sensing observations in real time could be especially useful in defining growth stage dates and lengths at various locations in the review it was demonstrated that many k c researchers often fail to scrutinize the k c values obtained the k c values much higher than reality could be due to either flaws in field measurements or to advection influences for example it was observed that exceptionally high k c values were often reported in papers where the description of methods employed was insufficient which may relate to absence of scrutiny of research results on the other hand the higher reported k c may be a function of local advection impacts that were rarely considered or mentioned in research performed during the last two decades therefore k c researchers are again strongly encouraged to include a careful and thorough inspection of results including the time dynamics of et that should provide for a better analysis on the accuracy of et estimation moreover since energy balance methods mainly ec and breb are becoming the choice of et measurement in research it is recommended that in addition to the scrutiny of et measured data the dynamics of the energy balance be explored to verify when latent heat exceeds the available energy r n g and or when sensible heat becomes negative so by identifying periods when et was influenced by advection it is then possible to correct measured et and very high k c values can then be avoided it became apparent from the review that the definition and computational procedures relative to the pm et o equation were often not followed numerous k c studies included comparative assessments of et equations thus not focusing on the derivation of k c on the pm eto equation naturally using an et o different than the pm et o results in k c values non comparable with the tabulated standard ones while transferability of research results is hampered when a different et o is used using the fao56 tabulated standard k c with a different et equation leads to over or under estimation errors in using the k c et o approach it is therefore recommended that research using a different reference et equation should consider the ratio of that et o to the pm et o equation doing this provides a means to convert the k c data making them comparable with tabulated standard values the best use of the k c et o method implies using the segmented fao k c curve i e accepting the definition of the four crop growth stages and the definition of three k c values k c ini k c mid and k c end using time averaged monthly k c values or non linear k c functions of time may be adequate for local use but these are very difficult to use predictively in different locations the fao k c curve is also difficult to use predictively due to inter annual weather variability inducing variable durations of the crop growth stages however this difficulty may be overcome when expressing growth durations in terms of cumulative growth degree days or with the use of remotely sensed vegetation indices these methods consist of areas of research already underway for various field crops and that should be extended to other crops as well tabulated k c values in this article basically refer to surface sprinkler and less often drip irrigation the use of mulches could not be considered for tabulated k c but the effects of mulches were small because reported literature on k c values refer to the mid and late season where the cover fraction is generally high nevertheless the impacts of mulches and related water management issues described in section 10 of fao56 are considered valid and appropriate however various reported studies provide for comparing impacts of irrigation methods and mulches which may add to what was provided in the referred fao56 section further research is required on the use of mulches but better focused hopefully on impacts on transpiration and soil evaporation with consideration of the fraction of soil wetted and the fraction of ground cover by the crop research should aim at obtaining high accuracy et estimation and partitioning and should focus on few relevant variables in such a way that impacts on k c k cb values could be well recognized and related results transferred to other locations at present mulch effects are often studied with focus on a large number of variables despite limitations of this review it is recommended that users apply the updated k c and k cb values to determine the upper limits of crop evapotranspiration when planning irrigation programs and in real time management of irrigation scheduling avoiding the use of high k c above 1 25 which have no physical justification as analyzed may lead to saving irrigation water it is informative to note that maximum k c and k cb values for major field crops such as wheat have not changed much from those given 22 years ago in fao56 the data used for the tabulated fao56 k c values obtained in studies over 40 50 years ago generally agree with current studies which suggests little effect of climate change induced differences on the ratio of et c et o however when facing climate change challenges and related environmental consequences such as reduced water resources it is imperative that methods like fao56 be considered as a means to manage productive crops with efficient irrigation water use to face global change water conservation and saving are definitely necessary declaration of competing

10414,this study reviews the abundant research on fao56 crop coefficients published following introduction of the fao56 paper in 1998 the primary goal was to evaluate update and consolidate the mid season and end season single k c and basal k cb crop coefficients tabulated for many field crops in fao56 the review found that the prevalent approach for estimating crop evapotranspiration et c is the fao56 k c et o approach i e the product of the k c and reference evapotranspiration et o the fao56 k c et o approach requires use of the fao56 pm et o grass reference equation with appropriate crop specific k c and or k cb reviewed research provided various approaches to determine k c and k cb and used a variety of actual crop et etc act measurements significant attention was placed on accessing the accuracy of the field measurements and models used in these studies accuracy requirements upper limits for k c values and related causal errors are discussed conceptual approaches relative to k c transferability requirements are provided with focus on standard crop conditions and use of the fao56 segmented k c curve papers selected to update k c k cb used the fao56 pm et o provided accurate measurements to determine and partition etc act and satisfied transferability requirements selected observed k c and k cb values were converted to standard sub humid climate as adopted in fao56 observed values with respect to tabulated fao56 k c and k cb were used in consolidating updated values for crops within general categories of grain legumes fiber crops oil crops sugar crops small grain cereals maize and sorghum and rice ancillary data e g maximum root depth and crop height were also collected from selected literature and tabulated results showed good agreement between updated and original tabulated fao56 k c and k cb confirming the reliability of the fao56 values this indicates change in the k c et c et o ratio of crops has not occurred due to climate change during the past sixty years new k c k cb data for crops not included in fao56 are also now presented for several oil crops and pseudo cereals the approach adopted for rice differs from fao56 because consideration was given to the numerous rice water management practices currently used and thus k c k cb values for the initial season of rice were also presented the review also observed that many research papers did not satisfy the adopted requirements in terms of et o method and or the accuracy of etc act determinations and therefore could not be used thus emphasis is placed on adopting improved accuracy and quality control in future research aimed at determining k c data comparable to presented values the transferability of standard k c and k cb has been assured for the values tabulated herein improved future applications of the fao56 k c et o method should consider remote sensing observations when available particularly in defining crop growth stages at given locations keywords transferability of standard k c upper limits to k c research accuracy requirements grain legumes fiber and oil crops sugar crops cereals rice 1 introduction in the field agricultural practice crop evapotranspiration et c is computed or modeled using weather data and algorithms that describe the aerodynamic characteristics of the vegetation and surface energy driving et c one of the most adopted computational procedures is the one proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 as recently reviewed by pereira et al 2015a and relative to the use of models by pereira et al 2020a the fao method uses the k c et o approach where et c is the product of a crop coefficient k c by the grass reference evapotranspiration et o et o represents the primary weather induced effects on the evapotranspiration rate of the grass reference crop and the crop coefficient k c scales the reference et o to account for crop specific influences on et c resulting from the differences in aerodynamic and surface resistances between the considered crop and the reference grass crop allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 during the crop growing season the et o mm d 1 is defined as the evapotranspiration rate of the grass reference crop which is assumed as a hypothetical grass crop with a height of 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing adequately watered and completely shading the ground allen et al 1998 daily et o is computed with the pm et o eq 1 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n g is the net balance of energy available at the surface mj m 2 d 1 t is the mean daily air temperature c at the reference height of 2 m e s e a represents the vapor pressure deficit vpd of air kpa at 2 m height u 2 is wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship at mean air temperature kpa o c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa o c 1 the most commonly used time step in the field practice and related water balance modeling pereira et al 2020a is daily because only vertical fluxes of heat and vapor are considered in the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1965 as parameterized for the grass reference crop to produce the pm et o in eq 1 advective heat energy fluxes are not considered in et o pereira et al 1999 defining k c as the ratio of et c to et o and expressing et c and et o in terms of the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1965 it becomes evident that k c varies throughout the crop season with the aerodynamic and surface resistance of the crop and the reference crop pereira et al 1999 2 k c e t c e t o δ c r n c g c ρ a c p e s e a c r a c δ c γ 1 r s c r a c δ o r n o g o ρ a c p e s e a o r a o δ o γ 1 r s o r a o where r n g e s e a δ and γ were defined above ρ a is air density c p is specific heat of air r a is aerodynamic resistance to heat and vapor transport from the surface to z height and r s is bulk surface resistance the subscripts c and o are respectively for the actual crop vegetation in the numerator and the grass reference crop in the denominator this ratio eq 2 allows visualizing that k c represents an integration of the effects of three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference 1 crop height that affects roughness and aerodynamic resistance 2 leaf area fraction of ground covered by the vegetation f c leaf age and condition degree of stomatal control and soil surface wetness which determine bulk crop soil surface resistance r s and 3 albedo of the crop soil surface which influences r n and depends upon by f c and soil surface conditions the derivation of k c is generally done using empirical approaches that must be consistent relative to the above presented theoretical background however this consistency is often not referred to in related crop coefficient literature two k c approaches are considered in fao56 fig 1 the time averaged single k c which includes multi day effects of soil evaporation in addition to plant transpiration and the dual k c consisting of a basal crop coefficient k cb and an evaporation coefficient k e defined respectively as k cb t c et o and k e e s et o with k c k cb k e where t c is crop transpiration and e s is soil evaporation considering eq 2 it is evident that k c varies throughout the crop season since parameters of the crop in the numerator will change with the growth of the crop until its maximum development and with crop maturation until harvest at the end season differently by definition the parameters of the reference crop in the denominator remain unchanged fao24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and later fao56 allen et al 1998 proposed to describe the time variation of k c using a segmented crop coefficient curve fig 1 it applies to both the single time averaged k c and the basal k cb because e s depends upon the fraction of ground cover on the soil wettings amount of water in the evaporation layer of the soil as well as on soil hydrodynamic characteristics k e varies with these conditions showing peaks in relation to soil wetting events the k c and k cb curves consist of four linear segments representative of the four crop stages identified in fig 1 initial from planting to 10 cover crop development up to full development mid season until senescence starts and late season until end season i e harvesting to draw the segmented curves it is required to know only the values of k c at the initial mid season and end season respectively k c ini k c mid and k c end k c ini essentially depends upon e s since t c is then very small and its average may be represented by a horizontal segment during the mid season the ratio et c et o has relatively small changes and k c mid may also be approximated by a horizontal segment k c end corresponds just to the end of the whole crop cycle however not exactly that on the harvesting day but an approximate trend value when precipitation occurring just by that end day or close to it would increase disproportionally the k c end value the k c end value should not be confounded with the average k c for the entire late season stage because this would largely overestimate k c end though mainly when the crop is harvested dry or close to it as shown in fig 1b naturally this guideline refers to both k c and k cb the advantage of the segmented k c curve is that it just requires knowing three values those at the initial stage k c ini k cb ini at mid season k c mid k cb mid and at harvesting or end season k c end k cb end k c values during crop development and late season stages are then just linearly interpolated fig 1b however the fao k c curve is not adopted by many researchers particularly when the objective is obtaining k c values to be used with the local climate alternative usage to the fao56 curve structure consists of a monthly k c averages whose values are tied to the local climate and thus cannot be transferred to other locations b functions relating k c with time whose values cannot be transferred because they depend upon the local climate only c functions relating k c with f c or a similar indicator as reviewed by pereira et al 2020b relative to assessing k c from ground cover and height and d in addition to k c mid using average values for the crop development stage and the late season which then do not allow a means to estimate respectively k c ini and k c end as shown in fig 1b nevertheless when graphical representations of cases a b and or c are produced in papers a reader may then roughly estimate the values for k c ini k c mid and k c end to draw the k c curve fig 1 it is required to know the time durations of the crop stages respective indicative values for crops were tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 and in publications by allen et al 2007 and jensen and allen 2016 however those tabulated values are just indicative to be used in first step planning when field observations are not yet available those publications refer to the need for observing actual stage durations through field surveys thus users should refrain from using indicative durations which may deviate much from actual ones but use actual field observations alternatively for planning purposes time durations may be replaced by cumulative growing degree days cgdd characterizing the crop growth stages as earlier reported in many applications in literature namely as early proposed by sammis et al 1985 when adopting the dual k c approach it is essential that partitioning et into transpiration and soil evaporation be performed accurately various methods may be applied as reviewed by kool et al 2014 they report on methods that like fao56 are based upon the relationship between e s and f c allen et al 1998 2005a b as well methods that require the use of specific instrumentation adopt a double source model or use isotopes modeling plays a main role as in the case of using a soil water balance model like simdualkc rosa et al 2012a paredes et al 2014 pereira et al 2020a while the use of remote sensing vegetation indices allows accurate estimation of k cb hunsaker et al 2005a b 2007 french et al 2020 lópez urrea et al 2020 k c and k cb are subject to a large number of influencing factors as summarized in fig 2 for k c at each growth stage during the initial stage the variability of k c ini relates to soil evaporation and factors controlling it such as frequency of rainfall and irrigation wettings use of plastic mulches plastic tunnels organic mulching soil residues management frequency and depth of irrigation applications and fraction of soil wetted by irrigation with such a variety of influencing factors it is not possible to tabulate values for k c ini and it is not possible to derive related values from published papers fao56 provided indicative k c ini values corresponding to the most common conditions i e when surface irrigation was used and the soil was maintained bare however in many studies researchers considered indicative k c ini as recommended values and thus may have used them erroneously therefore tabulated k c ini values are not proposed herein instead the k c ini computational procedures proposed by allen et al 1998 pg 114 121 2005b are recommended for users simple models can be used for that purpose for the dual k c approach the value k cb ini 0 15 is recommended since it averages conditions from bare soil and fraction of ground cover f c up to 0 10 and it is assumed to include diffusive or residual evaporation from soil for potentially long periods following wetting allen et al 2005a however under dry conditions with long periods between wettings or during the non growing season k cb ini can be set much lower even close to 0 differently k e should be computed taking into consideration all the factors affecting soil evaporation as detailed by allen et al 1998 2005a fao56 allen et al 1998 adopted the concept of standard k c vs actual k c k c act in correspondence with potential crop et et c vs actual crop et et c act et c and k c refer to optimal well watered conditions and pristine cultivated crops while et c act and k c act refer to crop conditions that are often not pristine due to insufficient or non uniform irrigation rainfall failures soil and water salinity as well as non optimal soil and agronomic management practices including crop density planting date seed quality and weed and disease control in addition to these factors niaghi et al 2019 assessed impacts of controlled drainage and related sub irrigation on et c act and k c act of maize as expected from cultivation with high water table k c act k c optimal are reported naturally only standard k c and k cb values may be transferred to other sites and therefore be tabularized as presented in fao56 k c and k c act as well as k cb and k cb act are related through a stress coefficient k s depending upon the sufficiency of available soil water to maintain the crop et rate at potential thus it results 3 k c act k s k c k s k cb k e where it is evidenced that when the dual k c is adopted k s only applies to the transpiration coefficient k cb when referring to water insufficiency only k s is defined allen et al 1998 as 4a k s taw d r i taw raw if d r i raw 4b k s 1 if d r i raw where taw and raw are respectively the total and readily available soil water relative to the rooting depth mm with raw p taw p is the soil water depletion fraction for no water stress and d ri is the soil water depleted from the root zone at the end of day i mm when salinity also affects et allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 then 5 k s taw d r i taw raw 1 b k y 100 ec e ec e threshold where k y is the yield response factor describing the relationship between the relative yield decrease with the relative evapotranspiration deficit doorenbos and kassam 1979 ec e threshold ds m 1 is the soil ec e value from where crop production starts to be affected by salinity and b is the percent rate of yield decrease relative to the ec e excess relative to ec e threshold ds m 1 indicative values for those parameters are updated and tabularized by minhas et al 2020 eqs 4 and 5 above make it evident that k c act values cannot be transferred when a crop has an et rate inferior to potential due to crop and water management and or salinity impacts the standard fao56 tabularized k c mid k cb mid and k c end k cb end values refer to irrigation management and precipitation frequencies typical of a sub humid climate where minimum relative humidity and wind speed at 2 m height are respectively rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 as defined in fao56 allen et al 1998 under humid and calm conditions the k c mid for full cover crops generally exceed 1 0 by only 0 05 to 0 10 approximately because full cover crops and the reference crop behave similarly regarding absorption of short wave radiation the primary energy source for evaporation under humid and calm conditions allen et al 2011b differences in et caused by differences in the aerodynamic resistance r a between the agricultural and the reference crop are also small because the vpd is then small thus the values of k c are less dependent on differences between the aerodynamic components of et c and et o eq 2 on the contrary under arid conditions such differences in r a are more pronounced because the vpd is then large hence k c will be larger under arid conditions mainly for tall crops that are more subjected to wind effects in terms of replacing the saturated air close to the leaves with drier air thus accelerating evaporation fluxes then k c values may not exceed 1 0 by more than about 0 25 as discussed by allen et al 2011b a and in the companion paper pereira et al 2021 unless advection occurs adding energy for evaporation k c obtained under advective influences are much too large and therefore are not transferable during the last two decades much research has been performed to develop and update crop coefficients however with diverse objectives and using a variety of field methods and approaches to derive k c and k cb from research results it is therefore opportune to assess such research select recognized advances and results including when approaches were not in agreement with the fao56 methodologies thus the objectives of this study consist of evaluating the progress in deriving k c and k cb values for agricultural field crops updating standard k c and k cb values formerly tabulated in fao56 extending that information to other crops and crop conditions not previously made available such as for rice as well as update crop characteristics required when formulating a water balance for irrigation planning however the analysis will not include changes in k c due to modification of cropping practices such as the use of mulches residues cover and intercropping these aspects are dealt in a recent article that reviews the impacts of diverse management practices on k e and k c jovanovic et al 2020 another important objective of the current article is to provide k c and k cb information that could be used to determine the upper limit of crop evapotranspiration and therefore help establish a target for the amounts of irrigation water use and support developing water saving practices thus responding to current environment challenges the intention of this review is in providing recent and updated information from the literature on k c and k cb at mid season and end of season for field crops defining specific durations of crop stages for the various crops was not applicable to this paper s scope growth stage lengths for any crop can vary widely from one location to the next and that is why using local observations including remote sensing data such as vegetation index vi is a forefront in fao56 application e g hunsaker et al 2005a b while general recommendations for growth stage lengths were provided in fao56 for most crops many times these stage lengths have been used directly in local studies with resultant claims of poor et c agreement with measurements thus caution is needed consequently it is recommended here to refrain from using the indicative stage durations provided in fao56 but instead use the actual field observations of crop growth stage durations as a function of days past planting or cumulative growing degree days cgdd this section 1 introduction has presented the main concepts relative to crop coefficients that are the basis of the performed analysis and of the adoption of distinct concepts of standard and actual crop coefficients section 2 updates energy limits on et and k c values advection effects and limitations to transferability of k c data focusing on field methods used to determine crop evapotranspiration and therefore the k c and k cb values in addition section 2 updates the required adjustments to standard climate and the procedures and constraints on collecting and handling k c information from literature a review of published k c and k cb for field crops that satisfy the basic requisites for transferability consist of section 3 with crops grouped as grain legumes fiber crops oil crops sugar crops small grains maize and sorghum and rice section 4 presents the tabulated values of the k c mid k c end and k cb mid k cb end resulting from that review taking consideration of the fao56 tabulated values section 5 aims at presenting the consolidated main ancillary data for the same crops finally conclusions and recommendations are made in section 6 2 background for updating the standard single and basal crop coefficients 2 1 limits on maximum values for et and crop coefficients advection effects as previously referred the availability of energy incident at the surface constrains the potential evaporation rate and forces adherence to the law of conservation of energy the basic equation of the balance of energy 6 r n g λ et h shows that the available energy at the surface r n g is the source for both the latent and sensible heat flux respectively λ et and h all expressed in mj m 2 d 1 if λ et exceeds r n g it means that an additional energy is added via convective transfer through the equilibrium boundary layer of air above the surface allen et al 2011b that transfer requires the transport by wind of the required h to the surface to support the conversion to et de bruin et al 2005 thus there is an upper limit on et including under extreme advection due to limitations on aerodynamic transport and on equilibrium forces above a vegetation canopy allen et al 2011b that upper limit on et c is readily approximated by comparing against et o using the crop coefficient values for k c may approach 1 3 for tall dense crops under windy arid and semiarid conditions because of the smooth roughness and small lai of the grass reference crop cf eq 2 in humid climates et is dominated more by net radiation availability and less by aerodynamics and vpd because a grass reference crop has an albedo like that of most crops at full cover and because the primary energy constraint for the et process is net radiation the maximum k c cannot generally exceed 1 2 to 1 3 with added regional advection effects following allen et al 2011b in arid and semiarid climates differences in aerodynamic and surface conductances when coupled with potentially strong regional advection may cause k c to be as high as 1 2 to exceptionally high values of 1 4 for tall dense healthy and well watered vegetation as discussed by allen et al 2011b when et is measured from small expanses of vegetation the internal boundary layer above the vegetation may not be in equilibrium with the surface and may not have developed up to the height of any meteorological or flux instrumentation small expanses of vegetation surrounded by shorter or dry cover may cause a clothesline effect so et and k c may be significantly greater in those conditions than those in large fields this also happens with lysimeters since the vegetation inside the lysimeter may function as a clothesline allen et al 1991a if et estimates are to represent large expanses of vegetation or small stands of vegetation surrounded by mixtures of other vegetation having similar roughness and soil water conditions then k c values must generally be 1 2 1 4 for grass reference these aspects are more fully discussed in the companion paper pereira et al 2021 measured or reported k c above 1 2 in sub humid regions or above about 1 2 to 1 4 in arid regions should cause an intense scrutiny of the et measurements the weather data used to compute et o and the data collection and handling procedures that need for scrutiny is supported by the previously referred recommendations formulated by allen et al 2011b a 2 2 limitations to the transferability of k c due to experimental and reporting insufficiencies research developed in the last 20 years to derive crop coefficients is very abundant however objectives of such studies were diverse used research methods very different with variable accuracy often aiming to obtain k c for local use only in addition they are frequently published with insufficient information relative to methods and instrumentation used weather conditions or about the crops and the cropping practices used it resulted that much of the published material had serious limitations to transferability and hence could not be used in this review due to a variety of reasons 1 adoption of et o equations approaches different than the standard pm et o eq 1 defined in fao56 since a k c is defined as the ratio et c et o eq 2 if the et o equation changes the k c also changes by a value corresponding to the ratio between the selected et o equation and pm et o a good example is provided by shankar et al 2012 who reported disparate k c values for maize and mustard computed for seven et o equations the transferability of the research results is only possible when that ratio is well known 2 using a k c curve relationship different from the standard segmented fao k c curve which implies that only approximate estimations of k c mid and k c end can be made from the reported graphical data but generally not possible from tabulated information 3 using non standard cultivation conditions such as plastic mulches direct planting into crop residues or mulch and intercropping which change crop et and soil evaporation e s thus k c these field practices are obviously necessary to control e s and or to improve infiltration but their influences on k c have to be well documented if transferability is the goal however reported changes in k c are often quite disparate among research papers with the study by feng et al 2019 showing that impacts of plastic mulch on k c of maize may be relatively small 4 when crop management practices deviate from pristine conditions unless k c results could be corrected with the use of k s eqs 3 and 5 as it can often be done through modeling k c values cannot be directly transferred problems for transferability often result from conditions where k c experiments are developed managed and data are handled this is the common case in small size experimental plots inadequate setting and management of lysimeters reduced fetch of energy balance instrumentation towers and the lack of appropriate estimation of soil water fluxes through the boundaries of the control volume affecting the accuracy of the soil water balance swb e g the amount of water passing through the bottom boundary i e deep percolation and capillary rise another common problem relates to the use of remote sensing when using non calibrated vegetation indices and when applications are done without distinction of stressed and non stressed crops these aspects were reviewed by allen et al 2011b evett et al 2012a c and in the companion paper pereira et al 2021 in addition it is often observed that reported descriptions of the experiments are insufficient in terms of both the instrumentation and the approaches used that would provide evidence for the accuracy of measurements although recommendations by allen et al 2011b a could be helpful when the et measurements described in literature studies had questionable accuracy they were deemed to be unacceptable for the use and transfer of the reported k c values presented herein the main problems in achieving crop et accuracy and usable data were found for the following measurement approaches 1 inaccuracies in performing the soil water balance swb as analyzed by evett et al 2012b which include insufficient characterization of the soil hydraulic properties non consideration of the full root zone depth inadequate spacing and or frequency of measurements inaccuracies in measuring the soil water content and or the irrigation applications and rainfall poor estimation of deep percolation fluxes and or gains by capillary rise rough computational approaches and or using an inadequately calibrated and validated model 2 using lysimeters without respect to related requirements for accuracy allen et al 1991b a lópez urrea et al 2006 evett et al 2016 namely having differences in cropping conditions inside and outside of the lysimeter thus affecting vigor and growth of crop vegetation poor settings of the lysimeter without similar vegetation surrounding it thus causing local advection or clothesline effects lack of a fetch such that the equilibrium boundary layer of air cannot be fully adjusted above the lysimeter and or having a high exposed rim that favors advective effects 3 measuring et with the bowen ratio energy balance breb method having inaccuracies payero et al 2003 allen et al 2011b that include insufficient fetch insufficient elevation of instruments above the canopy and less representative measurement of r n and g 4 when measurements are performed with eddy covariance ec systems various corrections and precautions are required alfieri et al 2012 evett et al 2012c burba 2013 kutikoff et al 2019 problems arise when requirements are not respected which include a large fetch to establish an equilibrium boundary layer deeper than the instrument height sufficient elevation of instruments above the canopy performing appropriate data corrections including adjustments for the effects of advection and correcting data for the energy balance closure error rn g λ e h namely caring for the effects of advection 5 the use of remote sensing vegetation indices vis to estimate crop coefficients is now well established mainly with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi hunsaker et al 2005a b calera belmonte et al 2017 and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi glenn et al 2011 linear relationships between the ndvi and k c or k cb are mentioned in numerous studies some of which will be referred to later in the paper however more recently other vis have shown higher correlation with k c and may be more preferable when using images of the sentinel 2 satellite rozenstein et al 2018 a main difficulty for deriving k c or k cb from a vi is improper calibration of the index and also the possibility that vi observations in pixels do not correspond to the crop growing under an approximately pristine condition as for examples provided by hunsaker et al 2005a b 2007 remote sensing energy balance is rarely used to estimate et for deriving k c values but would have similar difficulties to those using vi approaches however good results on k c with energy balance have been obtained as reported by tasumi and allen 2007 reported information and field observations of the crop plant density height and vigor the crop growth stages and cultivation practices are often incomplete or missing thus making it impossible or at least quite difficult to properly assess the reported k c values moreover information on the weather variables during the experimental period is often undocumented in papers particularly so for minimum relative humidity rh min and wind speed at 2 m height u 2 thus making it difficult to adjust the reported k c to climate as proposed in fao56 where it is assumed that k c refers to a standard semi humid climate rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 when accuracy in measuring crop et and in computing et o is poor it often results in high k c values and high k c x et o products occur which largely exceed the energy available at the surface for evaporation as discussed in section 2 1 although very high daily values are possible when advection occurs values of k c above 1 3 may be observed for a few occasional days or over short periods but cannot be accepted as averages for large periods e g over a month or the entire mid season researchers should include the control of observed et through comparing it with the available r n g under advection h may be negative due to transport of heat into the location under study nevertheless k c values affected by advection reflect local conditions and are not transferable 2 3 adjustment to the standard climate fao56 allen et al 1998 assumed that the standard transferable k c mid and k c end as well as k cb mid and k cb end values refer to irrigation management and precipitation frequencies typical of a sub humid climate where rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 thus when local climatic conditions deviate from these values the observed k c values k c mid obs and k c end obs need to be adjusted to become standard k c values k c mid std and k c end std as 7a k c m i d s t d k c m i d o b s 0 04 u 2 m i d 2 0 004 r h min m i d 45 h 3 0 3 7b k c e n d s t d k c e n d o b s 0 04 u 2 l a t e 2 0 004 r h min l a t e 45 h 3 0 3 where u 2 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 rh min is the average daily minimum relative humidity and h is the average plant height m the subscripts mid and late indicate that those averages refer to data observed during the mid and late season respectively when crops senesce and dry out in the field k c end 0 45 no adjustment is necessary for k c end crop height should be observed in the field and tabulated h values often deviate from reality and should not replace field observations similar adjustments apply to k cb thus 8a k c b m i d s t d k c b m i d o b s 0 04 u 2 m i d 2 0 004 r h min m i d 45 h 3 0 3 8b k c b e n d s t d k c b e n d o b s 0 04 u 2 l a t e 2 0 004 r h min l a t e 45 h 3 0 3 papers were checked relative to containing the weather information required to perform the above adjustments to the standard climate climate descriptions were often insufficient and the papers presenting data on the variables used in eqs 7 and 8 i e rh min u 2 and crop height averages for the mid and end season were very rare when that information was not available but weather data relative to the experimental location or a nearby site could be accessed through websites then the reported k c or k cb values were adjusted to the standard climate it is evident that the approximate average climate values then used did not provide for an accurate adjustment but otherwise it would not be possible to perform any approximate adjustment for most of collected information in addition most papers also did not provide information on observed crop heights thus the maximum heights tabulated in fao56 were used for this purpose 2 4 procedures for updating k c and k c b limitations to transferability referred before and further analyzed in the companion paper pereira et al 2021 obliged to a careful review of published material to check when derived k c based upon research performed with adequate accuracy or reported k c values were only of local interest and or representing non standard experimental conditions only k c relative to recognizable potential evaporative crop conditions resulting from optimal pristine cropping practices could be considered selected references were checked to ensure that sufficient descriptions of the practices used to measure et data crop practices and related production environment were provided the reported k c and k cb obtained under non standard conditions such as with mulches crop residues and intercropping are only marginally referred herein were also checked to avoid potential computational flaws and shortcomings in data handling and or in model calibration and validation there is a good number of studies on deriving crop coefficients k c and k cb for field crops however much literature could not be used mainly when studies adopted a reference evapotranspiration different of the grass fao pm or the grass asce pm et o namely the pan et the fao24 penman the alfalfa reference et r or any other locally developed or selected et equation did not adopt the fao56 segmented crop coefficient curve namely when describing k c k cb as a non linear function of time or k c were averaged by month or shorter period in such conditions mainly without graphical presentation that it was not possible obtaining values characterizing the mid season and the end season were performed along a single crop season in climates when the variability of environmental characteristics could lead to varied influences on k c or k cb values lack of appropriate description of experimental agronomic conditions thus when it was not possible to assume that derived k c referred to a non stressed crop well adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions assessed papers refer to a variety of approaches to estimate et c act when methods were insufficiently described and did not allow assessing the sufficiency of quality of performed field work and related data analyses were insufficient papers were discarded the analysis of data included checking the upper values of k c as discussed before when information on lysimeter setting was not stating the area cropping around it or the care for limiting micro scale advection or clothesline effects or about determining the effective evaporation area high k c data were treated as influenced by advection or clothesline effects if various sources of k c for the same crop were available data were discarded if those sources were insufficient then k c or k cb values were reduced by 10 as a rule of tomb to correct excess k c due to less good lysimeter setting and management if k c end k c mid data were necessarily discarded if k c mid 1 40 without appropriate explanation data were discarded namely when lacking adequate description of procedures used with swb breb ec or else that could justify those high values a similar rule of tomb was used to correct k c mid or k cb mid when the reported k c or k cb adjusted for the standard climate produced season averaged 1 40 k c mid 1 25 and or 1 35 k cb mid 1 20 naturally end season values were reduced proportionally in addition to issues dealt above concerning published k c data the following limitations relative to the various methods used to estimate et c act are noted weighing lysimeters wl acceptable data refer to wl installed in large fields where it is possible to assume vertical vapor fluxes however when lysimeter methods were insufficient or when the average k c mid and k c end values largely exceeded those observed by other authors and or tabulated in fao56 related papers were discarded drainage or water table lysimeters dl and wtl data were used when soil moisture observations were performed complementarily to lysimeter observations and information provided was sufficient to assume that local advection or clothesline effects did not affect results as for wl if average k c mid and k c end were excessive related papers were also discarded energy balance from measurements of eddy covariance ec and or bowen ratio breb data were used when proper location of towers was indicated corrections were mentioned and closure error was discussed soil water balance swb data were selected when there was sufficient information on depth and frequency of observations deep percolation was considered and there was some kind of evidence that computed soil moisture dynamics followed that of observations in addition data were from plots having a minimum size to avoid local advection or clothesline effects swb models were selected when evidence of appropriate calibration and validation was given models considered included isareg popova et al 2006 cholpankulov et al 2008 popova and pereira 2011 saltmed silva et al 2013a pulvento et al 2013 2015 and simdualkc rosa et al 2012b 2016 zhao et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 the crop growth yield model aquacrop giménez et al 2017 was also considered data were used when obtained by remote sensing of ndvi or savi when at least two years of observations were performed information allowed an understanding that ndvi or savi were obtained for a non stressed crop and that the relationships between the crop coefficient and the vegetation index were properly calibrated tested 2 5 tabulating collected crop coefficients information it was considered essential to contribute only the best available information collected in other words an adequate identification of the selected studies the retained crop coefficients and the retained related ancillary data for ease in accessing that information sets of tables are used the subscript obs is adopted to identify the collected k c and k cb values reported in literature which were obtained from field observations of et c act aiming at transferability those collected crop coefficients were adjusted to the standard climate using eqs 7 and 8 and are identified with the subscript std thus indicating that such values are standard single or basal crop coefficients for all crops actual k c obs were more often reported than k cb obs likely because the derivation of the latter requires detailed partitioning of et c act performing that partition is quite demanding both in terms of field data collection and in the use of specific computation algorithms which may be incorporated in simulation models e g the simdualkc model collected information are presented in tables for all groups of crops including the common english name and the scientific name of the crop the reference of the selected paper the location where field data were collected which allows a perception of the type of climate the field method used to gather data aimed at estimating et c act as discussed before information on the k c mid obs and k c end obs or on the k cb mid obs and k cb end obs reported in literature and crop coefficient values adjusted to the standard climate thus k c mid std and k c end std or the k cb mid std and k cb end std additional tables are used to provide the collected field information on main ancillary crop parameters that are often used in water balance studies namely for irrigation scheduling purposes and that were consistently proposed in fao56 these parameters consist of maximum root depth z r max m maximum crop height h max m maximum leaf area index lai max m2 m 2 maximum fraction of ground cover f c max and soil water depletion fractions for no stress p at the initial mid season and end season p ini p mid and p end assuming et c 5 mm d 1 unfortunately for many crops that ancillary information is incomplete or even lacking interesting to note that most of ancillary data were provided by studies using a soil water balance approach or when a dual k c approach was adopted 3 review on derived single and basal crop coefficients for field crops 3 1 grain legumes there is a large number of papers reporting on k c of grain legume crops less on k cb it was possible to select a reasonable number of papers that report on the derivation of single and basal crop coefficients for use with the pm et o reference evapotranspiration equation with adequate accuracy most studies refer to soybean the main cropped grain legume more than one paper refers to dry bean chickpea cowpea and fababean while black gram groundnut and pea are the object of single papers unfortunately appropriate studies on k c for green gram and lentil were not available the selected papers mostly used sprinkler irrigation often center pivot systems as well as various surface irrigation methods table 1 selected papers using drip irrigation were found for only two chickpea studies and one soybean study therefore observed k c mostly refer to irrigation conditions where the soil surface is fully wetted however these legume crops generally fully shadow the ground by mid season thus limiting the energy available for soil evaporation there was no evidence of high e s impacts on observed k c mid obs when comparing to the k c mid std while observed differences in k c end std mostly depended on crop management decisions relative to harvesting difficulties relative to assuming an adequate value for k c end std also stem from the fact that k c for the end season was often replaced by a k c value relative to the late season or to maturity or that daily k c values were unexpectedly increased due to a rain event occurring near to the end season other related problems were described earlier in section 1 therefore it was generally more problematic for researchers to produce a proper interpretation of data in estimating k c end obs the actual crop evapotranspiration et c act was field observed through a variety of approaches table 1 drainage lysimeters dl associated with a swb using neutron probes were used by laike et al 2006 in their study on dry bean similarly patil and tiwari 2020 used dl and swb based on capacitance probes measurements for green gram weighing lysimeters wl were used by howell et al 2006 for soybean and by bastos et al 2008 and cavalcante junior et al 2016 for cowpea however results reported by bastos et al 2008 are likely affected by advection and consequently their k c mid obs was empirically reduced by 0 10 garofalo et al 2009 and pandey and pandey 2011 also used wl but in combination with soil water balances swb performed respectively with tdr and gravimetric measurements various studies estimated et c act by performing the swb with or without a simulation model simple swb computations were used by detar 2009 for cowpea with the soil water content swc observed with neutron probes suleiman et al 2013 for groundnuts with swc measured with tdr while zayton et al 2014 and alla jabow et al 2015 measured the swc with a gravimetric approach applied respectively to peanuts and to bean chickpea and fababean studies simulation models calibrated with swb data were reported by silva et al 2013a wei et al 2015 giménez et al 2017 and paredes et al 2017 silva et al 2013a used the saltmed model with swc measured with a capacitance probe while the others used the dual crop coefficient model simdualkc with calibration and validation performed with swc measurements by tdr neutron probes and capacitance sensors respectively other approaches used for determining et c act refer to eddy covariance ec the bowen ratio energy balance breb and remote sensing rs the latter used by tasumi and allen 2007 ec applications are reported by amayreh and al abed 2003 for fababean and by both suyker and verma 2009 and payero and irmak 2013 for soybean odhiambo and irmak 2012 and irmak et al 2013 used breb for the study of soybean the partition of et c act for calculating k cb was performed using diverse approaches most often by adopting the fao56 dual k c approach i e estimating k e from the fraction of ground covered by the crop f c when using simdualkc or saltmed models f c is used as input and k cb is obtained through model calibration as reported by silva et al 2013a for chickpea wei et al 2015 and giménez et al 2017 for soybean and paredes et al 2017 for pea direct applications of the dual k c approach were used by pandey and pandey 2011 with a swb for black gram and by odhiambo and irmak 2012 and irmak et al 2013 with breb applied to soybean the example of k cb and k c derivation for pea paredes et al 2017 illustrates well the usability of models to derive the crop coefficients fig 3 shows the differences between the daily k c values which resulted from the sum of the daily estimation of k cb and k e and the time averaged k c values as used for irrigation scheduling purposes the average k c values do not change along the season because due to frequent precipitation and irrigation a high k e value was observed which maintained k c k e k cb constant throughout the initial and the vegetative period differently during the mid season k e was only residual due to the high fraction of ground covered by the crop f c max 0 98 resulting that k c and k cb values were quite close because pea for industry is to be harvested fresh when the bottom leaves start to senesce the k cb mid and k cb end values are very similar to use the simdualkc model for estimating the pea crop evapotranspiration and related crop coefficients fig 3 the components of the soil water balance were measured taking into consideration the accuracy recommendations provided by allen et al 2011b observations included a the precipitation and net irrigation depths measured using rain gauges placed at the soil surface b the soil water content θ cm3 cm 3 measurements performed weekly throughout the crop season using a previously calibrated diviner 2000 probe sentek pty ltd australia from 0 10 m to a depth of 0 90 m after adequate treatment of collected data the swb model simdualkc was calibrated and validated using independent θ data sets i e one season was used for calibration while the remaining datasets relative to a different season were used for validation of the model in addition to recognizing the approaches used and their potential accuracy it is also important to note that the selected applications were made in a variety of climates and countries in various continents studies on soybean were within major world producing areas including the us central great plains the north china plain and western uruguay in south america the study on fresh pea for industry is from portugal while studies focusing on chickpea k c were also developed in the mediterranean region italy and portugal and in sudan the research on bean and gram is from central brazil ethiopia sudan india and the usa while that on cowpea is from california usa and northeast brazil the study on k c for peanuts comes from georgia usa and those for fababean are from jordan and sudan that variety of research origins helps to assume that the reported applications encompass and represent a large diversity of climates and socio economic management conditions ancillary data are provided by some of the selected studies table 2 however information is scarce but usable to update related data published in fao56 tables of particular interest is the information relative to the fraction p of soil water depletion without causing stress values of reported p indicate that in general soil water depletion for many crops can be relatively large before stress occurs up to 0 50 0 55 which then allows more efficient use of large application depths as made in surface irrigation and non mechanized sprinkler systems new information on root depths z r max for crops is somewhat scarce table 2 data on crop height are also scarce those providing maximum lai indicate that the studies were likely without stress except the chickpea study by silva et al 2013a which may have been under some water stress or had low plant density the values for f c max indicate that related crops covered the ground well except for the above referred case study on chickpea 3 2 fiber oil and sugar crops the review of the literature has shown that a large number of papers relative to deriving k c for fiber crops have been published in the past 20 years mainly for cotton however many of those papers did not assure the accuracy required although a good number could be selected unfortunately not a single paper was available for hemp jute and sisal there are studies relative to linseed however cropped as an oil crop but none referring this crop for fiber i e it was also not possible to update the flax k c and k cb tabulated in fao56 therefore the selected papers on fiber crops refer only to cotton table 3 shows the selected cotton papers that were deemed to satisfactorily provide published information on derived cotton k c as based on pm et o and that included the fao56 k c curve and crop stage data these studies used various irrigation methods mostly sprinkler and surface irrigation basin and furrow with only two papers reporting on subsurface drip irrigation sdi this method is quite expensive but has a large potential to control e s among other benefits several other papers reported using above ground drip irrigation studies on cotton were conducted in several countries kazakhstan uzbekistan brazil syria china israel and in semi arid and arid areas of usa thus referring to the primary producing areas of the world various approaches were used to derive k c from field observations kumar et al 2015 and ko et al 2009 derived k c for well watered cotton with et c act data obtained in weighing lysimeters it is notable to point out how similar the k c data for the mid season were in these two studies table 3 cholpankulov et al 2008 used an energy balance approach to measure et c act in a study area of kazakhstan and performed a swb to compute et c act for a study area in fergana uzbekistan for both cases they derived k c for optimal conditions through calibration and validation of the isareg model the k c values reported by cholpankulov et al 2008 were similar for both semi arid areas for k c mid but differed highly for k c end much lower in the steppe of kazakhstan and higher in fergana likely due to local management practices and high upflow from the shallow water table bezerra et al 2012 determined et c act for a semi arid area in brazil using the breb technique while anapalli et al 2020 and fong et al 2020 used eddy covariance in cotton studies performed in usa detar 2004 in california used five seasons of swb data to derive et c act of cotton under sdi farahani et al 2008 also computed et c act by performing a swb using neutron probe measurements for drip irrigated cotton in syria the study by han et al 2019 used drainage lysimeters combined with swb based on neutron probe observations of the swc and focused on comparing k c for plastic mulch and non mulch conditions the experiments were performed in an oasis and salinity effects on et were assessed with the water and salinity k s proposed in fao56 and analyzed by minhas et al 2020 the 3 year average show small differences in k c between mulch and non mulch table 3 rozenstein et al 2018 derived k c using a combination of field methods ec surface renewal and sap flow and various remote sensing vegetation indices this study provided the lowest cotton k c mid values in table 3 authors affirm that the crop was not water or nutrient stressed thus low values are most likely due to using drip irrigation the derivation of cotton basal crop coefficients k cb based on the fao56 dual k c approach was reported by hunsaker 1999 who performed a swb for a sandy loam soil in arizona usa hunsaker 1999 developed back calculation procedures and used tdr measured surface swc data to separate the soil evaporation and transpiration components from measured et c using the dual k c approach the derived k cb values k cb ini k cb mid and k cb end and the respective k cb curve from that study are shown in fig 4 with k cb mid and k cb end given also in table 3 hunsaker et al 2003 2005a using sdi and basin irrigation respectively provided additional measured cotton k cb data that were derived by swb at the same arid location and used to correlate k cb to ndvi data obtained by remote sensing similarly thorp et al 2017 derived cotton fao56 k cb mid at a nearby sprinkler location in arizona using a swb with neutron probe data howell et al 2004 determined et c act with weighing lysimeters used the fao56 dual k c approach to derive cotton k cb and took advection into consideration at this windy texas location field data used with the swb model isareg cholpankulov et al 2008 were also used by rosa et al 2012b with the simdualkc model which integrates the fao dual k c approach so allowing a derivation of k cb when calibrating the model there is a good number of studies reporting accurately on crop coefficients for oil crops however much of it is for sunflower selected k c and k cb for oil crops are presented in table 3 and include a few crops not previously considered in fao56 camelina linseed and mustard data on k c are much more abundant than those for k cb likely because the derivation of the latter requires et c act partitioning into t c and e s thus basal crop coefficients are only reported for camelina canola linseed and sunflower studies on oil crops refer to diverse environments in various countries reported studies on camelina were performed in arizona usa for canola in australia and spain for castorbean in ne brazil for linseed in india and italy for mustard in india for safflower in india and the usa and for sunflower in china italy india lebanon spain and the usa therefore the selected studies refer to the various main oil crop producing areas of the world most studies were performed using sprinkler and surface irrigation basin and furrow and only a couple of studies used drip irrigation the most common approach used to determine the actual crop et of oil crops is the swb in combination with other methods dl wl rs and breb table 3 for swb studies soil water contents were determined by neutron probe tdr resistance and gravimetric methods were used either solely or in combination e g hunsaker et al 2011 table 3 other selected studies for oil crops determined et strictly by ec or breb methods in addition to the referred studies by tyagi et al 2000a and gupta et al 2017 wl were also used by lópez urrea et al 2020 for canola and by lópez urrea et al 2014 howell et al 2015 and garofalo and rinaldi 2015 for sunflower shankar et al 2012 used drainage lysimeters for deriving k c for mustard and performed the swb with watermark sensors remote sensing was used by hunsaker et al 2013 to obtain k cb values for camelina supported by swb the partition of et c act and related computation of k cb was performed with the fao56 dual kc approach based upon the observation of the fraction of ground covered by the vegetation f c in the wl studies reported by lópez urrea et al 2020 for canola and lópez urrea et al 2014 and howell et al 2015 for sunflower the same approach is incorporated in the simdualkc model used by miao et al 2016 for sunflower where the k cb values result from the model calibration an example for the dynamics of k c k e and k cb for sunflower is presented in fig 5 sunflower et c act values were measured with a large weighing lysimeter lópez urrea et al 2014 daily et c act values were calculated as the difference between lysimeter mass losses from evapotranspiration and lysimeter mass gains from precipitation irrigation or dew divided by the lysimeter area no drainage from the lysimeter tank was recorded during the study period additionally the basal crop coefficient k cb was calculated from the lysimeter k c values described above minus the estimated evaporation component k e values calculated with the fao56 methodology i e based on observed fraction of ground cover f c results in fig 5 show that several irrigation and precipitation events occurred along the season which contributed to soil water evaporation particularly during the crop stages when the f c was small i e when the energy available at the soil surface was higher as observed in table 3 the reported values for k c mid std results for oil crops were very similar particularly when considering an individual crop which also suggests good accuracy in their determination the values for k c end std have a relatively larger variation which results from differences in crop management with harvesting at various maturation conditions the current review found 15 published papers presenting field information on sugarcane crop coefficients during the last twenty years however only four papers could be selected to provide updated k c values but not one was selected for updating k cb observed and adjusted crop coefficients are presented in table 3 the methods used for estimating et c act included weighing lysimeters olivier and singels 2012 surface renewal bastidas obando et al 2017 and breb inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 bastidas obando et al 2017 a swb was performed with the swc sensed with reflectometry probes by silva et al 2013b with capacitance sensors by bastidas obando et al 2017 and with gravimetric measurements by dingre and gorantiwar 2020 inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 collected data at one location in australia and another in swaziland however not covering a full crop season the first location was furrow irrigated and the second was drip irrigated but the respective k c mid values were equal likely because of crop residue mulch effects on k c silva et al 2013b reported on a one year sugarcane study in sao francisco valley brazil where sprinkler irrigation was used however olivier and singels 2012 developed a study in south africa comparing the year of planting and the following year called ratoon showing that k c are greater in the planting year relative to ratoon moreover they compared effects of cane residues mulch and bare soil and concluded that k c are greater by about 0 05 when the crop is cultivated in a bare soil relative to a mulched soil which relates with the control of e s by the organic mulch drip irrigation was used by olivier and singels 2012 another selected paper is that by bastidas obando et al 2017 who compared two locations in south africa where one was drip irrigated and the other was rainfed as expected the k c mid std was smaller by 7 for the rainfed crop observed sugarcane k c mid std were quite coherent namely decreasing with crop residues mulch and in rainfed conditions while the two k c end std values reported were quite similar studies on sugar beet k c are scarce selected studies refer to the use of remote sensing with the model metric tasumi and allen 2007 applied in idaho usa to the use of the swap model where the swb was performed with swc observed with a neutron probe in northern spain utset et al 2007 and to the recent study by wang et al 2021 using weighing lysimeters eddy covariance and remote sensing k cb mid was observed in two studies using ndvi from rs gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 wang et al 2021 and in a multi site swb study based on gravimetric measurements hauer et al 2015 however the selected tabulated data from the latter study refers only to the göttingen site germany table 4 provides for ancillary values relative to the crops whose k c and k cb are presented in table 3 these values are however limited but are usable for creating tabulated information that will help users to perform a swb or to parameterize models e g simdualkc the soil water depletion fraction p is used in fao56 procedures to define the allowable soil water depletion for a crop before water stress occurs the p value is essential for modeling the soil water balance taking into consideration a water stress coefficient k s fao56 however except for cotton and sunflower relatively few of the selected papers for other crops provided such values moreover the reported p values varied in a wide range with small values indicating that water stress was avoided and large ones indicating that water stress could have occurred reported z r max values vary largely on one hand these values tend to be larger when the soil is lighter on the other hand values depend on the accuracy of observation of the small roots with many studies referring to the maximum depth as that providing for most water uptake and others reporting on the effectively observed maximum root depth there is also a large variability of h max measurements may play a role but crop varieties and crop management certainly are of a great impact lai max and f c max certainly vary with crop management and cultivation practices their values denote good crop development i e do not indicate that experiments were subjected to crop stress these ancillary parameters were used later in this paper to update related values previously tabulated in fao56 3 3 small grain cereals in addition to small grain cereals the current review of literature included two pseudo cereals amaranth grain and quinoa not formerly considered in fao56 among the small grains wheat is the most studied crop studies relative to oats rye and millet were not available except as forage crops and therefore were not included herein the observed actual k c mid obs and k c end obs and the respective values adjusted to the standard climate k c mid std and k c end std are presented in table 5 most selected studies estimated k c and only a few reported on k cb values except in wheat wheat studies were grouped into winter and spring wheat since the crop cycles and varieties are quite different in addition the wheat crop studies were grouped according to the duration of the late season shorter when harvesting is performed with high grain moisture that is to give an opportunity for planting the following summer crop or longer when the grain is harvested with low moisture the k c end of the latter is generally smaller than at high harvest grain moisture the reported studies most often used basin furrow or sprinkler irrigation thus generally fully wetting the ground a few studies used drip or sdi as per the cases of amaranth grain quinoa and a few wheat studies the selected studies are from a large variety of countries and environmental conditions amaranth grain was studied in italy and barley in ethiopia the czech republic and portugal the latter country reporting on malt barley for industry quinoa studies were in bolivia and italy and the teff study in ethiopia studies for wheat are from china india iran syria north africa northern and southern europe and the usa that vast origin of studies for wheat allows the assumption that most of the main producing areas were accounted for herein the k c and k cb selected studies for small grain cereals used various approaches for measuring actual crop et the most common approach is the swb using assorted methods to measure the swc such as gravimetry neutron probes tdr capacitance probes and fdr pozníková et al 2014 used the breb method to estimate et c act and the fao56 dual k c approach for its partitioning to then derive k cb ec was used to estimate et c act in various studies namely duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 kjaersgaard et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 and french et al 2020 sánchez et al 2015 used two variations of a simple two source energy balance stseb approach to estimate et c act and its partitioning on e s and t c weighing lysimeters were used in experiments reported by garcia et al 2003 in their studies on quinoa in the bolivian altiplan tyagi et al 2000b focusing on wheat in punjab howell et al 2006 and ko et al 2009 in wheat studies in texas usa and lópez urrea et al 2009 and sánchez et al 2015 for spring wheat in castilla la mancha spain remote sensing was used in wheat k c studies by various authors duchemin et al 2006 and er raki et al 2007 compared respectively k c and k cb values obtained with ndvi with those resulting from ec measurements while hunsaker et al 2005b 2007 compared k cb obtained with ndvi with k cb obtained by the swb using neutronic and tdr measurements of swc drerup et al 2017 also used ndvi calibrated k cb results in comparison with k cb derived from a swb with fdr measurements differently pakparvar et al 2014 used the energy balance with the remote sensing model sebs to derive k c values for wheat chattaraj et al 2013 linked k c and k cb values based on several vis measured with a spectroradiometer to those measured with the swb using neutron probe for swc the recent study by french et al 2020 compared k c based on ec observations in commercial durum wheat fields to daily k cb derived by vi using sentinel 2 and venus satellites to map the vi time series for the entire cropping seasons a few studies with a swb approach used models under these circumstances k c or k cb values are obtained through the calibration of the particular model which eases the processing of field data when performing a soil water balance the first swb model used in this respect was the isareg model where the single k c approach was used for performing the swb simulations e g liu et al 1998 later models adopting the dual k c approach were developed thus where derivation of k cb mid and k cb end are the objects of the calibration the saltmed model was used by pulvento et al 2013 2015 for quinoa and the amaranth grain respectively while the simdualkc model was used for wheat in four papers and for one barley study simdualkc may use et c act as input as adopted by zhang et al 2013 data from zhang et al 2013 in fig 6 shows the results of the calibration of simdualkc model using et c act measured with ec equipment in a winter wheat field with frozen soil during the winter months large differences between the single daily and time averaged k c curves occur particularly during the initial stage which relates to the high soil water content and related k e values during the first half of that stage during the second half of the initial stage k e highly decreases while the availability of water in the evaporation layer also decreases thus daily k c values become closer to k cb values differently during the mid season k e is generally low due to fewer wetting events and higher fraction of ground covered by the crop f c max 0 85 thus k c and k cb time averaged values become even closer the k cb act curve is below the standard k cb curve for only a few days during the late season when water stress occurred when a dual k c simulation model was not used the partitioning of et c act was performed using the fao56 dual k c procedures thus the estimated evaporation component is based primarily upon the fraction of ground covered by vegetation f c and the soil water characteristics of the surface layer this was the approach used by liu and pereira 2000 hunsaker et al 2005b 2007 er raki et al 2007 lópez urrea et al 2009 chattaraj et al 2013 pozníková et al 2014 and drerup et al 2017 however each author developed different purposefully applied computational algorithms reported studies offer a variety of approaches that have appropriate computation accuracy so k c or k cb values vary from one study to another only in a limited range table 5 that variability is usually caused by crop management e g different irrigation methods and different crop varieties to illustrate the influence of the varieties table 5 includes k cb values for three wheat varieties studied at the same location by chattaraj et al 2013 the ancillary parameters reported in the studies referenced in table 5 are shown in table 6 these parameters reflect the management of the cereal crops and may be useful for water balance irrigation scheduling applications reported values for spring and winter wheat root depths z r max varied in a large range from 0 55 to 1 50 m while h max ranged from 0 60 to 1 30 m both ranges reflect the impact of varieties and crop management but z r max also varies with the soil texture and structure the same influences occur for other crops but are not apparent due to the limited number of studies lai max for wheat varied much from 3 5 to 7 1 m2 m 2 while f c max was relatively stable from 0 85 0 98 the soil water depletion fraction for no stress ranged from 0 45 0 80 3 4 maize and sorghum the studies on crop coefficients for maize developed throughout the last decades are very numerous and a large number satisfied the accuracy criteria indicated in section 2 reported k c and k cb values are presented in table 7 where those relative to sorghum are also shown a distinction is made for both maize and sorghum in terms of cropping for grain or for silage due to a very different duration of the late season sorghum studies include a third group referring to sweet sorghum cropped for green energy the main distinction among these distinct groups refers to the k c or k cb at end season with k c end values for silage near k c mid values since the nutritional value of the crop is higher before senescence develops similarly k c end values of sweet sorghum are near the k c mid values because the crop energy value decreases when maturation develops in addition grain maize studies were grouped according to the grain moisture at harvest low grain moisture 15 and high grain moisture 20 where the latter has a shorter late season and therefore a larger k c end than the former indicating differences in the time for the crop to dry out in the field there is also maize produced for human consumption at the table which have k c at harvesting close or very close to the k c mid however new literature on this type of maize cropping was not available as reported in table 7 maize studies originate from a very large number of regions and countries including the more important producing areas of the world differently studies relative to sorghum are more restrictive in terms of their geographical origin though study locations often coincided with some of the maize study areas the majority of reviewed papers reporting on the derivation of k c and k cb for maize used a swb approach and most of the selected papers used some form of modeling the derivation of k c using swb was commonly performed with various swc measurement equipment namely tdr fdr neutron and capacitance probes as well as by using gravimetric measurements examples of deriving k c with swb and not using models are those reported by cameira et al 2003 kar and verma 2005 and gao et al 2009 hou et al 2014 reported on k cb derived using a swb approach combined with transpiration measurements using sap flow sensors and e s measurements with micro lysimeters jiang et al 2014 derived k c through a study involving swb ec and micro lysimeters when swb models were used k c were determined through model calibration with field data followed by required validation using different data sets the model reported for k c derivation was the isareg model and that for k cb determination was the simdualkc model table 7 these applications were used in different climates in various regions of the world a complex approach was reported by ran et al 2017 on deriving k cb with simdualkc where swb data were combined with ec data and with microlysimeters measurements of soil evaporation and sap flow measurements of transpiration differently miao et al 2016 reported on the use of the simdualkc model for deriving k cb for maize both grown alone and intercropped with wheat and present a procedure to compute k cb for the intercropped management chauhdary et al 2020 used the saltmed model calibrated and validated with gravimetric swc measurements a single study was selected on deriving k c mid with a remote sensing energy balance model tasumi and allen 2007 an example on the use of simdualkc for deriving maize k cb and k c through model calibration and validation is given in fig 7 it shows that when the model is calibrated the standard k cb curve i e for optimal conditions fig 7b does not change when water stress occurs fig 7d although k cb act falls below the curve when water stress occurs results from this modeling study paredes et al 2014 determined a p value for non stress of 0 50 table 8 fig 7a shows an appropriate calibration of the model and fig 7c a validation of the model with another data set an earlier study on deriving maize k c using ec measurements was reported by suyker and verma 2009 zhang et al 2013 reported on the use of ec measurements to calibrate and validate the model simdualkc other studies relative to the use of ec data for assessing k c values are those by facchi et al 2013 alberto et al 2014 ding et al 2015 and gong et al 2017 where all but alberto et al 2014 using ec measurements associated with swb observations studies using weighing lysimeters include those by tyagi et al 2003 howell et al 2006 2008 piccinni et al 2009 and anapalli et al 2016 combining lysimeter data with soil moisture observations to better assess the total et partition ding et al 2013 included a swb sap flow measurements for transpiration and et data from weighing lysimeter observations studies on sorghum grain include those by tyagi et al 2000b and howell et al 2008 using weighing type lysimeters in combination with swb based on neutron probe measurements kato and kamichica 2006 studied the k cb and the k e curves in the sorghum grain using the two compartment model of shuttleworth and wallace s w model bashir et al 2008 estimated et of sorghum through remotely sensed data sweet sorghum crop coefficients were studied by piccinni et al 2009 using a wl and a similar approach with a wl was used by howell et al 2008 and lópez urrea et al 2016 differently shenkut et al 2013 used a dl performing the swb using neutron probe data martínez cruz et al 2015 studied four varieties of sweet sorghum using swb with tdr measurements rosa et al 2016 used swc observations with tdr to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model when the experiment with sorghum and with maize silage was developed using saline irrigation and the water and salinity stress coefficients were tested see minhas et al 2020 when studies reported on a range of k c mid std and or k c end std i e when authors did not select the most appropriate values for growth stages and causes for their variability were not identified average k c mid std and k c end std were estimated in addition derived k cb data were used to estimate the k c values in a few cases following the guidelines indicated in section 2 5 results for sorghum show a range of k c mid std values wider than for k cb mid std which likely are due to the effects of rainfall and irrigation on soil evaporation ancillary parameters characterizing both the maize and sorghum crops which are commonly used in related et soil water balance studies are given in table 8 z r max vary in a relatively large range for grain maize 0 6 to 1 5 m and a similar range for maize silage however there are no evident reasons for the extreme variations in values most commonly reported z r max values for maize fall within 0 70 to 1 00 m which compares to 1 0 1 70 m in the fao56 tables for maize grain sorghum z r max table 8 were more consistent than maize except for the lower depth for sweet sorghum reported h max for maize also vary widely which may be related to different crop varieties and water management practices more common reported maize values range from 2 50 to 3 00 m while more extreme height variation primarily depending upon crop varieties and cropping practices these and other factors could also explain the rather large differences in maximum height found for sorghum lai max generally varies from 5 0 to 7 0 m2 m 2 which may indicate that maize crops were not stressed whereas two low lai max values for sorghum may indicate the opposite most frequent f c max values varied from 0 80 to 0 95 which also indicate non stressed sparse crops however these values may be influenced by the measurement procedure the soil water depletion fraction for no stress are mostly around 0 45 0 55 for the mid season but much higher values for p end are reported in a few papers that probably refer to late season crop management issues 3 5 rice 3 5 1 rice irrigation water management practices rice oryza sativa l is a main staple food crop cultivated everywhere in the world when the climate provides for a warm hot crop season of about 4 to 5 months and where water availability is sufficiently abundant typically it is cultivated in flooded paddies but it is cropped in a variety of conditions from deep water with floating rice to aerobic sprinkler irrigation conditions that diversity of rice water management results from the wide range of environmental conditions where rice may be cropped and implies numerous different crop varieties able to respond to the unique environmental requirements and related water management issues a long review of literature is the basis of the current section most of literature on rice crop coefficients are for flooded paddies but k c for a variety of other conditions has been documented an exception is for deep floating rice water management issues considered refer to a permanent flooded paddies which may vary in terms of management of the depth of water in the paddies for saving water and because precise land leveling is often applied that water depth may be reduced from about 0 10 m to less than 0 05 m however that reduction also concerns the effects of paddy water in avoiding low temperature impacts on the crop thus its proper use depends upon the climate in addition to the ability of the irrigators that variability of water depths has little impact on crop et but has great effects on the amount of deep percolation through the root zone bottom and on seepage through the borders of the paddies particularly into the surface drainage system b flooded paddies with dry seeding this is a water saving practice aimed at reducing irrigation during the initial early stages of the crop which leads to reducing the initial crop et thus smaller k c ini however this does not impact lessen et for the remainder of the crop season the adoption of this practice can increase mechanization options for the farm operations since seeding often is performed using an airplane in large farms c flooded paddies with anticipated cutoff greatly reduces irrigation during the late season a water saving practice that also reduces crop et during that stage which generally leads to a low k c end unfortunately very few references to this practice were available and none referred to an appropriate estimation of k c end d intermittent irrigation of the paddies where flooded basin irrigation is applied intermittently to the paddies to keep the soil water content close to saturation this is a water saving practice developed in south china where ponded water is not required for temperature control this practice aims at controlling deep percolation and seepage by avoiding standing water in the paddies except during times when they are flooded since the soil water is maintained close to saturation impacts on et compared to permanent flooding are generally quite small except for the late season because the intermittent paddies dry easier which may lead to a reduced k c end e aerobic rice where rice is cropped like any other grain cereal such as wheat or barley but irrigation is practiced adopting a smaller management allowed depletion mad thus requiring more frequent irrigation applications however rice yields with this practice can be reduced compared to other methods the climate must be such that the temperature is warm enough to not affect growth therefore k c ini k c mid and k c end values approach those for grain crops but can vary depending on the frequency of irrigation events for rice generally higher when sprinkler irrigation is practiced when surface irrigation is used soil and water management practices differ for level vs sloping fields which also influence k c values f rainfed rice where rice is generally cropped in paddy basins which are essential to store all rainfall water and provide its infiltration into the cropped soil so it can be productively used by the rice crop that practice is typical of monsoon climates k c values may be high as for flooded paddies when rainfall helps to keep soil water above the field capacity and k c values become smaller when time intervals between rain wettings are large 3 5 2 review on applications to rice crop coefficient studies are quite numerous but only few studies respond to the exigencies for accuracy defined for this study earlier in this paper or in the companion paper by pereira et al 2021 the review focused on k c et o applications where the pm et o equation is used unfortunately many applications to rice use fao24 et o equations doorenbos and pruitt 1977 or pan evaporation et o without assessing their relationships with the pm et o in addition several studies did not adopt the four segments k c curve adopted in fao56 and preferred a non linear description of k c as a function of time after planting moreover when the fao k c curve was adopted some authors reported either numerically or graphically on a range of values for k c ini k c mid and k c end however if these studies were otherwise sound we were obliged to evaluate the data values interpreting at our best appropriately reported k c values we noticed that advection was rarely considered contrarily with studies developed 20 years ago two classical studies considering the influence of advection in paddies et are those by lourence and pruitt 1971 and peterschmitt and perrier 1991 the first paper refers to an application of the bowen ratio energy balance breb to flooded paddies in california as well as to a weighing lysimeter at davis california the second concerns the application of an energy balance approach to a paddy field at pondicherry india however they are rarely quoted in literature despite that they could be of much interest for more recent studies using breb or eddy covariance observations an earlier review on rice et by tomar and o toole 1979 also referred to impacts of advection these mentioned studies are among the few focusing on crop coefficients where advection effects were considered however these studies were developed prior to fao56 do not refer to the pm et o and their approach to k c follows different concepts therefore the reported k c values were not compared with those in the current literature review more recently a study by tsai et al 2007 on the energy balance of rice paddies in central taiwan reports that corrections of eddy covariance measurements should include a correction for advection and proposed the required procedure alberto et al 2011 suggested possible impacts of advection in flooded rice but their reported k c values are relatively small and do not denote large advection impacts for the los baños area in the philippines likely due to various field observation or data handling flaws many published studies reported k e values of about 1 50 or greater thus largely exceeding the expected values when only vertical heat and vapor fluxes occur such large values are likely due to horizontal advective transport of heat at local or regional scale so sensible heat fluxes h are converted into latent heat fluxes le these conditions can lead to several days with quite high crop et but unlikely to an average et where k c is above 1 40 a reasonable k c upper threshold for hot and windy climates as discussed by allen et al 2011b localized advective impacts also occur when lysimeters or small experimental plots are not well integrated in a vast equally cropped area or when the crop in the study plots develops more than that surrounding cropped area nevertheless increased le or et due to advection is not reported to make k c 1 50 or larger in the referred studies lourence and pruitt 1971 peterschmitt and perrier 1991 tsai et al 2007 alberto et al 2011 for that reason studies having such large k c were excluded from this review in addition to the cases where mid or late season k c are above the referred threshold rice studies were not retained when there was an insufficient or inexistent description of the lysimeter facilities used of the quality control measures adopted and of the data handling procedures applied in fact poor lysimeter settings and management are prone to local transport of heat from the surrounding area including the occurrence of clothesline effects lack of quality control allows that measurements and data handling become prone to errors all these aspects often cause crop coefficients that increase much above expected values allen et al 2011b evett et al 2012a thus reason why it is considered relevant to describe well the lysimeter facilities when reporting related research allen et al 2011a therefore an overestimation of k c may often occur poor or insufficient description of the soil water balance swb approaches used namely roughly known or lack of soil hydraulic characteristics of the location under study insufficient description of computational procedures adopted for each term of the swb as well as insufficient information about the equipment used the swc sensors placement and frequency of observations the corresponding need for information has been also stressed allen et al 2011b a swb inaccuracies cause inaccurate estimations of the water fluxes through the bottom boundary of the soil root zone namely causing underestimation of deep percolation and of lateral seepage which then lead to overestimation of crop et and k c the calibration and validation procedures of any model used to perform the swb are often insufficiently described or at the limit the swb is sometimes performed without reference to soil water observations for such et and k c may be over or underestimated with particular relevance for errors relative to percolation and seepage the description of eddy covariance and breb equipment and of its management and quality control of related observed data were lacking namely not referring to the closure error that is required to assure that accuracy of data was appropriate inaccurate estimation of et and k c may then result despite using good quality sensors et and k c may then be over or under estimated k c values reported in selected studies focusing on the derivation of k c for rice are summarized in table 9 however only two k cb studies were selected vories et al 2013 alberto et al 2014 and related k cb data are also included in table 9 most reported studies refer to flooded rice paddies adopting reduced water depths aimed at water saving tyagi et al 2000a mao et al 2004 vu et al 2005 alberto et al 2011 2014 arif et al 2012 kadiyala et al 2012 hatiye et al 2015 linquist et al 2015 djaman et al 2019 diaz et al 2019 three of those studies report on adopting dry seeding alberto et al 2014 in the philipines linquist et al 2015 in california diaz et al 2019 in brazil rainfed paddies are the object of a study developed in thailand intermittent flooding irrigation is reported in four asian studies agrawal et al 2004 arif et al 2012 hatiye et al 2015 oue and laban 2019 aerobic rice cropping is reported by asian researchers relative to surface irrigation alberto et al 2011 kadiyala et al 2012 choudhury et al 2013 and by europeans relative to sprinkler irrigation spanu et al 2009 moratiel and martínez cob 2013 which coincide with the dominant type of irrigation of rice in asia and europe respectively none of k c referred studies reported advection the occurrence of stress was generally not identified by the authors a variety of et estimation methods were used in the reported studies table 9 a paddy water balance pwb approach was adopted using pairs of microlysimeters with open and closed bottom for assessing deep percolation where twice studies adopted a simplified model with a darcy approach to consider the different behaviors of the plowed layer the compacted layer and the lower layer paulo et al 1995 mao et al 2004 hatiye et al 2015 choudhury et al 2013 also used microlysimeters in combination with the swb when studying intermittent irrigation the use of weighing lysimeters is reported by tyagi et al 2000a and of drainage lysimeters is referred by vu et al 2005 breb was used in the study with rainfed rice attarod et al 2006 more recent studies reported on the use of eddy covariance alberto et al 2011 2014 linquist et al 2015 diaz et al 2019 and surface renewal moratiel and martínez cob 2013 the model ais arkansas irrigation scheduling was adopted by vories et al 2013 who used watermark sensors data to assess soil water content values for rice k c table 9 are quite variable but there is good consistency in k c among many studies however the mid season k c reported by linquist et al 2015 is much lower than those presented by other authors for flooded paddies this was taken into consideration when defining the consolidated k c mid values later k c ini values depend upon various factors that influence evaporation from a free water surface as previously noted in fao56 k c ini tends to increase when climates are dry and windy nevertheless the set of values reported describe insufficiently that initial period and variability of k c ini among studies may relate to differences in defining the initial crop growth stage management may also influence k c ini for flooded rice with the referred exception all values for k c mid std are in a relatively narrow range from 1 11 to 1 29 however for k c end std the range 0 87 to 1 14 is greater due to different management approaches to drain the paddies which depend upon the harvesting practices utilized as well as the target grain moisture at harvesting k c values for non flooded rice vary with the practices adopted and in general standard k c ini and k c end values were lower than for flooded rice on the other hand standard k c mid values were not very different from those for flooded paddies with intermittent irrigation although they were lower in some aerobic rice studies for k c end variability in non flooded rice is also due to management related issues ancillary rice parameters are dealt insufficiently with in literature as per table 10 information on root depths was scarce but it would have been desirable to have comparisons about z r when studies compare intermittent irrigation or aerobic cropping with flooded paddies information about crop heights was also scarce but the available data showed h max to vary in a wide range similarly information on lai max varied much likely due to both management and the crop variety data on f c max was only for a single value relative to the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p a large insufficiency refers to aerobic rice for which no information is available this is unfortunate since a good estimate for p is highly needed to support the development of new irrigation management and cropping practices for rice 4 updated single and basal standard crop coefficients 4 1 grain legumes the updating and consolidation of k c and k cb values for grain legumes was performed comparing the literature reported crop coefficients adjusted to the standard sub humid climate rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 with the k c values tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 table 11 however for some crops appropriate k c observations were lacking and thus the standard fao56 values were either unchanged lentil and dry pea or slightly revised based on our analysis referred to below green bean green gram green cowpea and fresh fababean the available k c values for crops reported in table 1 are well in agreement with those tabulated in fao56 for k c mid from the related analysis mainly considering the literature reported values table 1 it resulted that the standard k c mid values were increased by 0 05 relative to those formerly tabulated in the case of black gram and cowpea but contrarily were decreased by 0 10 for dry bean and 0 05 for fababean k c end values having more complexity due to the variability of observed values and the difficulties in getting true values from literature were mostly unchanged relative to the tabulated ones the exceptions are for pea and soybean whose standard k c end decreased because all reported values were smaller than the tabulated ones in fao56 the available study on k c referred to pea harvested fresh for industry where strict cropping rules apply including for high planting density led to increase by 0 05 both k c mid and k c end reported k cb values from literature were quite limited but the few available generally confirmed the fao56 tabulated values as with k c mid the k cb mid for dry bean and faba bean were slightly decreased while those for black gram chickpea and cowpea were slightly increased an increase of 0 05 of both k cb mid and k cb end was adopted for pea harvested fresh for industry thus in agreement with changes in k c values referred above also the k cb mid values for crops that may be harvested green or dry were equalized since differences for mid season are not justified an exception is for fresh pea that in agreement with industry requirements has now both mid and end k cb values larger than for dry pea due to the disagreement of values observed for various crops for k cb end we could not find sufficient reason to alter them and therefore they were unchanged relative to the fao56 tables 4 2 fiber oil and sugar crops only data for cotton were obtained from literature relative to k c and k cb of fiber crops a sufficient number of reported k c and k cb values for cotton permitted a consolidation of both the mid season and end season values and to avoid the confusion of the former tabulated pairs of values relative to full or deficit water supplied since the latter does not correspond to pristine cultivation and standard crop coefficients viewing that much lower than former fao56 mid season k c were reported for drip irrigated cotton lowering the k c mid to 1 10 is considered appropriate table 12 it is also justifiable to lower k cb mid to 1 05 single values for k c end and k cb end are also assumed as 0 50 and 0 40 respectively which correspond to the lower values tabulated in fao56 however we bear in mind that end season values can vary much with the particular cotton variety and with harvesting opportunity decisions reported literature data on linseed for oil allowed a refinement of the k c mid and k cb mid values for the same crop for fiber denoted as flax in table 12 thus k c mid and k cb mid for flax were decreased by 0 05 but k c end and k cb end remained unchanged relative to sisal no data were available from literature considering the characteristics of this crop an indicative k c and k cb value was assumed corresponding to the average value of the previous fao56 tabulated values selected bibliography provided information on k c and k cb for three oil crops not handled in fao56 camelina linseed and mustard literature data for these crops have the appropriate accuracy requirements for defining the standard k c mid and k c end for all three crops also the new oil crops k c and k cb values were in good agreement with those of the other oil crops reviewed table 12 formerly fao56 tabulated values for canola safflower and sunflower consisted of pairs of k c mid values with the lower one for deficit irrigation which does not correspond to standard k c conditions literature data however allowed a selection of single k c mid values for these crops presumably cultivated under nearly pristine conditions particularly without water stress or low density those single values are slightly smaller by 0 05 than the former tabulated upper value in the case of canola and safflower differently for sunflower the various available studies confirmed the fao56 k c mid value of 1 15 and the k cb mid value of 1 10 the k c mid value for castorbean and sesame were decreased by 0 05 considering the reported data available the k c end values for the oil crops that were in fao56 were kept equal to the fao56 tabulated values since the reported information did not provide data that could justify changes an exception is sunflower in which the k c end value was decreased by 0 05 regarding oil crops basal crop coefficients consolidation options were similar to those for single k c the pairs of tabulated k cb mid values for canola safflower and sunflower were replaced by unique k cb mid values close to the former upper value i e the value representing pristine conditions the k cb mid value for castorbean and sesame were also decreased by 0 05 the k cb mid and k c end values for the newly considered linseed and mustard were obtained from the corresponding k c values following the related fao56 guidelines referred in section 2 above i e by subtracting 0 05 to the k c mid since both crops covered the ground well reducing e s and also by subtracting k c end by 0 05 to define k cb end because commonly there is no rain or irrigation towards the end of the crop season reported k cb data for camelina led to k cb values that would be close to those using the referred fao56 guidelines based on k c results for consolidated k c and k cb values for sugar crops are presented in table 12 the set of k c mid std and k c end std resulting from the bibliography are close to the fao56 tabulated values however the analysis led to decrease the standard k c mid by 0 10 of both sugarbeet and sugar cane and inversely increase by 0 05 the standard k c end of both crops observed basal coefficients are lacking for both crops thus k cb mid and k cb end were also changed similarly to the corresponding k c values the reported data indicated that k c values may be different in the planting and ratoon years smaller in the latter but information was not sufficient to tabulate different values for planting and ratoon years it may be remarked that mid season k c and k cb values for many of the above crops were often decreased relative to the previously tabulated ones this fact reflects the increasing use of drip irrigation thus producing water savings in crop water use that induces smaller mid season k c and k cb values compared to other irrigation systems 4 3 cereals the updated k c and k cb for the mid and end season values for cereals resulting from the previous review analysis are presented in table 13 together with the range of the observed values adjusted to the standard climate and the fao56 tabulated k c and k cb overall only small changes relative to the tabulated fao56 were required for updating the standard k c and k cb from those formerly tabulated data for amaranthus grain quinoa and teff were reported and therefore are newly tabulated based on the available information the most reported k c and k cb data are for the most highly cultivated crops wheat and maize as previously defined distinction is made when harvesting is made with low or high moisture grain while the consolidated wheat and maize k c and k cb values for mid season were the same as in fao56 some of the k c and k cb for the end season were updated depending on grain moisture it is important to note that various papers reporting high k c mid or k cb mid for wheat and maize did not refer to the possible influence of advection on their results thus consolidated values for k c mid or k cb mid of these cereal crops were not increased relative to fao56 because regional advection is likely to have occurred in the related dry and hot areas a recent study on maize in hetao a hot and arid irrigated area of the upper yellow river in northern china demonstrated an important advection occurrence wang et al 2020 silage maize has a lower k c mid than grain maize the same occurs for silage sorghum relative to grain sorghum differently k c end values for silage maize and silage sorghum were set closer to the k c mid values the same was set for sweet sorghum k cb values were in agreement or when not available were computed using the guidelines expressed in fao56 and presented in section 2 reported data for barley led to decrease the values of k c mid and k cb mid by 0 05 relative to fao56 for this reason these values are now slightly smaller than for wheat similarly k c mid and k cb mid were also decreased for oats relative to fao56 however k c end and k cb end of both barley and oats were kept equal to those values for wheat harvested with low grain moisture the k c values for rye were added on the basis of non cited material data were not available for pearl millet resulting that k c and k cb were not changed from fao56 4 4 rice the updated single and basal crop coefficients for the various types of rice irrigation methods are presented in table 14 respectively and the values can be compared with the k c and k cb values shown in round brackets in table 14 that were tabulated for flooded rice paddies in fao56 allen et al 1998 table 14 also includes the range of values observed in the cited field studies after adjustment to the standard climate rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 as seen in table 14 the updated k c values correspond well to those observed when the related papers were not limited in number the updated k c mid season values for flooded and intermittent irrigation methods are the same as for flooded paddies in fao56 but were decreased by 0 10 for aerobic and rainfed conditions the k c ini except in permanent flooding were decreased depending on irrigation method relative to the fao56 initial value however k c end are somewhat higher than the highest end value of 0 90 in fao56 except for rainfed rice related literature observations were lacking for all rice k cb values thus our updated k cb mid values table 14 were defined by assuming k cb k c 0 05 as was done in the fao56 k cb table while the fao56 table decreased k cb end by 0 15 0 20 from k c end updated values were decreased 0 10 0 15 below the k c end varying with irrigation method very differently because the fao56 tabulated value for k cb ini was exclusively dedicated to flooded paddies it was defined in such a way that the paddy water evaporation was not considered distinctively separate from the plant transpiration thus fao56 tabulated value was k cb ini 1 00 however at present various and different irrigation methods are considered namely dry seeding intermittent irrigation aerobic rice and rainfed paddies these approaches correspond to different amounts of water evaporation thus to different k e values users of k cb having an initial value of 0 15 are therefore advised to consider k e values that represent the paddy water evaporation and soil water evaporation for instance the fao56 tabulated value for flooded rice implies that k cb ini is 0 15 and k e would be equal to 0 90 thus resulting k c ini 1 05 a smaller k e should be considered for other irrigation methods depending on the amount and frequency of irrigation and rainfall events thus resulting in a smaller k c ini for dry seeding intermittent irrigation aerobic rice and rainfed paddies a rough estimation is that when wettings are frequent k e would be about 0 90 resulting in k c ini 1 05 and when wettings are less frequent k e would vary around 0 60 0 70 which translates to k c ini values ranging between 0 75 0 85 overall despite the limitations due to the diversity of conditions reported in literature present authors are convinced that the proposed crop coefficients can be very useful for further developments in the domain of rice evapotranspiration and water management unfortunately the absolute lack of data impeded any chance to characterize floating rice et 5 updated ancillary data values for ancillary crop data reported in the quoted studies were tabulated in tables 2 4 6 8 and 10 for grain legumes fiber oil and sugar crops small grain cereals maize and sorghum and rice respectively these tabulated values were then consolidated by crop and combined in table 15 for all the crops except rice whose data are provided in table 16 for each crop values are presented for the range of observed maximum root depths z r max crop heights h max ground cover fractions f c max and mid season p fraction of soil water depletion for no stress for rice table 16 the data are separated for three conditions flooded paddies intermittent irrigation and aerobic rice these ranges of reported values were compared with the fao56 tabulated z r max h max and p fractions therefore resulting in updated values for these three ancillary parameters which could be quite useful in characterizing crop conditions when performing a swb for irrigation planning and management when related observations are not available in general observed root depths were similar to the fao56 tabulated ones updated z r max values are given as a range with the smaller value more appropriate for heavy soils and more frequent irrigation and larger values for light soils and or larger intervals between irrigations differently updated maximum crop heights are mostly given with a single value however crop varieties may be very distinct in different parts of the world and for several crops a range of h max values is given the indicative values provided for z r max and h max should be used with care because they vary much with the crop variety environmental conditions and crop management single values are given to the p fractions which refer to the crop et of 5 mm d 1 and should be modified following the guidelines in table 22 of fao56 values in table 15 are indicative and should be compared with measured observations whenever possible updated values for rice are also based upon those proposed in fao56 and those reported in the current bibliography notably updated root depths are largest for aerobic rice however crop height is reduced for aerobic rice also considerably higher allowable soil water depletion higher p value is associated with the aerobic condition however users are called upon to make the necessary parameter modifications whenever necessary 6 conclusions and recommendations the first conclusion drawn from the present study is that the performed crop coefficient review essentially confirms the tabulated k c and k cb values in fao56 allen et al 1998 although the updates we propose often show small differences relative to fao56 secondly the review results added new k c and k cb data for several crops that were unavailable in the literature prior to fao56 publication this was the case for three important oil crops camelina linseed and mustard for two increasingly popular pseudo cereals amaranth and quinoa and for an emerging grain cereal teff clearly with so many new crops emerging in recent years reviews like the present one will be needed soon to help extend k c et o application to these crops greater differences between the fao56 rice k c values and those presently provided occur because our updated values unlike fao56 include various water management alternatives to continuous flooding that are generally aimed at water saving e g flooded paddies with dry seeding flooded paddies with anticipated cut off intermittent irrigation of paddies irrigation of aerobic rice by flooding furrows or sprinkling as well as rainfed rice in monsoon areas no data were available for floating rice relative to maize and sorghum crop coefficients a distinction has now been made between production for grain silage and energy uses relative to maize and wheat for grain k c distinctions are now made to characterize the late season water use differences in cases when harvest is made with high or low moisture thus with short or long duration of the late season and the consequent larger or smaller k c end value similarly for gram and cowpea legumes the distinction is also made relative to green and dry harvests because the latter have a longer late season and a k c end smaller than green the organization of the crop coefficient and ancillary data in the present study expands the knowledge base beyond that provided in fao56 on the one hand in addition to the consolidated k c and k cb values tables are also presented to show the standard values for the mid season and the end season obtained from the reviewed research after conversion to the standard sub humid climate with rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 this information allows readers to have a better perception of the different environmental conditions from which data used to consolidate k c and k cb values were obtained on the other hand ancillary data available from the cited literature are also tabulated in complement to the observed standardized k c values thus also allowing readers to have some however limited insight of the experiments the primary ancillary data refer to crop rooting depths crop heights and the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p for ease in transferring information to readers and users all consolidated table data are compared with the ranges of values observed in the reviewed literature and with the fao56 tabulated values in addition readers can easily identify in tables the various locations around the world where the crop coefficient research was conducted all k c and k cb values reported were obtained using the fao56 grass reference evapotranspiration definition and the consequent pm et o equation studies using any different et o equation and computational procedure were not used because results could likely deviate from those of the pm et o equation this constraint allowed the literature reported k c and k cb values to be compared for the same or similar crop and more importantly to be compared with the fao56 tabulated values since the field and computational research procedures of the related studies satisfied the basic requisites for accuracy in determining crop et from field research the reported k c could be appropriately computed and used to obtain the consolidated standard values tabulated herein therefore the k c and k cb values proposed in the current study consist of the best set of standard values for every crop relative to the mid season and end season that can be appropriately transferred and used worldwide transferring implies that the standard k c and k cb values need to be adjusted to the local climate eqs 7a through 8b and when the crop is not cultivated in pristine conditions their use also requires adoption of a stress coefficient e g eq 3 and or eq 5 the current review confirmed the appropriateness of clearly distinguishing actual from standard crop coefficients with the latter referring to crops cultivated in pristine conditions in which evapotranspiration may well be considered the potential et of the considered crop under given environmental conditions however there is very abundant literature not quoted where this distinction is not made and where the k c correspond to cultivation practices far from pristine due to water stress salinity stress or stresses produced by various insufficiencies of agronomic nature therefore making the observed to be not transferable k c the review particularly for papers not selected allowed perceiving that the distinction between actual and standard k c or between standard and potential et c is not adopted by many researchers this alone makes it inappropriate to transfer the research results from one location for use in another in addition the review has shown that differences between k c observed and those adjusted to the standard climate may be large particularly when observations are performed in arid and windy conditions for those reasons it is very important that k c papers include appropriate description of methods used and of the climate during experimentation the review has shown that use of well calibrated and validated swb simulation models e g the simdualkc model makes it possible to derive standard k c and k cb values despite the occurrence of water and salinity stress in the experiment more research with focus on the use of these swb models would be welcome since the current review found only relatively limited use of models such models in addition have been successfully applied for irrigation planning purposes and for real time irrigation scheduling and they can incorporate and utilize information based on remote sensing data remote sensing observations in real time could be especially useful in defining growth stage dates and lengths at various locations in the review it was demonstrated that many k c researchers often fail to scrutinize the k c values obtained the k c values much higher than reality could be due to either flaws in field measurements or to advection influences for example it was observed that exceptionally high k c values were often reported in papers where the description of methods employed was insufficient which may relate to absence of scrutiny of research results on the other hand the higher reported k c may be a function of local advection impacts that were rarely considered or mentioned in research performed during the last two decades therefore k c researchers are again strongly encouraged to include a careful and thorough inspection of results including the time dynamics of et that should provide for a better analysis on the accuracy of et estimation moreover since energy balance methods mainly ec and breb are becoming the choice of et measurement in research it is recommended that in addition to the scrutiny of et measured data the dynamics of the energy balance be explored to verify when latent heat exceeds the available energy r n g and or when sensible heat becomes negative so by identifying periods when et was influenced by advection it is then possible to correct measured et and very high k c values can then be avoided it became apparent from the review that the definition and computational procedures relative to the pm et o equation were often not followed numerous k c studies included comparative assessments of et equations thus not focusing on the derivation of k c on the pm eto equation naturally using an et o different than the pm et o results in k c values non comparable with the tabulated standard ones while transferability of research results is hampered when a different et o is used using the fao56 tabulated standard k c with a different et equation leads to over or under estimation errors in using the k c et o approach it is therefore recommended that research using a different reference et equation should consider the ratio of that et o to the pm et o equation doing this provides a means to convert the k c data making them comparable with tabulated standard values the best use of the k c et o method implies using the segmented fao k c curve i e accepting the definition of the four crop growth stages and the definition of three k c values k c ini k c mid and k c end using time averaged monthly k c values or non linear k c functions of time may be adequate for local use but these are very difficult to use predictively in different locations the fao k c curve is also difficult to use predictively due to inter annual weather variability inducing variable durations of the crop growth stages however this difficulty may be overcome when expressing growth durations in terms of cumulative growth degree days or with the use of remotely sensed vegetation indices these methods consist of areas of research already underway for various field crops and that should be extended to other crops as well tabulated k c values in this article basically refer to surface sprinkler and less often drip irrigation the use of mulches could not be considered for tabulated k c but the effects of mulches were small because reported literature on k c values refer to the mid and late season where the cover fraction is generally high nevertheless the impacts of mulches and related water management issues described in section 10 of fao56 are considered valid and appropriate however various reported studies provide for comparing impacts of irrigation methods and mulches which may add to what was provided in the referred fao56 section further research is required on the use of mulches but better focused hopefully on impacts on transpiration and soil evaporation with consideration of the fraction of soil wetted and the fraction of ground cover by the crop research should aim at obtaining high accuracy et estimation and partitioning and should focus on few relevant variables in such a way that impacts on k c k cb values could be well recognized and related results transferred to other locations at present mulch effects are often studied with focus on a large number of variables despite limitations of this review it is recommended that users apply the updated k c and k cb values to determine the upper limits of crop evapotranspiration when planning irrigation programs and in real time management of irrigation scheduling avoiding the use of high k c above 1 25 which have no physical justification as analyzed may lead to saving irrigation water it is informative to note that maximum k c and k cb values for major field crops such as wheat have not changed much from those given 22 years ago in fao56 the data used for the tabulated fao56 k c values obtained in studies over 40 50 years ago generally agree with current studies which suggests little effect of climate change induced differences on the ratio of et c et o however when facing climate change challenges and related environmental consequences such as reduced water resources it is imperative that methods like fao56 be considered as a means to manage productive crops with efficient irrigation water use to face global change water conservation and saving are definitely necessary declaration of competing
