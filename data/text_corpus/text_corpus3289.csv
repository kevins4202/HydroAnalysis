16445,forested land plays an essential role in water supply across the united states us smoldering commonly existing in wildfires contributes significantly to biomass consumption and gas emission but its influence on source water quality has been rarely studied here we investigated the impact of smoldering temperature i e no burn 250 400 and 600 c on the nutrients elements and dissolved organic matter dom of water extracts from the residues of the leaf needles and woody trunks of pine pinus jeffreyi under the lab simulated smoldering fire results showed the increase of ph and the yields of

icr ms presented consistent results with uv fluorescence suggesting that the unburned materials contained more biodegradable tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds with high molecular weight mw whereas the 600 c smoldering materials composed of more aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with a potentially high density of c c bonds had less reactivity in forming trihalomethanes thms and haloacetonitriles hans our study indicates the smoldering dominated prescribed fire as a potential forest management strategy for reducing biomass fuel

widely used by water facilities across the united states us to produce drinking water brown et al 2008 elias et al 2013 however wildfires play a negative role in the downstream water quantity and

dichlorobromomethane dcbm due to warmer weather conditions forest wildfires especially in western north america have increased in both frequency and severity schoennagel et al 2017 westerling et al 2006 therefore investigating the fire affected water quality including dom and dbp precursors will help us confront climate change challenges and ensure drinking water safety by developing appropriate management strategies on forests and facilities bladon et al 2014 besides wildfires the influence of prescribed fire a planned and low intensity fire for eliminating the fuel and reducing the occurrence and intensity of wildfires alcaniz et al 2018 has also been evaluated on water quality majidzadeh et al 2019 found that the long term prescribed fires reduced forest detritus along with doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn and dom reactivity in forming thms and hans in the outflow of the watershed oxygen fuel and heat are three fire variables miloua 2019 that affect the physicochemical properties of water extracts from the ash residues after fires thermal decomposition including combustion and pyrolysis is the heat caused chemical decomposition that includes reactions using heat to break chemical bonds in the compound undergoing decomposition combustion is usually an exothermic reaction between fuel s and oxidant s i e oxygen whereas pyrolysis is mostly the endothermic reaction in the absence of oxidant s mulky and niemeyer 2019 using the detritus of ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and white fir abies concolor as fuel materials wang et al 2015a investigated the influence of oxygen combustion and pyrolysis and temperatures no burn 250 and 400 c on the optical properties and the dbp formation in ash derived water extracts for example with the order of no burn 250 and 400 c they found the decrease of the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 under the pyrolysis no oxygen whereas an increase of suva254 humification index hix dom reactivity in forming hans under the oxidation smoldering combustion is a slow low temperature and flameless fire with oxygen that reacts with the fuel surface which can be self sustaining switzer et al 2009 watts and kobziar 2013 the smolder process contains the simultaneous and competing pyrolysis and combustion reactions hadden et al 2013 it commonly occurs in a wildfire especially in the peatland and contributes significantly to biomass consumption and emission of greenhouse gas and volatile organic compounds vocs anca couce et al 2012 liu et al 2017 until now the influence of temperature and fuel types during smoldering has been rarely investigated on the water quality of the ash derived water extracts while uv visible and fluorescence spectroscopy uv fluorescence as a rapid and inexpensive analytical technique are widely used for characterizing dom optical properties liu et al 2019 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has appeared as an analytic technique in the past decade for characterizing complex organic matrix at the molecular level nebbioso and piccolo 2013 wu et al 2018 with the remarkable mass resolving power mass accuracy 1 ppm and mass resolution ft icr ms enables the assignment of unique molecular formulas to thousands of spectrum peaks in one sample benigni et al 2017 smith et al 2018 in this study we conducted controlled laboratory burning to simulate the smoldering process under different burning temperatures 250 400 and 600 c with two fuel materials leaf needles and woody trunk of pine pinus jeffreyi the objectives of the study were to 1 determine

different temperatures with a steady airflow of 200 ml min in the pre conditioned furnace heavy duty tube furnace lindberg mph mi figure s1b after 1 h the samples were removed from the furnace and cooled down to room temperature the samples were weighed before and after burning and the mass loss was calculated two fuel types leaf and wood were burned under three temperatures 250 400 and 600 c with two replicates this experimental design resulted in a total of four individual treatments unburned unb50 and burned at 250 400 and 600 c b250 b400 and b600 overall fourteen unburned and burned samples were collected for further analyses the samples had black color after burning under the studied temperatures figure s2 we considered the burnings in our study as smoldering because of steady airflow with the flameless form of the combustion process chemical analyses the contents of carbon c and nitrogen n in the burned residuals were determined by flash 2000 chn o analyzer thermo fisher

for uv absorbance and a shimadzu spectrofluorometer rf5301 for fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem we gained suva254 l mg c m and e2 e3 ratio by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm with the doc concentration and the uv absorbance at 365 nm respectively table 1 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the hix was calculated by dividing the peak area under the emission wavelengths em of 435 480 nm with that under em 300 345 nm at the excitation wavelength ex of 254 nm ohno 2002 the eem was operationally divided into five regions of i tyrosine like proteins ii tryptophan like proteins iii fulvic acid

the elute was blown down to 1 ml with a gentle flow of nitrogen gas diluted 100 with pure methanol and directly infused into a 12 tesla bruker solarix ft icr ms bruker daltonics inc billerica ma at the pacific northwest national laboratory wa samples were analyzed by co adding 200 scans using negative and positive ionization modes by electrospray ionization esi all samples were analyzed with a

lists by applying fourier transform mass spectrometry peak picker with signal to noise s n threshold of 7 and absolute intensity threshold of 100 the observed masses in each sample were internally calibrated using organic matter homologous series the mass measurement accuracy after internal calibration was 1 ppm subsequently elemental formulas were assigned using formularity software tolic et al 2017 following the compound identification algorithm cia described by kujawinski and behn 2006 with the criteria of c0 100h0 200o0 50n0 10s0 2 h c 2 2 o c 1 2 n c 0 5 and mass measurement error 0 5 ppm the formulas existing in duplicate burned samples were used for future data analysis data analysis we used the boundary limits in the van krevelen vk diagram from rivas ubach et al 2018 with a script in github https github com pnnl comp mass spec mscc for categorizing the assigned features into six biochemical classes of amino sugars carbohydrates phytochemical oxygenated aromatic compounds phyoxyarom proteins lipids and nucleotides molecular lability boundary for more labile formulas mlbl was calculated by dividing the number of formulas with h c 1 5 with the total amount of formulas table 1 d andrilli et al 2015 the double bond equivalent dbe calculated by 2c h n p 2 2 indicates the number of rings plus the number of double bonds to carbon in a formula tfaily et al 2013 the

represent the reduced compounds and the oxidized compounds with great polarity cao et al 2015 schmidt et al 2017 here we only considered the number of assigned formulas because the peak abundance cannot be directly equated to concentration and may be affected by ionization efficiency of different compounds in complex mixtures kujawinski 2002 liu and kujawinski 2015 we employed rstudio desktop version 1 3 959 boston ma for data analyses and visualization principal component analysis was conducted using the prcomp function in the stats package to describe the linkages among the properties of the assigned features by ft icr ms dom optical properties by uv fluorescence and dom reactivity in forming dbps in all water extract samples we calculated the correlation coefficients and p values in the correlation matrix using the cor and cor test functions in the stats package results and discussion mass loss and residual c and n the percentage of mass loss increased with increasing temperature from 58 5 and 44 0 at 250 c to 84 5 and 83 0 at 600 c for leaf and wood respectively but they were similar between leaf and wood burned under the same temperatures this result indicates that mass loss percentage depended on the burning process and temperature instead of fuel material wang et al 2015a also reported the slight difference 1 41 6 95 of mass loss percentages between the burned ponderosa pine and white fir under four conditions two combustion types two burning temperatures doerr et al 2018 found that mass loss percentage was positively and significantly r 0 65 p 0 01 related to maximum temperatures on the sample surface the mass loss percentage in the high intensity fire was considerably higher than that in the low intensity fire doerr et al 2018 wang et al 2015a found that the percentages of mass loss under the pyrolysis and combustion of the ponderosa pine detritus were 14 2 and 64 1 at 250 c and 39 5 and 75 4 at 400 c respectively they concluded that combustion caused more forest biomass loss relative to pyrolysis hadden et al 2013 reported a larger residual mass at lower oxygen concentration and suggested a wider smoldering front for sustaining the smoldering in our study the mass loss percentages during the smoldering of leaf and wood were 44 0 58 5 at 250 c and 76 5 77 0 at 400 c comparing with wang et al 2015a our result indicates the rough order of combustion smoldering pyrolysis in mass loss the carbon contents including organic and inorganic carbon in the burned leaf and wood increased with increasing temperature from 60 2 and 57 6 at 250 c to 69 2 and 75 4 at 600 c respectively these carbon contents were similar between leaf and wood burned under the same temperatures after using the meta analysis to summarize 57 publications nave et al 2011 concluded that wildfires reduced forest floor mainly organic carbon and nitrogen storage by 59 and 50 respectively but did not change soil carbon and nitrogen contents the thermal combustion can mineralize the organic carbon and nitrogen compounds and release co2 and n2 and vocs into the atmosphere at the same time a considerable amount of organic matter in fuel materials could be burned incompletely and thus accumulated on the burned materials knicker et al 2005 the fraction of dissolved organic carbon in residue carbon decreased significantly with increasing temperature from 0 39 and 0 49 at 250 c to 0 07 and 0 04 at 600 c for leaf and wood this result indicates a decrease in the water solubility of residue carbon possibly due to the shearing of side chains including the hydrophilic function groups such as oh and cooh for forming poly aromatic structures during fires alexis et al 2010 gonzalez perez et al 2004 there was no apparent tendency of the nitrogen content in the residuals under the studied burning temperatures which was in the range of 1 57 2 21 and 0 33 0 40 for the burned leaf and wood respectively however this result indicates a relatively higher nitrogen content in the burned leaf than in the burned wood though without an apparent tendency with increasing temperature in burned samples the c n ratio of 28 8 44 2 in burned leaf was much lower than those of 169 212 in burned wood this result suggests greater nitrogen limitation relative to carbon in burned wood for microbes during vegetation recovery after the smoldering fire considering the importance of nitrogen in sustaining productivity pellegrini et al 2018 nutrients and elements in water extracts for both leaf and wood the doc tdn and don yields decreased significantly after the smoldering while lower doc yields were observed under higher burning temperatures table 2 both doc and don yields in the unburned leaf were 4 49 and 3 07 times of these in the unburned wood indicating higher dom release from the unburned leaf relative to the unburned wood the tdn yields were 8 and 7 higher than don yields in the unburned leaf and wood respectively indicating organic nitrogen as the dominant form of nitrogen uzun et al 2020 these percentages were 12 52 and 54 84 for the burned leaf and wood respectively possibly due to faster volatilization of organic n relative to inorganic n during the smoldering wang et al 2015a found the decrease of doc and tdn yields in the order of unburned 250 c burned 400 c burned materials under the combustion and 250 c burned unburned 400 c burned materials under the pyrolysis the tendency of doc and tdn yields from the smoldering in our study was different from the pyrolysis and close to the combustion in wang et al 2015a noted the post fire water quality depends on not only fire characteristics e g severity intensity and duration but also watershed characteristics e g soil slope and vegetation and climate bladon et al 2014 ranalli 2004 the increases in the amounts of sediments doc and don were commonly observed in source water from the burned watersheds emelko et al 2011 writer et al 2014 due to the combustion of forest biomass soil especially o horizon previously as a filter layer for source water chen et al 2020 khan et al 2015 the no3 n yield µg g material in burned leaf and wood increased with temperature increasing from 250 c to 600 c though no3 n yield of 3 66 µg g material in unburned leaf was 12 2 times of 0 30 µg g material in unburned wood no3 n yield varied slightly between leaf and wood burned under the same temperature besides no2 n was rarely observed in our unburned and burned samples while nh4 n yields did not show a good tendency with temperatures possibly due to high variations between the replicate burnings during fires nh4 is primarily sourced from the combustion of organic matter while the nh4 nitrification is the primary source of no3 ranalli 2004 the yields mg g material of phosphorus p po4 3 p and so4 2 increased significantly with increasing temperature and leaf had much higher yields than wood when comparing their unburned materials or materials burned under the same temperatures specifically the po4 3 p yield increased from 0 24 in the unburned leaf to 1 50 6 30 times in 600 c burned leaf and from 0 06 in unburned wood to 0 27 4 67 times in 400 c burned wood and decreased slightly to 0 26 in 600 c burned wood due to the formation of hydrophobic organic layers and the increase of water repellency in soil the runoff increases after wildfires ranalli 2004 previous studies rhoades et al 2019 rhoades et al 2011 commonly reported the elevated concentrations of inorganic n and p in surface water after wildfires ranalli 2004 summarized 39 studies and found elevated average no3 n and po4 3 p levels both 3 5 and 1 2 years after wildfires sulwinski et al 2020 found an increase of po4 3 p in water and soil samples even 12 years after smoldering fire besides po4 3 p elevated levels of other p forms also have been reported after wildfires silins et al 2014 reported 2 13 times higher p 0 001 average concentrations of all form p including soluble reactive total dissolved particular and total in streams in burned and post fire salvage logged watersheds relative to those flowing through unburned watershed emelko et al 2016 reported significantly higher concentrations of total particular phosphorus downstream of wildfire affected areas compared to upstream unburned areas br in source water can influence the dbp formation by increasing the levels of formed thms and hans ersan et al 2019 and forming more brominated thms and hans chen et al 2020 in our study the br yield µg g material decreased from 3 19 in the unburned leaf to 0 01 in 250 c burned leaf and then increased to 4 31 in 600 c burned leaf this result could be due to the dynamic changes of burning induced halogen volatilization and the mineralization of organobromine compounds chen et al 2018 interestingly the br yield was not found in the wood related samples this result indicates the variation of br yield in the different parts of pine and the unburned and burned 400 c leaf needles of pine as an important source of br atmospheric deposition was an essential cause for the high chlorine and bromine inputs in the california forest ecosystems due to their proximity to the ocean chen et al 2018 the leaf with a much higher surface area relative to the wood could accumulate more bromine on its surface moreover wang et al 2015b reported the br yield of 0 30 and 0 66 µg g material in the black and white ashes respectively from the 2013 rim fire with the representative vegetation types of ponderosa pine mixed conifer forest mixed oak woodlands and chaparral these yields were significantly lower than 1 42 and 4 31 µg g material in 400 and 600 c burned leaf in our study indicating the dependence of the br yield on vegetation types the ph gradually increased from 4 74 and 5 40 in unburned leaf and wood to 10 1 and 9 48 in 600 c burned leaf and wood respectively indicating the change of water extracts to less acidic simultaneously as the dominated exchangeable cations the yields of k and mg2 in both burned leaf and wood residues increased with increasing temperature table s2 previous studies arocena and opio 2003 nathe et al 2018 reported that the release of exchangeable cations e g k and mg2 during the combustion of organic matter enhances the h adsorption on the negatively charged colloids and thus increases ph besides elements of arsenic as cadmium cd chromium cr molybdenum mo nickel ni lead pb and selenium se were not detected in all unburned and burned samples in our study table s2 optical properties of dom in water extracts the suva254 is a good indicator of aromatic carbon content weishaar et al 2003 whereas a higher hix is related to a higher humification degree fellman et al 2010 lavonen et al 2015 both suva254 and hix continuously increased with increasing temperature specifically from unb50 to b600 we found the increase of suva254 l mg c m from 0 60 0 68 to 3 13 3 22 and hix from 0 27 0 34 to 15 2 18 7 in b600 fig 1 and table s3 both suva254 and hix were similar between leaf and wood considering their unburned materials or materials burned under the same temperatures the hix values in b600 from our study were high as 15 9 5 9 for soil fulvic acid ohno 2002 a positive and significant relationship r 0 99 p 0 001 was found between suva254 and hix by including all the unburned and burned samples regardless of fuel materials and burning temperatures for correlation analysis table s4 wang et al 2015a reported that both suva254 and hix increased after the combustion and decreased after the pyrolysis suggesting an important role of oxygen in suva254 and hix during combustion the tendency of suva254 and hix after the smoldering in our study was consistent with that after the combustion in wang et al 2015a the e2 e3 inversely correlated with dom mw decreased from 5 93 8 50 in unb50 to 4 56 4 90 in b250 and then increased to 5 17 6 04 in b600 fig 1 and table s3 however the weak relationship r 0 58 p 0 05 between e2 e3 by fluorescence eem and mw by ft icr ms indicates e2 e3 as an unrepresentative indicator for dom mw the tyrosine like and tryptophan like proteins and soluble microbial byproducts are considered biodegradable while the fulvic acid like organics and humic acid like organics are relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation guo et al 2014 pang et al 2020 the pi n percentage decreased for tyrosine like region i and tryptophan like region ii proteins and soluble microbial byproducts region iv and increased for fulvic acid like region iii and humic acid like region v organics from unb50 to b250 to b400 while changes of the pi n percentage in these regions were slight from b400 to b600 the total percentage of relatively recalcitrant materials iii and v increased from 12 8 17 5 in unbu50 to 68 8 71 7 in b600 indicating decreased biodegradability with increasing temperature besides we found that suva254 and hix were negatively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 related to pi n tyrosine like proteins pii n tryptophan like proteins and piv n soluble microbial byproducts and positively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 correlated with piii n fulvic acid like organcs and pv n humic acid like organics table s4 this result indicates the potential contribution of the increase in aromaticity and humification degree to decreased biodegradability with increasing temperature molecular characterization of dom in water extracts the influence of burning temperatures instead of fuel materials was commonly observed on the bulk properties of the assigned features in water extracts the number of assigned features in dom significantly decreased with increasing temperature fig 2 and table s5 due to the mineralization volatilization of organic compounds during the smoldering cho with 40 9 88 7 was the dominated elemental class we observed lower cho percentages and higher chon chos and chons percentages at 600 c relative to the unburned materials though the elemental class percentages did not illustrate obvious tendencies with temperatures fig 3 and table s5 specifically we found relatively high chon percentages of 30 8 and 22 8 in leaf b400 and b600 respectively the leaf b400 and b600 had n containing compounds chon and chons of 37 0 and 34 9 and bn aimod 0 67 n 0 of 31 4 and 28 4 suggesting a large fraction of bn in these n containing compounds at high temperatures bn is composed of the n containing heterocyclic aromatic structures with great recalcitrance knicker 2010 lopez martin et al 2018 we found the increase of chos from 4 50 and 4 40 in b250 to 24 1 and 33 5 in b600 for leaf and wood respectively suggesting an important fraction of organosulfur compounds oscs in dom at high temperatures with increasing temperature we observed an increase in the fraction of unsaturated and aromatic compounds and a decrease in the fraction of labile organic compounds in dom specifically the percentage of phyoxyaroms as one of dominated biogeochemical classes increased from unb50 34 0 39 8 to b400 76 6 81 6 while group1 condensed polycyclic compounds increased from unb50 1 89 3 79 to b600 52 0 55 8 this result suggested the potential increase in the fraction of poly aromatic compounds in dom with increasing temperature moreover we observed the decrease in atomic h to c ratio h c and the increase in aimod from unb50 to b400 indicating the increase of unsaturation and aromaticity in dom the changes in the average properties of the assigned features by ft icr ms were generally slight when the temperature increased from 400 to 600 c higher dbe dbe to atomic c ratio dbe c dbe to atomic o ratio dbe o and the difference between dbe an atomic o dbe o suggest a higher degree of unsaturation by considering the number of π bonds and rings a higher density of c c double bonds a lower number of c o bonds and a higher c c unsaturation by excluding all the possible c o bonds respectively roth et al 2013 dbe dbe o and dbe o decreased from unb50 to b250 and then greatly increased to b600 except dbe o continuously increased from unb50 to b600 for wood this result indicates the increase in the unsaturation degree and the c c unsaturation and the decrease in c o bonds with temperatures from 250 to 600 c dbe c increased from 0 35 0 44 in unb50 and b250 to 0 65 0 71 in b400 and b600 indicating the increased density of c c double bonds the mlbl percentage decreased from unb50 42 0 45 8 to b400 6 03 11 0 indicating a decreased fraction of labile organic compounds for the leaf and wood nosc was negative in unb50 0 51 and

group3 highly unsaturated phenolic compounds from unb50 40 8 44 6 to b600 11 2 11 5 and of the group4 aliphatic compounds from unb50 42 0 45 8 to b400 6 03 11 0 this result also indicates a decrease of biodegradability with increasing temperature tsai and chow 2016 considering the rough order of group4 group3 group2 group1 in biodegradability santl temkiv et al 2013 the strong and significant r 0 50 or r 0 50 p 0 05 relationships were observed between the optical properties by uv fluorescence and the bulk properties by ft icr ms table s4 confirming the generally consistent interpretation of the optical properties by uv fluorescence with the ft icr ms bulk properties specifically the optical property of suva254 was positively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 related to aimod both of which were interpreted as aromaticity the optical properties of piii n fulvic acid like organics and pv n humic acid like organics were negatively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 correlated with mlbl the fulvic acid like organics piii n and humic acid like organics pv n are relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation while mlbl indicates the fraction of labile organic compounds the optical properties of suva254 hix piii n and pv n were positively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 related to dbe dbe c and dbe o whereas pi n pii n and piv n were negatively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 related to dbe c and dbe o this result indicates that the increase in aromaticity humification degree and fraction of fulvic and humic acid like organics with increasing temperature resulted in a higher density of c c double bonds and c c unsaturation lee et al 2019 also obtained consistent results using optical indices based end member mixing analysis emma and ft icr ms in urban river water they considered the optical indices based emma as a reliable tool for tracking organic matter sources in urban watersheds niu et al 2018 reported the strong correlation between suva254 and weight averaged dbe in nine river and lake water samples except for two outliers with relatively lower weight averaged atomic o to c ratio o c dom reactivity in dbp formation with increasing temperature we observed the decrease in the levels of formed dbps µg g material related to the decline of doc levels and the changes of dom chlorine chloramine reactivity fig 4 and table s6 this result suggests the smoldering dominated prescribed fire as an important landscape management strategy for mitigating the dbp precursors in forested land source water emelko and sham 2014 specifically thm fps µg g material decreased from 1628 and 296 in unb50 to 10 4 and 4 74 in b600 for leaf and wood respectively though the levels of formed dbps were similar between leaf and wood burned under the same burning temperatures the unburned leaf had higher levels of studied dbps than the unburned wood indicating the unburned leaf as a more important source of dbp precursors relative to the unburned wood the dom chlorine reactivity in forming thms except b600 for leaf and b400 for wood and hans except b250 for leaf µg mg doc roughly decreased with increasing temperature whereas the tendency was not apparent for dom reactivity in forming the other two studied dbp categories our previous study wang et al 2015b found that burned detritus of black moderate severity and white ash high severity had lower thms and haas reactivity µg mg doc relative to nonburned detritus from the 2013 rim fire in california us they suggested the decreased dom reactivity in forming thms and haas with increasing burn severity possibly due to high energy requirement in breaking down double bond structures when chlorinating condensed aromatics compared to plant derived phenolics these results potentially indicate the important role of side chains attached to aromatic structures in the thms and haas formation for example huang and shah 2018 found that tertiary amines enhanced the thm and haa formation via the strong chlorinating agent of r3n cl when chlorinating aromatic compounds i e salicylic acid phenol and resorcinol and suwannee river fulvic acid correlation analysis indicated that shan fps was negatively and significantly r 0 5 p 0 05 correlated with suva254 hix piii n aimod nosc dbe dbe c and dbe o and positively and significantly r 0 5 p 0 05 related to pii n piv n and mlbl table s4 suggesting the biodegradable tryptophan like and soluble microbial byproduct compounds with high chlorine reactivity in forming hans differently with increasing temperature wang et al 2015a found that dom chlorine reactivity in forming hans increased during the combustion and changed slightly during the pyrolysis combustion they suggested oxidized aromatic and humified compounds with high reactivity in forming hans these differences potentially indicate that combustion smoldering and pyrolysis play different roles in altering dom reactivity in forming hans by temperatures which needs further research our previous studies collected the field samples related with the 2013 rim fire chen et al 2020 wang et al 2015b we found the increased dom chlorine reactivity in forming hans with the orders of nonburned detritus black ash white ash wang et al 2015b moreover we observed higher dom chloramine relative to chlorine reactivity in forming hans with the order of fir pine white ash black ash chen et al 2020 these results potentially indicates that combustion instead of smoldering as the dominant fire behavior during wildfires affecting post fire dom reactivity in forming hans noted studies reported the hydrolysis of hans at an accelerated rate under the conditions of alkaline ph high free chlorine residual and prolonged reaction time glezer et al 1999 yu and reckhow 2015 our recent publication kanan and karanfil 2020 compared uniform formation condition ufc consisted of reaction time of 24 1 h the temperature of 20 0 1 0 c ph 7 8 0 2 and fp test consisted of reaction time of 120 h the temperature of 20 0 1 0 c ph 7 8 0 2 under chlorination and chloramination conditions we found that han formation was in the order of ufc fp during chloramination but ufc fp under chlorination indicating han decomposition during the fp test this result indicates that a relatively short reaction time of 24 h should be used during fp test under chlorination for reducing han decomposition using principal component analysis on the dom optical properties the properties of the assigned features by ft icr ms and the dom reactivity in forming dbps the first two components explained 71 4 and 16 5 of the total variance respectively fig 4 the variables of pi n pii n piv n mw mlbl sthm fps and shan fps had high negative loadings 0 50 in the first principal component pc1 while high positive loadings 0 50 in pc1 were observed for suva254 hix piii n pv n aimod nosc dbe dbe c dbe o and dbe o table s7 similarly loadings 0 50 in the second principal component pc2 were found for sndma fp while dbe o sthm fps and shaa fps had positive loading 0 50 in pc2 based on the loadings of studied parameters we interpreted the negative pc1 as the biodegradable tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds with high mw and high reactivity in forming thms and hans the positive pc1 was explained as the aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with a high degree of unsaturation a high density of c c double bonds a low number of c o bonds and a high c c unsaturation by excluding all the possible c o bonds the negative pc2 reflected compounds with high reactivity in forming ndma while the positive pc2 was considered as compounds with a low number of c o bonds and high reactivity in forming thms and haas according to their scores the samples were roughly separated into four clusters of unburned materials 250 c burned materials 400 c burned materials and 600 c burned materials with the increase of pc1 scores from negative to positive values this finding suggests that the unburned materials contained more biodegradable tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds with high mw and high reactivity in forming thms and hans while the 600 c burned materials were composed of more aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with a high degree of unsaturation high density of c c double bonds low number of c o bonds and high c c unsaturation by excluding all the possible c o bonds conclusion and environmental implications this study concluded that the mass loss percentage increased with temperatures increasing from 250 to 600 c and there were no significant differences in mass loss percentage between leaf and wood smoldered under the same temperatures biomass loss during smoldering combustion and flaming combustion was similar and higher than that during pyrolysis this result indicates that smoldering combustion may be effective for reducing the biomass of leaf and wood which are considered important sources of dom and dbps precursors in forested watersheds as temperatures increased from 250 to 600 c we observed a slight increase in the c contents including organic and inorganic c possibly due to the relative accumulation of incompletely burned compounds and the significant decrease in the fraction of dissolved organic c in residue c potentially because of the shearing of side chains including the hydrophilic function groups such as oh and cooh for the formation of poly aromatic structures during fires this result suggests the decreases of exported doc per gram of materials along with the water solubility of the residual organic c after smoldering moreover we observed low n content and extremely high c n in burned wood indicating great n limitation for microbes during vegetation recovery after smoldering fires the br yield was detectable in unburned and burned except 250 c leaf instead of the wood related samples whereas the pine wood was a less important source of br relative to the pine leaf results from ft icr ms suggest the decrease in the number of assigned features the number of cho compounds i e with the elements of only c h and o and the fraction of highly unsaturated phenolic compounds group3 and the increase in the fraction of condensed polycyclic compounds group1 with increasing temperature these results indicate that mineralization volatilization of organic compounds and also the enrichment of polyaromatic structures during smoldering with the order of unburned 250 c burned and 400 c burned materials we found the increase of unsaturated and oxidized compounds and aromaticity and the decrease in the fraction of labile organic compounds aimod mlbl and nosc were strongly and significantly r 0 50 or r 0 50 p 0 05 related to the optical properties of suva254 hix pi n pii n piii n piv n and pv n by uv fluorescence indicating the consistency of uv fluorescence results with those from ft icr ms using principal component analysis we found the decrease in the fraction of biodegradable tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds with high mw and high reactivity in forming thms and hans and the increase in the fraction of the aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with a high degree of unsaturation a high density of c c double bonds a low number of c o bonds and a high c c unsaturation by excluding all the possible c o bonds following the order of unburned materials 250 c burned materials 400 c burned materials and 600 c burned materials we observed a decrease in the formation of the studied four dbp categories i e thms haas hans and ndma with increasing temperature considering the variability in some parameters such as sthm fps in b400 for wood greater replication would be beneficial in future investigations of lab controlled smoldering thus our result suggests the smoldering dominated prescribed fire as a potential approach for reducing the dom reactivity in forming thms and hans and the fp of dbps i e thms haas hans and ndma in source water from forested watersheds though smoldering fires have notorious disadvantages e g hard to extinguish

total dissolved nitrogen tdn and dom reactivity in forming thms and hans in the outflow of the watershed oxygen fuel and heat are three fire variables miloua 2019 that affect the physicochemical properties of water extracts from the ash residues after fires thermal decomposition including combustion and pyrolysis is the heat caused chemical decomposition that includes reactions using heat to break chemical bonds in the compound undergoing decomposition combustion is usually an exothermic reaction between fuel s and oxidant s i e oxygen whereas pyrolysis is mostly the endothermic reaction

represent the reduced compounds and the oxidized compounds with great polarity cao et al 2015 schmidt et al 2017 here we only considered the number of assigned formulas because the peak abundance cannot be directly equated to concentration and may be affected by ionization efficiency of different compounds in complex mixtures kujawinski 2002 liu and kujawinski 2015 we employed rstudio desktop version 1 3 959 boston ma for data analyses and visualization principal component analysis was conducted using the prcomp function in the stats package to describe the linkages among the properties of the assigned features by ft icr ms dom optical properties by uv fluorescence and dom reactivity in forming dbps in all water extract samples we calculated the correlation coefficients and p values in the correlation matrix using the cor and cor test functions in the stats package results and discussion mass loss and residual c and n the percentage of mass loss increased with increasing temperature from 58 5 and 44 0 at 250 c to 84 5 and 83 0 at 600 c for leaf and wood respectively but they were similar between leaf and wood burned under the same temperatures this result indicates that mass loss percentage depended on the burning process and temperature instead of fuel material wang et al 2015a also reported the slight difference 1 41 6 95 of mass loss percentages between the burned ponderosa pine and white fir under four conditions two combustion types two burning temperatures doerr et al 2018 found that mass loss percentage was positively and significantly r 0 65 p 0 01 related to maximum temperatures on the sample surface the mass loss percentage in the high intensity fire was considerably higher than that in the low intensity fire doerr et al 2018 wang et al 2015a found that the percentages of mass loss under the pyrolysis and combustion of the ponderosa pine detritus were 14 2 and 64 1 at 250 c and 39 5 and 75 4 at 400 c respectively they concluded that combustion caused more forest biomass loss relative to pyrolysis hadden et al 2013 reported a larger residual mass at lower oxygen concentration and suggested a wider smoldering front for sustaining the smoldering in our study the mass loss percentages during the smoldering of leaf and wood were 44 0 58 5 at 250 c and 76 5 77 0 at 400 c comparing with wang et al 2015a our result indicates the rough order of combustion smoldering pyrolysis in mass loss the carbon contents including organic and inorganic carbon in the burned leaf and wood increased with increasing temperature from 60 2 and 57 6 at 250 c to 69 2 and 75 4 at 600 c respectively these carbon contents were similar between leaf and wood burned under the same temperatures after using the meta analysis to summarize 57 publications nave et al 2011 concluded that wildfires reduced forest floor mainly organic carbon and nitrogen storage by 59 and 50 respectively but did not change soil carbon and nitrogen contents the thermal combustion can mineralize the organic carbon and nitrogen compounds and release co2 and n2 and vocs into the atmosphere at the same time a considerable amount of organic matter in fuel materials could be burned incompletely and thus accumulated on the burned materials knicker et al 2005 the fraction of dissolved organic carbon in residue carbon decreased significantly with increasing temperature from 0 39 and 0 49 at 250 c to 0 07 and 0 04 at 600 c for leaf and wood this result indicates a decrease in the water solubility of residue carbon possibly due to the shearing of side chains including the hydrophilic function groups such as oh and cooh for forming poly aromatic structures during fires alexis et al 2010 gonzalez perez et al 2004 there was no apparent tendency of the nitrogen content in the residuals under the studied burning temperatures which was in the range of 1 57 2 21 and 0 33 0 40 for the burned leaf and wood respectively however this result indicates a relatively higher nitrogen content in the burned leaf than in the burned wood though without an apparent tendency with increasing temperature in burned samples the c n ratio of 28 8 44 2 in burned leaf was much lower than those of 169 212 in burned wood this result suggests greater nitrogen limitation relative to carbon in burned wood for microbes during vegetation recovery after the smoldering fire considering the importance of nitrogen in sustaining productivity pellegrini et al 2018 nutrients and elements in water extracts for both leaf and wood the doc tdn and don yields decreased significantly after the smoldering while lower doc yields were observed under higher burning temperatures table 2 both doc and don yields in the unburned leaf were 4 49 and 3 07 times of these in the unburned wood indicating higher dom release from the unburned leaf relative to the unburned wood the tdn yields were 8 and 7 higher than don yields in the unburned leaf and wood respectively indicating organic nitrogen as the dominant form of nitrogen uzun et al 2020 these percentages were 12 52 and 54 84 for the burned leaf and wood respectively possibly due to faster volatilization of organic n relative to inorganic n during the smoldering wang et al 2015a found the decrease of doc and tdn yields in the order of unburned 250 c burned 400 c burned materials under the combustion and 250 c burned unburned 400 c burned materials under the pyrolysis the tendency of doc and tdn yields from the smoldering in our study was different from the pyrolysis and close to the combustion in wang et al 2015a noted the post fire water quality depends on not only fire characteristics e g severity intensity and duration but also watershed characteristics e g soil slope and vegetation and climate bladon et al 2014 ranalli 2004 the increases in the amounts of sediments doc and don were commonly observed in source water from the burned watersheds emelko et al 2011 writer et al 2014 due to the combustion of forest biomass soil especially o horizon previously as a filter layer for source water chen et al 2020 khan et al 2015 the no3 n yield µg g material in burned leaf and wood increased with temperature increasing from 250 c to 600 c though no3 n yield of 3 66 µg g material in unburned leaf was 12 2 times of 0 30 µg g material in unburned wood no3 n yield varied slightly between leaf and wood burned under the same temperature besides no2 n was rarely observed in our unburned and burned samples while nh4 n yields did not show a good tendency with temperatures possibly due to high variations between the replicate burnings during fires nh4 is primarily sourced from the combustion of organic matter while the nh4 nitrification is the primary source of no3 ranalli 2004 the yields mg g material of phosphorus p po4 3 p and so4 2 increased significantly with increasing temperature and leaf had much higher yields than wood when comparing their unburned materials or materials burned under the same temperatures specifically the po4 3 p yield increased from 0 24 in the unburned leaf to 1 50 6 30 times in 600 c burned leaf and from 0 06 in unburned wood to 0 27 4 67 times in 400 c burned wood and decreased slightly to 0 26 in 600 c burned wood due to the formation of hydrophobic organic layers and the increase of water repellency in soil the runoff increases after wildfires ranalli 2004 previous studies rhoades et al 2019 rhoades et al 2011 commonly reported the elevated concentrations of inorganic n and p in surface water after wildfires ranalli 2004 summarized 39 studies and found elevated average no3 n and po4 3 p levels both 3 5 and 1 2 years after wildfires sulwinski et al 2020 found an increase of po4 3 p in water and soil samples even 12 years after smoldering fire besides po4 3 p elevated levels of other p forms also have been reported after wildfires silins et al 2014 reported 2 13 times higher p 0 001 average concentrations of all form p including soluble reactive total dissolved particular and total in streams in burned and post fire salvage logged watersheds relative to those flowing through unburned watershed emelko et al 2016 reported significantly higher concentrations of total particular phosphorus downstream of wildfire affected areas compared to upstream unburned areas br in source water can influence the dbp formation by increasing the levels of formed thms and hans ersan et al 2019 and forming more brominated thms and hans chen et al 2020 in our study the br yield µg g material decreased from 3 19 in the unburned leaf to 0 01 in 250 c burned leaf and then increased to 4 31 in 600 c burned leaf this result could be due to the dynamic changes of burning induced halogen volatilization and the mineralization of organobromine compounds chen et al 2018 interestingly the br yield was not found in the wood related samples this result indicates the variation of br yield in the different parts of pine and the unburned and burned 400 c leaf needles of pine as an important source of br atmospheric deposition was an essential cause for the high chlorine and bromine inputs in the california forest ecosystems due to their proximity to the ocean chen et al 2018 the leaf with a much higher surface area relative to the wood could accumulate more bromine on its surface moreover wang et al 2015b reported the br yield of 0 30 and 0 66 µg g material in the black and white ashes respectively from the 2013 rim fire with the representative vegetation types of ponderosa pine mixed conifer forest mixed oak woodlands and chaparral these yields were significantly lower than 1 42 and 4 31 µg g material in 400 and 600 c burned leaf in our study indicating the dependence of the br yield on vegetation types the ph gradually increased from 4 74 and 5 40 in unburned leaf and wood to 10 1 and 9 48 in 600 c burned leaf and wood respectively indicating the change of water extracts to less acidic simultaneously as the dominated exchangeable cations the yields of k and mg2 in both burned leaf and wood residues increased with increasing temperature table s2 previous studies arocena and opio 2003 nathe et al 2018 reported that the release of exchangeable cations e g k and mg2 during the combustion of organic matter enhances the h adsorption on the negatively charged colloids and thus increases ph besides elements of arsenic as cadmium cd chromium cr molybdenum mo nickel ni lead pb and selenium se were not detected in all unburned and burned samples in our study table s2 optical properties of dom in water extracts the suva254 is a good indicator of aromatic carbon content weishaar et al 2003 whereas a higher hix is related to a higher humification degree fellman et al 2010 lavonen et al 2015 both suva254 and hix continuously increased with increasing temperature specifically from unb50 to b600 we found the increase of suva254 l mg c m from 0 60 0 68 to 3 13 3 22 and hix from 0 27 0 34 to 15 2 18 7 in b600 fig 1 and table s3 both suva254 and hix were similar between leaf and wood considering their unburned materials or materials burned under the same temperatures the hix values in b600 from our study were high as 15 9 5 9 for soil fulvic acid ohno 2002 a positive and significant relationship r 0 99 p 0 001 was found between suva254 and hix by including all the unburned and burned samples regardless of fuel materials and burning temperatures for correlation analysis table s4 wang et al 2015a reported that both suva254 and hix increased after the combustion and decreased after the pyrolysis suggesting an important role of oxygen in suva254 and hix during combustion the tendency of suva254 and hix after the smoldering in our study was consistent with that after the combustion in wang et al 2015a the e2 e3 inversely correlated with dom mw decreased from 5 93 8 50 in unb50 to 4 56 4 90 in b250 and then increased to 5 17 6 04 in b600 fig 1 and table s3 however the weak relationship r 0 58 p 0 05 between e2 e3 by fluorescence eem and mw by ft icr ms indicates e2 e3 as an unrepresentative indicator for dom mw the tyrosine like and tryptophan like proteins and soluble microbial byproducts are considered biodegradable while the fulvic acid like organics and humic acid like organics are relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation guo et al 2014 pang et al 2020 the pi n percentage decreased for tyrosine like region i and tryptophan like region ii proteins and soluble microbial byproducts region iv and increased for fulvic acid like region iii and humic acid like region v organics from unb50 to b250 to b400 while changes of the pi n percentage in these regions were slight from b400 to b600 the total percentage of relatively recalcitrant materials iii and v increased from 12 8 17 5 in unbu50 to 68 8 71 7 in b600 indicating decreased biodegradability with increasing temperature besides we found that suva254 and hix were negatively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 related to pi n tyrosine like proteins pii n tryptophan like proteins and piv n soluble microbial byproducts and positively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 correlated with piii n fulvic acid like organcs and pv n humic acid like organics table s4 this result indicates the potential contribution of the increase in aromaticity and humification degree to decreased biodegradability with increasing temperature molecular characterization of dom in water extracts the influence of burning temperatures instead of fuel materials was commonly observed on the bulk properties of the assigned features in water extracts the number of assigned features in dom significantly decreased with increasing temperature fig 2 and table s5 due to the mineralization volatilization of organic compounds during the smoldering cho with 40 9 88 7 was the dominated elemental class we observed lower cho percentages and higher chon chos and chons percentages at 600 c relative to the unburned materials though the elemental class percentages did not illustrate obvious tendencies with temperatures fig 3 and table s5 specifically we found relatively high chon percentages of 30 8 and 22 8 in leaf b400 and b600 respectively the leaf b400 and b600 had n containing compounds chon and chons of 37 0 and 34 9 and bn aimod 0 67 n 0 of 31 4 and 28 4 suggesting a large fraction of bn in these n containing compounds at high temperatures bn is composed of the n containing heterocyclic aromatic structures with great recalcitrance knicker 2010 lopez martin et al 2018 we found the increase of chos from 4 50 and 4 40 in b250 to 24 1 and 33 5 in b600 for leaf and wood respectively suggesting an important fraction of organosulfur compounds oscs in dom at high temperatures with increasing temperature we observed an increase in the fraction of unsaturated and aromatic compounds and a decrease in the fraction of labile organic compounds in dom specifically the percentage of phyoxyaroms as one of dominated biogeochemical classes increased from unb50 34 0 39 8 to b400 76 6 81 6 while group1 condensed polycyclic compounds increased from unb50 1 89 3 79 to b600 52 0 55 8 this result suggested the potential increase in the fraction of poly aromatic compounds in dom with increasing temperature moreover we observed the decrease in atomic h to c ratio h c and the increase in aimod from unb50 to b400 indicating the increase of unsaturation and aromaticity in dom the changes in the average properties of the assigned features by ft icr ms were generally slight when the temperature increased from 400 to 600 c higher dbe dbe to atomic c ratio dbe c dbe to atomic o ratio dbe o and the difference between dbe an atomic o dbe o suggest a higher degree of unsaturation by considering the number of π bonds and rings a higher density of c c double bonds a lower number of c o bonds and a higher c c unsaturation by excluding all the possible c o bonds respectively roth et al 2013 dbe dbe o and dbe o decreased from unb50 to b250 and then greatly increased to b600 except dbe o continuously increased from unb50 to b600 for wood this result indicates the increase in the unsaturation degree and the c c unsaturation and the decrease in c o bonds with temperatures from 250 to 600 c dbe c increased from 0 35 0 44 in unb50 and b250 to 0 65 0 71 in b400 and b600 indicating the increased density of c c double bonds the mlbl percentage decreased from unb50 42 0 45 8 to b400 6 03 11 0 indicating a decreased fraction of labile organic compounds for the leaf and wood nosc was negative in unb50 0 51 and 0 60 and b250 0 34 and 0 29 and positive in b400 0 29 and 0 08 and b600 0 28 and 0 12 indicating more oxidized dom at high temperatures cao et al 2015 schmidt et al 2017 we observed the decrease of group3 highly unsaturated phenolic compounds from unb50 40 8 44 6 to b600 11 2 11 5 and of the group4 aliphatic compounds from unb50 42 0 45 8 to b400 6 03 11 0 this result also indicates a decrease of biodegradability with increasing temperature tsai and chow 2016 considering the rough order of group4 group3 group2 group1 in biodegradability santl temkiv et al 2013 the strong and significant r 0 50 or r 0 50 p 0 05 relationships were observed between the optical properties by uv fluorescence and the bulk properties by ft icr ms table s4 confirming the generally consistent interpretation of the optical properties by uv fluorescence with the ft icr ms bulk properties specifically the optical property of suva254 was positively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 related to aimod both of which were interpreted as aromaticity the optical properties of piii n fulvic acid like organics and pv n humic acid like organics were negatively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 correlated with mlbl the fulvic acid like organics piii n and humic acid like organics pv n are relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation while mlbl indicates the fraction of labile organic compounds the optical properties of suva254 hix piii n and pv n were positively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 related to dbe dbe c and dbe o whereas pi n pii n and piv n were negatively and significantly r 0 50 p 0 05 related to dbe c and dbe o this result indicates that the increase in aromaticity humification degree and fraction of fulvic and humic acid like organics with increasing temperature resulted in a higher density of c c double bonds and c c unsaturation lee et al 2019 also obtained consistent results using optical indices based end member mixing analysis emma and ft icr ms in urban river water they considered the optical indices based emma as a reliable tool for tracking organic matter sources in urban watersheds niu et al 2018 reported the strong correlation between suva254 and weight averaged dbe in nine river and lake water samples except for two outliers with relatively lower weight averaged atomic o to c ratio o c dom reactivity in dbp formation with increasing temperature we observed the decrease in the levels of formed dbps µg g material related to the decline of doc levels and the changes of dom chlorine chloramine reactivity fig 4 and table s6 this result suggests the smoldering dominated prescribed fire as an important landscape management strategy for mitigating the dbp precursors in forested land source water emelko and sham 2014 specifically thm fps µg g material decreased from 1628 and 296 in unb50 to 10 4 and 4 74 in b600 for leaf and wood respectively though the levels of formed dbps were similar between leaf and wood burned under the same burning temperatures the unburned leaf had higher levels of studied dbps than the unburned wood indicating the unburned leaf as a more important source of dbp precursors relative to the unburned wood the dom chlorine reactivity in forming thms except b600 for leaf and b400 for wood and hans except b250 for leaf µg mg doc roughly decreased with increasing temperature whereas the tendency was not apparent for dom reactivity in forming the other two studied dbp categories our previous study wang et al 2015b found that burned detritus of black moderate severity and white ash high severity had lower thms and haas reactivity µg mg doc relative to nonburned detritus from the 2013 rim fire in california us they suggested the decreased dom reactivity in forming thms and haas with increasing burn severity possibly due to high energy requirement in breaking down double bond structures when chlorinating condensed aromatics compared to plant derived phenolics these results potentially indicate the important role of side chains attached to aromatic structures in the thms and haas formation for example huang and shah 2018 found that tertiary amines enhanced the thm and haa formation via the strong chlorinating agent of r3n cl when chlorinating aromatic compounds i e salicylic acid phenol and resorcinol and suwannee river fulvic acid correlation analysis indicated that shan fps was negatively and significantly r 0 5 p 0 05 correlated with suva254 hix piii n aimod nosc dbe dbe c and dbe o and positively and significantly r 0 5 p 0 05 related to pii n piv n and mlbl table s4 suggesting the biodegradable tryptophan like and soluble microbial byproduct compounds with high chlorine reactivity in forming hans differently with increasing temperature wang et al 2015a found that dom chlorine reactivity in forming hans increased during the combustion and changed slightly during the pyrolysis combustion they suggested oxidized aromatic and humified compounds with high reactivity in forming hans these differences potentially indicate that combustion smoldering and pyrolysis play different roles in altering dom reactivity in forming hans by temperatures which needs further research our previous studies collected the field samples related with the 2013 rim fire chen et al 2020 wang et al 2015b we found the increased dom chlorine reactivity in forming hans with the orders of nonburned detritus black ash white ash wang et al 2015b moreover we observed higher dom chloramine relative to chlorine reactivity in forming hans with the order of fir pine white ash black ash chen et al 2020 these results potentially indicates that combustion instead of smoldering as the dominant fire behavior during wildfires affecting post fire dom reactivity in forming hans noted studies reported the hydrolysis of hans at an accelerated rate under the conditions of alkaline ph high free chlorine residual and prolonged reaction time glezer et al 1999 yu and reckhow 2015 our recent publication kanan and karanfil 2020 compared uniform formation condition ufc consisted of reaction time of 24 1 h the temperature of 20 0 1 0 c ph 7 8 0 2 and fp test consisted of reaction time of 120 h the temperature of 20 0 1 0 c ph 7 8 0 2 under chlorination and chloramination conditions we found that han formation was in the order of ufc fp during chloramination but ufc fp under chlorination indicating han decomposition during the fp test this result indicates that a relatively short reaction time of 24 h should be used during fp test under chlorination for reducing han decomposition using principal component analysis on the dom optical properties the properties of the assigned features by ft icr ms and the dom reactivity in forming dbps the first two components explained 71 4 and 16 5 of the total variance respectively fig 4 the variables of pi n pii n piv n mw mlbl sthm fps and shan fps had high negative loadings 0 50 in the first principal component pc1 while high positive loadings 0 50 in pc1 were observed for suva254 hix piii n pv n aimod nosc dbe dbe c dbe o and dbe o table s7 similarly loadings 0 50 in the second principal component pc2 were found for sndma fp while dbe o sthm fps and shaa fps had positive loading 0 50 in pc2 based on the loadings of studied parameters we interpreted the negative pc1 as the biodegradable tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds with high mw and high reactivity in forming thms and hans the positive pc1 was explained as the aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with a high degree of unsaturation a high density of c c double bonds a low number of c o bonds and a high c c unsaturation by excluding all the possible c o bonds the negative pc2 reflected compounds with high reactivity in forming ndma while the positive pc2 was considered as compounds with a low number of c o bonds and high reactivity in forming thms and haas according to their scores the samples were roughly separated into four clusters of unburned materials 250 c burned materials 400 c burned materials and 600 c burned materials with the increase of pc1 scores from negative to positive values this finding suggests that the unburned materials contained more biodegradable tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds with high mw and high reactivity in forming thms and hans while the 600 c burned materials were composed of more aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with a high degree of unsaturation high density of c c double bonds low number of c o bonds and high c c unsaturation by excluding all the possible c o bonds conclusion and environmental implications this study concluded that the mass loss percentage increased with temperatures increasing from 250 to 600 c and there were no significant differences in mass loss percentage between leaf and wood smoldered under the same temperatures biomass loss during smoldering combustion and flaming combustion was similar and higher than that during pyrolysis this result indicates that smoldering combustion may be effective for reducing the biomass of leaf and wood which are considered important sources of dom and dbps precursors in forested watersheds as temperatures increased from 250 to 600 c we observed a slight increase in the c contents including organic and inorganic c possibly due to the relative accumulation of incompletely burned compounds and the significant decrease in the fraction of dissolved organic c in residue c potentially because of the shearing of side chains including the hydrophilic function groups such as oh and cooh for the formation of poly aromatic structures during fires this result suggests the decreases of exported doc per gram of materials along with the water solubility of the residual organic c after smoldering moreover we observed low n content and extremely high c n in burned wood indicating great n limitation for microbes during vegetation recovery after smoldering fires the br yield was detectable in unburned and burned except 250 c leaf instead of the wood related samples whereas the pine wood was a less important source of br relative to the pine leaf results from ft icr ms suggest the decrease in the number of assigned features the number of cho compounds i e with the elements of only c h and o and the fraction of highly unsaturated phenolic compounds group3 and the increase in the fraction of condensed polycyclic compounds group1 with increasing temperature these results indicate that mineralization volatilization of organic compounds and also the enrichment of polyaromatic structures during smoldering with the order of unburned 250 c burned and 400 c burned materials we found the increase of unsaturated and oxidized compounds and aromaticity and the decrease in the fraction of labile organic compounds aimod mlbl and nosc were strongly and significantly r 0 50 or r 0 50 p 0 05 related to the optical properties of suva254 hix pi n pii n piii n piv n and pv n by uv fluorescence indicating the consistency of uv fluorescence results with those from ft icr ms using principal component analysis we found the decrease in the fraction of biodegradable tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds with high mw and high reactivity in forming thms and hans and the increase in the fraction of the aromatic humified fulvic humic acid like and oxidized compounds with a high degree of unsaturation a high density of c c double bonds a low number of c o bonds and a high c c unsaturation by excluding all the possible c o bonds following the order of unburned materials 250 c burned materials 400 c burned materials and 600 c burned materials we observed a decrease in the formation of the studied four dbp categories i e thms haas hans and ndma with increasing temperature considering the variability in some parameters such as sthm fps in b400 for wood greater replication would be beneficial in future investigations of lab controlled smoldering thus our result suggests the smoldering dominated prescribed fire as a potential approach for reducing the dom reactivity in forming thms and hans and the fp of dbps i e thms haas hans and ndma in source water from forested watersheds though smoldering fires have notorious disadvantages e g hard to extinguish and damage to tree roots the smoldering dominated prescribed fire under controlled conditions can be a potential landscape management strategy for consuming biomass fuel and thus ensuring drinking

16446,chlorine disinfection is often used as a pretreatment technology to control biofouling of reverse osmosis ro membranes however previous studies showed that biofouling of the ro system was aggravated after chlorine disinfection chlorine resistant bacteria crb were presumed to be closely related to the aggravation of fouling caused by chlorine disinfection in order to analyze the membrane fouling mechanisms of crb 5 crb strains were isolated from the surface of fouled ro membranes for wastewater reclamation and 3 reference bacterial strains sphingopyxis soli bm1 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and escherichia coli cgmcc1 3373 were selected for comparative study the chlorine resistance membrane fouling potential secretion and adhesion characteristics of these strains were evaluated among these isolated strains 3 strains showed much higher chlorine resistance than pao1 under the condition of 0 5 2 5 mg l cl2 especially bacillus cr19 and bacillus cr2 furthermore a significant positive correlation was found between membrane fouling potential and chlorine resistance of all the strains in this study the membrane fouling potential of the above 8 strains increased monotonically with the increase of chlorine resistance under the condition of 0 5 mg l cl2 serious fouling caused by extracellular substances was observed in biofouling layers of the strains with high chlorine resistance which lead to more severe flux decline extracellular polymeric substances eps amount per cell was found to be the main factor related to the chlorine resistance as well as the fouling potential computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used to demonstrate the filtration resistance induced by the secretion of eps however crb with higher eps amount may not show higher membrane adhesion potential and thus may not be the dominant strain on the ro membranes before chlorine disinfection these crb with high fouling potential but low membrane adhesion potential such as bacillus cr19 and bacillus cr2 may become the dominant bacteria on the membrane surface after chlorine disinfection and thus aggravate membrane fouling significantly graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine resistant bacteria crb reverse osmosis fouling potential eps secretion adhesion potential 1 introduction in water deficient countries reclaimed water has become an important water source for the production of industrial pure water which is used in electronic industry power industry heat industry and so on navarro 2018 tseng et al 2021 reverse osmosis ro is the essential process during industrial pure water production and the core process of pollutant removal liu et al 2017 ordóñez et al 2013 yu et al 2021 in recent years the scale of industrial reclaimed water produced by ro process is increasing rapidly however the operation of ro system often faces serious problems of biofouling biofouling leads to the increase of operational pressure and power consumption which ultimately leads to the increase of operating cost pretreatment technologies such as chlorine disinfection are often used to control biofouling however researchers observed that the biofouling of the ro system in laboratory scale and pilot scale was aggravated after chlorine disinfection namely compared with that before disinfection the biofouling potential of feed water after disinfection was increased significantly luo et al 2021a wang et al 2019a community structure analysis showed that chlorine disinfection led to the increase of relative abundance of chlorine resistant bacteria crb in feed water as well as in the membrane fouling layer which may be closely related to the aggravation of fouling caused by chlorine disinfection luo et al 2021a wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019a proposed that chlorine disinfection screened bacteria with higher extracellular polymeric substances eps production and promoted eps secretion of the bacterial community after disinfection however chen et al 2021 proposed that disinfection might affect the yield and properties of eps by changing microbial communities chemically reacting with eps or affecting the metabolism of bacteria therefore the change of the dominant bacteria in the feed water due to disinfection is not the only possible reason for the increased biofouling potential actually there is still a lack of direct experimental evidences to answer an important question whether crb generally have high eps secretion capacity and membrane fouling potential typical crb in the ro system for wastewater reclamation are important research objects to understand the question above but they have rarely been isolated in the current research furthermore the chlorine resistance and fouling characteristics of typical crb need to be evaluated to clarify and understand the correlation between chlorine resistance and membrane fouling potential in the research field of crb the researches mainly focused on the crb in drinking water and there is little research on the crb in reclaimed water luo et al 2021b systematically summarized the sources of typical crb isolated by researchers of which only 4 articles reported crb in the secondary effluent coronel olivares et al 2011 owoseni and okoh 2017a 2017b shekhawat et al 2020 the crb have not been isolated from the ro system for wastewater reclamation and investigated for its growth and eps secretion characteristics which may be related to their chlorine resistance and membrane fouling characteristics besides pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 is usually used as a model bacterial strain for the investigation of membrane biofouling ferrando et al 2017 herzberg and elimelech 2007 herzberg et al 2009 saeki et al 2016 however it is still unclear whether its membrane fouling potential are higher than the average level of bacteria in reclaimed water in addition pao1 might not survive after chlorine disinfection pretreatment of ro systems if the crb isolated from the ro membrane surface have higher fouling potential than that of pao1 they would be better model bacteria in these conditions this study aimed to isolate typical crb in the ro system for wastewater reclamation and reveal the membrane fouling mechanisms of crb initially five typical crb strains were isolated from the ro membrane surface in this study subsequently the chlorine resistance of these crb strains and three reference bacterial strains were compared moreover the secretion characteristics and membrane adhesion characteristics of typical crb and reference bacteria were also evaluated furthermore membrane fouling potential of these strains were investigated by a lab scale ro filtration system the correlations between the above results were also analyzed to better understand the membrane fouling mechanisms of crb 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of chlorine resistant bacteria chlorine resistant bacteria crb were isolated from fouling layers on the ro membranes of a full scale wastewater reclamation plant in beijing and a pilot scale ro system in tianjin this full scale wastewater reclamation plant applied uf ultrafiltration and ro process the disinfectant naocl was continuously added into uf feed water the antiscalant and reducing agent nahso3 was continuously added after uf process the non oxidizing biocide was impulsively added into ro feed water chemical cleaning of ro membrane was carried out when the ro feed water pressure was greater than 1 4 mpa until the pressure dropped below 1 mpa this pilot scale ro system applied uncontaminated 4 inch ro membrane lp100 vontron the free chlorine dosage was 5 mg l after continuous chlorination and dechlorination the feed water entered the ro system lasting a month 2 2 isolation of chlorine resistant bacteria isolation and purification of crb included following steps disinfection culture screening purification identification and evaluation of chlorine resistance the experimental steps were as follows 1 in order to isolate all the bacteria on the membrane surface we scraped off all the visible fouling layer on the fouled ro membranes and dissolved the foulants in sterile saline 2 the elution solution of ro membrane with bacteria was sterilized for 30 min the concentration of free chlorine was 2 mg l 3 after 30 min disinfection the bacterial solution was coated on lb agar plates at 25 4 after bacterial colonies grew on the plate for 48 h strains with different morphology and high frequency appeared on the plate were selected and single colony was inoculated into lb broth 5 the bacteria in lb broth cultured for 24 h were coated on the lb agar plates again 6 repeat steps 4 and 5 five times to obtain a pure strain 7 the bacterial strains isolated above were identified by polymerase chain reaction and 16s rdna sequencing method 8 finally the chlorine resistance was determined by the method described by luo et al 2021b 2 3 identification of typical chlorine resistant bacteria crb were defined using the evaluation method for chlorine resistance recommended by luo et al 2021b the log inactivation rate was taken as a core index for evaluate the chlorine resistance the disinfection conditions were 0 5 2 5 mg l free chlorine for 30 min luo et al 2021b and the initial bacterial cell density was 107 cfu ml the bacteria with inactivation rate in high chlorine resistance area inactivation rate 1log or low chlorine resistance area inactivation rate 1 3log were defined as crb luo et al 2021b chlorine resistance index was used to characterize chlorine resistance and calculated by following eq 1 1 cri 7 inactivation rate where cri was chlorine resistance index it was noteworthy that the chlorine resistance mentioned above only referred to the resistance of suspended bacteria 2 4 reference bacterial strains three reference bacterial strains sphingopyxis soli bm1 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and escherichia coli cgmcc1 3373 were selected for comparative study bm1 1 was a typical strain isolated from ro system for municipal wastewater reclamation wang et al 2019b yu et al 2018 pao1 was a model bacterium in the research about biofilms and ro membrane fouling ferrando et al 2017 herzberg and elimelech 2007 werner et al 2004 the e coli was a negative control recommended by literature for chlorine resistance evaluation luo et al 2021b zyara et al 2016 2 5 bacteria cultivation the glycerol stock of bacteria 100 μl was inoculated into lb broth 50 ml and incubated at 25 the growth curve was measured by optical density at 600 nm od600 the bacteria in lb broth cultured for 24 h to stationary phase 2 6 lab scale ro system the lab scale ro system used in the previous study wang et al 2019a which was shown in fig s1 was used to evaluate the membrane fouling potential a commercial ro membrane lp100 vontron was used as the experimental membrane the operational pressure was 1 2 mpa and the flow rate of feed water was fixed at 1 ml min the membrane flux j of the ro membrane were normalized based on the initial membrane flux j0 in the first 1 h of operation the normalized membrane flux was written as j j0 the lower the normalized flux j j0 after certain operation time the greater the membrane fouling potential the experimental groups were composed of crb isolated in this study and three reference bacterial strains respectively the concentration of viable cells in the feed water samples of the ro system were controlled at 107 cells ml saline was added to the feed water samples to adjust the conductivity to about 1100μs cm notably the conductivity of the feed water of the full scale ro system for wastewater reclamation was usually in the range of 1000 1500μs cm the water quality of feed water samples in ro

temperature 25 for 48 h biofilms formed at the bottom of the microplate 3 the bacterial suspension in the microplates was discarded with a pipette the biofilm was gently rinsed 3 times with 200 μl sterile water to remove residual lb broth and suspended bacteria 4 the microplates were placed in a ventilated clean bench for 30 min to seasoning the biofilms the dry biofilm was used for subsequent

crb and reference bacteria the pretreatment process included fixation with glutaraldehyde 2 5wt solution dehydration with ethanol and acetone solutions embedding with epoxy resin and ultrathin by microtome meng et al 2016 2 7 2 membrane fouling layer analysis a piece of fouled ro membrane which was approximately the size of 5mm 5 mm from lab scale ro system was cut and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss merlin the experimental steps were as follows 1 the fixed and dehydrated method of membrane samples was according to the literature herzberg et al 2007 2 after that membrane samples were prepared by supercritical fluid drying of co2 and coated with a layer of platinum 10 nm 3 the surfaces of the membrane samples were observed with 15 kv acceleration voltage and 20 000 times magnification the measuring steps for the density of viable cells in biofouling layers followed the literature wang et al 2019a a piece of fouled ro membrane sample of around 5mm 5 mm was cut and the precise area was measured by vernier caliper the membrane sample were placed in 1 ml physiological saline and shaken for 1 min the viable cells were determined by plate counts method the quotient of viable cells and membrane sample area was the density of viable cells in biofouling layers the measuring steps for the density of dissolved organic carbon doc in biofouling layers followed the literature wang et al 2019a a piece of fouled ro membrane sample of around 5mm 5 mm was cut and the precise area was measured the membrane samples were placed in 5 ml naoh solution ph 12 and shaken for 2 h in constant temperature oscillator 150 rpm 25 c then the solution was adjusted to ph 7 0 0 2 by 5 ml hcl solution ph 2 and diluted to 25 ml with pure water the doc concentration of above water samples was measured with a sievers 5310c analyzer ge usa the amount of doc was obtained by multiplying the concentration by the volume of doc solution the quotient of doc and membrane sample area was the density of doc in biofouling layers 2 7 3 eps characterization analysis the extracting step of eps was described as the research of yu et al 2017 and modified briefly the bacterial suspension about 107 cfu ml was heated in water bath at 45 for 1 h bacteria were removed by centrifugal precipitation at 12 000 rpm for 20 min organic matter in supernatant was considered as bacterial eps the doc was determined to represent the total amount of eps with a sievers 5310c analyzer ge usa the protein in eps was determined by lowry method frolund et al 1996 the polysaccharide in eps was determined by phenol sulfuric acid method 2 7 4 contributions of eps to chlorine consumption in disinfection the contribution of eps to chlorine consumption in disinfection was described as the research of gao et al 2015 and modified the bacteria whose density were 107 cfu ml were divided into two equal parts each with a volume of 50 ml one part retained cells with eps and the other was used to extract eps the disinfection condition was 0 5 mg l free chlorine for 30 min the ratio of chlorine consumption of eps to that of cells with eps was calculated in order to evaluate the contribution of eps to chlorine consumption in disinfection 2 8 5 adhesion potential analysis cellular adhesion potential was estimated by membrane adhesion test which was modified on the basis of the literatures faille et al 2002 fey et al 2002 the experimental steps were as follows a piece of clean ro membrane with diameter of 12 mm were placed in 5 ml bacterial suspension about 107 cfu ml and the suspension stood for 1 min after that the membrane was taken out and air dried for 10 min in a ventilated clean bench the membrane was placed in 5 ml physiological saline and shaken for 1 min in order to elute the bacteria adhering to the membrane the viable cells were determined by plate counts method the cellular adhesion ratio was obtained by dividing the cells counts in the membrane surface and suspension the higher the adhesion ratio the stronger the ability of bacteria to adhere to the membrane surface 2 7 6 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used to demonstrate the filtration resistance induced by the secretion of eps a biofilm micro unit composed of four bacterial cells was used for fluid field simulation as shown in fig s2 the parameters were shown in table s1 bacterial cells were set as impervious cylinders with a diameter of 0 5 μm and a length of 2 μm the axes of the four bacteria were all parallel to the x y plane the lower two cells were arranged in parallel and the upper two cells were also arranged in parallel the included angle between the axis of upper and lower cell was 90 the angle between the axis of cells and the x z plane were 45 bacterial cells were covered by loosely and tightly bound eps lb eps and tb eps there is a 20 nm gap between upper and lower cells covered with eps according to the literature taheri et al 2021 the thickness ratio of lb eps and tb eps layer was set to 1 2 lb eps and tb eps were two fluids with different density and viscosity and they were immiscible with water phase because the permeating velocity of commercial ro membrane was very low about 10 μm s the creeping flow model neglecting inertial terms had been used to simulate the flow field the creeping flow stokes flow theory equation was shown as following eq 2 2 ρ u t pl k f ρ u 0 where ρ is the density u is the velocity vector p is pressure k is the viscous stress tensor f is the volume force vector the fluid pressure drop across the cells group reflected the filtration resistance of biofilm micro unit the method mentioned above has been applied in the analysis of high eps veps vcell 50 and low eps veps vcell 10 amount 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation and identification of typical crb on fouled ro membranes a total of 4 bacterial strains cr19 cr4 cr26 and cr25 were isolated from fouled ro membranes of a full scale wastewater reclamation plant in beijing and one strain cr2 was isolated from fouled ro membranes of a pilot scale ro system in tianjin the basic information referred to identification of these strains is shown in table 2 among the isolated bacteria 5 strains mainly belonged to proteobacteria and firmicutes including bacillus 2 species acinetobacter aeromonas and enterobacteria according to the statistics of luo et al 2021b on crb strains of bacillus acinetobacter and aeromonas have been isolated and reported as crb by researchers enterobacter has not been reported as crb in the literatures and its chlorine resistance deserves more attention partial 16s rrna gene sequences of the above bacterial strains were uploaded to genbank of national center for biotechnology information ncbi and the genbank number is shown in table 2 in addition three reference bacterial strains sphingopyxis soli bm1 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and e coli cgmcc1 3373 were selected for comparative study the neighbor joining tree and cellular morphology of isolated bacterial strains in this study and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 1 and all the above strains were rod shaped bacteria after 24 h cultivation all above strains were in stationary phase as shown in fig s3 therefore 24 h was selected as the cultivation time for subsequent analysis the chlorine resistance of above strains was assessed by the method in section 2 3 as shown in fig 2 a the chlorine resistance of all isolated bacterial strains in this study was higher than that of reference bacteria e coli since cr19 and cr2 would produce spores after 24 h cultivation the cultivation time for chlorine resistance test of these strains was reduced to 18 h to avoid the interference of spores under the condition of 0 5 mg l free chlorine cr19 and cr2 showed high chlorine resistance while cr4 cr26 and cr25 showed low chlorine resistance the inactivation rate of cr19 and cr2 was less than 1 log even at highest chlorine concentration 5 mg l under the condition of 2 mg l free chlorine cr26 pao1 bm1 1 and cr25 no longer had chlorine resistance consequently all isolated bacterial strains met the definition of crb under the condition of 0 5 mg l proposed by luo et al 2021b therefore these 5 strains were considered as typical crb the order of their chlorine resistance under the condition of 0 5 mg l decreased as followed cr19 cr2 cr4 cr26 pao1 bm1 1 cr25 e coli additionally pao1 and bm1 1 with low chlorine resistance also met the definition of crb under the condition of 0 5 mg l free chlorine under different concentrations of chlorine the orders of chlorine resistance of above 8 strains were generally consistent as the chlorine concentration increased the chlorine resistance ranking of some strains changed a possible explanation was that the chlorine resistance mechanism of crb changed with the change of chlorine concentration eps was the outermost chlorine resistant structure of bacteria so it first reacted with free chlorine gilbert et al 2001 maillard et al 2002 xue et al 2012 at high concentrations of chlorine free chlorine began to react more with cell wall outer membrane layer etc maillard et al 2002 mizozoe et al 2019 russell et al 2003 1988 the contributions of eps to chlorine consumption in disinfection was evaluated as shown in the fig 2 b 2 d for cr19 pao1 and e coli free chlorine consumed by eps was 98 35 and 30 of that consumed by cells with eps after 30 min disinfection respectively it proved that eps was an important or decisive source of chlorine resistance of crb 3 2 membrane fouling potential of typical crb from the ro system normalized flux decline curves during ro filtration of typical crb and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 3 the membrane fouling potential of different bacteria varies significantly the normalized fluxes of cr2 and cr19 decreased significantly faster than that of other bacteria and reached equilibrium normalized flux within 18 h the final normalized fluxes of cr19 and e coli were 0 25 and 0 56 respectively and the latter was 2 24 times higher than the former chlorine resistance index was used to characterize chlorine resistance and calculated by eq 1 the correlativity between membrane fouling potential and chlorine resistance were analyzed and shown in fig 4 a c consistently there was a significant positive correlation between chlorine resistance and membrane fouling potential under the condition of 0 5 2 5 mg l cl2 in fig 4 a c above strains could be divided into 3 groups with similar membrane fouling potential and similar chlorine resistance interestingly the final normalized flux drop increased monotonically with the increase of chlorine resistance index under the condition of 0 5 mg l cl2 as shown in fig 4 a fig 4 d was obtained by combining fig 4 a c the three groups of data were fitted linearly the fitting results of inactivation rates and normalized fluxes were shown in table 3 the r2 of fitting curve with 0 5 mg l cl2 was the highest among three fitting curves reaching 0 86 due to the best correlation and monotonicity of the fitted curve with 0 5 mg l cl2 the inactivation rates with 0 5 mg l cl2 was selected as the basis for subsequent analysis of chlorine resistance the sem images of membrane biofouling layers of typical crb and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 5 the images of these strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low the sem images provided a microscopic explanation for the above experimental results according to sem images the fouling layers of cr19 and cr4 are relatively dense and those of cr2 and cr26 contained a sticky filiform structure indicating that the biological fouling in these groups were accompanied by serious fouling caused by extracellular substances which lead to severe flux decline the fouling layers of the other bacteria was sparser which lead to slight flux decline the above conclusions were also supported by previous literature the fouling layers without amount of extracellular organic substances which could be validated by sem images had slight membrane fouling problems herzberg and elimelech 2007 the density of viable cells and doc in biofouling layers were shown in fig 6 a and 6 b the strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low there was no obvious correlation between viable cells density and fouling potential the conclusion was similar to previous research wu et al 2021 previously found that higher viable cell density was not equivalent to more serious membrane fouling there was also no obvious correlation between doc density and fouling potential furthermore the doc content per cell was obtained by dividing the doc density by the viable cell density as shown in fig 6 c the strains were also arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low there were similar trends of the doc content per cell and the fouling potential the doc content per cell was related to the eps secretion characteristics of bacterial strains previous studies showed that eps was the main source of filtration resistance in fouling layer herzberg and elimelech 2007 yu et al 2018 herzberg and elimelech 2007 reported that the filtration resistance of cake layers composed of bacterial cells without eps may be negligible compared to that with eps when the cells secreted little amount of eps there were crevices in fouling layers which resulted in the low filtration resistance 3 3 eps production and characteristics of typical crb eps has invariably been regarded as the main structural component of biofilm and it has been reported that eps accounts for 50 80 of organic matter in biofilm de beer and stoodley 2006 other studies have claimed that eps accounts for more than 60 of the total biomass in the biofilm of specific bacteria watcharamusik and prapagdee 2008 the doc content was determined to represent the total amount of eps in this study the eps of typical crb and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 7 a the strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low notably the fouling potential increased monotonically with the increase of eps amount in this study protein polysaccharide concentrations of typical crb and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 7 b there was no significant difference in the protein polysaccharide ratios of these strains the correlation between eps amount and chlorine resistance under the chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg l were analyzed as shown in fig 8 a remarkably the inactivation rate monotonically decreased with the increase of eps in other words chlorine resistance was positively correlated with eps it suggested that eps was the main source of chlorine resistance for the strains under the chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg l in this study researchers indicated that eps was the outermost protective structure of bacteria which could consume free chlorine and protect cells from chlorine attack xue et al 2013 zhu et al 2020b gao et al 2015 studied the contribution of eps to h2o2 oxidative bactericide consumption in the process of bacterial inactivation and the conclusion was that the h2o2 consumed by eps was 50 of that consumed by cells with eps nevertheless the contribution of eps to cl2 consumption has rarely reported the correlation between eps amount and fouling potential were analyzed as shown in fig 8 b the final normalized fluxes also monotonically decreased with the increase of eps amount in other words fouling potential was positively correlated with eps researchers have also reported that eps played an important role in biofilm formation biofilm stability and membrane fouling ferrando et al 2017 herzberg and elimelech 2007 jafari et al 2020 to summarize eps amount per cell chlorine resistance and fouling potential were highly correlated in this study furthermore eps amount per cell was the main reason to explain the chlorine resistance and fouling potential in the studies of chlorine resistance of biofilm eps was considered to play an important role gilbert et al 2001 xue et al 2012 xue et al 2012 studied three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa wild type eps and eps which have different eps secretion capabilities it was found that eps increased the resistance of biofilm to chlorine xue et al 2012 this study also proved that eps was closely related to chlorine resistance of suspended cells however eps was not the only source of chlorine resistance researchers found that the bacterial target sites of chlorine include eps cell wall outer membrane layer spore cytoplasmic protein and nucleic acid maillard et al 2002 mizozoe et al 2019 russell 2003 russell and gould 1988 among them cell walls outer membrane layers and spores were considered to be other important sources of chlorine resistance the cell walls of gram positive bacteria which has a thick fibrous layer frequently less susceptible to chlorine russell and gould 1988 cell wall of mycobacteria with mycolic acids was a thick hydrophobic barrier preventing diffusion lowering permeability and enhancing bacterial chlorine resistance le dantec et al 2002 in addition mizozoe et al 2019 found that the cell membrane can insulate hypochlorite ion clo from e coli however the cell membrane of e coli could hardly insulate hypochlorous acid hclo mizozoe et al 2019 hypochlorous acid inactivated e coli without damaging its cell membrane and cell wall mizozoe et al 2019 some other bacteria relied on spores to resist chlorine oxidation bloomfield and arthur 1994 these studies indicate that different bacterial strains had different chlorine resistance mechanisms due to the various sources the correlation between chlorine resistance and eps was underestimated to some extent accordingly the correlation between chlorine resistance and fouling potential was also underestimated so far there has not been research to directly verify the correlation between chlorine resistance and fouling potential the results of this study bridged the gap above in addition it was reported that ultraviolet uv disinfection could also aggravate the fouling potential of bacterial community wu et al 2021 uv resistant bacteria might also have similar fouling characteristics to crb but there has been no experimental evidence yet it should be noted that some crb with spores such as bacillus might be considered to secrete less eps than other strains actually cr19 and cr2 with large amount of eps were both species of bacillus in this study previous study also reported that eps play a more important role on biofilm chlorine resistance than spores and interspecific interaction zhu et al 2020b the above conclusion might also be generalized to the chlorine resistance of suspended cells furthermore bacillus has been widely reported in the influent and membrane surface of ro system luo et al 2021a yu et al 2017 hence it might cause serious ro membrane fouling problems and deserves more attention in the fouling control of ro systems computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used to demonstrate the filtration resistance induced by the secretion of eps a biofilm micro unit composed of four bacterial cells was used for fluid field simulation as shown in fig 9 fluid velocity field with low or high eps amount were shown in fig 9 a and 9 b the increase of eps lead to the narrowing of the flow channel between bacteria so that the max water velocity increased fluid pressure field with low or high eps amount were shown in fig 9 c 9 f the increase of water velocity demanded higher inlet pressure and showed higher pressure drop the max fluid pressure increased from 0 42 pa to 0 73 pa and the corresponding pressure drop increased from 0 41 pa to 0 73 pa because of increased eps secretion the increase of fluid pressure drop reflected the increase of filtration resistance the results of cfd simulation were consistent with above experimental results 3 4 biofilm formation and membrane adhesion potential of typical crb the biofilm formation potential was assessed by the methods in section 2 7 the biofilm formation potential of typical crb and reference bacterial strains was shown in fig 10 a the strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low according to fig 10 a there was no obvious correlation between biofilm formation potential and fouling potential which was similar to the conclusions of other literatures habimana et al 2014 ishizaki et al 2016 it did not lead to contradiction that the statistical uncorrelationbetween biofilm formation potential and membrane fouling potential since membrane fouling level was also affected by the density porosity and thickness of fouling layers the membrane adhesion potential of different strains was shown in fig 10 b the strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low according to fig 10 b there was also no obvious correlation between adhesion potential and fouling potential of pure bacterial strain however bacteria with high adhesion potential could gain advantage in the survival competition on the membrane surface due to their tendency to colonize on clean membranes some studies showed that adhesion potential could not be used to predict the biomass of mature biofilm namely there was no direct relation between the initial bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation potential it was also found that the adhesion potential and cellular surface characteristics i e hydrophobicity and surface charge of pure bacterial strain were irrelevant with the microfiltration membrane fouling potential ishizaki et al 2016 the membrane adhesion potential of pure bacterial strain might indirectly affect fouling level by changing the community structure on the membrane surface nevertheless it is still difficult to answer how the adhesion potential affects the community structure on the membrane surface and membrane fouling level as the trends of fouling potential and eps were the same in this study according to fig 10 b here was no obvious correlation between eps and bacterial adhesion potential the above conclusions were supported by previous literature long et al 2009 analyzed the adhesion potential of four kinds of bacteria with or without eps to silica surface removal of eps reduced the adhesion potential of these strains but it did not change the adhesion potential order of them long et al 2009 these results illustrated that eps was an effective but not significant factor in bacterial adhesion processes the membrane adhesion potential and fouling potential were analyzed together as shown in fig 11 the median of the final normalized flux drop of typical crb and reference bacterial strains was 60 6 and the membrane adhesion potential was 0 63 in addition the median of fouling potential in this study might be overestimated because there were 5 crb strains in 8 bacteria strains and the fouling potential of typical crb was higher than that of general bacteria based on the above two medians the fouling potential and adhesion potential were divided into high and low level respectively hence the bacterial strains investigated in this study could be divided into 4 categories 1 bacteria with high fouling potential but low adhesion potential such as cr19 and cr2 these strains with high fouling potential were likely to be crb although their adhesion potential was low they might become the dominant bacteria in the membrane surface community after chlorine disinfection which might lead to serious fouling problems 2 bacteria with high fouling and adhesion potential such as cr4 exceptionally pao1 should also be classified into this category since there was little difference in fouling potential between pao1 and cr4 and the adhesion potential of pao1 was obviously higher there was a defect of pao1 as a model strain since it was not isolated from the water environment 3 bacteria with low fouling potential but high adhesion potential such as cr25 and e coli these bacteria with low fouling potential could not make large contribution to membrane fouling 4 bacteria with low fouling and adhesion potential such as bm1 1 this kind of bacteria could neither cause serious fouling problems when interspecific interaction was not considered among the four kinds of bacteria the first two kinds were appropriate model bacteria for membrane fouling research before chlorine disinfection the second and third kind of bacteria with higher adhesion potential might have greater competitive advantages on the membrane surface when the third kind of bacteria was predominant on the membrane surface there were minor fouling problems after chlorine disinfection the first and second kind of bacteria with higher fouling potential as well as higher chlorine resistance was predominant on the membrane surface which led to severe fouling problems the above inference could be used to explain the aggravation of membrane fouling caused by chlorine disinfection luo et al 2021a wang et al 2019a it should be noted that the bacterial adhesion potential of a specific strain in heterogeneous mixed populations might be different from the above results the bacterial adhesion potential and membrane fouling characteristics in heterogeneous mixed populations were an important follow up research direction 4 conclusions in this study 5 typical crb strains isolated from the fouled ro membrane surface were analyzed three reference bacterial strains bm1 1 pao1 and e coli were selected for comparative study the chlorine resistance membrane fouling potential secretion and adhesion characteristics of typical crb and reference bacteria were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 under the condition of 0 5 mg l free chlorine cr19 and cr2 showed high chlorine resistance while cr4 cr26 cr25 pao1 and bm1 1 showed low chlorine resistance they all met the definition of crb except e coli the inactivation rate of cr19 and cr2 was less than 1 log even at highest chlorine concentration 5 mg l 2 there was a significant positive correlation between membrane fouling potential and chlorine resistance under the condition of 0 5 2 5 mg l cl2 the normalized flux drop increased monotonically with the chlorine resistance under the condition of 0 5 mg l cl2 3 serious fouling caused by extracellular substances was observed in biofouling layers of the bacterial strains with high chlorine resistance which lead to severe flux decline in contrast the biofouling layers of other bacteria with slight fouling caused by extracellular substances was sparser which led to slight flux decline 4 the chlorine resistance and fouling potential of bacteria increased monotonically with the increase of eps secretion in this study eps amount per cell was the main factor related to the chlorine resistance and fouling potential 5 since the contribution of eps to bacterial adhesion was not decisive adhesion and fouling potential were relatively independent bacteria with high fouling potential but low adhesion potential which might become the dominant bacteria on the membrane surface after chlorine disinfection

16446,chlorine disinfection is often used as a pretreatment technology to control biofouling of reverse osmosis ro membranes however previous studies showed that biofouling of the ro system was aggravated after chlorine disinfection chlorine resistant bacteria crb were presumed to be closely related to the aggravation of fouling caused by chlorine disinfection in order to analyze the membrane fouling mechanisms of crb 5 crb strains were isolated from the surface of fouled ro membranes for wastewater reclamation and 3 reference bacterial strains sphingopyxis soli bm1 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and escherichia coli cgmcc1 3373 were selected for comparative study the chlorine resistance membrane fouling potential secretion and adhesion characteristics of these strains were evaluated among these isolated strains 3 strains showed much higher chlorine resistance than pao1 under the condition of 0 5 2 5 mg l cl2 especially bacillus cr19 and bacillus cr2 furthermore a significant positive correlation was found between membrane fouling potential and chlorine resistance of all the strains in this study the membrane fouling potential of the above 8 strains increased monotonically with the increase of chlorine resistance under the condition of 0 5 mg l cl2 serious fouling caused by extracellular substances was observed in biofouling layers of the strains with high chlorine resistance which lead to more severe flux decline extracellular polymeric substances eps amount per cell was found to be the main factor related to the chlorine resistance as well as the fouling potential computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used to demonstrate the filtration resistance induced by the secretion of eps however crb with higher eps amount may not show higher membrane adhesion potential and thus may not be the dominant strain on the ro membranes before chlorine disinfection these crb with high fouling potential but low membrane adhesion potential such as bacillus cr19 and bacillus cr2 may become the dominant bacteria on the membrane surface after chlorine disinfection and thus aggravate membrane fouling significantly graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine resistant bacteria crb reverse osmosis fouling potential eps secretion adhesion potential 1 introduction in water deficient countries reclaimed water has become an important water source for the production of industrial pure water which is used in electronic industry power industry heat industry and so on navarro 2018 tseng et al 2021 reverse osmosis ro is the essential process during industrial pure water production and the core process of pollutant removal liu et al 2017 ordóñez et al 2013 yu et al 2021 in recent years the scale of industrial reclaimed water produced by ro process is increasing rapidly however the operation of ro system often faces serious problems of biofouling biofouling leads to the increase of operational pressure and power consumption which ultimately leads to the increase of operating cost pretreatment technologies such as chlorine disinfection are often used to control biofouling however researchers observed that the biofouling of the ro system in laboratory scale and pilot scale was aggravated after chlorine disinfection namely compared with that before disinfection the biofouling potential of feed water after disinfection was increased significantly luo et al 2021a wang et al 2019a community structure analysis showed that chlorine disinfection led to the increase of relative abundance of chlorine resistant bacteria crb in feed water as well as in the membrane fouling layer which may be closely related to the aggravation of fouling caused by chlorine disinfection luo et al 2021a wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019a proposed that chlorine disinfection screened bacteria with higher extracellular polymeric substances eps production and promoted eps secretion of the bacterial community after disinfection however chen et al 2021 proposed that disinfection might affect the yield and properties of eps by changing microbial communities chemically reacting with eps or affecting the metabolism of bacteria therefore the change of the dominant bacteria in the feed water due to disinfection is not the only possible reason for the increased biofouling potential actually there is still a lack of direct experimental evidences to answer an important question whether crb generally have high eps secretion capacity and membrane fouling potential typical crb in the ro system for wastewater reclamation are important research objects to understand the question above but they have rarely been isolated in the current research furthermore the chlorine resistance and fouling characteristics of typical crb need to be evaluated to clarify and understand the correlation between chlorine resistance and membrane fouling potential in the research field of crb the researches mainly focused on the crb in drinking water and there is little research on the crb in reclaimed water luo et al 2021b systematically summarized the sources of typical crb isolated by researchers of which only 4 articles reported crb in the secondary effluent coronel olivares et al 2011 owoseni and okoh 2017a 2017b shekhawat et al 2020 the crb have not been isolated from the ro system for wastewater reclamation and investigated for its growth and eps secretion characteristics which may be related to their chlorine resistance and membrane fouling characteristics besides pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 is usually used as a model bacterial strain for the investigation of membrane biofouling ferrando et al 2017 herzberg and elimelech 2007 herzberg et al 2009 saeki et al 2016 however it is still unclear whether its membrane fouling potential are higher than the average level of bacteria in reclaimed water in addition pao1 might not survive after chlorine disinfection pretreatment of ro systems if the crb isolated from the ro membrane surface have higher fouling potential than that of pao1 they would be better model bacteria in these conditions this study aimed to isolate typical crb in the ro system for wastewater reclamation and reveal the membrane fouling mechanisms of crb initially five typical crb strains were isolated from the ro membrane surface in this study subsequently the chlorine resistance of these crb strains and three reference bacterial strains were compared moreover the secretion characteristics and membrane adhesion characteristics of typical crb and reference bacteria were also evaluated furthermore membrane fouling potential of these strains were investigated by a lab scale ro filtration system the correlations between the above results were also analyzed to better understand the membrane fouling mechanisms of crb 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of chlorine resistant bacteria chlorine resistant bacteria crb were isolated from fouling layers on the ro membranes of a full scale wastewater reclamation plant in beijing and a pilot scale ro system in tianjin this full scale wastewater reclamation plant applied uf ultrafiltration and ro process the disinfectant naocl was continuously added into uf feed water the antiscalant and reducing agent nahso3 was continuously added after uf process the non oxidizing biocide was impulsively added into ro feed water chemical cleaning of ro membrane was carried out when the ro feed water pressure was greater than 1 4 mpa until the pressure dropped below 1 mpa this pilot scale ro system applied uncontaminated 4 inch ro membrane lp100 vontron the free chlorine dosage was 5 mg l after continuous chlorination and dechlorination the feed water entered the ro system lasting a month 2 2 isolation of chlorine resistant bacteria isolation and purification of crb included following steps disinfection culture screening purification identification and evaluation of chlorine resistance the experimental steps were as follows 1 in order to isolate all the bacteria on the membrane surface we scraped off all the visible fouling layer on the fouled ro membranes and dissolved the foulants in sterile saline 2 the elution solution of ro membrane with bacteria was sterilized for 30 min the concentration of free chlorine was 2 mg l 3 after 30 min disinfection the bacterial solution was coated on lb agar plates at 25 4 after bacterial colonies grew on the plate for 48 h strains with different morphology and high frequency appeared on the plate were selected and single colony was inoculated into lb broth 5 the bacteria in lb broth cultured for 24 h were coated on the lb agar plates again 6 repeat steps 4 and 5 five times to obtain a pure strain 7 the bacterial strains isolated above were identified by polymerase chain reaction and 16s rdna sequencing method 8 finally the chlorine resistance was determined by the method described by luo et al 2021b 2 3 identification of typical chlorine resistant bacteria crb were defined using the evaluation method for chlorine resistance recommended by luo et al 2021b the log inactivation rate was taken as a core index for evaluate the chlorine resistance the disinfection conditions were 0 5 2 5 mg l free chlorine for 30 min luo et al 2021b and the initial bacterial cell density was 107 cfu ml the bacteria with inactivation rate in high chlorine resistance area inactivation rate 1log or low chlorine resistance area inactivation rate 1 3log were defined as crb luo et al 2021b chlorine resistance index was used to characterize chlorine resistance and calculated by following eq 1 1 cri 7 inactivation rate where cri was chlorine resistance index it was noteworthy that the chlorine resistance mentioned above only referred to the resistance of suspended bacteria 2 4 reference bacterial strains three reference bacterial strains sphingopyxis soli bm1 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and escherichia coli cgmcc1 3373 were selected for comparative study bm1 1 was a typical strain isolated from ro system for municipal wastewater reclamation wang et al 2019b yu et al 2018 pao1 was a model bacterium in the research about biofilms and ro membrane fouling ferrando et al 2017 herzberg and elimelech 2007 werner et al 2004 the e coli was a negative control recommended by literature for chlorine resistance evaluation luo et al 2021b zyara et al 2016 2 5 bacteria cultivation the glycerol stock of bacteria 100 μl was inoculated into lb broth 50 ml and incubated at 25 the growth curve was measured by optical density at 600 nm od600 the bacteria in lb broth cultured for 24 h to stationary phase 2 6 lab scale ro system the lab scale ro system used in the previous study wang et al 2019a which was shown in fig s1 was used to evaluate the membrane fouling potential a commercial ro membrane lp100 vontron was used as the experimental membrane the operational pressure was 1 2 mpa and the flow rate of feed water was fixed at 1 ml min the membrane flux j of the ro membrane were normalized based on the initial membrane flux j0 in the first 1 h of operation the normalized membrane flux was written as j j0 the lower the normalized flux j j0 after certain operation time the greater the membrane fouling potential the experimental groups were composed of crb isolated in this study and three reference bacterial strains respectively the concentration of viable cells in the feed water samples of the ro system were controlled at 107 cells ml saline was added to the feed water samples to adjust the conductivity to about 1100μs cm notably the conductivity of the feed water of the full scale ro system for wastewater reclamation was usually in the range of 1000 1500μs cm the water quality of feed water samples in ro system was shown in table 1 2 6 biofilm formation potential the biofilm formation potential was conducted by the method described by zhu et al 2020a and modified the experimental steps were as follows

microtome meng et al 2016 2 7 2 membrane fouling layer analysis a piece of fouled ro membrane which was approximately the size of 5mm 5 mm from lab scale ro system was cut and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss merlin the experimental steps were as follows 1 the fixed and dehydrated method of membrane samples was according to the literature herzberg et al 2007 2 after that

20 000 times magnification the measuring steps for the density of viable cells in biofouling layers followed the literature wang et al 2019a a piece of fouled ro membrane sample of around 5mm 5 mm was cut and the precise area was measured by vernier caliper the membrane sample were placed in 1 ml physiological saline and shaken for 1 min the viable cells were determined by plate counts method the quotient of viable cells and membrane sample area was the density of viable cells in biofouling layers the measuring steps for the density of dissolved organic carbon doc in biofouling layers followed the literature wang et al 2019a a piece of fouled ro membrane sample of around 5mm 5 mm was cut and the precise area was measured the membrane samples were placed in 5 ml naoh solution ph 12 and shaken for 2 h in constant temperature oscillator 150 rpm 25 c then the solution was adjusted to ph 7 0 0 2 by 5 ml hcl solution ph 2 and diluted to 25 ml with pure water the doc concentration of above water samples was measured with a sievers 5310c analyzer ge usa the amount of doc was obtained by multiplying the concentration by the volume of doc solution the quotient of doc and membrane sample area was the density of doc in biofouling layers 2 7 3 eps characterization analysis the extracting step of eps was described as the research of yu et al 2017 and modified briefly the bacterial suspension about 107 cfu ml was heated in water bath at 45 for 1 h bacteria were removed by centrifugal precipitation at 12 000 rpm for 20 min organic matter in supernatant was considered as bacterial eps the doc was determined to represent the total amount of eps with a sievers 5310c analyzer ge usa the protein in eps was determined by lowry method frolund et al 1996 the polysaccharide in eps was determined by phenol sulfuric acid method 2 7 4 contributions of eps to chlorine consumption in disinfection the contribution of eps to chlorine consumption in disinfection was described as the research of gao et al 2015 and modified the bacteria whose density were 107 cfu ml were divided into two equal parts each with a volume of 50 ml one part retained cells with eps and the other was used to extract eps the disinfection condition was 0 5 mg l free chlorine for 30 min the ratio of chlorine consumption of eps to that of cells with eps was calculated in order to evaluate the contribution of eps to chlorine consumption in disinfection 2 8 5 adhesion potential analysis cellular adhesion potential was estimated by membrane adhesion test which was modified on the basis of the literatures faille et al 2002 fey et al 2002 the experimental steps were as follows a piece of clean ro membrane with diameter of 12 mm were placed in 5 ml bacterial suspension about 107 cfu ml and the suspension stood for 1 min after that the membrane was taken out and air dried for 10 min in a ventilated clean bench the membrane was placed in 5 ml physiological saline and shaken for 1 min in order to elute the bacteria adhering to the membrane the viable cells were determined by plate counts method the cellular adhesion ratio was obtained by dividing the cells counts in the membrane surface and suspension the higher the adhesion ratio the stronger the ability of bacteria to adhere to the membrane surface 2 7 6 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used to demonstrate the filtration resistance induced by the secretion of eps a biofilm micro unit composed of four bacterial cells was used for fluid field simulation as shown in fig s2 the parameters were shown in table s1 bacterial cells were set as impervious cylinders with a diameter of 0 5 μm and a length of 2 μm the axes of the four bacteria were all parallel to the x y plane the lower two cells were arranged in parallel and the upper two cells were also arranged in parallel the included angle between the axis of upper and lower cell was 90 the angle between the axis of cells and the x z plane were 45 bacterial cells were covered by loosely and tightly bound eps lb eps and tb eps there is a 20 nm gap between upper and lower cells covered with eps according to the literature taheri et al 2021 the thickness ratio of lb eps and tb eps layer was set to 1 2 lb eps and tb eps were two fluids with different density and viscosity and they were immiscible with water phase because the permeating velocity of commercial ro membrane was very low about 10 μm s the creeping flow model neglecting inertial terms had been used to simulate the flow field the creeping flow stokes flow theory equation was shown as following eq 2 2 ρ u t pl k f ρ u 0 where ρ is the density u is the velocity vector p is pressure k is the viscous stress tensor f is the volume force vector the fluid pressure drop across the cells group reflected the filtration resistance of biofilm micro unit the method mentioned above has been applied in the analysis of high eps veps vcell 50 and low eps veps vcell 10 amount 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation and identification of typical crb on fouled ro membranes a total of 4 bacterial strains cr19 cr4 cr26 and cr25 were isolated from fouled ro membranes of a full scale wastewater reclamation plant in beijing and one strain cr2 was isolated from fouled ro membranes of a pilot scale ro system in tianjin the basic information referred to identification of these strains is shown in table 2 among the isolated bacteria 5 strains mainly belonged to proteobacteria and firmicutes including bacillus 2 species acinetobacter aeromonas and enterobacteria according to the statistics of luo et al 2021b on crb strains of bacillus acinetobacter and aeromonas have been isolated and reported as crb by researchers enterobacter has not been reported as crb in the literatures and its chlorine resistance deserves more attention partial 16s rrna gene sequences of the above bacterial strains were uploaded to genbank of national center for biotechnology information ncbi and the genbank number is shown in table 2 in addition three reference bacterial strains sphingopyxis soli bm1 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and e coli cgmcc1 3373 were selected for comparative study the neighbor joining tree and cellular morphology of isolated bacterial strains in this study and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 1 and all the above strains were rod shaped bacteria after 24 h cultivation all above strains were in stationary phase as shown in fig s3 therefore 24 h was selected as the cultivation time for subsequent analysis the chlorine resistance of above strains was assessed by the method in section 2 3 as shown in fig 2 a the chlorine resistance of all isolated bacterial strains in this study was higher than that of reference bacteria e coli since cr19 and cr2 would produce spores after 24 h cultivation the cultivation time for chlorine resistance test of these strains was reduced to 18 h to avoid the interference of spores under the condition of 0 5 mg l free chlorine cr19 and cr2 showed high chlorine resistance while cr4 cr26 and cr25 showed low chlorine resistance the inactivation rate of cr19 and cr2 was less than 1 log even at highest chlorine concentration 5 mg l under the condition of 2 mg l free chlorine cr26 pao1 bm1 1 and cr25 no longer had chlorine resistance consequently all isolated bacterial strains met the definition of crb under the condition of 0 5 mg l proposed by luo et al 2021b therefore these 5 strains were considered as typical crb the order of their chlorine resistance under the condition of 0 5 mg l decreased as followed cr19 cr2 cr4 cr26 pao1 bm1 1 cr25 e coli additionally pao1 and bm1 1 with low chlorine resistance also met the definition of crb under the condition of 0 5 mg l free chlorine under different concentrations of chlorine the orders of chlorine resistance of above 8 strains were generally consistent as the chlorine concentration increased the chlorine resistance ranking of some strains changed a possible explanation was that the chlorine resistance mechanism of crb changed with the change of chlorine concentration eps was the outermost chlorine resistant structure of bacteria so it first reacted with free chlorine gilbert et al 2001 maillard et al 2002 xue et al 2012 at high concentrations of chlorine free chlorine began to react more with cell wall outer membrane layer etc maillard et al 2002 mizozoe et al 2019 russell et al 2003 1988 the contributions of eps to chlorine consumption in disinfection was evaluated as shown in the fig 2 b 2 d for cr19 pao1 and e coli free chlorine consumed by eps was 98 35 and 30 of that consumed by cells with eps after 30 min disinfection respectively it proved that eps was an important or decisive source of chlorine resistance of crb 3 2 membrane fouling potential of typical crb from the ro system normalized flux decline curves during ro filtration of typical crb and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 3 the membrane fouling potential of different bacteria varies significantly the normalized fluxes of cr2 and cr19 decreased significantly faster than that of other bacteria and reached equilibrium normalized flux within 18 h the final normalized fluxes of cr19 and e coli were 0 25 and 0 56 respectively and the latter was 2 24 times higher than the former chlorine resistance index was used to characterize chlorine resistance and calculated by eq 1 the correlativity between membrane fouling potential and chlorine resistance were analyzed and shown in fig 4 a c consistently there was a significant positive correlation between chlorine resistance and membrane fouling potential under the condition of 0 5 2 5 mg l cl2 in fig 4 a c above strains could be divided into 3 groups with similar membrane fouling potential and similar chlorine resistance interestingly the final normalized flux drop increased monotonically with the increase of chlorine resistance index under the condition of 0 5 mg l cl2 as shown in fig 4 a fig 4 d was obtained by combining fig 4 a c the three groups of data were fitted linearly the fitting results of inactivation rates and normalized fluxes were shown in table 3 the r2 of fitting curve with 0 5 mg l cl2 was the highest among three fitting curves reaching 0 86 due to the best correlation and monotonicity of the fitted curve with 0 5 mg l cl2 the inactivation rates with 0 5 mg l cl2 was selected as the basis for subsequent analysis of chlorine resistance the sem images of membrane biofouling layers of typical crb and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 5 the images of these strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low the sem images provided a microscopic explanation for the above experimental results according to sem images the fouling layers of cr19 and cr4 are relatively dense and those of cr2 and cr26 contained a sticky filiform structure indicating that the biological fouling in these groups were accompanied by serious fouling caused by extracellular substances which lead to severe flux decline the fouling layers of the other bacteria was sparser which lead to slight flux decline the above conclusions were also supported by previous literature the fouling layers without amount of extracellular organic substances which could be validated by sem images had slight membrane fouling problems herzberg and elimelech 2007 the density of viable cells and doc in biofouling layers were shown in fig 6 a and 6 b the strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low there was no obvious correlation between viable cells density and fouling potential the conclusion was similar to previous research wu et al 2021 previously found that higher viable cell density was not equivalent to more serious membrane fouling there was also no obvious correlation between doc density and fouling potential furthermore the doc content per cell was obtained by dividing the doc density by the viable cell density as shown in fig 6 c the strains were also arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low there were similar trends of the doc content per cell and the fouling potential the doc content per cell was related to the eps secretion characteristics of bacterial strains previous studies showed that eps was the main source of filtration resistance in fouling layer herzberg and elimelech 2007 yu et al 2018 herzberg and elimelech 2007 reported that the filtration resistance of cake layers composed of bacterial cells without eps may be negligible compared to that with eps when the cells secreted little amount of eps there were crevices in fouling layers which resulted in the low filtration resistance 3 3 eps production and characteristics of typical crb eps has invariably been regarded as the main structural component of biofilm and it has been reported that eps accounts for 50 80 of organic matter in biofilm de beer and stoodley 2006 other studies have claimed that eps accounts for more than 60 of the total biomass in the biofilm of specific bacteria watcharamusik and prapagdee 2008 the doc content was determined to represent the total amount of eps in this study the eps of typical crb and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 7 a the strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low notably the fouling potential increased monotonically with the increase of eps amount in this study protein polysaccharide concentrations of typical crb and reference bacterial strains were shown in fig 7 b there was no significant difference in the protein polysaccharide ratios of these strains the correlation between eps amount and chlorine resistance under the chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg l were analyzed as shown in fig 8 a remarkably the inactivation rate monotonically decreased with the increase of eps in other words chlorine resistance was positively correlated with eps it suggested that eps was the main source of chlorine resistance for the strains under the chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg l in this study researchers indicated that eps was the outermost protective structure of bacteria which could consume free chlorine and protect cells from chlorine attack xue et al 2013 zhu et al 2020b gao et al 2015 studied the contribution of eps to h2o2 oxidative bactericide consumption in the process of bacterial inactivation and the conclusion was that the h2o2 consumed by eps was 50 of that consumed by cells with eps nevertheless the contribution of eps to cl2 consumption has rarely reported the correlation between eps amount and fouling potential were analyzed as shown in fig 8 b the final normalized fluxes also monotonically decreased with the increase of eps amount in other words fouling potential was positively correlated with eps researchers have also reported that eps played an important role in biofilm formation biofilm stability and membrane fouling ferrando et al 2017 herzberg and elimelech 2007 jafari et al 2020 to summarize eps amount per cell chlorine resistance and fouling potential were highly correlated in this study furthermore eps amount per cell was the main reason to explain the chlorine resistance and fouling potential in the studies of chlorine resistance of biofilm eps was considered to play an important role gilbert et al 2001 xue et al 2012 xue et al 2012 studied three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa wild type eps and eps which have different eps secretion capabilities it was found that eps increased the resistance of biofilm to chlorine xue et al 2012 this study also proved that eps was closely related to chlorine resistance of suspended cells however eps was not the only source of chlorine resistance researchers found that the bacterial target sites of chlorine include eps cell wall outer membrane layer spore cytoplasmic protein and nucleic acid maillard et al 2002 mizozoe et al 2019 russell 2003 russell and gould 1988 among them cell walls outer membrane layers and spores were considered to be other important sources of chlorine resistance the cell walls of gram positive bacteria which has a thick fibrous layer frequently less susceptible to chlorine russell and gould 1988 cell wall of mycobacteria with mycolic acids was a thick hydrophobic barrier preventing diffusion lowering permeability and enhancing bacterial chlorine resistance le dantec et al 2002 in addition mizozoe et al 2019 found that the cell membrane can insulate hypochlorite ion clo from e coli however the cell membrane of e coli could hardly insulate hypochlorous acid hclo mizozoe et al 2019 hypochlorous acid inactivated e coli without damaging its cell membrane and cell wall mizozoe et al 2019 some other bacteria relied on spores to resist chlorine oxidation bloomfield and arthur 1994 these studies indicate that different bacterial strains had different chlorine resistance mechanisms due to the various sources the correlation between chlorine resistance and eps was underestimated to some extent accordingly the correlation between chlorine resistance and fouling potential was also underestimated so far there has not been research to directly verify the correlation between chlorine resistance and fouling potential the results of this study bridged the gap above in addition it was reported that ultraviolet uv disinfection could also aggravate the fouling potential of bacterial community wu et al 2021 uv resistant bacteria might also have similar fouling characteristics to crb but there has been no experimental evidence yet it should be noted that some crb with spores such as bacillus might be considered to secrete less eps than other strains actually cr19 and cr2 with large amount of eps were both species of bacillus in this study previous study also reported that eps play a more important role on biofilm chlorine resistance than spores and interspecific interaction zhu et al 2020b the above conclusion might also be generalized to the chlorine resistance of suspended cells furthermore bacillus has been widely reported in the influent and membrane surface of ro system luo et al 2021a yu et al 2017 hence it might cause serious ro membrane fouling problems and deserves more attention in the fouling control of ro systems computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used to demonstrate the filtration resistance induced by the secretion of eps a biofilm micro unit composed of four bacterial cells was used for fluid field simulation as shown in fig 9 fluid velocity field with low or high eps amount were shown in fig 9 a and 9 b the increase of eps lead to the narrowing of the flow channel between bacteria so that the max water velocity increased fluid pressure field with low or high eps amount were shown in fig 9 c 9 f the increase of water velocity demanded higher inlet pressure and showed higher pressure drop the max fluid pressure increased from 0 42 pa to 0 73 pa and the corresponding pressure drop increased from 0 41 pa to 0 73 pa because of increased eps secretion the increase of fluid pressure drop reflected the increase of filtration resistance the results of cfd simulation were consistent with above experimental results 3 4 biofilm formation and membrane adhesion potential of typical crb the biofilm formation potential was assessed by the methods in section 2 7 the biofilm formation potential of typical crb and reference bacterial strains was shown in fig 10 a the strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low according to fig 10 a there was no obvious correlation between biofilm formation potential and fouling potential which was similar to the conclusions of other literatures habimana et al 2014 ishizaki et al 2016 it did not lead to contradiction that the statistical uncorrelationbetween biofilm formation potential and membrane fouling potential since membrane fouling level was also affected by the density porosity and thickness of fouling layers the membrane adhesion potential of different strains was shown in fig 10 b the strains were arranged in the order of fouling potential from high to low according to fig 10 b there was also no obvious correlation between adhesion potential and fouling potential of pure bacterial strain however bacteria with high adhesion potential could gain advantage in the survival competition on the membrane surface due to their tendency to colonize on clean membranes some studies showed that adhesion potential could not be used to predict the biomass of mature biofilm namely there was no direct relation between the initial bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation potential it was also found that the adhesion potential and cellular surface characteristics i e hydrophobicity and surface charge of pure bacterial strain were irrelevant with the microfiltration membrane fouling potential ishizaki et al 2016 the membrane adhesion potential of pure bacterial strain might indirectly affect fouling level by changing the community structure on the membrane surface nevertheless it is still difficult to answer how the adhesion potential affects the community structure on the membrane surface and membrane fouling level as the trends of fouling potential and eps were the same in this study according to fig 10 b here was no obvious correlation between eps and bacterial adhesion potential the above conclusions were supported by previous literature long et al 2009 analyzed the adhesion potential of four kinds of bacteria with or without eps to silica surface removal of eps reduced the adhesion potential of these strains but it did not change the adhesion potential order of them long et al 2009 these results illustrated that eps was an effective but not significant factor in bacterial adhesion processes the membrane adhesion potential and fouling potential were analyzed together as shown in fig 11 the median of the final normalized flux drop of typical crb and reference bacterial strains was 60 6 and the membrane adhesion potential was 0 63 in addition the median of fouling potential in this study might be overestimated because there were 5 crb strains in 8 bacteria strains and the fouling potential of typical crb was higher than that of general bacteria based on the above two medians the fouling potential and adhesion potential were divided into high and low level respectively hence the bacterial strains investigated in this study could be divided into 4 categories 1 bacteria with high fouling potential but low adhesion potential such as cr19 and cr2 these strains with high fouling potential were likely to be crb although their adhesion potential was low they might become the dominant bacteria in the membrane surface community after chlorine disinfection which might lead to serious fouling problems 2 bacteria with high fouling and adhesion potential such as cr4 exceptionally pao1 should also be classified into this category since there was little difference in fouling potential between pao1 and cr4 and the adhesion potential of pao1 was obviously higher there was a defect of pao1 as a model strain since it was not isolated from the water environment 3 bacteria with low fouling potential but high adhesion potential such as cr25 and e coli these bacteria with low fouling potential could not make large contribution to membrane fouling 4 bacteria with low fouling and adhesion potential such as bm1 1 this kind of bacteria could neither cause serious fouling problems when interspecific interaction was not considered among the four kinds of bacteria the first two kinds were appropriate model bacteria for membrane fouling research before chlorine disinfection the second and third kind of bacteria with higher adhesion potential might have greater competitive advantages on the membrane surface when the third kind of bacteria was predominant on the membrane surface there were minor fouling problems after chlorine disinfection the first and second kind of bacteria with higher fouling potential as well as higher chlorine resistance was predominant on the membrane surface which led to severe fouling problems the above inference could be used to explain the aggravation of membrane fouling caused by chlorine disinfection luo et al 2021a wang et al 2019a it should be noted that the bacterial adhesion potential of a specific strain in heterogeneous mixed populations might be different from the above results the bacterial adhesion potential and membrane fouling characteristics in heterogeneous mixed populations were an important follow up research direction 4 conclusions in this study 5 typical crb strains isolated from the fouled ro membrane surface were analyzed three reference bacterial strains bm1 1 pao1 and e coli were selected for comparative study the chlorine resistance membrane fouling potential secretion and adhesion characteristics of typical crb and reference bacteria were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 under the condition of 0 5 mg l free chlorine cr19 and cr2 showed high chlorine resistance while cr4 cr26 cr25 pao1 and bm1 1 showed low chlorine resistance they all met the definition of crb except e coli the inactivation rate of cr19 and cr2 was less than 1 log even at highest chlorine concentration 5 mg l 2 there was a significant positive correlation between membrane fouling potential and chlorine resistance under the condition of 0 5 2 5 mg l cl2 the normalized flux drop increased monotonically with the chlorine resistance under the condition of 0 5 mg l cl2 3 serious fouling caused by extracellular substances was observed in biofouling layers of the bacterial strains with high chlorine resistance which lead to severe flux decline in contrast the biofouling layers of other bacteria with slight fouling caused by extracellular substances was sparser which led to slight flux decline 4 the chlorine resistance and fouling potential of bacteria increased monotonically with the increase of eps secretion in this study eps amount per cell was the main factor related to the chlorine resistance and fouling potential 5 since the contribution of eps to bacterial adhesion was not decisive adhesion and fouling potential were relatively independent bacteria with high fouling potential but low adhesion potential which might become the dominant bacteria on the membrane surface after chlorine disinfection

chemicals edcs a type of exogenous persistent organic pollutants are known to interfere with the functions of the endocrine system as well as the synthesis release and metabolism of hormones chen et al 2019 due to their wide range of applications a large number of edcs have increasingly been employed in industry agriculture and daily life however improper disposal of these chemicals has resulted in the continuous release of multiple edcs e g surfactant alkylphenols plasticizer phthalates paes flame retardant polybrominated biphenyls pesticides and synthetic resin materials bisphenols among others petrakis et al 2017 casals casas and desvergne 2011 liu et al 2019 qiu et al 2018 these pollutants are of particular concern due to their universality and higher levels of discovery in aquatic environments e g surface water groundwater and wastewater compared with other edcs and are likely to cause environmental impacts that translate to adverse effects in aquatic animals aquatic ecosystems and human health table 1 edcs are mainly known for their reproductive toxicity however a growing number of studies have suggested that edcs may cause neurotoxicity in the cortex hippocampus hypothalamus and other brain regions by affecting neuronal membrane permeability ion channels and mitochondria resulting in oxidative damage and cell apoptosis agarwal et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 zhang and yang 2018 pretorius et al 2005 suggested that edcs may also induce neurotoxicity by dysregulating the hormone synthesis transport metabolism and activation mediated by receptor phosphorylation pathways reproductive function is affected by the interaction between the environment and the hypothalamus pituitary gonad hpg axis musumeci et al 2015 as a core part of the neuroendocrine system the hypothalamus and pituitary gland respond to nerve signals from the brain and convert them into chemical signals hormones that act on glandular tissues such as the gonads in turn the gonadal secretion of sex hormones affects the function of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland furthermore the complexity of the hormone network that controls the hpg axis makes it a major target of edcs lamia et al 2012 according to previous studies edcs may directly interact with gonadal receptors to change the hormonal environment thereby affecting the nervous system and leading to neurotoxicity otherwise edcs may first act on the central nervous system and then the endocrine system martyniuk et al 2010 studied the effects of acute dieldrin exposure on neurotransmitter and overall gene transcription in largemouth bass and demonstrated that the hypothalamus may be the target of induced neurotoxicity this was consistent with the fact that the reproductive system of largemouth bass may also be prone to toxicity additionally gonadotropin releasing hormone neurosecretory cells are the main drivers of this axis as they receive afferents from other neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system for proper coordination between reproduction and the environment dickerson et al 2008 like all vertebrates fish reproduction is controlled by the hpg axis many studies have reported that edc may affect the expression of key genes cyp11a1 cyp17 hsd3b hsd11b2 and vtg1 on the hpg axis and the concentration of hormones as well as the neuroendocrine and reproduction system of zebrafish guo et al 2021 hou et al 2018 dang et al 2015 martino et al 2002 liu and jun 2016 behavior integrates the responses of animals to internal and external stimuli levitis et al 2009 therefore behavior can be used as an indicator of the effects of environmental pollutants on animals at the molecular biochemical and physiological levels weis 2001 the zebrafish has been extensively used as a model to study abnormal behavior among many other endpoints due to its small body size and rapid development moreover zebrafish embryos are transparent during their early development and zebrafish eggs are externally fertilized and develop ectogenously all of which facilitate genetic screening and behavioral observations nguyen et al 2013 norton and bally cuif 2010 furthermore zebrafish behavior is sensitive to environmental pollutants which makes this model particularly useful for the assessment of the neurotoxic effects of environmental pollutants ašmonaitė et al 2016 nema and bhargava 2018 numerous studies have demonstrated that edc exposure adversely affects zebrafish behavior resulting in impaired social behavior anxiety learning cognitive abnormalities and changes in locomotor patterns zala and penn 2004 a literature search was conducted on the web of science www isiwebofknowledge com google scholar www scholar google co kr and science direct www sciencedirect com with keywords for each edc name in addition to the terms zebrafish behavior and mechanism the relevance of the studies was then verified and a total of 231 references were selected the effects of edc on zebrafish behavior have been extensively reported however there is a lack of related reports that systematically summarize the effects of edcs on zebrafish behavior and their mechanisms based on the existing literature this review summarizes the adverse effects of several common edcs on zebrafish behavior at different developmental stages presents their potential mechanisms of action and discusses the applications of zebrafish behavior assays for neuroscience research 2 zebrafish behavior behavior is highly sensitive to environmental pollutants weis 2014 and is considered to be closely linked to the health and survival of organisms macphail et al 2009 the zebrafish is widely considered an ideal vertebrate model and therefore zebrafish behavioral research has recently attracted increasing attention current studies on zebrafish behavior have mainly focused on locomotor behavior e g swimming distance average speed and swimming speed social behavior memory anxiety associated behaviors and courtship behavior among others table 2 recently locomotor activity has been widely used to study the effects of neurotoxic chemicals on zebrafish neurobehavior and has become a biological marker of neurotoxicity locomotor behavior plays a critical role in feeding social activities and predator avoidance throughout the life cycle of zebrafish from incubation to death colwill and creton 2011 cheng and zhang 2020 used zebrafish swimming behavior as a biological indicator of neurotoxicity when studying the neurotoxicity of famoxadone cymoxanil to zebrafish embryos li et al 2019 explored the mitochondrial toxicity of pyraclostrobin using zebrafish embryos by assessing their locomotor behavior after acute pyraclostrobin exposure andrade et al 2018 used larval zebrafish swimming behavior as an endpoint to explore the mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicity induced by ayahuasca the social behaviors of zebrafish include shoaling behavior aggression and dominance among others zala and penn 2004 shoaling behavior plays a key role in improving zebrafish foraging efficiency avoiding predators and finding mates engeszer et al 2007 a shoal of zebrafish is capable of foraging for longer periods and more easily than individual fish as shoaling provides protection against potentially dangerous prey and increases the likelihood of catching prey items that might be too fast for an individual fish to capture moreover large shoals of fish are more likely to avoid predators and have a better chance of survival predators also find it more difficult to track a single target when facing a scattered shoal of fish colwill and creton 2011 therefore zebrafish typically choose larger and more active shoals pritchard et al 2001 moreover the sex ratio and male female composition of a given shoal also affect the social preferences of individual zebrafish rhul and mccrobert 2005 for example peichel demonstrated that male zebrafish are more inclined to choose female fish groups to gain more mating opportunities in contrast female zebrafish tend to prefer larger shoals regardless of whether they are primarily comprised of males or females the authors speculated that this behavior provided the females with greater security and protection peichel 2004 in recent years increasingly more research has been conducted in an effort to obtain additional insights into the basis of zebrafish aggressive behavior for example nabinger et al 2018 found that nicl2 exposure reduced the incidence of aggressive behavior in adult zebrafish zebrafish chase and bite each other to establish dominant subordinate relationships interestingly this aggression gradually decreases over time once the aforementioned relationship is established suggesting that the fish become aware of their social hierarchy and therefore the dominant fish no longer need to attack the others to maintain their position larson et al 2006 the courtship behavior of zebrafish is an important endpoint for evaluating the ecotoxicological effects of water contaminants during courtship both male and female zebrafish exhibit five main courtship behaviors the courtship behaviors of females include approaching escorting presentation leading and egg laying whereas the males pursue the female through chasing tail nosing zig zagging and quivering darrow et al 2004 increasingly more studies have quantified the courtship behavior of zebrafish to quantitatively evaluate the impact of neurotoxicants on this endpoint mi et al 2019 mitchell et al 2020 hamilton et al 2021 yong et al 2017 quantified the courtship behaviors of zebrafish chases zig zagging tail nosing and quivering and found that the courtship behavior of male zebrafish lacking the androgen receptor was significantly reduced thus highlighting the critical role of this receptor in driving courtship behavioral impairment results from changes in neuronal structure and or physiology zebrafish have obvious circadian rhythms which manifest in their spawning foraging swimming and shoaling behaviors further these circadian patterns are thought to optimize resource and energy use krylov et al 2021 therefore the swimming activity of zebrafish and their responses to diverse stimuli are widely used in neurobiology to assess anxiety aggression learning memory and mate selection bailey et al 2013 behavioral changes are among the most obvious endpoints for the assessment of edc toxicity as a large proportion of these compounds affect neurological function therefore the neurotoxic effects of edcs on zebrafish can be determined by measuring zebrafish behavior 3 applications of zebrafish behavior experiments in neuroscience behavioral assessment is a relatively simple cost effective practical and effective means to characterize the effects of contaminants such as edcs on aquatic animals cresci et al 2018 further the popularization of computer technology and software has made zebrafish behavior experiments more intelligent the methods for detecting behavior also vary depending on the type of zebrafish to be evaluated for example locomotor behavior is usually quantified based on the total distance moved average swimming speed and turning angle souders et al 2019 pohl et al 2019 ding et al 2020 learning and memory on the other hand are tested using more complex methods such as the t maze and y maze as well as the active avoidance reflex and warning response kundap et al 2017 ngoc hieu et al 2020 the detection of anxiety associated behavior generally entails the analysis of hyperactivity and position preference common zebrafish behavior experiments are summarized in table 3 and discussed in detail below noldus wageningen nederland has developed daniovision a high throughput system that is specifically used to quantitatively analyze the locomotor behavior of zebrafish embryos and larvae using the ethovision xt software ding et al 2020 used this system to measure the velocity angular velocity and turn angle of larval zebrafish to evaluate the toxic effects of monohaloacetamides on early neural development pohl et al 2019 used the zebrabox system coupled with the zebralab software to measure the total travel distance of larval zebrafish when the lights inside the testing chamber were abruptly turned on and off at set intervals du et al 2020 investigated the influence of ethanol on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal hpa axis of larval zebrafish by assessing their swimming behavior the authors identified changes in locomotor activity which served as a basis to explain the effect of ethanol on the activity of the hpa axis the t maze test fig 1 is often used to assess the cognitive function of zebrafish the maze used to conduct this assay consists of two arms and alleys of the same width and height combined with the innate foraging behaviors of zebrafish this assay can be used to evaluate the effect of neurotoxic chemicals on learning and memory by assessing the conditional location bias of zebrafish using positive reinforcement xia et al 2021 aparna and patri 2021 the t maze can also be used to explore the effects of neurotoxic chemicals on learning memory by measuring the latency to leave the initial area to reach and stay in the reward zone zheng et al 2017 the y maze is typically used to test learning and memory in rodents the spatial memory ability of animals can be effectively measured without the need to condition the animals to learn any rules which offers several unique advantages heredia lópez et al 2016 the y maze fig 1 consists of three identical arms and a connector and all three arms are at a 120 angle from each other fontana et al 2021b there are two common y maze experiments the first experiment is divided into two parts 1 one arm remains closed allowing the zebrafish to explore freely between the other two arms 2 the closed arm is then opened and the zebrafish is allowed to explore freely between the three arms during the trial the time and distance required to arrive at the new arm are measured lalonde et al 2002 if the memory of the zebrafish was impaired the exploration time and distance traveled in the new arm will be reduced additionally there is another y maze test in which the zebrafish is placed at the end of an arm the order in which the zebrafish enters the other arms is recorded within 5 8 minutes and the acquired data is used to assess the learning and memory of the zebrafish cleal et al 2021 brinza et al 2020 adopted the first experimental method to assess the effect of rhoifolin on zebrafish memory by measuring the time spent in each arm total travel distance and turning angle the novel tank test ntt can also be used to evaluate the stress and anxiety of zebrafish the ntt typically consists of dividing the tank into three equal areas bottom middle and top fontana et al 2021a mezzomo et al 2016 or four sterling et al 2015 after being exposed to pollutants individual zebrafish were placed in the novel tank and a video camera was used to record their behavior while exploring the tank the effects of contaminant exposure on the occurrence of anxiety like behaviors were then assessed by quantifying the time spent in the top middle and bottom sections the total distance traveled fontana et al 2019 khor et al 2013 and the latency to reach the top section of the tank fenske et al 2020 meshalkina et al 2018 fontana et al 2021a used this behavioral experiment to evaluate whether zebrafish sex differences affected anxiety like behaviors the authors found that females were more likely to exhibit anxiety behaviors than males thus highlighting the importance of accounting for this variable when using zebrafish models for behavioral analyses sterling et al 2015 also used this method to investigate the effects of ethanol on anxiety like behaviors in zebrafish interestingly 20 ethanol significantly reduced the latency to reach the top zone likewise thigmotaxis is often used as an indicator of stress and anxiety in zebrafish thigmotaxis is the tendency of stressed animals to remain close to an edge or wall and is calculated as the ratio between the total distance moved tdm in the outer zone of the test area i e closer to the edges and the tdm in the entire test area including the inner and outer zone the experiment began by dividing each well of a 24 well plate into two zones one internal and one external with equal areas individual 5 hour post fertilization hpf larvae were then placed in each well and a video camera was used to track their movements and positions within the wells the test lasted 10 minutes the lights were kept on for 0 6 minutes and then were turned off for 7 10 minutes the data was then collected to evaluate thigmotaxis behavior schnörr et al 2012 paredes zúñiga et al 2019 used a similar method to assess anxiety like behaviors in triadimefon exposed zebrafish mirror image stimulation mis is also often used to study zebrafish aggressive behavior similar to the other assays the device used to assess zebrafish aggressive behavior is illustrated in fig 1 exposed zebrafish were placed in a tank where a mirror was placed perpendicular to the horizontal plane one side of the mirror would overlap with the back edge of the tank and formed a 22 5 angle with the side of the tank the area near the tank was labeled close and the other area was labeled far the two areas represent the apparent distance between the fish and its reflection further to eliminate the influence of other environmental factors on the test results all of the other tank walls are typically covered with opaque partitions fontana et al 2016 michelotti et al 2018 during the test the movement of the zebrafish is tracked and analyzed using a video camera and aggressive behaviors including mirror biting frequency and duration time spent close to the mirror and time to bite the mirror are monitored and quantified moretz et al 2006 barbosa et al 2018 marks et al 2005 used the mis assay to detect aggressive behaviors in adult zebrafish when studying the influence of the developmental environment on phenotypic responses michelotti et al 2018 applied the mis test to study whether ketamine affects the aggressive behavior of adult zebrafish the authors found that low concentrations of this compound increased aggression towards the mirror whereas high concentrations reduce aggression these findings provide important insights into the effect of environmental contaminants such as ketamine on the occurrence of aggressive behaviors shoaling is another component of the behavioral repertoire of zebrafish which is often used to quantify social behavior miller and gerlai 2011 shoaling behavior can be assessed using a novel tank as described above the novel tank is divided into two equal parts upper and lower after which shoaling behavior is recorded for 6 minutes using a video camera on one side of the tank in the second half of the recording eight screenshots are taken every 20 seconds to measure the distance between each fish cm and calculate an average fig 1 pham et al 2012 grossman et al 2010 additionally shoaling behavior can also be used to assess stress or anxiety in zebrafish stressed fish tend to swim closer to their conspecifics whereas the opposite is true for more relaxed fish speedie and gerlai 2008 for example after acute treatment with the sedative drug ketamine the average number of zebrafish at the top of the tank and the average inter fish distance increased thus confirming the anti anxiety effects of ketamine riehl et al 2011 4 mechanisms of zebrafish behavior regulation the dynamic balance between acetylcholinesterase ache and dopamine da plays an indispensable role in maintaining the normal progress of nerve signals in the brain mennella et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 oxidative stress is a common mode of action for edcs to induce toxicity and this damage also exists in related neuronal cells for example when oxidative stress occurs in dopamine neurons da auto oxidizes to da quinone which can amplify oxidative damage signals juárez et al 2016 at the same time the abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species will lead to the decrease of acetylcholinesterase activity thus preventing acetylcholine from being eliminated in time and ultimately inducing neurotoxicity jeyarasasingam et al 2000 den hartog et al 2002 wyse et al 2004 additionally edcs may eventually lead to imbalances of dopamine acetylcholine homeostasis by reducing the activity of related proteins responsible for dopamine synthesis and transport e g tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter and causing the abnormal accumulation of dopamine between cells therefore this review will focus on the role of da ache and oxidative stress as targets and mechanisms of edc induced behavioral impairment in zebrafish fig 2 4 1 acetylcholinesterase acetylcholine ach is a cholinergic neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role as an excitatory transmitter in addition to its role as a sympathetic preganglionic transmitter and a parasympathetic preganglionic and postganglionic transmitter fulton et al 2010 and is thus an important driver of animal behavior and neurodevelopment ach was the first neurotransmitter to be discovered and its accumulation can affect the normal function of the nervous system colović et al 2013 payne et al 1996 kruse et al 2012 ache is among the key enzymes that regulate neurotransmitter uptake in organisms and is therefore widely used as a neurotoxic marker specifically this enzyme eliminates the influence of ach accumulation on the nervous system by hydrolyzing ach to choline and acetic acid thereby terminating the excitatory effect of neurotransmitters on the postsynaptic membrane to ensure the normal transmission of nerve signals in vivo soreq et al 2001 cheng and jiang 2020 toumi et al 2015 massoulié et al 1993 chen and yu 2012 furthermore this enzyme is expressed in many primary neurons of zebrafish embryos including motor and sensory neurons this is crucial for the development of neurons in zebrafish embryos and is intimately related to zebrafish behavior bertrand et al 2001 hanneman et al 2010 changes in ache activity and decreases in gene expression level affect the behavior of zebrafish which is manifested as increases in muscle activity loss of motor ability and anxiety like behaviors behra et al 2002 xiong et al 2019 jensen et al 1997 tilton et al 2011 vieira et al 2020 liu and zhang 2020 exposed zebrafish embryos to 0 10 100 and 1000 μg l of the fungicide propamocarb for 7 days to explore the effect of this compound on larval zebrafish behavior the authors tested the locomotor behavior of the larval zebrafish at 96 hpf and observed a decrease in the swimming speed distance traveled and swimming output when switching the lights on and off in the observation chamber these observations coincided with ache activity inhibition and downregulation of its mrna transcript levels it is speculated that the accumulation of ach in synapses is possibly due to the change of ache activity and transcription level similar to larval zebrafish the same phenomena have also been observed in adult zebrafish pullaguri et al 2020 demonstrated significant decreases in ache activity in both brain and skeletal muscle which resulted in changes in turn angle swimming distance speed and freezing behavior when adult zebrafish were exposed to 0 3 and 0 6 mg l of triclosan for 48 h moreover other studies have demonstrated that ache activity may be affected by oxidative stress dopamine and intracellular calcium concentration parlak et al 2018 greenfield 2005 4 2 dopamine da is synthesized from tyrosine wasel and freeman 2020 and is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system cns da is the main target of environmental pollutants and regulates many important neurological functions in the brain da regulates motor and emotional functions as well as learning memory and reward outside the brain da can also act on multiple organs and tissues and regulate hormone release to modulate blood pressure missale et al 1998 matt and gaskill 2020 liu and yu 2020 showed that after exposing female zebrafish to 5 50 and 500 mg l carbofuran for 48 h the transitions and time spent at the top of the tank were significantly reduced however erratic movements were increased and the increase of 5 and 50 mg l was more significant interestingly all of these changes coincided with a significant increase in da levels to demonstrate the role of da as one of the main mediators of anxiety like behaviors the authors added a tyrosine hydroxylase the rate limiting enzyme of da synthesis inhibitor and it was found that anxiety like behaviors were alleviated wang et al 2015 conducted a similar study and found that exposing zebrafish to 30 and 100 µg l polybrominated diphenyl ethers can significantly reduce da content and cause abnormal behavior average speed decreased significantly some researchers have li also reached the same conclusion i e a decrease in dopamine content leads to neurobehavioral disorders li et al 2020 da can transmit signals through dopamine receptors drs and drs play an important role in regulating dopaminergic neurotransmission there are currently five known subtypes of drs d1 d2 d3 d4 and d5 which in turn can be subdivided into two types d1 like receptors and d2 like receptors both of which are g protein coupled receptors kebabian and calne 1979 when excited the former activates the adenylate cyclase in contrast the latter inhibits adenylate cyclase missale et al 1998 recent studies have linked the mrna expression level of drs e g dopamine transporter dopamine d1 receptor dopamine receptor d2a and dopamine d3 receptor with zebrafish behavior liu et al 2021 for example yu et al 2021 exposed adult zebrafish to 0 3 30 and 300 µg l of tetrabromobisphenol for 42 days after which their embryos were analyzed the authors found that the locomotor behavior da level and mrna transcript levels of the da receptor related genes drd2b and drd3 in the larvae in the high concentration group 300 µg l were all significantly reduced tu et al 2020 assessed the effect of tbt 500 ng l exposure on the occurrence of anxiety like behaviors by quantifying the time that adult zebrafish spent on the bottom of their aquarium decreased transcript levels of mrna encoding d2 receptors drd2a and drd2b in adult fish brains indicated reduced dopamine transmission signaling in the brain and these changes coincided with an increase in anxious behavior which greatly suggested the involvement of the da neurotransmitter system in changes in anxious behavior other studies have demonstrated that dopamine and its receptors are also involved in the regulation of zebrafish bone metabolism and have important regulatory effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts bones are key components of the locomotor system and therefore da plays a critical role in the swimming performance of zebrafish lee et al 2015 4 3 oxidative stress oxidative stress is another important aspect of toxicology research cheng and zhang 2020 which causes an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species ros and the ability of antioxidant enzymes to remove them currently the assessment of antioxidant indices in zebrafish typically entails the determination of antioxidant enzyme activity ros level and lipid peroxidation goncalves et al 2020 superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione peroxidase are the main antioxidant enzymes that are monitored to assess antioxidant activity due to their crucial role in combating the harmful effects caused by excessive ros production yang and lee 2015 jin et al 2010 regarding the determination of antioxidant enzyme activity although some studies reported inhibitions in the level of the antioxidant enzymes upon edc exposure zhang and zhou 2018 yan et al 2016 shukla et al 2017 other studies found that edcs did not inhibit enzyme activity but instead enhance it faria et al 2021 nunes et al 2017 the reason for this reaction may be that short term exposure activates the antioxidant defense system of biological leading to an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes thereby triggering an adaptive response moreover molecular studies also have shown contradictory results jiang et al 2015 mukhopadhyay et al 2015 ros accumulation can interfere with a variety of functions of the nervous system including nerve growth and regeneration neuron survival differentiation synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission salim 2017 the occurrence of oxidative stress in the body also has a crucial impact on behavioral impairment salahinejad et al 2021 found that oxidative stress is closely related to anxiety associated behaviors in humans and animals adult zebrafish that were exposed to bisphenol s bps for 75 days remained at the bottom of the novel tank for shorter periods furthermore the time spent above the centerline and fear related behavior indices triggered by external stimuli alarm cues were used to evaluate anxiety and fear behaviors the results indicated that long term bps exposure decreased the indexes related to anxiety and fear in adult zebrafish as well as the transcriptional levels of genes related to oxidative stress several studies have concluded that oxidative stress may affect zebrafish behavior by altering ache activity and the da system den hartog et al 2002 wyse et al 2004 pullaguri et al 2020 both of these are important targets of neurotoxic chemicals da is an essential source of free radicals and oxidative stress jones and miller 2008 but whose integrity could be influenced by oxidative stress meiser et al 2013 juárez olguín et al 2016 additionally oxidative stress can also reduce the response and defense capabilities of cells leading to energy homeostasis imbalances espinosa ruiz et al 2019 which has an impact on neural development zielonka et al 2019 and is closely related to zebrafish behavior abe et al 2018 5 effect of single edcs on zebrafish behavior 5 1 bisphenols bisphenol a bpa a plastic synthetic material is an important derivative of phenol and acetone that was discovered in the 1950s and has since been widely used in the production of epoxy resin and polycarbonate materials ben jonathan and hugo 2016 bpa can enter the human body through different routes such as the digestive tract and respiratory tract damaging the human reproductive system and immune system and causing neuroendocrine system disorders santoro et al 2019 segovia mendoza et al 2020 ma et al 2019 most countries and organizations worldwide are restricting the use of bpa and actively promote bpa alternatives niu et al 2017 many bpa substitutes such as bisphenol f bpf and bps have been developed however they have been found to exert toxic effects comparable to those of bpa many studies have reported that bisphenol affects zebrafish behavior potentially by affecting the expression of genes associated with nervous system function oxidative damage and cell apoptosis gyimah et al 2021 conducted bpa bps acute exposure experiments to demonstrate that bpa bps exposure had obvious neurobehavioral effects on zebrafish which is specifically manifested as an increased activity frequency mania frequency mania time and activity time in zebrafish the abnormal locomotor behavior of zebrafish may be related to the influence of bpa bps on its neurodevelopment and central nervous system gu et al 2020 discussed the effect of bpf on zebrafish neurotoxicity and the molecular mechanisms of its toxicity the experimental results showed that bpf treatment significantly reduced the expression of neurodevelopment related genes syn2a elavl3 gfap and mbp additionally bpf treatment increased the levels of brain oxidative stress and activated nerve cell apoptosis in zebrafish larvae similar studies have also found that the changes in locomotor behavior of zebrafish were related to the concentration of bisphenol and its exposure time sun and juan juan 2016 wang et al 2013 demonstrated that 1 15 μmol l bpa caused significant changes in spontaneous locomotion and free swimming speed by inducing axial muscle tissue damage and disrupting the axonal growth of primary and secondary motor neurons in zebrafish 5 2 organophosphorus and organochlorine pesticides pesticides play an important role in promoting the development of agriculture however the frequent and irrational use of pesticides has led to widespread pesticide pollution huang et al 2020 many studies have reported the adverse effects of these pesticide residues on living organisms including the behavioral changes and neurotoxicity in zebrafish 5 2 1 organophosphorus pesticides organophosphorus pesticides ops are among the most important agricultural insecticides and have played a historical role in the development of agriculture worldwide soares et al 2019 ops inhibit the activity of ache thus hampering the ability of this enzyme to hydrolyze ach this in turn results in an overwhelming accumulation of neurotransmitters in the synapses overexcitation of the cns and cholinergic nerves and finally death carlson 1997 due to their high efficiency and low price these compounds are widely used in agriculture forestry fisheries and even in the household particularly chlorpyrifos cpf and dichlorvos shaffo et al 2018 ding et al 2019 many studies have reported the adverse effects of op residues on living organisms including behavioral changes and neurotoxicity in zebrafish in zebrafish cpf affects the expression of nervous system related genes such as elavl3 gap43 gfap and mbp among others sun and xu 2016 as well as ache activity including transcriptional level jeon et al 2016 and dopamine and serotonin levels aragon et al 2017 tufi et al 2016 all of which are known to affect behavior levin et al 2004 found that early exposure of zebrafish embryos to 100 ng ml cpf significantly affected early swimming after hatching early cpf exposure likely affects the nervous system of embryonic zebrafish which further leads to cognitive impairment and causes abnormal behaviors other ops e g dichlorvos malathion have also been found to exert similar effects to those described above exposing zebrafish embryos to 0 1 5 and 10 mg l dichlorvos for 7 and 14 d significantly reduced the body length and heart rate the surface area of the eyes the swimming distance and swimming speed and the avoidance ability of larvae this means that exposure to organophosphorus compounds in the early stages of development will lead to increased susceptibility to behavioral and neuronal changes that may be associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases altenhofen et al 2019 5 2 2 organochlorine pesticides organochlorine pesticides have a longer history than ops and are widely used due to their good insecticidal effects however their half lives are extremely long and their accumulation can lead to severe and persistent effects on environmental and human health guida et al 2021 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt is a non decomposable and commonly used organochlorine pesticide the evaluation of ddt toxicity has so far primarily focused on early developmental exposure abreu villaca and levin 2017 tiedeken and ramsdell 2009 found that ddt increased the sensitivity of zebrafish embryos to seizure inducing drugs pentylenetetrazol and domoic acid the specific mechanism of this phenomenon is the spatial interaction between ddt and voltage gated sodium channel inactivation the inhibition of channel inactivation leads to sodium ion leakage which leads to excessive nerve excitement and repetitive discharge this eventually leads to more severe seizures and head shaking behavior regarding adult zebrafish hawkey et al 2020 exposed 6 to 8 month old zebrafish to ddt for a week and found that their locomotor behavior decreased whereas anxiety shallow water seeking behavior and predator avoidance increased additionally it was found that ddt and cpf produced quite different behavioral changes with ddt being more associated with aversive symptoms such as hypoactivity or increased stress response and cpf being more associated with inhibitory symptoms such as boldness enhanced social approach hyperactivity and reduced persistent avoidance this suggests that different pesticides may be act on different molecular targets in zebrafish and therefore result in different behavioral changes in zebrafish 5 3 flame retardants flame retardants are a type of chemicals used to improve the combustion performance of materials which are widely used to treat various decorative materials and furniture nosaka et al 2020 this review will focus on two typical flame retardants a phosphate ester flame retardant triphenyl phosphate tpp a phosphorus flame retardant and an organic chloride flame retardant dechlorane plus dp a halogen flame retardant 5 3 1 triphenyl phosphate the demand and output of tpp a type of organic phosphate flame retardant are consistently increasing each year liu et al 2016 in most commercial products tpp is used as an additive and does not covalently bind to other materials therefore this compound can be easily released into the surrounding environment throughout the entire lifetime of the products van der veen and de boer 2012 further recent research has demonstrated the adverse effects of tpp on zebrafish neurobehavior anderson et al 2004 ni et al 2007 dishaw et al 2014 tao et al 2016 exposed 120 h zebrafish embryos to various concentrations of tpp and found that the swimming speed of the larvae increased in the 5 µg l treatment group but significantly decreased in the high concentration 625 µg l treatment group further tpp exposed zebrafish embryos exhibited behavioral abnormalities when examined using a light dark alternation experiment which coincided with lower levels of the neurodevelopment related genes gap43 and a1 tubulin as well as a reduction in ache activity together these findings suggest that these changes in motor behavior may be related to the transcription levels of neurodevelopment related genes and changes in ache activity after tpp exposure 5 3 2 dechlorane plus dp is another commonly used chlorinated flame retardant additive due to its good flame retardant properties it is widely used in plastics electrical wires connectors in computers and other products wang et al 2016 wang and jia 2020 previous studies have shown that dp severely impairs zebrafish behavior chen et al 2017 exposed zebrafish embryos to 15 30 and 60 µg l of dp and found that their spontaneous movement and touch response swimming behavior and light dark transition movement were significantly affected which coincided with motor axon inhibition oxidative stress and an increase in the transcription levels of apoptosis associated genes bax and caspase 3 it is speculated that dp inhibited the growth of primary neuron axons which in turn was caused by accelerated tail cell apoptosis in recent years studies have reported that dp can affect the level of thyroid hormone and intracellular ca2 signals kang al 2016 chen and chen 2019 both of which are closely related to the development of the nervous system and the regulation of nerve cell function gomez and spitzer 1999 huang et al 2010 5 4 phthalates paes are often used as plasticizers to enhance the softness and elasticity of polyvinyl chloride products akkbik et al 2020 paes have been widely used in daily life and industrial and agricultural production remarkably pae exposure affected the neurobehavior of fetuses at 26 weeks of pregnancy yolton et al 2011 a study of children s intelligence revealed a negative correlation between the level of phthalates in their urine and their iq cho et al 2010 some current studies have shown that pae exposure may induce neurobehavioral changes in zebrafish qian et al 2020 reported that paes may inhibit the skeletal development of juvenile zebrafish thus affecting zebrafish behavior when zebrafish embryos were exposed to 6 types of paes diethyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate di n butyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and di n octyl phthalate until 7 days post fertilization their autokinetic movement decreased at 24 hpf and different degrees of curved spine appeared at 96 hpf which coincided with downregulation of skeletal development related genes runx2b and gpc4a at 144 hpf pu et al 2020 5 5 nonylphenol nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ester is often used as a cleaning product and ultimately finds its way to aquatic ecosystems through sewage from industrial and urban sewage treatment plants nonylphenol np is another typical edc and therefore also affects zebrafish behavior fraser et al 2017 exposed zebrafish embryos to np for 96 h and the distance traveled and activity time of larval zebrafish changed when evaluated using the light dark test chandrasekar et al 2011 exposed zebrafish embryos to np and found that a low concentration treatment 2 µm affected the motor ability of larval zebrafish and swimming behavior decreased moreover 24 hpf zebrafish embryos exhibited notochord distortion and hernia formation which was attributed to apoptosis in the notochord and resulted in notochord muscle and motor neuron defects the notochord plays a crucial role in the differentiation of muscle and nerve cells which might explain the decreased motor ability and abnormal swimming behavior of the larval zebrafish in addition to locomotor behavior np also affects other behaviors of zebrafish xia et al 2010 found that a high concentration 100 g l of np could significantly inhibit the activity and group preference of zebrafish moreover in the bite mirror stimulation experiment there was a significant decrease in the aggressive behavior of male and female zebrafish in the high concentration group whereas the low concentration groups 1 and 10 g l exhibited increases in these behaviors 6 effects of edc mixtures on zebrafish behavior edcs always occur in the form of complex mixtures in the environment and therefore aquatic organisms are generally exposed to edc mixtures rather than single compounds fig 3 thus evaluating the effects of edc mixtures on zebrafish neurobehavior provides a much more realistic assessment of the effects of environmental edc exposure synergistic effects on swimming behavior inhibition of proneural gene expression and oxidative stress were observed when larval zebrafish were co exposed to permethrin and cypermethrin yang et al 2014 the locomotor behavior and learning ability of larval zebrafish were also more markedly affected by cpf and deltamethrin co exposure than single exposure hu et al 2020 nevertheless edc mixtures do not always have synergistic toxic effects in zebrafish edcs with similar or different modes of action may also have antagonistic effects on humans and wildlife rivollier et al 2019 beyer et al 2014 liu et al 2018 found that a low concentration of tdt a mixture of triclosan 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and 2 4 dichlorophenol at 0 28 mg l promoted the swimming behavior of zebrafish whereas high concentrations 0 56 and 1 12 mg l decreased this change jijie et al 2020 found that toxic metals cadmium and nickel alleviated the inhibitory effect of deltamethrin on the swimming distance and speed of zebrafish additionally mixed exposure to these three substances decreased the swimming speed of zebrafish when they approached the water surface however the combined effects of edc are not well understood as the number of related studies is extremely limited therefore exploring the toxic effects of edc mixtures on zebrafish is of great significance 7 conclusion and outlook edcs are widely detected in aquatic environments and therefore fish and other aquatic organisms are particularly vulnerable to these toxic compounds edcs possess varying degrees of neurotoxicity and can therefore affect a wide range of zebrafish behaviors including locomotor activity anxiety memory and shoaling behavior however most current studies have exclusively focused on the influence of edc on zebrafish behavior and therefore additional studies are required to determine the mechanisms by which edcs interfere with zebrafish behavior particularly at the molecular and signaling pathway levels edcs have different effects on the behavior of zebrafish at different developmental stages larval zebrafish are particularly sensitive to environmental insult and their behavior changes more significantly in response to toxicant exposure therefore behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae could be used as biomarkers to accelerate the screening and identification of environmental contaminants particularly neurodevelopmental toxicants currently a growing number of clinical and epidemiological studies have linked exposure to neurotoxic chemicals with behavioral alteration nevertheless the in vivo evaluation of developmental neurotoxicity endpoints using mammalian models such as rodents is difficult costly and time intensive the zebrafish has thus become an efficient and versatile environmental toxicology model organism with an irreplaceable position in the evaluation of the toxicity mechanisms of environmental chemicals due to its rapid life cycle and small size therefore we believe that zebrafish behavioral models will lead to important breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of modern diseases declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16447,environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs a type of exogenous organic pollutants are ubiquitous in natural aquatic environments therefor this review focused on the use of the zebrafish as a model to explore the effect of different edcs on behavior as well as the molecular mechanisms that drive these effects furthermore our study summarizes the current knowledge on the neuromodulatory effects of different edcs in zebrafish this study also reviews the current state of zebrafish behavior research in addition to the potential mechanisms of single and mixed pollutant

chemicals edcs a type of exogenous persistent organic pollutants are known to interfere with the functions of the endocrine system as well as the synthesis release and metabolism of hormones chen et al 2019 due to their wide range of applications a large number of edcs have increasingly been employed in industry agriculture and daily life however improper disposal of these chemicals has resulted in the continuous release of multiple edcs e g surfactant alkylphenols plasticizer phthalates paes flame retardant polybrominated biphenyls pesticides and synthetic resin materials bisphenols among others petrakis et al 2017 casals casas and desvergne 2011 liu et al 2019 qiu et al 2018 these pollutants are of particular concern due to their universality and higher levels of discovery in aquatic environments e g surface water groundwater and wastewater compared with other edcs and are likely to cause environmental impacts that translate to adverse effects in aquatic animals aquatic ecosystems and human health table 1 edcs are mainly known for their reproductive toxicity however a growing number of studies have suggested that edcs may cause neurotoxicity in the cortex hippocampus hypothalamus and other brain regions by affecting neuronal membrane permeability ion channels and mitochondria resulting in oxidative damage and cell apoptosis agarwal et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 zhang and yang 2018 pretorius et al 2005 suggested that edcs may also induce neurotoxicity by dysregulating the hormone synthesis transport metabolism and activation mediated by receptor phosphorylation pathways reproductive function is affected by the interaction between the environment and the hypothalamus pituitary gonad hpg axis musumeci et al 2015 as a core part of the neuroendocrine system the hypothalamus and pituitary gland respond to nerve signals from the brain and convert them into chemical signals hormones that act on glandular tissues such as the gonads in turn the gonadal secretion of sex hormones affects the function of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland furthermore the complexity of the hormone network that controls the hpg axis makes it a major target of edcs lamia et al 2012 according to previous studies edcs may directly interact with gonadal receptors to change the hormonal environment thereby affecting the nervous system and leading to neurotoxicity otherwise edcs may first act on the central nervous system and then the endocrine system martyniuk et al 2010 studied the effects of acute dieldrin exposure on neurotransmitter and overall gene transcription in largemouth bass and demonstrated that the hypothalamus may be the target of induced neurotoxicity this was consistent with the fact that the reproductive system of largemouth bass may also be prone to toxicity additionally gonadotropin releasing hormone neurosecretory cells are the main drivers of this axis as they receive afferents from other neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system for proper coordination between reproduction and the environment dickerson et al 2008 like all vertebrates fish reproduction is controlled by the hpg axis many studies have reported that edc may affect the expression of key genes cyp11a1 cyp17 hsd3b hsd11b2 and vtg1 on the hpg axis and the concentration of hormones as well as the neuroendocrine and reproduction system of zebrafish guo et al 2021 hou et al 2018 dang et al 2015 martino et al 2002 liu and jun 2016 behavior integrates the responses of animals to internal and external stimuli levitis et al 2009 therefore behavior can be used as an indicator of the effects of environmental pollutants on animals at the molecular biochemical and physiological levels weis 2001 the zebrafish has been extensively used as a model to study abnormal behavior among many other endpoints due to its small body size and rapid development moreover zebrafish embryos are transparent during their early development and zebrafish eggs are externally fertilized and develop ectogenously all of which facilitate genetic screening and behavioral observations nguyen et al 2013 norton and bally cuif 2010 furthermore zebrafish behavior is sensitive to environmental pollutants which makes this model particularly useful for the assessment of the neurotoxic effects of environmental pollutants ašmonaitė et al 2016 nema and bhargava 2018 numerous studies have demonstrated that edc exposure adversely affects zebrafish behavior resulting in impaired social behavior anxiety learning cognitive abnormalities and changes in locomotor patterns zala and penn 2004 a literature search was conducted on the web of science www isiwebofknowledge com google scholar www scholar google co kr and science direct www sciencedirect com with keywords for each edc name in addition to the terms zebrafish behavior and mechanism the relevance of the studies was then verified and a total of 231 references were selected the effects of edc on zebrafish behavior have been extensively reported however there is a lack of related reports that systematically summarize the effects of edcs on zebrafish behavior and their mechanisms based on the existing literature this review summarizes the adverse effects of several common edcs on zebrafish behavior at different developmental stages presents their potential mechanisms of action and discusses the applications of zebrafish behavior assays for neuroscience research 2 zebrafish behavior behavior is highly sensitive to environmental pollutants weis 2014 and is considered to be closely linked to the health and survival of organisms macphail et al 2009 the zebrafish is widely considered an ideal vertebrate model and therefore zebrafish behavioral research has recently attracted increasing attention current studies on zebrafish behavior have mainly focused on locomotor behavior e g swimming distance average speed and swimming speed social behavior memory anxiety associated behaviors and courtship behavior among others table 2 recently locomotor activity has been widely used to study the effects of neurotoxic chemicals on zebrafish neurobehavior and has become a biological marker of neurotoxicity locomotor behavior plays a critical role in feeding social activities and predator avoidance throughout the life cycle of zebrafish from incubation to death colwill and creton 2011 cheng and zhang 2020 used zebrafish swimming behavior as a biological indicator of neurotoxicity when studying the neurotoxicity of famoxadone cymoxanil to zebrafish embryos li et al 2019 explored the mitochondrial toxicity of pyraclostrobin using zebrafish embryos by assessing their locomotor behavior after acute pyraclostrobin exposure andrade et al 2018 used larval zebrafish swimming behavior as an endpoint to explore the mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicity induced by ayahuasca the social behaviors of zebrafish include shoaling behavior aggression and dominance among others zala and penn 2004 shoaling behavior plays a key role in improving zebrafish foraging efficiency avoiding predators and finding mates engeszer et al 2007 a shoal of zebrafish is capable of foraging for longer periods and more easily than individual fish as shoaling provides protection against potentially dangerous prey and increases the likelihood of catching prey items that might be too fast for an individual fish to capture moreover large shoals of fish are more likely to avoid predators and have a better chance of survival predators also find it more difficult to track a single target when facing a scattered shoal of fish colwill and creton 2011 therefore zebrafish typically choose larger and more active shoals pritchard et al 2001 moreover the sex ratio and male female composition of a given shoal also affect the social preferences of individual zebrafish rhul and mccrobert 2005 for example peichel demonstrated that male zebrafish are more inclined to choose female fish groups to gain more mating opportunities in contrast female zebrafish tend to prefer larger shoals regardless of whether they are primarily comprised of males or females the authors speculated that this behavior provided the females with greater security and protection peichel 2004 in recent years increasingly more research has been conducted in an effort to obtain additional insights into the basis of zebrafish aggressive behavior for example nabinger et al 2018 found that nicl2 exposure reduced the incidence of aggressive behavior in adult zebrafish zebrafish chase and bite each other to establish dominant subordinate relationships interestingly this aggression gradually decreases over time once the aforementioned relationship is established suggesting that the fish become aware of their social hierarchy and therefore the dominant fish no longer need to attack the others to maintain their position larson et al 2006 the courtship behavior of zebrafish is an important endpoint for evaluating the ecotoxicological effects of water contaminants during courtship both male and female zebrafish exhibit five main courtship behaviors the courtship behaviors of females include approaching escorting presentation leading and egg laying whereas the males pursue the female through chasing tail nosing zig zagging and quivering darrow et al 2004 increasingly more studies have quantified the courtship behavior of zebrafish to quantitatively evaluate the impact of neurotoxicants on this endpoint mi et al 2019 mitchell et al 2020 hamilton et al 2021 yong et al 2017 quantified the courtship behaviors of zebrafish chases zig zagging tail nosing and quivering and found that the courtship behavior of male zebrafish lacking the androgen receptor was significantly reduced thus highlighting the critical role of this receptor in driving courtship behavioral impairment results from changes in neuronal structure and or physiology zebrafish have obvious circadian rhythms which manifest in their spawning foraging swimming and shoaling behaviors further these circadian patterns are thought to optimize resource and energy use krylov et al 2021 therefore the swimming activity of zebrafish and their responses to diverse stimuli are widely used in neurobiology to assess anxiety aggression learning memory and mate selection bailey et al 2013 behavioral changes are among the most obvious endpoints for the assessment of edc toxicity as a large proportion of these compounds affect neurological function therefore the neurotoxic effects of edcs on zebrafish can be determined by measuring zebrafish behavior 3 applications of zebrafish behavior experiments in neuroscience behavioral assessment is a relatively simple cost effective practical and effective means to characterize the effects of contaminants such as edcs on aquatic animals cresci et al 2018 further the popularization of computer technology and software has made zebrafish behavior experiments more intelligent the methods for detecting behavior also vary depending on the type of zebrafish to be evaluated for example locomotor behavior is usually quantified based on the total distance moved average swimming speed and turning angle souders et al 2019 pohl et al 2019 ding et al 2020 learning and memory on the other hand are tested using more complex methods such as the t maze and y maze as well as the active avoidance reflex and warning response kundap et al 2017 ngoc hieu et al 2020 the detection of anxiety associated behavior generally entails the analysis of hyperactivity and position preference common zebrafish behavior experiments are summarized in table 3 and discussed in detail below noldus wageningen nederland has developed daniovision a high throughput system that is specifically used to quantitatively analyze the locomotor behavior of zebrafish embryos and larvae using the ethovision xt software ding et al 2020 used this system to measure the velocity angular velocity and turn angle of larval zebrafish to evaluate the toxic effects of monohaloacetamides on early neural development pohl et al 2019 used the zebrabox system coupled with the zebralab software to measure the total travel distance of larval zebrafish when the lights inside the testing chamber were abruptly turned on and off at set intervals du et al 2020 investigated the influence of ethanol on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal hpa axis of larval zebrafish by assessing their swimming behavior the authors identified changes in locomotor activity which served as a basis to explain the effect of ethanol on the activity of the hpa axis the t maze test fig 1 is often used to assess the cognitive function of zebrafish the maze used to conduct this assay consists of two arms and alleys of the same width and height combined with the innate foraging behaviors of zebrafish this assay can be used to evaluate the effect of neurotoxic chemicals on learning and memory by assessing the conditional location bias of zebrafish using positive reinforcement xia et al 2021 aparna and patri 2021 the t maze can also be used to explore the effects of neurotoxic chemicals on learning memory by measuring the latency to leave the initial area to reach and stay in the reward zone zheng et al 2017 the y maze is typically used to test learning and memory in rodents the spatial memory ability of animals can be effectively measured without the need to condition the animals to learn any rules which offers several unique advantages heredia lópez et al 2016 the y maze fig 1 consists of three identical arms and a connector and all three arms are at a 120 angle from each other fontana et al 2021b there are two common y maze experiments the first experiment is divided into two parts 1 one arm remains closed allowing the zebrafish to explore freely between the other two arms 2 the closed arm is then opened and the zebrafish is allowed to explore freely between the three arms during the trial the time and distance required to arrive at the new arm are measured lalonde et al 2002 if the memory of the zebrafish was impaired the exploration time and distance traveled in the new arm will be reduced additionally there is another y maze test in which the zebrafish is placed at the end of an arm the order in which the zebrafish enters the other arms is recorded within 5 8 minutes and the acquired data is used to assess the learning and memory of the zebrafish cleal et al 2021 brinza et al 2020 adopted the first experimental method to assess the effect of rhoifolin on zebrafish memory by measuring the time spent in each arm total travel distance and turning angle the novel tank test ntt can also be used to evaluate the stress and anxiety of zebrafish the ntt typically consists of dividing the tank into three equal areas bottom middle and top fontana et al 2021a mezzomo et al 2016 or four sterling et al 2015 after being exposed to pollutants individual zebrafish were placed in the novel tank and a video camera was used to record their behavior while exploring the tank the effects of contaminant exposure on the occurrence of anxiety like behaviors were then assessed by quantifying the time spent in the top middle and bottom sections the total distance traveled fontana et al 2019 khor et al 2013 and the latency to reach the top section of the tank fenske et al 2020 meshalkina et al 2018 fontana et al 2021a used this behavioral experiment to evaluate whether zebrafish sex differences affected anxiety like behaviors the authors found that females were more likely to exhibit anxiety behaviors than males thus highlighting the importance of accounting for this variable when using zebrafish models for behavioral analyses sterling et al 2015 also used this method to investigate the effects of ethanol on anxiety like behaviors in zebrafish interestingly 20 ethanol significantly reduced the latency to reach the top zone likewise thigmotaxis is often used as an indicator of stress and anxiety in zebrafish thigmotaxis is the tendency of stressed animals to remain close to an edge or wall and is calculated as the ratio between the total distance moved tdm in the outer zone of the test area i e closer to the edges and the tdm in the entire test area including the inner and outer zone the experiment began by dividing each well of a 24 well plate into two zones one internal and one external with equal areas individual 5 hour post fertilization hpf larvae were then placed in each well and a video camera was used to track their movements and positions within the wells the test lasted 10 minutes the lights were kept on for 0 6 minutes and then were turned off for 7 10 minutes the data was then collected to evaluate thigmotaxis behavior schnörr et al 2012 paredes zúñiga et al 2019 used a similar method to assess anxiety like behaviors in triadimefon exposed zebrafish mirror image stimulation mis is also often used to study zebrafish aggressive behavior similar to the other assays the device used to assess zebrafish aggressive behavior is illustrated in fig 1 exposed zebrafish were placed in a tank where a mirror was placed perpendicular to the horizontal plane one side of the mirror would overlap with the back edge of the tank and formed a 22 5 angle with the side of the tank the area near the tank was labeled close and the other area was labeled far the two areas represent the apparent distance between the fish and its reflection further to eliminate the influence of other environmental factors on the test results all of the other tank walls are typically covered with opaque partitions fontana et al 2016 michelotti et al 2018 during the test the movement of the zebrafish is tracked and analyzed using a video camera and aggressive behaviors including mirror biting frequency and duration time spent close to the mirror and time to bite the mirror are monitored and quantified moretz et al 2006 barbosa et al 2018 marks et al 2005 used the mis assay to detect aggressive behaviors in adult zebrafish when studying the influence of the developmental environment on phenotypic responses michelotti et al 2018 applied the mis test to study whether ketamine affects the aggressive behavior of adult zebrafish the authors found that low concentrations of this compound increased aggression towards the mirror whereas high concentrations reduce aggression these findings provide important insights into the effect of environmental contaminants such as ketamine on the occurrence of aggressive behaviors shoaling is another component of the behavioral repertoire of zebrafish which is often used to quantify social behavior miller and gerlai 2011 shoaling behavior can be assessed using a novel tank as described above the novel tank is divided into two equal parts upper and lower after which shoaling behavior is recorded for 6 minutes using a video camera on one side of the tank in the second half of the recording eight screenshots are taken every 20 seconds to measure the distance between each fish cm and calculate an average fig 1 pham et al 2012 grossman et al 2010 additionally shoaling behavior can also be used to assess stress or anxiety in zebrafish stressed fish tend to swim closer to their conspecifics whereas the opposite is true for more relaxed fish speedie and gerlai 2008 for example after acute treatment with the sedative drug ketamine the average number of zebrafish at the top of the tank and the average inter fish distance increased thus confirming the anti anxiety effects of ketamine riehl et al 2011 4 mechanisms of zebrafish behavior regulation the dynamic balance between acetylcholinesterase ache and dopamine da plays an indispensable role in maintaining the normal progress of nerve signals in the brain mennella et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 oxidative stress is a common mode of action for edcs to induce toxicity and this damage also exists in related neuronal cells for example when oxidative stress occurs in dopamine neurons da auto oxidizes to da quinone which can amplify oxidative damage signals juárez et al 2016 at the same time the abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species will lead to the decrease of acetylcholinesterase activity thus preventing acetylcholine from being eliminated in time and ultimately inducing neurotoxicity jeyarasasingam et al 2000 den hartog et al 2002 wyse et al 2004 additionally edcs may eventually lead to imbalances of dopamine acetylcholine homeostasis by reducing the activity of related proteins responsible for dopamine synthesis and transport e g tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter and causing the abnormal accumulation of dopamine between cells therefore this review will focus on the role of da ache and oxidative stress as targets and mechanisms of edc induced behavioral impairment in zebrafish fig 2 4 1 acetylcholinesterase acetylcholine ach is a cholinergic neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role as an excitatory transmitter in addition to its role as a sympathetic preganglionic transmitter and a parasympathetic preganglionic and postganglionic transmitter fulton et al 2010 and is thus an important driver of animal behavior and neurodevelopment ach was the first neurotransmitter to be discovered and its accumulation can affect the normal function of the nervous system colović et al 2013 payne et al 1996 kruse et al 2012 ache is among the key enzymes that regulate neurotransmitter uptake in organisms and is therefore widely used as a neurotoxic marker specifically this enzyme eliminates the influence of ach accumulation on the nervous system by hydrolyzing ach to choline and acetic acid thereby terminating the excitatory effect of neurotransmitters on the postsynaptic membrane to ensure the normal transmission of nerve signals in vivo soreq et al 2001 cheng and jiang 2020 toumi et al 2015 massoulié et al 1993 chen and yu 2012 furthermore this enzyme is expressed in many primary neurons of zebrafish embryos including motor and sensory neurons this is crucial for the development of neurons in zebrafish embryos and is intimately related to zebrafish behavior bertrand et al 2001 hanneman et al 2010 changes in ache activity and decreases in gene expression level affect the behavior of zebrafish which is manifested as increases in muscle activity loss of motor ability and anxiety like behaviors behra et al 2002 xiong et al 2019 jensen et al 1997 tilton et al 2011 vieira et al 2020 liu and zhang 2020 exposed zebrafish embryos to 0 10 100 and 1000 μg l of the fungicide propamocarb for 7 days to explore the effect of this compound on larval zebrafish behavior the authors tested the locomotor behavior of the larval zebrafish at 96 hpf and observed a decrease in the swimming speed distance traveled and swimming output when switching the lights on and off in the observation chamber these observations coincided with ache activity inhibition and downregulation of its mrna transcript levels it is speculated that the accumulation of ach in synapses is possibly due to the change of ache activity and transcription level similar to larval zebrafish the same phenomena have also been observed in adult zebrafish pullaguri et al 2020 demonstrated significant decreases in ache activity in both brain and skeletal muscle which resulted in changes in turn angle swimming distance speed and freezing behavior when adult zebrafish were exposed to 0 3 and 0 6 mg l of triclosan for 48 h moreover other studies have demonstrated that ache activity may be affected by oxidative stress dopamine and intracellular calcium concentration parlak et al 2018 greenfield 2005 4 2 dopamine da is synthesized from tyrosine wasel and freeman 2020 and is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system cns da is the main target of environmental pollutants and regulates many important neurological functions in the brain da regulates motor and emotional functions as well as learning memory and reward outside the brain da can also act on multiple organs and tissues and regulate hormone release to modulate blood pressure missale et al 1998 matt and gaskill 2020 liu and yu 2020 showed that after exposing female zebrafish to 5 50 and 500 mg l carbofuran for 48 h the transitions and time spent at the top of the tank were significantly reduced however erratic movements were increased and the increase of 5 and 50 mg l was more significant interestingly all of these changes coincided with a significant increase in da levels to demonstrate the role of da as one of the main mediators of anxiety like behaviors the authors added a tyrosine hydroxylase the rate limiting enzyme of da synthesis inhibitor and it was found that anxiety like behaviors were alleviated wang et al 2015 conducted a similar study and found that exposing zebrafish to 30 and 100 µg l polybrominated diphenyl ethers can significantly reduce da content and cause abnormal behavior average speed decreased significantly some researchers have li also reached the same conclusion i e a decrease in dopamine content leads to neurobehavioral disorders li et al 2020 da can transmit signals through dopamine receptors drs and drs play an important role in regulating dopaminergic neurotransmission there are currently five known subtypes of drs d1 d2 d3 d4 and d5 which in turn can be subdivided into two types d1 like receptors and d2 like receptors both of which are g protein coupled receptors kebabian and calne 1979 when excited the former activates the adenylate cyclase in contrast the latter inhibits adenylate cyclase missale et al 1998 recent studies have linked the mrna expression level of drs e g dopamine transporter dopamine d1 receptor dopamine receptor d2a and dopamine d3 receptor with zebrafish behavior liu et al 2021 for example yu et al 2021 exposed adult zebrafish to 0 3 30 and 300 µg l of tetrabromobisphenol for 42 days after which their embryos were analyzed the authors found that the locomotor behavior da level and mrna transcript levels of the da receptor related genes drd2b and drd3 in the larvae in the high concentration group 300 µg l were all significantly reduced tu et al 2020 assessed the effect of tbt 500 ng l exposure on the occurrence of anxiety like behaviors by quantifying the time that adult zebrafish spent on the bottom of their aquarium decreased transcript levels of mrna encoding d2 receptors drd2a and drd2b in adult fish brains indicated reduced dopamine transmission signaling in the brain and these changes coincided with an increase in anxious behavior which greatly suggested the involvement of the da neurotransmitter system in changes in anxious behavior other studies have demonstrated that dopamine and its receptors are also involved in the regulation of zebrafish bone metabolism and have important regulatory effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts bones are key components of the locomotor system and therefore da plays a critical role in the swimming performance of zebrafish lee et al 2015 4 3 oxidative stress oxidative stress is another important aspect of toxicology research cheng and zhang 2020 which causes an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species ros and the ability of antioxidant enzymes to remove them currently the assessment of antioxidant indices in zebrafish typically entails the determination of antioxidant enzyme activity ros level and lipid peroxidation goncalves et al 2020 superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione peroxidase are the main antioxidant enzymes that are monitored to assess antioxidant activity due to their crucial role in combating the harmful effects caused by excessive ros production yang and lee 2015 jin et al 2010 regarding the determination of antioxidant enzyme activity although some studies reported inhibitions in the level of the antioxidant enzymes upon edc exposure zhang and zhou 2018 yan et al 2016 shukla et al 2017 other studies found that edcs did not inhibit enzyme activity but instead enhance it faria et al 2021 nunes et al 2017 the reason for this reaction may be that short term exposure activates the antioxidant defense system of biological leading to an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes thereby triggering an adaptive response moreover molecular studies also have shown contradictory results jiang et al 2015 mukhopadhyay et al 2015 ros accumulation can interfere with a variety of functions of the nervous system including nerve growth and regeneration neuron survival differentiation synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission salim 2017 the occurrence of oxidative stress in the body also has a crucial impact on behavioral impairment salahinejad et al 2021 found that oxidative stress is closely related to anxiety associated behaviors in humans and animals adult zebrafish that were exposed to bisphenol s bps for 75 days remained at the bottom of the novel tank for shorter periods furthermore the time spent above the centerline and fear related behavior indices triggered by external stimuli alarm cues were used to evaluate anxiety and fear behaviors the results indicated that long term bps exposure decreased the indexes related to anxiety and fear in adult zebrafish as well as the transcriptional levels of genes related to oxidative stress several studies have concluded that oxidative stress may affect zebrafish behavior by altering ache activity and the da system den hartog et al 2002 wyse et al 2004 pullaguri et al 2020 both of these are important targets of neurotoxic chemicals da is an essential source of free radicals and oxidative stress jones and miller 2008 but whose integrity could be influenced by oxidative stress meiser et al 2013 juárez olguín et al 2016 additionally oxidative stress can also reduce the response and defense capabilities of cells leading to energy homeostasis imbalances espinosa ruiz et al 2019 which has an impact on neural development zielonka et al 2019 and is closely related to zebrafish behavior abe et al 2018 5 effect of single edcs on zebrafish behavior 5 1 bisphenols bisphenol a bpa a plastic synthetic material is an important derivative of phenol and acetone that was discovered in the 1950s and has since been widely used in the production of epoxy resin and polycarbonate materials ben jonathan and hugo 2016 bpa can enter the human body through different routes such as the digestive tract and respiratory tract damaging the human reproductive system and immune system and causing neuroendocrine system disorders santoro et al 2019 segovia mendoza et al 2020 ma et al 2019 most countries and organizations worldwide are restricting the use of bpa and actively promote bpa alternatives niu et al 2017 many bpa substitutes such as bisphenol f bpf and bps have been developed however they have been found to exert toxic effects comparable to those of bpa many studies have reported that bisphenol affects zebrafish behavior potentially by affecting the expression of genes associated with nervous system function oxidative damage and cell apoptosis gyimah et al 2021 conducted bpa bps acute exposure experiments to demonstrate that bpa bps exposure had obvious neurobehavioral effects on zebrafish which is specifically manifested as an increased activity frequency mania frequency mania time and activity time in zebrafish the abnormal locomotor behavior of zebrafish may be related to the influence of bpa bps on its neurodevelopment and central nervous system gu et al 2020 discussed the effect of bpf on zebrafish neurotoxicity and the molecular mechanisms of its toxicity the experimental results showed that bpf treatment significantly reduced the expression of neurodevelopment related genes syn2a elavl3 gfap and mbp additionally bpf treatment increased the levels of brain oxidative stress and activated nerve cell apoptosis in zebrafish larvae similar studies have also found that the changes in locomotor behavior of zebrafish were related to the concentration of bisphenol and its exposure time sun and juan juan 2016 wang et al 2013 demonstrated that 1 15 μmol l bpa caused significant changes in spontaneous locomotion and free swimming speed by inducing axial muscle tissue damage and disrupting the axonal growth of primary and secondary motor neurons in zebrafish 5 2 organophosphorus and organochlorine pesticides pesticides play an important role in promoting the development of agriculture however the frequent and irrational use of pesticides has led to widespread pesticide pollution huang et al 2020 many studies have reported the adverse effects of these pesticide residues on living organisms including the behavioral changes and neurotoxicity in zebrafish 5 2 1 organophosphorus pesticides organophosphorus pesticides ops are among the most important agricultural insecticides and have played a historical role in the development of agriculture worldwide soares et al 2019 ops inhibit the activity of ache thus hampering the ability of this enzyme to hydrolyze ach this in turn results in an overwhelming accumulation of neurotransmitters in the synapses overexcitation of the cns and cholinergic nerves and finally death carlson 1997 due to their high efficiency and low price these compounds are widely used in agriculture forestry fisheries and even in the household particularly chlorpyrifos cpf and dichlorvos shaffo et al 2018 ding et al 2019 many studies have reported the adverse effects of op residues on living organisms including behavioral changes and neurotoxicity in zebrafish in zebrafish cpf affects the expression of nervous system related genes such as elavl3 gap43 gfap and mbp among others sun and xu 2016 as well as ache activity including transcriptional level jeon et al 2016 and dopamine and serotonin levels aragon et al 2017 tufi et al 2016 all of which are known to affect behavior levin et al 2004 found that early exposure of zebrafish embryos to 100 ng ml cpf significantly affected early swimming after hatching early cpf exposure likely affects the nervous system of embryonic zebrafish which further leads to cognitive impairment and causes abnormal behaviors other ops e g dichlorvos malathion have also been found to exert similar effects to those described above exposing zebrafish embryos to 0 1 5 and 10 mg l dichlorvos for 7 and 14 d significantly reduced the body length and heart rate the surface area of the eyes the swimming distance and swimming speed and the avoidance ability of larvae this means that exposure to organophosphorus compounds in the early stages of development will lead to increased susceptibility to behavioral and neuronal changes that may be associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases altenhofen et al 2019 5 2 2 organochlorine pesticides organochlorine pesticides have a longer history than ops and are widely used due to their good insecticidal effects however their half lives are extremely long and their accumulation can lead to severe and persistent effects on environmental and human health guida et al 2021 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt is a non decomposable and commonly used organochlorine pesticide the evaluation of ddt toxicity has so far primarily focused on early developmental exposure abreu villaca and levin 2017 tiedeken and ramsdell 2009 found that ddt increased the sensitivity of zebrafish embryos to seizure inducing drugs pentylenetetrazol and domoic acid the specific mechanism of this phenomenon is the spatial interaction between ddt and voltage gated sodium channel inactivation the inhibition of channel inactivation leads to sodium ion leakage which leads to excessive nerve excitement and repetitive discharge this eventually leads to more severe seizures and head shaking behavior regarding adult zebrafish hawkey et al 2020 exposed 6 to 8 month old zebrafish to ddt for a week and found that their locomotor behavior decreased whereas anxiety shallow water seeking behavior and predator avoidance increased additionally it was found that ddt and cpf produced quite different behavioral changes with ddt being more associated with aversive symptoms such as hypoactivity or increased stress response and cpf being more associated with inhibitory symptoms such as boldness enhanced social approach hyperactivity and reduced persistent avoidance this suggests that different pesticides may be act on different molecular targets in zebrafish and therefore result in different behavioral changes in zebrafish 5 3 flame retardants flame retardants are a type of chemicals used to improve the combustion performance of materials which are widely used to treat various decorative materials and furniture nosaka et al 2020 this review will focus on two typical flame retardants a phosphate ester flame retardant triphenyl phosphate tpp a phosphorus flame retardant and an organic chloride flame retardant dechlorane plus dp a halogen flame retardant 5 3 1 triphenyl phosphate the demand and output of tpp a type of organic phosphate flame retardant are consistently increasing each year liu et al 2016 in most commercial products tpp is used as an additive and does not covalently bind to other materials therefore this compound can be easily released into the surrounding environment throughout the entire lifetime of the products van der veen and de boer 2012 further recent research has demonstrated the adverse effects of tpp on zebrafish neurobehavior anderson et al 2004 ni et al 2007 dishaw et al 2014 tao et al 2016 exposed 120 h zebrafish embryos to various concentrations of tpp and found that the swimming speed of the larvae increased in the 5 µg l treatment group but significantly decreased in the high concentration 625 µg l treatment group further tpp exposed zebrafish embryos exhibited behavioral abnormalities when examined using a light dark alternation experiment which coincided with lower levels of the neurodevelopment related genes gap43 and a1 tubulin as well as a reduction in ache activity together these findings suggest that these changes in motor behavior may be related to the transcription levels of neurodevelopment related genes and changes in ache activity after tpp exposure 5 3 2 dechlorane plus dp is another commonly used chlorinated flame retardant additive due to its good flame retardant properties it is widely used in plastics electrical wires connectors in computers and other products wang et al 2016 wang and jia 2020 previous studies have shown that dp severely impairs zebrafish behavior chen et al 2017 exposed zebrafish embryos to 15 30 and 60 µg l of dp and found that their spontaneous movement and touch response swimming behavior and light dark transition movement were significantly affected which coincided with motor axon inhibition oxidative stress and an increase in the transcription levels of apoptosis associated genes bax and caspase 3 it is speculated that dp inhibited the growth of primary neuron axons which in turn was caused by accelerated tail cell apoptosis in recent years studies have reported that dp can affect the level of thyroid hormone and intracellular ca2 signals kang al 2016 chen and chen 2019 both of which are closely related to the development of the nervous system and the regulation of nerve cell function gomez and spitzer 1999 huang et al 2010 5 4 phthalates paes are often used as plasticizers to enhance the softness and elasticity of polyvinyl chloride products akkbik et al 2020 paes have been widely used in daily life and industrial and agricultural production remarkably pae exposure affected the neurobehavior of fetuses at 26 weeks of pregnancy yolton et al 2011 a study of children s intelligence revealed a negative correlation between the level of phthalates in their urine and their iq cho et al 2010 some current studies have shown that pae exposure may induce neurobehavioral changes in zebrafish qian et al 2020 reported that paes may inhibit the skeletal development of juvenile zebrafish thus affecting zebrafish behavior when zebrafish embryos were exposed to 6 types of paes diethyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate di n butyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and di n octyl phthalate until 7 days post fertilization their autokinetic movement decreased at 24 hpf and different degrees of curved spine appeared at 96 hpf which coincided with downregulation of skeletal development related genes runx2b and gpc4a at 144 hpf pu et al 2020 5 5 nonylphenol nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ester is often used as a cleaning product and ultimately finds its way to aquatic ecosystems through sewage from industrial and urban sewage treatment plants nonylphenol np is another typical edc and therefore also affects zebrafish behavior fraser et al 2017 exposed zebrafish embryos to np for 96 h and the distance traveled and activity time of larval zebrafish changed when evaluated using the light dark test chandrasekar et al 2011 exposed zebrafish embryos to np and found that a low concentration treatment 2 µm affected the motor ability of larval zebrafish and swimming behavior decreased moreover 24 hpf zebrafish embryos exhibited notochord distortion and hernia formation which was attributed to apoptosis in the notochord and resulted in notochord muscle and motor neuron defects the notochord plays a crucial role in the differentiation of muscle and nerve cells which might explain the decreased motor ability and abnormal swimming behavior of the larval zebrafish in addition to locomotor behavior np also affects other behaviors of zebrafish xia et al 2010 found that a high concentration 100 g l of np could significantly inhibit the activity and group preference of zebrafish moreover in the bite mirror stimulation experiment there was a significant decrease in the aggressive behavior of male and female zebrafish in the high concentration group whereas the low concentration groups 1 and 10 g l exhibited increases in these behaviors 6 effects of edc mixtures on zebrafish behavior edcs always occur in the form of complex mixtures in the environment and therefore aquatic organisms are generally exposed to edc mixtures rather than single compounds fig 3 thus evaluating the effects of edc mixtures on zebrafish neurobehavior provides a much more realistic assessment of the effects of environmental edc exposure synergistic effects on swimming behavior inhibition of proneural gene expression and oxidative stress were observed when larval zebrafish were co exposed to permethrin and cypermethrin yang et al 2014 the locomotor behavior and learning ability of larval zebrafish were also more markedly affected by cpf and deltamethrin co exposure than single exposure hu et al 2020 nevertheless edc mixtures do not always have synergistic toxic effects in zebrafish edcs with similar or different modes of action may also have antagonistic effects on humans and wildlife rivollier et al 2019 beyer et al 2014 liu et al 2018 found that a low concentration of tdt a mixture of triclosan 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and 2 4 dichlorophenol at 0 28 mg l promoted the swimming behavior of zebrafish whereas high concentrations 0 56 and 1 12 mg l decreased this change jijie et al 2020 found that toxic metals cadmium and nickel alleviated the inhibitory effect of deltamethrin on the swimming distance and speed of zebrafish additionally mixed exposure to these three substances decreased the swimming speed of zebrafish when they approached the water surface however the combined effects of edc are not well understood as the number of related studies is extremely limited therefore exploring the toxic effects of edc mixtures on zebrafish is of great significance 7 conclusion and outlook edcs are widely detected in aquatic environments and therefore fish and other aquatic organisms are particularly vulnerable to these toxic compounds edcs possess varying degrees of neurotoxicity and can therefore affect a wide range of zebrafish behaviors including locomotor activity anxiety memory and shoaling behavior however most current studies have exclusively focused on the influence of edc on zebrafish behavior and therefore additional studies are required to determine the mechanisms by which edcs interfere with zebrafish behavior particularly at the molecular and signaling pathway levels edcs have different effects on the behavior of zebrafish at different developmental stages larval zebrafish are particularly sensitive to environmental insult and their behavior changes more significantly in response to toxicant exposure therefore behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae could be used as biomarkers to accelerate the screening and identification of environmental contaminants particularly neurodevelopmental toxicants currently a growing number of clinical and epidemiological studies have linked exposure to neurotoxic chemicals with behavioral alteration nevertheless the in vivo evaluation of developmental neurotoxicity endpoints using mammalian models such as rodents is difficult costly and time intensive the zebrafish has thus become an efficient and versatile environmental toxicology model organism with an irreplaceable position in the evaluation of the toxicity mechanisms of environmental chemicals due to its rapid life cycle and small size therefore we believe that zebrafish behavioral models will lead to important breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of modern diseases declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16448,untreated combined sewage bypass is often discharged by wastewater treatment plants to receiving rivers during stormwater events where it may contribute to increased levels of antibiotic resistance genes args and multi resistance risk factors multi resistant bacteria and multi resistance genomic determinants mgds in the receiving water other contamination sources such as soil runoff and resuspended river sediment could also play a role during stormwater events here we report on stormwater event based sampling campaigns to determine temporal dynamics of args and multi resistance risk factors in bypass treated effluent and the receiving river as well as complimentary data on catchment soils and surface sediments both indicator args qpcr and resistome arg profiles revealed by metagenomics indicated bypass as the main contributor to the increased levels of args in the river during stormwater events furthermore we showed for the first time that the risk of exposure to bypass borne multi resistance risk factors increase under stormwater events and that many of these mgds were plasmid associated and thus potentially mobile in addition elevated resistance risk factors persisted for some time up to 22 h in the receiving water after stormwater events likely due to inputs from distributed overflows in the catchment this indicates temporal dynamics should be considered when interpreting the risks of exposure to resistance from event based contamination we propose that reducing bypass from wastewater treatment plants may be an important intervention option for reducing dissemination of antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antimicrobial resistance stormwater events wastewater bypass metagenomics river 1 introduction antibiotic resistance has been considered one of the biggest challenges to public health and its global increase has been recognized as an impending public health crisis by intergovernmental entities antibiotic resistance genes args and bacteria are transmitted not only via direct human to human interaction but also via multi sectoral routes such as interdependent routes among humans food animals and environments mcewen and collignon 2018 as examples args and bacteria are enriched in reservoirs such as human patients hospitals and livestock sometimes driven by antibiotic overuse mcewen and collignon 2018 args and bacteria can subsequently be transmitted to environments via sewage hospital wastewaters farm runoff manure etc humans and animals may be exposed to these environmental args and bacteria mcewen and collignon 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are a known route through which sewage borne resistance genes are discharged into the environment bürgmann et al 2018 rizzo et al 2013 even though many studies showed that the level genes per volume or absolute abundance of args decreases during wastewater treatment processes ju et al 2019 marano et al 2020 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 profound levels of args remain in treated effluents lee et al 2021 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 for instance the levels of common args and bacteria in treated effluents are significantly higher than upstream waters by up to 2 order of magnitude lee et al 2021 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 sabri et al 2018 accordingly the levels of args and bacteria at receiving waters increase after receiving effluents lee et al 2021 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 even though the exact degree of increase depends on the proportion of effluent discharge to river discharge lee et al 2021 ort and siegrist 2009 the abovementioned studies have generally been conducted under conditions of normal wwtp operation however many sewer systems or wwtps will regularly experience high flow events caused by high intensity precipitation if such flows exceed the capacity of the wwtp or sewer system it may lead to wastewater bypass the release of untreated combined sewage into receiving waters weyrauch et al 2010 during stormwater events the level of args in wastewater receiving waters can increase due to the input of wastewater bypass but high volume flows from precipitation may reduce or compensate this effect resistance levels may also increase during stormwater events due to inputs from other non point sources soil runoff from river catchment and sediment resuspension are considered as potential non point sources under stormwater events tsihrintzis and hamid 1997 storm drains and urban runoff baral et al 2018 may represent temporary point sources at various points in a catchment however bypass is expected to contain the highest abundance of resistance determinants args and resistant bacteria and multi resistance risk factors multi resistant bacteria and multi resistance genomic determinants mgds because untreated sewage contains resistance determinants ju et al 2019 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 and multi resistant bacteria at considerably higher levels than treated effluent czekalski et al 2012 the potential combined effects of different contributors on receiving waters during stormwater events were investigated in the stroubles creek virginia usa by monitoring surface water qualities garner et al 2017 two other studies monitored combined sewage overflows and the receiving surface waters noted elevated levels of args in the receiving waters during stormwater events in the hudson river raritan bay and passaic river usa eramo et al 2017 and north shore channel usa chaudhary et al 2018 in a study performed in the antelope creek in lincoln nebraska usa baral et al 2018 that does not receive wastewater the authors found that discharges from storm drains had the strongest impact on the riverine resistome total args identified using shot gun sequencing compared to impacts from potential sewage leakage street sweepings soils and sediments while wastewater receiving river waters have been studied quite intensively so far there have thus been comparatively few studies systemically examining the combined effects among potential contamination sources for instance the contribution of bypass has not been systematically compared with other potential sources i e treated effluent surface soil runoff and sediment resuspension thus whether those other sources also contribute significantly to the increase of riverine args or not remains unanswered furthermore the potential existence of bypass borne multi resistance risk factors in the river has not been known in this study we investigated the effect of stormwater events leading to bypass discharge on a highly wastewater impacted river the river murg near the wwtp münchwilen switzerland the main goals of this study were 1 to assess the impact of stormwater related disturbance and resilience of the resistome of the murg river by monitoring temporal dynamics of the resistome during stormwater events that lead to combined sewage bypass 2 to identify the key source s which contribute the most to the increase of riverine resistance levels and 3 to assess the impact of stormwater events in terms of multi resistance risk factors we used various molecular biological microbiological and ecological parameters to identify the key factor among different pollution sources those parameters include absolute and relative abundance of well known anthropogenic antibiotic resistance markers sul1 and inti1 by quantitative pcr qpcr and alpha and beta diversity analysis of the resistome based on environmental shotgun metagenomics this approach was motivated by the hypothesis that different sources would be distinguishable by the different relative abundance and or the composition and diversity of resistance indicators to analyze multi resistance risk factors we used metagenome assembled contigs and heterotrophic cultivation presumptive multi resistant bacteria and mgds which are defined as contigs where 2 args conferring resistance to different antibiotic classes are co located in this study the underlying hypothesis was that untreated combined sewage bypass is more likely to contain high levels of multi resistance risk factors and thus their abundance might increase in receiving waters during stormwater events 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and samplings samples were obtained from the river murg near münchwilen thurgau in switzerland which is one of the most wastewater impacted rivers in switzerland this site was well studied under dry flow condition in 2018 lee et al 2021 and has the following characteristics 1 wastewater effluents comprises a high proportion of the downstream river discharge 33 0 38 0 under base flow condition 2 under baseflow conditions no other known point source of wastewater inputs exist other than studied wwtp 3 all potential combined sewer overflows into the river are from the sewer system that connects to the studied wwtp other than the sampled bypass which is discharged near the wwtp fig 1 left there are additional upstream points where combined sewage may be discharged the nearest one is located 800 m and the farthest one 11 0 km upstream of the wwtp h zbinden personal communication to authors and unpublished sewer planning document june 29 2021 4 the wwtp receives combined sewage community sewage storm drain during stormwater events and the bypass untreated combined sewage is discharged after primary sedimentation to the receiving river when the treatment and rainwater storage capacity of the wwtp is exceeded during heavy rainfall 5 the river catchment is widely utilized as agricultural area pasture and meadow for livestock farms bfs 2013 coordinates and key information on the sampling sites as well as information on the wwtp münchwilen are summarized in dataset s1 on june 25 dry1 and august 27 dry2 in 2019 water samples were obtained under base flow condition no precipitation in the previous 24 h over 24 h in hourly 1 l batches using autosamplers isco usa installed at three sampling points river murg 200 m upstream us and 500 m downstream ds of the wastewater discharge point and from effluent ef prior to discharge water samples were cooled with ice and cooling packs inside the autosamplers surface soils and sediments 5 cm from the river catchment were obtained in a separate campaign under base flow condition on may 28 2019 dry0 as shown in fig 1 right two soil samples each were obtained from forests f1 2 meadows m1 2 and pastures p1 2 river sediments were sampled once at the ds and us locations and at two sites m1 2 further upstream 0 45 and 1 0 km both surface soil and sediment samples were obtained by subsampling and pooling 5 subsamples from each location into sterile containers on site event based sampling campaigns were carried out over the summer of 2019 weather forecasts provided by meteoswiss for the münchwilen region were monitored from july to september 2020 when heavy rainfall was predicted for the catchment area of the murg autosamplers were deployed in the same way as described for base flow sampling for us ds and ef sites an additional autosampler was installed at the wastewater bypass line bp of the wwtp prior to discharge fig 1 left two event based sampling campaigns were eventually performed on august 12 13 13 00 12 00 and september 23 01 00 24 00 2019 when there was a total of 10 5 and 20 0 mm of precipitation during 48 h 24 h on the sampling date plus the previous 24 h refer to fig s1 meteoswiss 2019 during these events bp could only be sampled when there was sufficient bypass flow while the autosampler was operating only 2 samples at 13 00 aug 12 and 12 00 aug 13 could be obtained for ef in rain1 because of a malfunction of the autosampler between14 00 aug 12 11 00 aug 13 all samples were cooled at 4 c in the dark while being transported to the laboratory within 32 h from the starting time of auto samplings 2 2 sample pooling strategy for dry1 and dry2 sampling campaigns upon arrival at the laboratory hourly water samples were pooled over 6 consecutive hours to produce 4 samples for further analysis morning mor 06 00 11 00 afternoon aft 12 00 17 00 evening eve 18 00 23 00 and night nig 24 00 05 00 for every sample type us ds ef exceptions were made for mor and nig samples in dry1 ef where we could not obtain samples during 01 00 07 00 due to too low water levels in the outflow table s1 for rain1 and rain2 sampling campaigns equal volumes of hourly water samples each 1 0 l were pooled from time intervals before during between and or after stormwater events for 2 7 consecutive hours as shown in table s1 those pooled samples were stored at 4 c in the dark and further analysis cultivation and biomass filtration was performed the next day after 16 h the information on bp flow condition and sample pooling was encoded into the sample labeling scheme which denotes samples as bp or no bp nbp depending on bp flow at the time of sampling the sampling times of pooled samples is also given for example bp 2 8 9 h denotes the second sample taken during active bypass flow and is a composite sample taken after 8 and 9 h from the start all sample designations are listed in table s1 2 2 heterotrophic plate counts colony counts of presumptive clarithromycin and tetracycline resistant bacteria clr tet was shown to be an useful indicator for anthropogenic resistance inputs in our previous studies czekalski et al 2012 lee et al 2021 the clr tet colonies were cultivated for water samples using biomass concentrated on 0 2 µm pore size cellulose nitrate filters followed by incubation on r2a agar plates in the presence of clarithromycin 4 0 mg l and tetracycline 16 0 mg l as outlined in our previous publications czekalski et al 2012 lee et al 2021 samples were diluted before filtration using 0 85 nacl according to the previously optimized ranges 10 ml loading volumes of 10 3 10 1 diluted samples lee et al 2021 contamination controls using a blank solution sterile 0 85 nacl were performed for each sampling campaign and no growth of colonies was confirmed technical triplicates were incubated for each sample and standard errors of triplicates are shown as error bars 2 3 biomass filtration dna extraction and quantitative pcr to obtain concentrated suspended biomass for dna extraction water samples were filtered through a sterilized 0 2 µm pore size cellulose nitrate filter sartorius germany using autoclaved nalgene filter units thermo fisher scientific usa the maximum filtration volume was up to 1 0 l for river waters 0 5 l for ef and 0 1 l for bypass but the exact volume varied by sample because filters were clogged at different volumes dataset s2 after biomass filtration the filters were stored at 20 c until processing for dna extraction soil and sediment samples were frozen immediately after arrival at the laboratory and stored at 20 c until processed further for dna extraction dna extraction was performed using dneasy powerwater kit qiagen germany for water samples and dneasy powermax soil kit qiagen germany for soils and sediments according to the manufacturer s instruction after extraction dna quality indicators 260 280 and 260 230 absorbance ratios were checked using nanodrop one spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa and concentrations were analyzed using both nanodrop and qubit dsdna br assay kit thermo fisher scientific usa dataset s2 the extracted dna samples were stored at 20 c until analyzed qpcr targeting two resistance indicators sul1 and inti1 and the 16s rrna gene were performed as outlined in our previous studies czekalski et al 2014 ju et al 2019 lee et al 2021 the two resistance indicator genes sul1 and inti1 used in our study are two of the most widely used genetic markers for tracking anthropogenic sources of resistance berendonk et al 2015 gillings et al 2015 the analysis was performed using lightcycler 480 probes master kit roche switzerland on a lightcycler 480 ii roche switzerland primers are given in table s2 and key information for qpcr validation is given in table s3 standards were run in quintuplicates samples in triplicate measurements with cp values above negative controls but below the limit of detection lod average cp of lowest valid standard or which had a standard deviation of cp values of triplicates 0 5 were not quantified and labeled as detected but not quantifiable d n q samples without valid cp or with average cp values smallest cp value from the non template controls were indicated as not detected n d standard errors of triplicate measurements are displayed as error bars in the figures to calculate absolute abundances from qpcr results we calculated the total number of gene copies per biomass filter and normalized by filtration volumes for water samples copies per volume for soils and sediments the total copies measured in wet mass were normalized to dry mass copies per g dried soils or sediments the dry mass of soils and sediments was determined according to standard methods apha awwa wpcf 1981 2 4 shotgun metagenomic sequencing and downstream data analysis the following dna samples were selected for shotgun metagenomics sequencing 1 6 samples from two dry samplings the same dna mass ng of different time points mor aft eve nig were pooled together for each location 3 locations us ef ds from each campaign

metagenomics libraries is given in dataset s3 in addition to our own samples raw metagenome reads of soils from two other studies grazed and ungrazed grassland soils from sinkiang inner mongolia in china compost amended and non amended greenhouse soils from microcosm experiments in virginia usa were downloaded from the sequence read archive sra chen et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 and subjected to bioinformatics analysis dataset s3 by comparing with this data we expected to draw more general conclusion e g by ruling out whether or not the chance that the soil resistome from other regions with similar or different land usages could be similar to the resistome of stormwater disturbed waters the selected dna samples from our study were sequenced using the illumina novaseq6000 with a paired end 2 150 strategy by novogene europe cambridge uk the reads containing adapters and low quality reads n 10 and quality score 5 were removed by novogene and the read qualities were double checked by the authors using fastqc v0 11 4 andrews 2010 for resistome analysis we used a read based annotation approach because assembly efficiencies percentage aligned sequences calculated using eq 1 were relatively low for soil and sediment samples as a result resistance gene profiles could not be properly represented using the de novo assembly based annotation approach used in our previous publication lee et al 2021 fig s4 1 assembly efficiency i 1 n c o n t i g l e n g t h s i a v e r a g e c o v e r a g e i t o t a l m e t a g e n o m e r e a d b a s e s i n a s a m p l e 100 where n denotes the total number of assembled contigs in a sample and average coverage indicates the average sequencing depths per contig calculated according to albertsen et al 2013 read based arg annotation was performed using deeparg short reads pipeline v1 0 2 with default parameters this pipeline was developed to process short reads and to find and annotate resistance genes using a deep learning algorithm after incorporating several arg databases publicly available arango argoty et al 2018 in short this pipeline finds and quantifies arg like and 16s rrna gene like reads and normalizes the reads assigned to args to 16s rrna gene like reads arango argoty et al 2018 both our samples and downloaded metagenomes from sra were analyzed using this approach in water samples only where assembly efficiencies were relatively high 51 0 a de novo assembly based approach was used for the limited purpose of analyzing mgds we followed the work flow described in our previous publications ju et al 2019 lee et al 2021 a short summary of the bioinformatics work flow is also suggested in the supporting information si identification of args was based on two published databases card v3 1 0 protein homolog model alcock et al 2020 for args and integrall v1 2 moura et al 2009 for inti1 2 5 analysis of multi resistance genomic determinants in order to list up mgds all contigs containing 2 args that confer resistance to different classes of antibiotics were sub selected dataset s6 for defining resistance classes we strictly followed the classification of antibiotics shown in card v3 1 0 the occurrence of mgds was quantitatively assessed in terms of the relative abundance defined as follows in this study eq 2 2 relative abundance of total mgds i 1 m c o v m g d i j 1 n c o v c o n t i g j where c o v m g d indicates the average coverage of a mgd c o v c o n t i g denotes the average coverage of a contig m n indicate the total number of mgds and contigs respectively in a sample the args physically co located within mgds were further visualized in a directed network using r igraph the network analysis was performed using an adjacency matrix produced from two vertices two co located args and an edge co occurrence frequency the edge information was produced according to the following equation eq 3 a the mgds containing arg a in all samples b the mgds containing arg b in all samples 3 e arg a arg b n a b n a a detailed example of the derivation process for edges is given in the si we tried to assign taxonomy to mgds using kraken2 wood et al 2019 kaiju v1 7 2 menzel et al 2016 and blast against ncbi nt database sayers et al 2019 as outlined in our previous publication lee et al 2021 in short we considered the assigned taxonomy as a valid information only if all three approaches yielded a consensus classification at genus level 2 6 statistical analysis and visualization all statistics and graphs were produced using r the shannon index was used as a parameter for alpha diversity and calculated using vegan oksanen et al 2013 the dissimilarity of resistome among metagenome samples beta diversity analysis were analyzed using non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds in vegan pairwise t test p adjustment method benjamini hochberg was performed to test for significant differences among potential contamination sources wastewaters surface sediments soils in terms of alpha diversity index 3 results 3 1 absolute abundance of resistance indicators sul1 inti1 and clr tet in waters two sampling campaigns performed under dry weather baseflow conditions were used to establish reference values for resistance indicator levels in us ds and ef under normal operation as shown by horizontal lines in fig 2 the results from these campaigns also showed the expected elevated absolute and relative abundance of resistance indicators in ef and the expected general increase of the abundance in ds compared to us as a result of ef discharge we observed little intra day variability figs s3 and s5 analysis of the resistance indicators in water samples from stormwater event based sampling revealed that bp contained high levels of resistance even higher than ef p 0 01 kruskal wallis test fig s2 specifically the levels of sul1 inti1 and clr tet in bp were higher than in ef by up to 2 1 orders of magnitude fig 2 accordingly the levels of those indicators in up and downstream water of the receiving river us and ds also increased when bypass flow was active the levels of indicators in both us and ds during bypass events bp in rain1 2 peri in fig s3 were significantly higher than the reference mor nig in dry1 2 pre in fig s3 levels p 0 01 kruskal wallis and the post hoc dunn s test in most cases one exception occurred for inti1 in us where the difference between pre and peri groups was not statistically significant p 0 14 it is important to note that we learned from the operators after the campaign that the us sampling point also receives combined sewage overflows from discharge points further upstream the levels of sul1 inti1 and clr tet in us and ds were highest during bypass flow events bp 1 in rain1 and bp 3 in rain2 the peak levels in bypass affected ds samples exceeded the ds levels at dry conditions by up to 2 4 orders of magnitude and even exceeded the levels in ef this indicates that aquatic riverine resistance at receiving points was profoundly influenced by bypass from wwtp and upstream points of discharge during bypass events in contrast levels in ef were not affected or increased only slightly during or after the bypass event fig 2 the levels of clr tet in ef at rain2 was higher than for baseflow conditions dry p 0 0008 kruskal wallis test n 8 for each of dry ef and rain2 ef however this was also the case for the ef sample at nbp 1 3 h and ds levels from this campaign thus probably reflecting a change in the effluent not related to the bypass event fig 2 we observed that elevated levels of resistance indicators at us and ds temporarily persisted for some time after bp flow had stopped fig 2 the levels returned to the pre disturbance status the levels at dry only after 17 22 h in rain1 the temporal persistence of resistance was even more profound in the campaign rain2 when there were heavier rains the levels of sul1 inti1 and clr tet at us and ds were still higher by up to 1 0 order of magnitude compared to the pre disturbance status the levels at dry 13 h after the last bypass event bp 3 10 11 h for most samples the ds levels of resistance indicators were above the us level except for inti1 and sul1 levels during rain2 nbp 15 17 h sample showing a persistent effect of the wwtp ef and bp notably however the us levels increased as well especially during rain2 while the existence of further combined sewage discharge points upstream may explain this observation we could not a priori rule out the possibility of other contributions sediment resuspension and surface soil runoffs in order to quantitatively assess the potential contributions of different sources we analyzed relative abundances of resistance indicator genes in the water samples and potential sources bypass effluent sediment and soil by normalizing to 16s rrna gene levels 3 2 relative abundance of sul1 and inti1 in waters soils and sediments relative abundance gene copies per 16s rrna gene copy of sul1 and inti1 at us and ds increased dramatically during bypass events bp 1 in rain1 and bp 1 to 3 in rain2 fig 3 similar to the pattern that we observed in absolute abundance analysis the increased relative abundance also temporarily persisted in receiving waters and gradually decreased over time fig 3 the abundance of sul1 and inti1 was below the lod d n q or n d for most soil samples where it could be determined the relative abundance of these indicators in soil was far below the values for water samples fig 3 the sediment samples showed higher values compared to soils especially for the sediment obtained from ds however all relative abundances determined for sediment were lower than in river water with exception of sul1 in us in some pre and post bypass samples nbp 3 5 h to nbp 24 h in rain1 and nbp 1 3 h in rain2 fig 3 m01 43 in dataset s3 to broaden the dataset for soil 19 published soil metagenomes were downloaded from ncbi sra we analyzed the arg content using a read based approach see dataset s3 for key information on raw reads alpha and beta diversity analysis of resistomes was performed using relative abundance data of arg identified at resistance subtype level dataset s4 anova and the post hoc pairwise t test of shannon diversity index values of the retrieved resistomes from the three potential contamination sources in the river murg catchment wastewater sediments and soils ch revealed that the shannon index of wastewater resistomes was significantly higher than of soil or sediment fig 4 a the shannon index values of soil resistomes from other studies soils cn and soils usa were similar to or lower than for soils ch the two highest shannon index values in us and ds were observed during and right after bypass discharges bp 3 and nbp 12 14 h in rain2 for us bp 3 in rain2 and bp 1 in rain1 for ds which were higher than sediments and soils beta diversity analysis of arg subtypes using nmds based on bray curtis distance stress 7 49 showed that dissimilarities between resistomes of water and other compartments were profound fig 4b water samples clustered together mostly in the 2nd and 3rd quadrants on the ordination plot and soils were mostly located in the 1st and 4th quadrants of the plot the dissimilarities between sediments and water resistomes especially for us samples were low compared to those between the soils and water but still clearly distinct from highly stormwater influenced river water samples e g bp 3 in rain2 for us bp 1 in rain1 and bp 3 in rain2 for ds the resistomes of high stormwater influenced water samples were however most similar to the bypass samples 3 3 riverine resistome during stormwater events resistance classes with high explanatory power for the resistome beta diversity and thus differing between resistomes in different habitats or with different influence of bypass were selected as follows 1 resistome profiles were aggregated by class of antibiotic resistance in dataset s5 and analyzed using nmds stress 5 67 fig s6 2 the correlation between resistance classes and the ordination and 3 the resistance classes showing high statistical significance p value 0 0001 of the correlation were selected a total of 16 resistance types were selected with these criteria conferring resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam diaminopyrimidine fluoroquinolone fosmidomycin glycopeptide multidrug nitroimidazole peptide pleuromutilin rifamycin sulfonamide tetracenomycin c and tetracycline the relative abundances of those 16 resistance classes of resistance in water soil and sediment samples are shown in fig 5 bypass and effluent samples contained in high abundance mls aminoglycoside beta lactam diaminopyrimidine fluoroquinolone sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes those 7 resistance classes showed high relative abundance also in high stormwater influenced us and ds samples bp 1 in rain1 and bp 1 to 3 in rain2 in soils and sediments the following 7 types of args were prevalent fosmidomycin glycopeptide multidrug nitroimidazole pleuromutilin rifamycin and tetracenomycin c resistance genes in spite of being selected as resistance classes with high explanatory value bacitracin resistance genes were highly prevalent in waters in general but also occurred in soil and sediment and the multidrug resistance class was abundant in all sample types but especially abundant in the soil and sediment both are therefore shown separately in fig 5 and were not considered further the relative abundance of args in the classes not selected by our criteria are shown in fig s7 3 4 analysis of multi resistance genomic determinants the results shown above provide strong evidence that resistance levels increased profoundly in receiving river waters during stormwater events and that the majority of the increase in resistance determinants in river waters originates from bypass according to the results presented in sections 3 1 3 3 based on these findings we hypothesized that the risk of exposure to various multi resistance risk factors would also increase while this was already partly supported by our clr tet analysis in fig 2 we aimed to obtain a more comprehensive picture by screening de novo assembled contigs for evidence of multi resistance contigs containing 2 args were classified as mgds and their relative abundances in each sample were calculated according to eq 2 the temporal dynamics of mgds in terms of relative abundance fig 6 followed a similar pattern to that of other resistance indicators figs 2 and 3 highest abundances were found in all bp samples high abundances of mgds were also observed in the river during bp1 rain1 and bp 1 3 rain2 elevated relative abundance of mgds persisted temporarily but decreased over time fig 6 notably the relative abundance of mgds in ef was low compared to bp and to bp affected river water to provide a better understanding of the nature of the resistances contained in the mgds we visualized the co localization of args on mgds with a network analysis the directed network shows the frequency with which each gene co occurs on mgds with each other gene fig 7 a according to references many of those genes are expected to be associated with plasmids for instance various aac 6 ib aada catb cmla dfra sul1 and inti1 homologues were found to be located in bacterial plasmids isolated from wild animals dolejska and papagiannitsis 2018 activated sludges and treated wastewaters tennstedt et al 2003 sediments and various water environments river waters drinking and wastewaters ma et al 2017 among genes associated with animal human and environmental origin plasmids the following subtypes also occurred in mgds of our study aac 6 ib aada aada5 catb2 catb3 cmla5 dfra14 oxa 2 oxa 10 oxa 129 sul1 and inti1 assuming that the args that are directly linked to the subtypes listed above are also associated with plasmids a large portion of the args 35 out of 72 subtypes fig 7b identified on mgds are likely plasmid located those potentially plasmid associated args confer resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam diaminopyrimidine fluoroquinolone phenicol and sulfonamide antibiotic classes the args that are previously reported to be associated with gene cassettes of inti1 tennstedt et al 2003 are indicated by larger nodes in fig 7b the mgds retrieved from water samples were then subjected to contig based taxonomy assignment in order to infer potential bacterial hosts dataset s7 after annotating taxonomy using two read based taxonomy assignment tools kaiju and kraken2 a total of 12 out of 126 mgds showed a consensus at genus level those 12 mgds were additionally subjected to blast analysis against ncbi nt db finally a total of 5 mgds showed a consensus among all three approaches table 1 and we considered the assigned taxonomy as potential hosts to those mgds four of the five assigned hosts were potential pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa escherichia coli and citrobacter sp on the other hand tolumonas auensis was described as an isolate from freshwater sediment capable of toluene production and is not a known human pathogen fischer romero et al 1996 4 discussion 4 1 wastewater bypass as a major contamination source for resistance during stormwater events various lines of evidence i e relative abundance of resistance indicators and alpha and beta diversity analysis of various compartments of river systems revealed that wastewater bypass was a major source of resistance during stormwater events in the river murg this indicates wwtps and sewer systems are important intervention points for tackling dissemination of args in the aquatic environment during stormwater events without proper interventions the risk of public exposure to those genes will remain high the risk of exposure to mls aminoglycoside beta lactam diaminopyrimidine fluoroquinolone sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes through contact with river water is considerably elevated during such events fig 5 furthermore bypass events occur frequently in the murg catchment near münchwilen for instance they occurred on a total of 118 calendar dates in 2019 the year of our study the bypass events occurred especially frequently during august september occurring on 54 out of 61 days the elevated exposure risk also persists for several hours after the stormwater event discussed in detail below considering that beta lactam antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in switzerland for both in and out patients foph and fsvo 2020 the discharge and potential for public exposure to bacteria with those resistance groups could be potentially problematic while the actual risks of exposure and likelihood of spreading resistance determinants to the population through this route remain unknown our findings may provide some justification to recommend caution against exposure to river water during and after strong precipitation events in rivers receiving high levels of bypass obtaining a quantitative overview of the frequency and magnitude of bypass discharge would be an important asset in this sense considering that both relative and absolute abundances of resistance indicators were relatively stable over time for ef and considerably lower than those for bypass i e incoming combined sewage reducing combined sewer overflows or bypass by increasing the treatment or retention capacities of wwtp and retention basins could be a way to reduce the amount of resistance factors released to receiving waters scaling up existing treatment facilities could be an option or at least this aspect could be considered in the early stage of wwtp installation or renovation i e making capacities of new wwtps be high enough to handle large quantities of incoming combined sewage 4 2 a temporal persistence of bypass born resistance at receiving waters after stormwater events our observation that bypass borne resistance at us and ds sites persisted for an unexpectedly long time for 22 h until it fell to pre disturbance levels in rain1 indicates that the temporal dynamics of resistance deserves further investigation and should be considered when interpreting the fate of event based resistance inputs in the river and associated risks the downstream transport of event based pollutant inputs has been widely studied jamieson et al 2005 nevers and boehm 2010 parsaie and haghiabi 2017 and hydraulic processes advection and dispersion are regarded as main drivers our previous study showed that ef is fully mixed cross sectionally after 500 m downstream distance at the münchwilen study site lee et al 2021 thus the prolonged increase of bypass borne resistance genes at both ds and us sampling sites appears to be likely due to the advective transport and longitudinal dispersion of upstream inputs from combined sewer overflows several such potential discharge points exist in the catchment however data on their contribution during the observed events is not available given our current data and study design it is not possible to quantitatively explain the temporal dynamics of resistance genes from bypass and combined sewer overflows in the receiving waters we are missing quantitative information e g on the discharge flow duration and resistance indicator loads in the various sewer overflows connected to the studied river it is even less possible to predict the situation in other watersheds the impact of bypass can be expected to depend on additional site specific properties such as the proportion of bypass discharges to river discharge characteristics of incoming combined sewages river hydraulics etc therefore further studies will be required to better understand the factors that influence the total loadings peak levels and duration of event based inputs of resistance factors from bypass and sewer overflows and to derive larger scale assessments of the contribution of bypass to amr levels in receiving waters catchment wide measurements of bypass properties discharge and representative values of resistance levels in bp etc and inputs during stormwater events combined with hydraulic modeling could provide a clearer picture 4 3 the risk of exposure not only to resistance but also to multi resistance increases at bypass receiving waters to the best of our knowledge we showed for the first time that wwtp bypass of untreated sewage leads to high relative abundance of potentially problematic multi resistance factors in bypass receiving rivers thus increasing the risk of exposure to multi resistant bacteria during and shortly after stormwater events untreated sewage contains a resistome much more closely related to the resistome of the human gut compared to effluent ju et al 2019 thus the risk of these inputs could be even higher many mgds containing the args shown in fig 7b are potentially associated with plasmids and could be transmitted to previously susceptible cells via horizontal gene transfer hgt in the presence of antibiotic mediated selection the plasmids containing those mgds could also persist or evolve in environmental microbial communities for instance in the form of attached growths near wastewater receiving points where continuous anthropogenic disturbance such as ef and also event based disturbance stormwater events exist recent studies provide evidence that args could persist even in the absence of antibiotic driven selection plasmids are a key to mediate these processes for instance under laboratory condition it has been shown that arg encoding non mobile plasmids persist in e coli over long timescales under non selective conditions wein et al 2019 another study showed that conjugal plasmids encoding args were transmitted to donor cells via hgt at high rates in e coli even without antibiotic mediated selection lopatkin et al 2017 the ubiquity of hgt in highly dense population e g biofilms positive selection coupled with other compensations and or population dynamics could be contributing factors lopatkin et al 2017 these findings indicate that there is a risk of environmental persistence of disseminated mgds even in locations where antibiotic levels are not high such as downstream river locations and reservoirs i e lakes contig based taxonomy assignment results in table 1 suggest that three mgds k121 1708054 k121 852659 and k121 1425685 retrieved from bypass m13 and bypass receiving ds water m14 are hosted by potential opportunistic pathogens e coli and citrobacter sp the risk of potential exposure to multi resistant e coli and citrobacter sp in bypass receiving water under stormwater events therefore has to be considered even though these organisms are often found in the human gut and do not normally lead to serious infections in healthy individuals the risk of infection still exists once exposed to a high dose of pathogenic strains infectious dose such as diarrhea in the case of e coli hunter 2003 and urinary tract infection for citrobacter sp abbott 2011 even though their relative abundances in our analysis do not appear high 0 0038 0 0065 of contigs in each sample care should be taken to minimize human exposure to these pathogens using our current approach it was not possible to assign taxonomy to many other mgds so a comprehensive overview of mgd host relationships is not provided one of the ways to increase success rates for contig based taxonomy assignment in the future could be to obtain longer contigs so that those sequences could have a higher likelihood to include taxonomic markers e g housekeeping genes while it would still be difficult to assign taxonomy to highly mobile fragments i e plasmid sequences that are usually shared by many taxa it might be possible to assign taxonomy at least to chromosomal associated sequences in this way practically speaking applying long read sequencing or combining short and long read sequencings could help to obtain longer sequenced or de novo assembled fragments thus increase the success rate of taxonomic assignment 5 conclusions wwtps are potentially important intervention points for preventing or minimizing discharges of bypass borne args future interventions could be made by increasing the proportion of treated wastewater discharges to incoming combined sewages during stormwater events temporal persistence of bypass borne args in the receiving water should be considered when interpreting the fate of aquatic args during and after stormwater events transport of upstream combined sewage inputs could be the reason future study involving hydraulic aspects is required the risk of exposure to multi resistance risk factors increased profoundly in the bypass receiving river due to bypass inputs during stormwater events large portion of bypass borne mgds were expected to be associated with plasmids proper interventions for tackling discharges of bypass borne mgds are required to prevent potential persistence and evolution of those factors in the environment data availability the raw sequencing data are

16448,untreated combined sewage bypass is often discharged by wastewater treatment plants to receiving rivers during stormwater events where it may contribute to increased levels of antibiotic resistance genes args and multi resistance risk factors multi resistant bacteria and multi resistance genomic determinants mgds in the receiving water other contamination sources such as soil runoff and resuspended river sediment could also play a role during stormwater events here we report on stormwater event based sampling campaigns to determine temporal dynamics of args and multi resistance risk factors in bypass treated effluent and the receiving river as well as complimentary data on catchment soils and surface sediments both indicator args qpcr and resistome arg profiles revealed by metagenomics indicated bypass as the main contributor to the increased levels of args in the river during stormwater events furthermore we showed for the first time that the risk of exposure to bypass borne multi resistance risk factors increase under stormwater events and that many of these mgds were plasmid associated and thus potentially mobile in addition elevated resistance risk factors persisted for some time up to 22 h in the receiving water after stormwater events likely due to inputs from distributed overflows in the catchment this indicates temporal dynamics should be considered when interpreting the risks of exposure to resistance from event based contamination we propose that reducing bypass from wastewater treatment plants may be an important intervention option for reducing dissemination of antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antimicrobial resistance stormwater events wastewater bypass metagenomics river 1 introduction antibiotic resistance has been considered one of the biggest challenges to public health and its global increase has been recognized as an impending public health crisis by intergovernmental entities antibiotic resistance genes args and bacteria are transmitted not only via direct human to human interaction but also via multi sectoral routes such as interdependent routes among humans food animals and environments mcewen and collignon 2018 as examples args and bacteria are enriched in reservoirs such as human patients hospitals and livestock sometimes driven by antibiotic overuse mcewen and collignon 2018 args and bacteria can subsequently be transmitted to environments via sewage hospital wastewaters farm runoff manure etc humans and animals may be exposed to these environmental args and bacteria mcewen and collignon 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are a known route through which sewage borne resistance genes are discharged into the environment bürgmann et al 2018 rizzo et al 2013 even though many studies showed that the level genes per volume or absolute abundance of args decreases during wastewater treatment processes ju et al 2019 marano et al 2020 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 profound levels of args remain in treated effluents lee et al 2021 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 for instance the levels of common args and bacteria in treated effluents are significantly higher than upstream waters by up to 2 order of magnitude lee et al 2021 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 sabri et al 2018 accordingly the levels of args and bacteria at receiving waters increase after receiving effluents lee et al 2021 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 even though the exact degree of increase depends on the proportion of effluent discharge to river discharge lee et al 2021 ort and siegrist 2009 the abovementioned studies have generally been conducted under conditions of normal wwtp operation however many sewer systems or wwtps will regularly experience high flow events caused by high intensity precipitation if such flows exceed the capacity of the wwtp or sewer system it may lead to wastewater bypass the release of untreated combined sewage into receiving waters weyrauch et al 2010 during stormwater events the level of args in wastewater receiving waters can increase due to the input of wastewater bypass but high volume flows from precipitation may reduce or compensate this effect resistance levels may also increase during stormwater events due to inputs from other non point sources soil runoff from river catchment and sediment resuspension are considered as potential non point sources under stormwater events tsihrintzis and hamid 1997 storm drains and urban runoff baral et al 2018 may represent temporary point sources at various points in a catchment however bypass is expected to contain the highest abundance of resistance determinants args and resistant bacteria and multi resistance risk factors multi resistant bacteria and multi resistance genomic determinants mgds because untreated sewage contains resistance determinants ju et al 2019 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 and multi resistant bacteria at considerably higher levels than treated effluent czekalski et al 2012 the potential combined effects of different contributors on receiving waters during stormwater events were investigated in the stroubles creek virginia usa by monitoring surface water qualities garner et al 2017 two other studies monitored combined sewage overflows and the receiving surface waters noted elevated levels of args in the receiving waters during stormwater events in the hudson river raritan bay and passaic river usa eramo et al 2017 and north shore channel usa chaudhary et al 2018 in a study performed in the antelope creek in lincoln nebraska usa baral et al 2018 that does not receive wastewater the authors found that discharges from storm drains had the strongest impact on the riverine resistome total args identified using shot gun sequencing compared to impacts from potential sewage leakage street sweepings soils and sediments while wastewater receiving river waters have been studied quite intensively so far there have thus been comparatively few studies systemically examining the combined effects among potential contamination sources for instance the contribution of bypass has not been systematically compared with other potential sources i e treated effluent surface soil runoff and sediment resuspension thus whether those other sources also contribute significantly to the increase of riverine args or not remains unanswered furthermore the potential existence of bypass borne multi resistance risk factors in the river has not been known in this study we investigated the effect of stormwater events leading to bypass discharge on a highly wastewater impacted river the river murg near the wwtp münchwilen switzerland the main goals of this study were 1 to assess the impact of stormwater related disturbance and resilience of the resistome of the murg river by monitoring temporal dynamics of the resistome during stormwater events that lead to combined sewage bypass 2 to identify the key source s which contribute the most to the increase of riverine resistance levels and 3 to assess the impact of stormwater events in terms of multi resistance risk factors we used various molecular biological microbiological and ecological parameters to identify the key factor among different pollution sources those parameters include absolute and relative abundance of well known anthropogenic antibiotic resistance markers sul1 and inti1 by quantitative pcr qpcr and alpha and beta diversity analysis of the resistome based on environmental shotgun metagenomics this approach was motivated by the hypothesis that different sources would be distinguishable by the different relative abundance and or the composition and diversity of resistance indicators to analyze multi resistance risk factors we used metagenome assembled contigs and heterotrophic cultivation presumptive multi resistant bacteria and mgds which are defined as contigs where 2 args conferring resistance to different antibiotic classes are co located in this study the underlying hypothesis was that untreated combined sewage bypass is more likely to contain high levels of multi resistance risk factors and thus their abundance might increase in receiving waters during stormwater events 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and samplings samples were obtained from the river murg near münchwilen thurgau in switzerland which is one of the most wastewater impacted rivers in switzerland this site was well studied under dry flow condition in 2018 lee et al 2021 and has the following characteristics 1 wastewater effluents comprises a high proportion of the downstream river discharge 33 0 38 0 under base flow condition 2 under baseflow conditions no other known point source of wastewater inputs exist other than studied wwtp 3 all potential combined sewer overflows into the river are from the sewer system that connects to the studied wwtp other than the sampled bypass which is discharged near the wwtp fig 1 left there are additional upstream points where combined sewage may be discharged the nearest one is located 800 m and the farthest one 11 0 km upstream of the wwtp h zbinden personal communication to authors and unpublished sewer planning document june 29 2021 4 the wwtp receives combined sewage community sewage storm drain during stormwater events and the bypass untreated combined sewage is discharged after primary sedimentation to the receiving river when the treatment and rainwater storage capacity of the wwtp is exceeded during heavy rainfall 5 the river catchment is widely utilized as agricultural area pasture and meadow for livestock farms bfs 2013 coordinates and key information on the sampling sites as well as information on the wwtp münchwilen are summarized in dataset s1 on june 25 dry1 and august 27 dry2 in 2019 water samples were obtained under base flow condition no precipitation in the previous 24 h over 24 h in hourly 1 l batches using autosamplers isco usa installed at three sampling points river murg 200 m upstream us and 500 m downstream ds of the wastewater discharge point and from effluent ef prior to discharge water samples were cooled with ice and cooling packs inside the autosamplers surface soils and sediments 5 cm from the river catchment were obtained in a separate campaign under base flow condition on may 28 2019 dry0 as shown in fig 1 right two soil samples each were obtained from forests f1 2 meadows m1 2 and pastures p1 2 river sediments were sampled once at the ds and us locations and at two sites m1 2 further upstream 0 45 and 1 0 km both surface soil and sediment samples were obtained by subsampling and pooling 5 subsamples from each location into sterile containers on site event based sampling campaigns were carried out over the summer of 2019 weather forecasts provided by meteoswiss for the münchwilen region were monitored from july to september 2020 when heavy rainfall was predicted for the catchment area of the murg autosamplers were deployed in the same way as described for base flow sampling for us ds and ef sites an additional autosampler was installed at the wastewater bypass line bp of the wwtp prior to discharge fig 1 left two event based sampling campaigns were eventually performed on august 12 13 13 00 12 00 and september 23 01 00 24 00 2019 when there was a total of 10 5 and 20 0 mm of precipitation during 48 h 24 h on the sampling date plus the previous 24 h refer to fig s1 meteoswiss 2019 during these events bp could only be sampled when there was sufficient bypass flow while the autosampler was operating only 2 samples at 13 00 aug 12 and 12 00 aug 13 could be obtained for ef in rain1 because of a malfunction of the autosampler between14 00 aug 12 11 00 aug 13 all samples were cooled at 4 c in the dark while being transported to the laboratory within 32 h from the starting time of auto samplings 2 2 sample pooling strategy for dry1 and dry2 sampling campaigns upon arrival at the laboratory hourly water samples were pooled over 6 consecutive hours to produce 4 samples for further analysis morning mor 06 00 11 00 afternoon aft 12 00 17 00 evening eve 18 00 23 00 and night nig 24 00 05 00 for every sample type us ds ef exceptions were made for mor and nig samples in dry1 ef where we could not obtain samples during 01 00 07 00 due to too low water levels in the

consecutive hours as shown in table s1 those pooled samples were stored at 4 c in the dark and further analysis cultivation and biomass filtration was performed the next day after 16 h the information on bp flow condition and sample pooling was encoded into the sample labeling scheme which denotes samples as bp or no bp nbp depending on bp flow at the time of sampling the sampling times of pooled

inputs in our previous studies czekalski et al 2012 lee et al 2021 the clr tet colonies were cultivated for water samples using biomass concentrated on 0 2 µm pore size cellulose nitrate filters followed by incubation on r2a agar plates in the presence of clarithromycin 4 0 mg l and tetracycline 16 0 mg l as outlined in our previous publications czekalski et al 2012 lee et al 2021 samples were diluted before filtration using 0 85 nacl according to the previously optimized ranges 10 ml loading volumes of 10 3 10 1 diluted samples lee et al 2021 contamination controls using a blank solution sterile 0 85 nacl were performed for each sampling campaign and no growth of colonies was confirmed technical triplicates were incubated for each sample and standard errors of triplicates are shown as error bars 2 3 biomass filtration dna extraction and quantitative pcr to obtain concentrated suspended biomass for dna extraction water samples were filtered through a sterilized 0 2 µm pore size cellulose nitrate filter sartorius germany using autoclaved nalgene filter units thermo fisher scientific usa the maximum filtration volume was up to 1 0 l for river waters 0 5 l for ef and 0 1 l for bypass but the exact volume varied by sample because filters were clogged at different volumes dataset s2 after biomass filtration the filters were stored at 20 c until processing for dna extraction soil and sediment samples were frozen immediately after arrival at the laboratory and stored at 20 c until processed further for dna extraction dna extraction was performed using dneasy

outlined in our previous studies czekalski et al 2014 ju et al 2019 lee et al 2021 the two resistance indicator genes sul1 and inti1 used in our study are two of the most widely used genetic markers

china compost amended and non amended greenhouse soils from microcosm experiments in virginia usa were downloaded from the sequence read archive sra chen et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 and subjected to bioinformatics analysis dataset s3 by comparing with this data we expected to draw more general conclusion e g by ruling out whether or not the chance that the soil resistome from other regions with similar or different land usages could be similar to the resistome of stormwater disturbed waters the selected dna samples from our study were sequenced using the illumina novaseq6000 with a paired end 2 150 strategy by novogene europe cambridge uk the reads containing adapters and low quality reads n 10 and quality score 5 were removed by novogene and the read qualities were double checked by the authors using fastqc v0 11 4 andrews 2010 for resistome analysis we used a read based annotation approach because assembly efficiencies percentage aligned sequences calculated using eq 1 were relatively low for soil and sediment samples as a result resistance gene profiles could not be properly represented using the de novo assembly based annotation approach used in our previous

reads assigned to args to 16s rrna gene like reads arango argoty et al 2018 both our samples and downloaded metagenomes from sra were analyzed using this approach in water samples only where assembly efficiencies were relatively high 51 0 a de novo assembly based approach was used for the limited purpose of analyzing mgds we followed the work flow described in our previous publications ju et al 2019 lee et al 2021 a short summary of the bioinformatics work flow is also suggested in the supporting information si identification of args was based on two published databases card v3 1 0 protein homolog model alcock et al 2020 for args and integrall v1 2 moura et al 2009 for inti1 2 5 analysis of multi resistance genomic determinants in order to list up mgds all contigs containing 2 args that confer resistance to different classes of antibiotics were sub selected dataset s6 for defining resistance classes we strictly followed the classification of antibiotics shown in card v3 1 0 the occurrence of mgds was quantitatively assessed in terms of the relative abundance defined as follows in this study eq 2 2 relative abundance of total mgds i 1 m c o v m g d i j 1 n c o v c o n t i g j where c o v m g d indicates the average coverage of a mgd c o v c o n t i g denotes the average coverage of a contig m n indicate the total number of mgds and contigs respectively in a sample the args physically co located within mgds were further visualized in a directed network using r igraph the network analysis was performed using an adjacency matrix produced from two vertices two co located args and an edge co occurrence frequency the edge information was produced according to the following equation eq 3 a the mgds containing arg a in all samples b the mgds containing arg b in all samples 3 e arg a arg b n a b n a a detailed example of the derivation process for edges is given in the si we tried to assign taxonomy to mgds using kraken2 wood et al 2019 kaiju v1 7 2 menzel et al 2016 and blast against ncbi nt database sayers et al 2019 as outlined in our previous publication lee et al 2021 in short we considered the assigned taxonomy as a valid information only if all three approaches yielded a consensus classification at genus level 2 6 statistical analysis and visualization all statistics and graphs were produced using r the shannon index was used as a parameter for alpha diversity and calculated using vegan oksanen et al 2013 the dissimilarity of resistome among metagenome samples beta diversity analysis were analyzed using non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds in vegan pairwise t test p adjustment method benjamini hochberg was performed to test for significant differences among potential contamination sources wastewaters surface sediments soils in terms of alpha diversity index 3 results 3 1 absolute abundance of resistance indicators sul1 inti1 and clr tet in waters two sampling campaigns performed under dry weather baseflow conditions were used to establish reference values for resistance indicator levels in us ds and ef under normal operation as shown by horizontal lines in fig 2 the results from these campaigns also showed the expected elevated absolute and relative abundance of resistance indicators in ef and the expected general increase of the abundance in ds compared to us as a result of ef discharge we observed little intra day variability figs s3 and s5 analysis of the resistance indicators in water samples from stormwater event based sampling revealed that bp contained high levels of resistance even higher than ef p 0 01 kruskal wallis test fig s2 specifically the levels of sul1 inti1 and clr tet in bp were higher than in ef by up to 2 1 orders of magnitude fig 2 accordingly the levels of those indicators in up and downstream water of the receiving river us and ds also increased when bypass flow was active the levels of indicators in both us and ds during bypass events bp in rain1 2 peri in fig s3 were significantly higher than the reference mor nig in dry1 2 pre in fig s3 levels p 0 01 kruskal wallis and the post hoc dunn s test in most cases one exception occurred for inti1 in us where the difference between pre and peri groups was not statistically significant p 0 14 it is important to note that we learned from the operators after the campaign that the us sampling point also receives combined sewage overflows from discharge points further upstream the levels of sul1 inti1 and clr tet in us and ds were highest during bypass flow events bp 1 in rain1 and bp 3 in rain2 the peak levels in bypass affected ds samples exceeded the ds levels at dry conditions by up to 2 4 orders of magnitude and even exceeded the levels in ef this indicates that aquatic riverine resistance at receiving points was profoundly influenced by bypass from wwtp and upstream points of discharge during bypass events in contrast levels in ef were not affected or increased only slightly during or after the bypass event fig 2 the levels of clr tet in ef at rain2 was higher than for baseflow conditions dry p 0 0008 kruskal wallis test n 8 for each of dry ef and rain2 ef however this was also the case for the ef sample at nbp 1 3 h and ds levels from this campaign thus probably reflecting a change in the effluent not related to the bypass event fig 2 we observed that elevated levels of resistance indicators at us and ds temporarily persisted for some time after bp flow had stopped fig 2 the levels returned to the pre disturbance status the levels at dry only after 17 22 h in rain1 the temporal persistence of resistance was even more profound in the campaign rain2 when there were heavier rains the levels of sul1 inti1 and clr tet at us and ds were still higher by up to 1 0 order of magnitude compared to the pre disturbance status the levels at dry 13 h after the last bypass event bp 3 10 11 h for most samples the ds levels of resistance indicators were above the us level except for inti1 and sul1 levels during rain2 nbp 15 17 h sample showing a persistent effect of the wwtp ef and bp notably however the us levels increased as well especially during rain2 while the existence of further combined sewage discharge points upstream may explain this observation we could not a priori rule out the possibility of other contributions sediment resuspension and surface soil runoffs in order to quantitatively assess the potential contributions of different sources we analyzed relative abundances of resistance indicator genes in the water samples and potential sources bypass effluent sediment and soil by normalizing to 16s rrna gene levels 3 2 relative abundance of sul1 and inti1 in waters soils and sediments relative abundance gene copies per 16s rrna gene copy of sul1 and inti1 at us and ds increased dramatically during bypass events bp 1 in rain1 and bp 1 to 3 in rain2 fig 3 similar to the pattern that we observed in absolute abundance analysis the increased relative abundance also temporarily persisted in receiving waters and gradually decreased over time fig 3 the abundance of sul1 and inti1 was below the lod d n q or n d for most soil samples where it could be determined the relative abundance of these indicators in soil was far below the values for water samples fig 3 the sediment samples showed higher values compared to soils especially for the sediment obtained from ds however all relative abundances determined for sediment were lower than in river water with exception of sul1 in us in some pre and post bypass samples nbp 3 5 h to nbp 24 h in rain1 and nbp 1 3 h in rain2 fig 3 m01 43 in dataset s3 to broaden the dataset for soil 19 published soil metagenomes were downloaded from ncbi sra we analyzed the arg content using a read based approach see dataset s3 for key information on raw reads alpha and beta diversity analysis of resistomes was performed using relative abundance data of arg identified at resistance subtype level dataset s4 anova and the post hoc pairwise t test of shannon diversity index values of the retrieved resistomes from the three potential contamination sources in the river murg catchment wastewater sediments and soils ch revealed that the shannon index of wastewater resistomes was significantly higher than of soil or sediment fig 4 a the shannon index values of soil resistomes from other studies soils cn and soils usa were similar to or lower than for soils ch the two highest shannon index values in us and ds were observed during and right after bypass discharges bp 3 and nbp 12 14 h in rain2 for us bp 3 in rain2 and bp 1 in rain1 for ds which were higher than sediments and soils beta diversity analysis of arg subtypes using nmds based on bray curtis distance stress 7 49 showed that dissimilarities between resistomes of water and other compartments were profound fig 4b water samples clustered together mostly in the 2nd and 3rd quadrants on the ordination plot and soils were mostly located in the 1st and 4th quadrants of the plot the dissimilarities between sediments and water resistomes especially for us samples were low compared to those between the soils and water but still clearly distinct from highly stormwater influenced river water samples e g bp 3 in rain2 for us bp 1 in rain1 and bp 3 in rain2 for ds the resistomes of high stormwater influenced water samples were however most similar to the bypass samples 3 3 riverine resistome during stormwater events resistance classes with high explanatory power for the resistome beta diversity and thus differing between resistomes in different habitats or with different influence of bypass were selected as follows 1 resistome profiles were aggregated by class of antibiotic resistance in dataset s5 and analyzed using nmds stress 5 67 fig s6 2 the correlation between resistance classes and the ordination and 3 the resistance classes showing high statistical significance p value 0 0001 of the correlation were selected a total of 16 resistance types were selected with these criteria conferring resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam diaminopyrimidine fluoroquinolone fosmidomycin glycopeptide multidrug nitroimidazole peptide pleuromutilin rifamycin sulfonamide tetracenomycin c and tetracycline the relative abundances of those 16 resistance classes of resistance in water soil and sediment samples are shown in fig 5 bypass and effluent samples contained in high abundance mls aminoglycoside beta lactam diaminopyrimidine fluoroquinolone sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes those 7 resistance classes showed high relative abundance also in high stormwater influenced us and ds samples bp 1 in rain1 and bp 1 to 3 in rain2 in soils and sediments the following 7 types of args were prevalent fosmidomycin glycopeptide multidrug nitroimidazole pleuromutilin rifamycin and tetracenomycin c resistance genes in spite of being selected as resistance classes with high explanatory value bacitracin resistance genes were highly prevalent in waters in general but also occurred in soil and sediment and the multidrug resistance class was abundant in all sample types but especially abundant in the soil and sediment both are therefore shown separately in fig 5 and were not considered further the relative abundance of args in the classes not selected by our criteria are shown in fig s7 3 4 analysis of multi resistance genomic determinants the results shown above provide strong evidence that resistance levels increased profoundly in receiving river waters during stormwater events and that the majority of the increase in resistance determinants in river waters originates from bypass according to the results presented in sections 3 1 3 3 based on these findings we hypothesized that the risk of exposure to various multi resistance risk factors would also increase while this was already partly supported by our clr tet analysis in fig 2 we aimed to obtain a more comprehensive picture by screening de novo assembled contigs for evidence of multi resistance contigs containing 2 args were classified as mgds and their relative abundances in each sample were calculated according to eq 2 the temporal dynamics of mgds in terms of relative abundance fig 6 followed a similar pattern to that of other resistance indicators figs 2 and 3 highest abundances were found in all bp samples high abundances of mgds were also observed in the river during bp1 rain1 and bp 1 3 rain2 elevated relative abundance of mgds persisted temporarily but decreased over time fig 6 notably the relative abundance of mgds in ef was low compared to bp and to bp affected river water to provide a better understanding of the nature of the resistances contained in the mgds we visualized the co localization of args on mgds with a network analysis the directed network shows the frequency with which each gene co occurs on mgds with each other gene fig 7 a according to references many of those genes are expected to be associated with plasmids for instance various aac 6 ib aada catb cmla dfra sul1 and inti1 homologues were found to be located in bacterial plasmids isolated from wild animals dolejska and papagiannitsis 2018 activated sludges and treated wastewaters tennstedt et al 2003 sediments and various water environments river waters drinking and wastewaters ma et al 2017 among genes associated with animal human and environmental origin plasmids the following subtypes also occurred in mgds of our study aac 6 ib aada aada5 catb2 catb3 cmla5 dfra14 oxa 2 oxa 10 oxa 129 sul1 and inti1 assuming that the args that are directly linked to the subtypes listed above are also associated with plasmids a large portion of the args 35 out of 72 subtypes fig 7b identified on mgds are likely plasmid located those potentially plasmid associated args confer resistance to aminoglycoside beta lactam diaminopyrimidine fluoroquinolone phenicol and sulfonamide antibiotic classes the args that are previously reported to be associated with gene cassettes of inti1 tennstedt et al 2003 are indicated by larger nodes in fig 7b the mgds retrieved from water samples were then subjected to contig based taxonomy assignment in order to infer potential bacterial hosts dataset s7 after annotating taxonomy using two read based taxonomy assignment tools kaiju and kraken2 a total of 12 out of 126 mgds showed a consensus at genus level those 12 mgds were additionally subjected to blast analysis against ncbi nt db finally a total of 5 mgds showed a consensus among all three approaches table 1 and we considered the assigned taxonomy as potential hosts to those mgds four of the five assigned hosts were potential pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa escherichia coli and citrobacter sp on the other hand tolumonas auensis was described as an isolate from freshwater sediment capable of toluene production and is not a known human pathogen fischer romero et al 1996 4 discussion 4 1 wastewater bypass as a major contamination source for resistance during stormwater events various lines of evidence i e relative abundance of resistance indicators and alpha and beta diversity analysis of various compartments of river systems revealed that wastewater bypass was a major source of resistance during stormwater events in the river murg this indicates wwtps and sewer systems are important intervention points for tackling dissemination of args in the aquatic environment during stormwater events without proper interventions the risk of public exposure to those genes will remain high the risk of exposure to mls aminoglycoside beta lactam diaminopyrimidine fluoroquinolone sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes through contact with river water is considerably elevated during such events fig 5 furthermore bypass events occur frequently in the murg catchment near münchwilen for instance they occurred on a total of 118 calendar dates in 2019 the year of our study the bypass events occurred especially frequently during august september occurring on 54 out of 61 days the elevated exposure risk also persists for several hours after the stormwater event discussed in detail below considering that beta lactam antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in switzerland for both in and out patients foph and fsvo 2020 the discharge and potential for public exposure to bacteria with those resistance groups could be potentially problematic while the actual risks of exposure and likelihood of spreading resistance determinants to the population through this route remain unknown our findings may provide some justification to recommend caution against exposure to river water during and after strong precipitation events in rivers receiving high levels of bypass obtaining a quantitative overview of the frequency and magnitude of bypass discharge would be an important asset in this sense considering that both relative and absolute abundances of resistance indicators were relatively stable over time for ef and considerably lower than those for bypass i e incoming combined sewage reducing combined sewer overflows or bypass by increasing the treatment or retention capacities of wwtp and retention basins could be a way to reduce the amount of resistance factors released to receiving waters scaling up existing treatment facilities could be an option or at least this aspect could be considered in the early stage of wwtp installation or renovation i e making capacities of new wwtps be high enough to handle large quantities of incoming combined sewage 4 2 a temporal persistence of bypass born resistance at receiving waters after stormwater events our observation that bypass borne resistance at us and ds sites persisted for an unexpectedly long time for 22 h until it fell to pre disturbance levels in rain1 indicates that the temporal dynamics of resistance deserves further investigation and should be considered when interpreting the fate of event based resistance inputs in the river and associated risks the downstream transport of event based pollutant inputs has been widely studied jamieson et al 2005 nevers and boehm 2010 parsaie and haghiabi 2017 and hydraulic processes advection and dispersion are regarded as main drivers our previous study showed that ef is fully mixed cross sectionally after 500 m downstream distance at the münchwilen study site lee et al 2021 thus the prolonged increase of bypass borne resistance genes at both ds and us sampling sites appears to be likely due to the advective transport and longitudinal dispersion of upstream inputs from combined sewer overflows several such potential discharge points exist in the catchment however data on their contribution during the observed events is not available given our current data and study design it is not possible to quantitatively explain the temporal dynamics of resistance genes from bypass and combined sewer overflows in the receiving waters we are missing quantitative information e g on the discharge flow duration and resistance indicator loads in the various sewer overflows connected to the studied river it is even less possible to predict the situation in other watersheds the impact of bypass can be expected to depend on additional site specific properties such as the proportion of bypass discharges to river discharge characteristics of incoming combined sewages river hydraulics etc therefore further studies will be required to better understand the factors that influence the total loadings peak levels and duration of event based inputs of resistance factors from bypass and sewer overflows and to derive larger scale assessments of the contribution of bypass to amr levels in receiving waters catchment wide measurements of bypass properties discharge and representative values of resistance levels in bp etc and inputs during stormwater events combined with hydraulic modeling could provide a clearer picture 4 3 the risk of exposure not only to resistance but also to multi resistance increases at bypass receiving waters to the best of our knowledge we showed for the first time that wwtp bypass of untreated sewage leads to high relative abundance of potentially problematic multi resistance factors in bypass receiving rivers thus increasing the risk of exposure to multi resistant bacteria during and shortly after stormwater events untreated sewage contains a resistome much more closely related to the resistome of the human gut compared to effluent ju et al 2019 thus the risk of these inputs could be even higher many mgds containing the args shown in fig 7b are potentially associated with plasmids and could be transmitted to previously susceptible cells via horizontal gene transfer hgt in the presence of antibiotic mediated selection the plasmids containing those mgds could also persist or evolve in environmental microbial communities for instance in the form of attached growths near wastewater receiving points where continuous anthropogenic disturbance such as ef and also event based disturbance stormwater events exist recent studies provide evidence that args could persist even in the absence of antibiotic driven selection plasmids are a key to mediate these processes for instance under laboratory condition it has been shown that arg encoding non mobile plasmids persist in e coli over long timescales under non selective conditions wein et al 2019 another study showed that conjugal plasmids encoding args were transmitted to donor cells via hgt at high rates in e coli even without antibiotic mediated selection lopatkin et al 2017 the ubiquity of hgt in highly dense population e g biofilms positive selection coupled with other compensations and or population dynamics could be contributing factors lopatkin et al 2017 these findings indicate that there is a risk of environmental persistence of disseminated mgds even in locations where antibiotic levels are not high such as downstream river locations and reservoirs i e lakes contig based taxonomy assignment results in table 1 suggest that three mgds k121 1708054 k121 852659 and k121 1425685 retrieved from bypass m13 and bypass receiving ds water m14 are hosted by potential opportunistic pathogens e coli and citrobacter sp the risk of potential exposure to multi resistant e coli and citrobacter sp in bypass receiving water under stormwater events therefore has to be considered even though these organisms are often found in the human gut and do not normally lead to serious infections in healthy individuals the risk of infection still exists once exposed to a high dose of pathogenic strains infectious dose such as diarrhea in the case of e coli hunter 2003 and urinary tract infection for citrobacter sp abbott 2011 even though their relative abundances in our analysis do not appear high 0 0038 0 0065 of contigs in each sample care should be taken to minimize human exposure to these pathogens using our current approach it was not possible to assign taxonomy to many other mgds so a comprehensive overview of mgd host relationships is not provided one of the ways to increase success rates for contig based taxonomy assignment in the future could be to obtain longer contigs so that those sequences could have a higher likelihood to include taxonomic markers e g housekeeping genes while it would still be difficult to assign taxonomy to highly mobile fragments i e plasmid sequences that are usually shared by many taxa it might be possible to assign taxonomy at least to chromosomal associated sequences in this way practically speaking applying long read sequencing or combining short and long read sequencings could help to obtain longer sequenced or de novo assembled fragments thus increase the success rate of taxonomic assignment 5 conclusions wwtps are potentially important intervention points for preventing or minimizing discharges of bypass borne args future interventions could be made by increasing the proportion of treated wastewater discharges to incoming combined sewages during stormwater events temporal persistence of bypass borne args in the receiving water should be considered when interpreting the fate of aquatic args during and after stormwater events transport of upstream combined sewage inputs could be the reason future study involving hydraulic aspects is required the risk of exposure to multi resistance risk factors increased profoundly in the bypass receiving river due to bypass inputs during stormwater events large portion of bypass borne mgds were expected to be associated with plasmids proper interventions for tackling discharges of bypass borne mgds are required to prevent potential persistence and evolution of those factors in the environment data availability the raw sequencing data are

16449,the water framework directive wfd demands that good status is to be achieved for all european water bodies while governmental monitoring under the wfd mostly concludes a good status with regard to pesticide pollution numerous scientific studies have demonstrated widespread negative ecological impacts of pesticide exposure in surface waters to identify reasons for this discrepancy we analysed pesticide concentrations measured in a monitoring campaign of 91 agricultural streams in 2018 and 2019 using methodologies that exceed the requirements of the wfd this included a sampling strategy that takes into account the periodic occurrence of pesticides and a different analyte spectrum designed to reflect current pesticide use we found that regulatory acceptable concentrations racs were exceeded for 39 different pesticides at 81 of monitoring sites in comparison wfd compliant monitoring of the same sites would have detected only eleven pesticides as exceeding the wfd based environmental quality standards eqs at 35 of monitoring sites we suggest three reasons for this underestimation of pesticide risk under the wfd compliant monitoring 1 the sampling approach the timing and site selection are unable to adequately capture the periodic occurrence of pesticides and investigate surface waters particularly susceptible to pesticide risks 2 the measuring method a too narrow analyte spectrum 6 of pesticides currently approved in germany and insufficient analytical capacities result in risk drivers being overlooked 3 the assessment method for measured concentrations the protectivity and availability of regulatory thresholds are not sufficient to ensure a good ecological status we therefore propose practical and legal refinements to improve the wfd s monitoring and assessment strategy in order to gain a more realistic picture of pesticide surface water pollution this will enable more rapid identification of risk drivers and suitable risk management measures to ultimately improve the status of european surface waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality agriculture freshwater ecosystem pesticide monitoring ecological risk 1 introduction since its implementation in the year 2000 the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 eg has served as the legal basis for eu member states to protect their surface waters european union 2000 it requires member states to achieve and maintain a good status of all lentic and lotic waters to have good status a surface water must exhibit both a good chemical and a good ecological status however the latest results on the status of european surface waters submitted by the member states reveal that at least 35 of surface waters fail to achieve a good chemical status and 51 show an insufficient ecological status moderate poor or bad eea 2018 the drivers made responsible for this poor status mainly include the occurrence of ubiquitous persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances upbts morphological degradation and high nutrient loads bmub uba 2016 eea 2018 pesticides on the contrary are broadly represented in the wfd list of analytes but cause only 0 4 of surface waters to fail to achieve a good chemical status according to the monitoring data from the 2nd river basin management plan mohaupt et al 2020 this contradicts numerous studies which observed that pesticides frequently exceed regulatory acceptable concentrations racs stehle and schulz 2015b szöcs et al 2017 and even pose a greater threat to european surface water ecology than any other pollutant class malaj et al 2014 wolfram et al 2021 pesticides have been shown to impair surface water fauna and flora within europe beketov et al 2013 larras et al 2017 liess et al 2021a liess and ohe 2005 schäfer et al 2011 but also worldwide for example in africa ganatra et al 2021 australia burgert et al 2011 wood et al 2019 and north and south america chiu et al 2016 hunt et al 2017 these contrasting results suggest that the current monitoring and assessment methods used in compliance with the wfd result in an underestimation of the actual pesticide risk the wfd surface water monitoring strategy focuses on larger rivers while catchments are surveyed less frequently if 100 km2 or only in exceptional cases if 10 km2 szöcs et al 2017 wick et al 2019 the chemical and ecological status of european small streams is therefore largely unknown this is problematic because small headwater streams play a decisive role in large scale overall ecological condition and biodiversity as they make up two thirds of the entire river network bfn 2021 meyer et al 2007 small stream ecosystems are considered biodiversity hotspots offering diversified habitats for numerous animal plant algae and fungi species and act as recolonization sources for impaired downstream reaches liess and ohe 2005 orlinskiy et al 2015 such streams have also been shown to be particularly susceptible to agricultural diffuse pesticide pollution often being located in direct proximity to agricultural fields while lacking the capacity of larger waters to dilute pesticide inputs schulz 2004 stehle and schulz 2015b szöcs et al 2017 these inputs are mostly due to rainfall induced surface runoff transporting pesticide residues from fields into adjacent streams resulting in short term concentration peaks liess et al 1999 for these reasons there is growing global concern about the chemical and ecological quality of small rivers which is also reflected in more recent monitoring programmes focusing on small streams such as the regional stream quality assessment rsqa in the us https webapps usgs gov rsqa or the nawa spez in switzerland https www eawag ch en research water for ecosystem pollutants nawaspez amongst other objectives the german national action plan nap for the sustainable use of plant protection products addressed this blind spot in wfd monitoring specifically requiring representative monitoring of small surface waters in agricultural catchments with an area of 10 km2 bmel 2013 consequently a uniquely comprehensive monitoring campaign of 124 small streams designed to adequately characterise pesticide pollution was carried out in 2018 and 2019 throughout germany central europe see project homepage under www ufz de kgm apart from the focus on small streams its strategy comprised i event driven sampling eds to capture transient pesticide peak concentrations in addition to wfd compliant regular grab sampling ii an analyte spectrum based on current pesticide use statistics which differs from the wfd pesticide analytes and iii the consideration of additional pesticide surface water thresholds beyond those listed for the purposes of the wfd on the basis of this stream monitoring liess et al 2021a confirmed the frequent occurrence of pesticides in ecologically harmful concentrations generally exceeding regulatory thresholds additionally they linked ecological status to pesticide pressure and proposed protective pesticide thresholds relying on field observations further halbach et al 2021 quantified the periodic occurrence of pesticides following rain events in these streams and compared measured concentrations with those recorded during the routine wfd monitoring of two german federal states the present study now uses this stream monitoring data to evaluate the wfd s pesticide monitoring strategy therefore we compared the results of the surface water assessment of our refined stream monitoring approach against a wfd compliant approach of the same monitoring sites in this way we aim to evaluate the wfd s ability to detect pesticide risks in surface waters identify reasons for divergent results where they exist and propose refinements to improve the wfd s pesticide monitoring strategy 2 material and methods 2 1 pesticide monitoring under the wfd the current situation under the wfd eu member states monitor three different categories of sites i surveillance monitoring sites where all the wfd quality elements ecological hydromorphological chemical and physico chemical are normally assessed in germany the extensive surveillance monitoring network comprises about 260 sites mostly located in larger rivers ii operational monitoring sites are more abundant 13 000 in germany but require a limited monitoring effort restricted to the assessment of quality elements known to react most sensitively in a water body this operational monitoring therefore depends on the locally specific pressure situation iii investigative monitoring sites to locate and assess causes of water pollution that make a surface water fail to achieve a good status arle et al 2016 the wfd monitoring of pesticides is involved in both the chemical and the ecological status assessment to classify a surface water s chemical status all eu member states regularly measure 45 priority substances ps or substance groups listed in the wfd and implemented in german law by the surface water ordinance bgbl 2016 annex 8 the list of ps contains 23 pesticides see supplementary information si table 1 as part of the ecological classification each eu member state is also obliged to identify pollutants of regional or local importance the river basin specific pollutants rbsp in germany the list of rbsp comprises 67 substances 44 of which are pesticides bgbl 2016 annex 6 both ps and rbsp are assigned legally binding environmental quality standards eqs reflecting concentration levels below which it is assumed that the aquatic environment and human health are protected if a single ps or rbsp exceeds an eqs the chemical status is classified as not good or the ecological status is downgraded to less than good at most moderate respectively in contrast to ps rbsp must be monitored if discharged in significant quantities monitoring frequencies are legally defined in that ps are measured twelve times per year at least once every three years operational monitoring or six years surveillance monitoring while rbsp require monitoring four to 13 times per year at least once every three years operational monitoring or six years surveillance monitoring bgbl 2016 annex 10 2 2 monitoring design used in this study the information on stream water pesticide concentrations was collected as part of a germany wide monitoring campaign of 124 small lowland streams in 2018 and 2019 the monitoring strategy was described in detail by liess et al 2021a and only a short summary is provided here this study focused on a subset of the complete monitoring dataset by considering lowland streams i within agricultural catchments i e those with 20 agricultural land cover within the catchment copernicus land monitoring service 2019 and ii where rainfall event driven sampling eds see below could be carried out this subset comprised 91 agricultural streams of which ten were monitored in both 2018 and 2019 these ten streams are analysed individually for each year as weather conditions and or crop types in the catchments differed between the years the hydrological catchments of these small streams were mostly 30 km2 mean 19 km2 with an agricultural land cover ranging from 22 to 100 mean 75 although the selection of agricultural stream monitoring sites and respective catchments showed a higher percentage of agricultural land cover than average german small stream catchments we estimate the level of pesticide pollution to be representative for german agricultural streams in general see si representativity analysis urban land cover accounted for less than 5 in the majority of stream catchments see si figs 1 and 2 the streams were sampled from the beginning of april to mid july covering the intense application period of pesticides in early summer szöcs et al 2017 weisner et al 2021 the samplings were carried out in two different ways i grab samples n 450 were taken on a regular three week cycle comparable to the monthly samplings performed under the wfd grab sampling was thus carried out irrespective of weather and discharge conditions ii additionally the streams were sampled directly after rainfall assumed to cause surface runoff eds n 312 using automatic sampling devices collecting time integrated composite samples triggered by a significant water level increase for details see si in total an average of 4 5 grab samples and 3 1 eds samples was collected per site all water samples were cooled below 4 c during sampling and transport and analysed within four days for 75 pesticides and 33 pesticide metabolites using lc ms ms see si for substance list and halbach et al 2021 for the analytical method the selection of pesticide analytes was compiled from a prior study by wick et al 2019 taking into account i a pesticide s current use statistics in relation to its toxicity ii measured concentrations in previous monitoring programmes and iii its compatibility with a multi substance method for chemical analysis the selected analyte spectrum overlapped with the list of ps and rbsp for two and 22 pesticides respectively see si table 2 pyrethroid insecticides and the herbicide glyphosate are expected potential risk drivers for aquatic ecosystems that were omitted due to analytical limitations nonetheless we consider that the analyte spectrum covered the majority of ecotoxicologically relevant pesticides at the time 2 3 pesticide surface water thresholds we applied three different types of pesticide surface water thresholds to assess the ecological relevance of measured concentrations the wfd based eqs the regulatory acceptable concentrations rac derived during the authorisation of plant protection products containing the pesticides uba 2019 and the field based acceptable concentrations acfield liess et al 2021a the eqs values were taken from the list of ps and german rbsp according to the surface water ordinance bgbl 2016 annex 6 8 to account for the duration of exposure there are two different eqs under the wfd i the annual average eqs aa eqs covering long term effects normally derived on the basis of chronic toxicity data and ii maximum acceptable concentration eqs mac eqs which covers short term effects normally derived on the basis of acute toxicity data european commission 2018 aa eqs are therefore used to assess time averaged long term concentration levels while mac eqs are used to assess short term peak concentrations aa eqs were available for 24 pesticides three insecticides three fungicides 18 herbicides and mac eqs were available for ten of these 24 pesticides two insecticides one fungicide seven herbicides when comparing mac eqs to the rac and acfield we also considered pesticides that are listed as rbsp in other eu member states see si table 2 eea 2021 and or were not included in the stream monitoring analyte spectrum see si table 3 the racs as thresholds derived within the environmental risk assessment of plant protection products were obtained from uba 2019 as each plant protection product containing a specific pesticide active ingredient requires re authorisation prior to use racs were available for all pesticides analysed n 75 eleven insecticides 25 fungicides 39 herbicides the metabolites methiocarb sulfoxide and prothioconazole desthio are also assigned a rac due to their elevated ecotoxicological potential the racs applied in this study reflect the regulatory status when monitoring was carried out in 2018 and 2019 individual racs may have been adjusted in the meantime as the plant protection products may have been reauthorised taking new scientific knowledge into account both rac and mac eqs assess concentration maxima but originate from different legal frameworks and differ in terms of the definition of the protection goal and the precise derivation approach if a mac eqs is exceeded then counteractive measures must be initiated while compliance with racs is not legally required the acfield was derived on the basis of field observations by liess et al 2021a by linking a stream s peak exposure to its ecological status as reflected by the invertebrate community this threshold aims for 95 of streams to show a good or high ecological status in terms of the invertebrate based indicator spearpesticides which responds specifically to pesticide pressure an acfield was only assigned to the 22 pesticides eleven insecticides eight fungicides three herbicides for which freshwater invertebrates were considered the most sensitive organism group according to uba 2019 referred to in this article as primarily invertebrate toxic pesticides from here in contrast to the eqs or rac this threshold incorporates other environmental stresses present in the field that interact with pesticide toxicity e g other pesticides nutrients temperature or competition all thresholds are listed in si table 2 2 4 evaluation of risk indicated by threshold exceedances exceedances of the rac mac eqs and acfield were determined by comparing the measured concentration ci of pesticide or pesticide metabolite i to the relevant threshold a threshold exceedance is indicated by a risk quotient rq greater than 1 1 r q c i t h r e s h o l d i to determine exceedances for the aa eqs the average of all measured concentrations of the pesticide i is divided by the threshold 2 r q aa eqs mean c i aa eq s i in the wfd compliant assessment the monthly sampled concentrations are commonly averaged over an entire year and then compared to the aa eqs lawa ao 2019 since the stream samples of this study were taken only during the period of intense pesticide application our averaging period only ranged from april to july this limited averaging period may result in a higher risk than if considering the year as a whole which would include months with no or reduced pesticide application particularly in winter weisner et al 2021 however unlike in practice the wfd guidance document also explicitly advises that averaging periods should be shorter than a year when episodic exposure is known which will also be discussed below see chapter 3 1 european commission 2018 therefore we also considered a best case scenario including hypothetical measurements in which no pesticides were detected in the months when no samplings took place and calculated annual average concentrations following the german guidance see si and lawa ao 2019 all calculations were performed using the statistical software r version 3 5 1 and all plots were created using the r package ggplot2 version 3 2 0 r core team 2018 wickham 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 reason 1 sampling pesticides here we discuss the time and sites to sample surface waters for pesticides firstly the wfd sampling frequencies and intervals must be regarded as unsuitable with respect to the seasonal application of pesticides and their event related input the rainfall event driven sampling eds used in our refined monitoring approach captured on average 8 3 times higher pesticide concentration peaks 95th percentile compared to common grab sampling as performed under the wfd see fig 1 and si table 2 halbach et al 2021 liess et al 2021a for the metabolites analysed eds concentration peaks exceeded the relevant grab sample concentration on average by a factor of 3 8 eds detected higher total pesticide concentrations compared to grab sampling in 80 of streams n 81 as a consequence eds increased the probability that an exceedance of the maximum acceptable concentration environmental quality standard mac eqs would be detected by a factor of four respective exceedances were identified in 3 n 16 of grab samples and 12 n 35 of eds samples restricting our analysis to grab sampling caused 16 of the 30 streams with mac eqs exceedances to go unnoticed eds was thus indispensable to adequately monitor pesticide toxicity peaks as shown in multiple studies bundschuh et al 2014 lorenz et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2017 it is these peak concentrations that were shown to determine the ecological status of a surface water liess et al 2021a ohe et al 2011 schäfer et al 2012 by investigating the concentration differences depending on weather conditions szöcs et al 2017 and halbach et al 2021 confirmed the periodic occurrence of pesticides in surface waters on runoff relevant days however wfd compliant grab sampling following a regular schedule coincided with such runoff relevant days in only 7 of samplings minimizing the likelihood of capturing relevant concentration peaks rainfall 10 mm d norman et al 2020 and spycher et al 2018 found that regular grab sampling needed to be performed at a high frequency of 12 24 h to capture transient peaks adequately for optimal cost benefit we therefore recommend supplementing the usual grab sampling with eds sampling during the main period of pesticide application and following rainfall events this can also be performed with less elaborate methods than automated sampling devices for example simple bottle samplers liess and ohe 2005 the monthly wfd samplings also cover periods outside the growing season when no relevant pesticide inputs are expected accordingly the assessment of chronic exposure through compliance with annual average eqs aa eqs involves averaging all monthly measurements for the entire year lawa ao 2019 however pesticide application frequencies peaking in april may weisner et al 2021 were shown to directly relate to measured toxicity peaks in streams in april june liess et al 1999 spycher et al 2018 the current aa eqs assessment under the wfd thus causes a downscaling of time averaged concentrations which conceals exceedances of aa eqs this is in contrast to the wfd guidance explicitly stating that when the exposure pattern for a substance is known to be episodic e g many pesticides the averaging period may be a shorter period than a year european commission 2018 so far this guidance has been disregarded in practical implementation the scheduling of sampling and the corresponding averaging period for the aa eqs assessment thus need to account for the substance specific periodic occurrence of pesticides for larger rivers the timing of sampling may be of less relevance as pesticide exposure may occur in flattened peaks as inputs from different tributaries arrive successively secondly the selection of sampling sites currently monitored under the wfd is biased resulting in unrepresentative estimations of the status of surface waters and contributing to the underestimation of pesticide risk wolfram et al 2021 estimated a median catchment area of 238 km2 of european surface waters monitored under the wfd while the median catchment area of the natural river network is less than 20 km2 small streams are thus underrepresented in the wfd monitoring site selection while being particularly susceptible to pesticide pollution lorenz et al 2017 schulz 2004 stehle and schulz 2015b szöcs et al 2017 this especially concerns small waters with catchments of 10 km2 which are completely omitted from regular wfd monitoring and are not required to achieve good status despite making up approximately two thirds of the entire river network bfn 2021 for these we observed the same concerning level of pesticide pollution the number of rac exceedances detected between streams with catchments of 10 km2 n 65 and 10 km2 was comparable n 36 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 6 we therefore recommend that the current monitoring performed in the context of the wfd be shifted more towards small water bodies 30 100 km2 and even include smaller waters with catchments of 10 km2 3 2 reason 2 measuring pesticide contamination in this section we discuss issues related to the chemical analysis following water sampling firstly we found the spectrum of pesticide analytes to be measured under the wfd to be outdated and inconsistent all 108 pesticides and metabolites detected in this study were chosen on the basis of their expected environmental relevance see chapter 2 2 however only 24 of the 75 detected pesticides are subject to mandatory monitoring under the wfd and assigned an eqs two priority substances ps and 22 river basin specific pollutants rbsp see si table 2 accordingly wfd compliant monitoring of the 101 streams identified eleven pesticides that exceeded their eqs if only grab samples were counted or 16 if eds were included we also found that pesticides not listed in the wfd occurred in ecologically relevant concentrations with 31 pesticides and one metabolite grab samples only or 37 pesticides and two metabolites eds included exceeding the regulatory acceptable concentrations racs see si table 2 for aclonifen and metazachlor the eqs but not the rac was exceeded by contrast 31 rac exceeding pesticides were identified that would have gone unnoticed in wfd monitoring see si fig 4 of the ten pesticides most frequently found in concentrations exceeding their rac only three are included in the wfd spectrum of analytes none of the four pesticides that most frequently caused rac exceedances thiacloprid clothianidin methiocarb and fipronil 54 of rac exceedances are listed as a ps or rbsp these results are supported by tsaboula et al 2016 who identified 71 pesticides that required monitoring based on a multi criteria prioritisation in a large greek river basin while only small fractions of 13 and 6 pesticides were ps and rbps respectively accordingly moschet et al 2014 found that when measurements were restricted to pesticides listed as ps in a swiss stream monitoring campaign 80 of threshold exceedances remained undetected this significantly influences the status classification of surface waters wfd compliant pesticide monitoring would yield a good status for 65 n 66 of the streams investigated in this study see fig 2 only in 12 n 12 of streams more than one pesticide exceeding the eqs would have been detected by including eds samples and racs to assess additional pesticide analytes only 19 n 19 of streams were found to achieve good status with respect to pesticides almost two thirds of the streams 64 n 65 exhibited at least two rac exceeding pesticides wfd compliant monitoring and assessment therefore failed to detect the unacceptable pesticide risk rac exceedance for 57 of agricultural streams and 72 of the pesticides consequently the list of analytes to be monitored under the wfd by far does not include the majority of environmentally relevant pesticides at the same time we found that approximately three quarters n 49 of pesticides considered under the wfd were no longer approved for use in germany eu pesticides database of the european commission as of july 2021 in contrast of the 301 different pesticides currently approved for use in germany only 6 n 18 are subject to mandatory analysis under the wfd previous investigations have already emphasized that prioritization monitoring and assessment mostly cover long known substances while those of emerging concern remain disregarded brack et al 2017 heiss and küster 2015 thiacloprid for example was responsible for 25 of rac exceedances showing the highest rate of exceedances in our study thiacloprid along with other neonicotinoids was placed on the so called watch list which brings together candidates for an updated list of ps in 2015 in 2020 however its use for plant protection was banned across the eu european commission 2020 not yet listed as a ps thiacloprid has probably already peaked in terms of environmental relevance in the stream monitoring campaign clothianidin methiocarb and fipronil were also often measured in concentrations exceeding the rac these substances have not been monitored under the wfd and were also banned for plant protection in recent years nevertheless substitutes e g anthranilic diamides like chlorantraniliprole schmidt jeffris and nault 2016 will fill the emerging gap and if the aim is to avoid unexpected ecological consequences environmental concentrations must be monitored directly when a compound is used in significant amounts the list of wfd pesticide analytes and the corresponding eqs must therefore respond more rapidly to the continuously changing spectrum of pesticides applied and relevant in the environment the watch list needs to be updated before the candidate substance s environmental relevance peaks this could be achieved by monitoring a wide range of pesticides in a representative selection of agricultural surface waters and through regular dialogue with pesticide regulators familiar with the dynamics of the current use pesticide spectrum for now we recommend that environmental authorities in charge of monitoring extend the mandatory analyte spectrum to include pesticides currently used e g on the basis of sales quantities as published by the federal office of consumer protection and food safety bvl 2021 for germany or identified as drivers of risk in this study see si table 2 to classify measured concentrations when eqs are not available we suggest using the acfield for invertebrate toxic pesticides liess et al 2021a and the rac for pesticides primarily affecting other organism groups uba 2019 to assess concentration maxima the swiss ecotox centre has also derived chronic and acute quality standards for many pesticides not assigned an aa or mac eqs following the official guidance oekotoxzentrum 2021 that may not provide sufficient protection though see reason 3 below furthermore the spectrum of rbsp to be measured by an eu member state involves two deficiencies i increasing the monitoring effort and extending the rbsp spectrum involves additional costs for monitoring and possible risk mitigation measures by providing less monitoring data the obligation to initiate such measures can be circumvented thus penalising ambitions to protect the environment ii under the wfd rbsp are monitored in a certain surface water if they were considered beforehand to be discharged in significant quantities whether an rbsp is discharged in significant quantities in a specific water body and needs to be integrated in routine wfd monitoring is difficult to evaluate reliably as long as the rbsp is not measured monitoring capacities for almost 10 000 wfd water bodies in germany alone are limited and do not allow all pollutants discharged in significant quantities to be precisely identified in advance meanwhile continuous changes in agricultural use and pesticide application schemes make it more difficult to monitor relevant rbsp arle et al 2016 moreover the wfd does not define what significant quantities are with the result that different interpretations prevail in the eu member states we therefore support the integration of rbsp monitoring into the chemical status assessment as proposed by brack et al 2017 the separate assessment of ps for chemical status and rbsp for determining ecological status unjustifiably implies different monitoring intensities and complicates the interpretation of the effect of chemicals on the ecological status the proposed integration would also have the positive side effect of harmonizing monitoring ambitions as all eu member states would monitor the same list of rbsp assigned harmonized eqs to take into account regional differences in pollution patterns and risk drivers eu member states might omit analytes of negligible concern for their region or river basin such a negligible concern would have to be convincingly demonstrated on a regular basis by representative measurements pesticide sales and application quantities or exposure modelling in addition to the insufficient analyte spectrum analytical capacities hinder measuring the pesticide contamination several pesticides are so toxic for aquatic organisms that their acceptable concentrations in the water phase are below common analytical limits of detection this partly concerns legacy compounds like heptachlor and dichlorvos but also current use neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides the aa eqs for imidacloprid and cypermethrin for example are only 2 ng l and 80 pg l concentrations too low to be quantified by the commissioned laboratories in the wfd monitoring jarosch 2018 moschet et al 2014 rösch et al 2019 weißbach and stricker 2020 eqs exceedances may therefore remain unmeasured raising the question of how to adequately monitor such toxic compounds and whether their use is generally justifiable when the resulting risk cannot be reliably assessed 3 3 reason 3 assessing pesticide effects here we address the assessment of potential ecological consequences of measured concentrations by applying regulatory thresholds firstly we raise concerns regarding the capacity of current regulatory thresholds to adequately assess pesticide risk we compared the absolute values of mac eqs including other member states rbsp with the german racs and the field based acceptable concentrations acfield liess et al 2021a all of which aim to assess acute pesticide risks rac and mac eqs values differed for 29 of the 31 analysed pesticides that are assigned both thresholds but were on average comparable log transformed paired t test p 0 4 all four pesticides that are assigned mac eqs and acfield values imidacloprid dimethoate pirimicarb and ethofumesate exhibit a mac eqs greater than the respective acfield by a mean factor of 16 geometric mean min 2 4 max 195 see fig 3 the rac exceeded the corresponding acfield values for 90 n 20 of compared pesticides racs were significantly higher than acfield values log transformed paired t test p 0 001 by a mean factor of 4 2 geometric mean n 22 min 0 04 max 56 5 consequently applying the mostly lower acfield classified more streams as being at risk than the eqs or rac showing 96 n 97 of agricultural streams as failing to achieve good status see si fig 4 the general comparability of absolute values of mac eqs and rac and the divergence from the acfield are largely due to the differing assessment factors afs applied in the respective threshold derivation mac eqs and rac rely on comparable or partly equal afs aiming to account for the uncertainties relating to the transferability of effects from artificial test systems to the field to extrapolate from acute toxicity tests to the field for invertebrates for example the guidance for the derivation of mac eqs and rac propose afs of 100 efsa 2013 european commission 2018 while afs of mac eqs and rac are generally based on estimations derived from artificial test systems the af determined for the acfield is calibrated to pesticide effects observed in the field following this approach liess et al 2021a determined an af for acute toxicity tests of almost 2000 required to protect vulnerable species in the field resulting in the mostly lower acfield values this insufficiency of current afs is supported by several other studies relating pesticide concentrations to effects on invertebrates under field conditions significant shifts in stream invertebrate communities were demonstrated at concentrations of one 100th of the concentration causing 50 of organisms to display effects in acute toxicity tests knillmann et al 2018 liess and ohe 2005 münze et al 2017 ohe et al 2011 schäfer et al 2012 found that the relative abundance of sensitive species decreased by 27 61 with an af of 100 and estimated that an af of 1000 10 000 was required to avoid pesticide related effects in addition the richness of invertebrate families was found to decrease in the field when concentration maxima exceeded levels equalling one tenth of regulatory thresholds beketov et al 2013 stehle and schulz 2015a in contrast to these field investigations an af of ten to 100 was estimated as sufficient to extrapolate from single species acute toxicity tests to multi species micro and mesocosms brock and van wijngaarden 2012 van wijngaarden et al 2015 these test systems however fail to realistically represent environmental conditions and to account for factors that increase the sensitivity of organisms in the field these include the joint toxicity of co occurring pesticides weisner et al 2021 additional environmental stress beermann et al 2018 complex trophic interactions leading to indirect effects miller et al 2020 delayed effects appearing after the runtime of the test rasmussen et al 2017 sequential pesticide exposure wiberg larsen et al 2020 and the insensitivity of commonly studied biological metrics liess and beketov 2011 all these investigations indicate that regulatory thresholds are too high to protect aquatic ecosystems this inadequacy of regulatory thresholds is also supported by an extreme variability between eqs for a single rbsp in different eu member states when national rbsp overlap with divergences amounting to as much as a factor of 100 000 despite a common guideline for the derivation of thresholds arle et al 2016 this is despite an absence of evidence that effect thresholds vary by such magnitude across geographic regions instead this underlines the regulatory uncertainty when predicting effect thresholds from experimental data further efforts are therefore needed to validate regulatory thresholds based on field observations also for aa eqs and considering groups of organisms other than invertebrates for many pesticides algae plants or fish are the first organism groups to show effects leblanc 1984 but still lack a suitable bioindicator for pesticide stress which is required to validate the relevant regulatory thresholds and afs besides the question whether eqs are protective enough we raise concerns regarding the availability of mac eqs to assess concentration maxima for the 24 pesticides to be analysed both under the wfd in germany and in our study only ten are assigned a mac eqs however the remaining fourteen pesticides also showed a periodically increased occurrence following rain events mean eds grab sample concentration ratio 9 5 fig 1 the guideline theoretically requires that exposure duration be taken into account since exposure may also occur intermittently for short periods e g coinciding with storm events european commission 2018 but once again the implementation has so far disregarded this requirement in conclusion there is strong evidence that compliance with current regulatory thresholds does not ensure a good ecological status in the field we therefore recommend the use of acfield values validated by field observations for invertebrate toxic pesticides however a field based validation of mac eqs for pesticides primarily affecting organism groups other than invertebrates as well as aa eqs in general is lacking the comparability of status assessments throughout the eu and the coherence of initiation of risk reducing strategies requires an eu wide harmonization of eqs for pesticides and other rbsp furthermore there is no logical reason to separately define divergent pesticide thresholds for acceptable concentration maxima as for the rac under regulation ec no 1107 2009 and the eqs under the wfd following the recommendations of brack et al 2017 and schäfer et al 2019 coexisting legal frameworks should thus be more interconnected where their scopes overlap in order to harmonize protection goals 3 4 our findings in the light of eu wide results even if pesticide risk drivers are expected to vary locally due to differing cropping patterns and pest pressures pesticide pressure and related ecological risks were found to be comparable for surface waters across european regions despite differences in agricultural use intensities schreiner et al 2021 stehle and schulz 2015b wolfram et al 2021 we thus assume that our findings quantifying pesticide risk are generally transferable to other regions beyond our german study area however our results differ distinctly from eu wide wfd compliant assessments by applying the rac we found 81 of the streams investigated to be at risk due to pesticides see fig 2 racs were exceeded in 38 n 38 of streams by herbicides and in 75 n 76 of streams by insecticides an eu wide assessment of wfd monitoring data covering the period 2007 to 2017 found only 5 15 and 3 8 of surface waters failing to achieve a good status due to herbicides and insecticides respectively mohaupt et al 2020 this discrepancy is partly rooted in our focus on surface waters in the agricultural landscape more importantly we conclude that the discrepancy in results is due to the issues associated with the wfd monitoring strategy as outlined above which apply to all eu member states 4 conclusions wfd sampling chemical analysis and assessment of measured concentrations are insufficient to identify pesticide risks in surface waters as a consequence the chemical status of surface waters is overestimated and the contribution of pesticides to the ecological status is underestimated under the wfd we propose legal and practical adjustments that would enable refined and more realistic wfd pesticide monitoring this will i help explain and narrow the gap between the chemical and ecological status of surface water bodies also requiring the consideration of suitable ecological indicators that respond to pesticide pressure and ii implement an adequate pesticide post registration monitoring that enables a shift in the prospective pesticide risk assessment from non validated exposure and effect predictions to actual environmental exposure and protective thresholds as shown in this study current governmental monitoring under the wfd is only of very limited use for such validation as critical pesticides and threatened surface waters remain undetected following the polluter pays principle the european parliament has already suggested in the plant protection products regulation that the additional costs for specific pesticide monitoring could be co financed by plant protection product manufacturers early identification of risk drivers and immediate feedback to pesticide regulators is key to reducing the proportion of surface waters that fail to achieve a good chemical and ecological status 20 years after the implementation of the wfd the failure to come closer to meeting the envisaged good status for european surface water bodies underlines the necessity to substantially improve the monitoring and assessment strategy credit authorship contribution statement oliver weisner conceptualization methodology

16449,the water framework directive wfd demands that good status is to be achieved for all european water bodies while governmental monitoring under the wfd mostly concludes a good status with regard to pesticide pollution numerous scientific studies have demonstrated widespread negative ecological impacts of pesticide exposure in surface waters to identify reasons for this discrepancy we analysed pesticide concentrations measured in a monitoring campaign of 91 agricultural streams in 2018 and 2019 using methodologies that exceed the requirements of the wfd this included a sampling strategy that takes into account the periodic occurrence of pesticides and a different analyte spectrum designed to reflect current pesticide use we found that regulatory acceptable concentrations racs were exceeded for 39 different pesticides at 81 of monitoring sites in comparison wfd compliant monitoring of the same sites would have detected only eleven pesticides as exceeding the wfd based environmental quality standards eqs at 35 of monitoring sites we suggest three reasons for this underestimation of pesticide risk under the wfd compliant monitoring 1 the sampling approach the timing and site selection are unable to adequately capture the periodic occurrence of pesticides and investigate surface waters particularly susceptible to pesticide risks 2 the measuring method a too narrow analyte spectrum 6 of pesticides currently approved in germany and insufficient analytical capacities result in risk drivers being overlooked 3 the assessment method for measured concentrations the protectivity and availability of regulatory thresholds are not sufficient to ensure a good ecological status we therefore propose practical and legal refinements to improve the wfd s monitoring and assessment strategy in order to gain a more realistic picture of pesticide surface water pollution this will enable more rapid identification of risk drivers and suitable risk management measures to ultimately improve the status of european surface waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality agriculture freshwater ecosystem pesticide monitoring ecological risk 1 introduction since its implementation in the year 2000 the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 eg has served as the legal basis for eu member states to protect their surface waters european union 2000 it requires member states to achieve and maintain a good status of all lentic and lotic waters to have good status a surface water must exhibit both a good chemical and a good ecological status however the latest results on the status of european surface waters submitted by the member states reveal that at least 35 of surface waters fail to achieve a good chemical status and 51 show an insufficient ecological status moderate poor or bad eea 2018 the drivers made responsible for this poor status mainly include the occurrence of ubiquitous persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances upbts morphological degradation and high nutrient loads bmub uba 2016 eea 2018 pesticides on the contrary are broadly represented in the wfd list of analytes but cause only 0 4 of surface waters to fail to achieve a good chemical status according to the monitoring data from the 2nd river basin management plan mohaupt et al 2020 this contradicts numerous studies which observed that pesticides frequently exceed regulatory acceptable concentrations racs stehle and schulz 2015b szöcs et al 2017 and even pose a greater threat to european surface water ecology than any other pollutant class malaj et al 2014 wolfram et al 2021 pesticides have been shown to impair surface water fauna and flora within europe beketov et al 2013 larras et al 2017 liess et al 2021a liess and ohe 2005 schäfer et al 2011 but also worldwide for example in africa ganatra et al 2021 australia burgert et al 2011 wood et al 2019 and north and south america chiu et al 2016 hunt et al 2017 these contrasting results suggest that the current monitoring and assessment methods used in compliance with the wfd result in an underestimation of the actual pesticide risk the wfd surface water monitoring strategy focuses on larger rivers while catchments are surveyed less frequently if 100 km2 or only in exceptional cases if 10 km2 szöcs et al 2017 wick et al 2019 the chemical and ecological status of european small streams is therefore largely unknown this is problematic because small headwater streams play a decisive role in large scale overall ecological condition and biodiversity as they make up two thirds of the entire river network bfn 2021 meyer et al 2007 small stream ecosystems are considered biodiversity hotspots offering diversified habitats for numerous animal plant algae and fungi species and act as recolonization sources for impaired downstream reaches liess and ohe 2005 orlinskiy et al 2015 such streams have also been shown to be particularly susceptible to agricultural diffuse pesticide pollution often being located in direct proximity to agricultural fields while lacking the capacity of larger waters to dilute pesticide inputs schulz 2004 stehle and schulz 2015b szöcs et al 2017 these inputs are mostly due to rainfall induced surface runoff transporting pesticide residues from fields into adjacent streams resulting in short term concentration peaks liess et al 1999 for these reasons there is growing global concern about the chemical and ecological quality of small rivers which is also reflected in more recent monitoring programmes focusing on small streams such as the regional stream quality assessment rsqa in the us https webapps usgs gov rsqa or the nawa spez in switzerland https www eawag ch en research water for ecosystem pollutants nawaspez amongst other objectives the german national action plan nap for the sustainable use of plant protection products addressed this blind spot in wfd monitoring specifically requiring representative monitoring of small surface waters in agricultural catchments with an area of 10 km2 bmel 2013 consequently a uniquely comprehensive monitoring campaign of 124 small streams designed to adequately characterise pesticide pollution was carried out in 2018 and 2019 throughout germany central europe see project homepage under www ufz de kgm apart from the focus on small streams its strategy comprised i event driven sampling eds to capture transient pesticide peak concentrations in addition to wfd compliant regular grab sampling ii an analyte spectrum based on current pesticide use statistics which differs from the wfd pesticide analytes and iii the consideration of additional pesticide surface water thresholds beyond those listed for the purposes of the wfd on the basis of this stream monitoring liess et al 2021a confirmed the frequent occurrence of pesticides in ecologically harmful concentrations generally exceeding regulatory thresholds additionally they linked ecological status to pesticide pressure and proposed protective pesticide thresholds relying on field observations further halbach et al 2021 quantified the periodic occurrence of pesticides following rain events in these streams and compared measured concentrations with those recorded during the routine wfd monitoring of two german federal states the present study now uses this stream monitoring data to evaluate the wfd s pesticide monitoring strategy therefore we compared the results of the surface water assessment of our refined stream monitoring approach against a wfd compliant approach of the same monitoring sites in this way we aim to evaluate the wfd s ability to detect pesticide risks in surface waters identify reasons for divergent results where they exist and propose refinements to improve the wfd s pesticide monitoring strategy 2 material and methods 2 1 pesticide monitoring under the wfd the current situation under the wfd eu member states monitor three different categories of sites i surveillance monitoring sites where all the wfd quality elements ecological hydromorphological chemical and physico chemical are normally assessed in germany the extensive surveillance monitoring network comprises about 260 sites mostly located in larger rivers ii operational monitoring sites are more abundant 13 000 in germany but require a limited monitoring effort restricted to the assessment of quality elements known to react most sensitively in a water body this operational monitoring therefore depends on the locally specific pressure situation iii investigative monitoring sites to locate and assess causes of water pollution that make a surface water fail to achieve a good status arle et al 2016 the wfd monitoring of pesticides is involved in both the chemical and the ecological status assessment to classify a surface water s chemical status all eu member states regularly measure 45 priority substances ps or substance groups listed in the wfd and implemented in german law by the surface water ordinance bgbl 2016 annex 8 the list of ps contains 23 pesticides see supplementary information si table 1 as part of the ecological classification each eu member state is also obliged to identify pollutants of regional or local importance the river basin specific pollutants rbsp in germany the list of rbsp comprises 67 substances 44 of which are pesticides bgbl 2016 annex 6 both ps and rbsp are assigned legally binding environmental quality standards eqs reflecting concentration levels below which it is assumed that the aquatic environment and human health are protected if a single ps or rbsp exceeds an eqs the chemical status is classified as not good or the ecological status is downgraded to less than good at most moderate respectively in contrast to ps rbsp must be monitored if discharged in significant quantities monitoring frequencies are legally defined in that ps are measured twelve times per year at least once every three years operational monitoring or six years surveillance monitoring while rbsp require monitoring four to 13 times per year at least once every three years operational monitoring or six years surveillance monitoring bgbl 2016 annex 10 2 2 monitoring design used in this study the information on stream water pesticide concentrations was collected as part of a germany wide monitoring campaign of 124 small lowland streams in 2018 and 2019 the monitoring strategy was described in detail by liess et al 2021a and only a short summary is provided here this study focused on a subset of the complete monitoring dataset by considering lowland streams i within agricultural catchments i e those with 20 agricultural land cover within the catchment copernicus land monitoring service 2019 and ii where rainfall event driven sampling eds see below could be carried out this subset comprised 91 agricultural streams of which ten were monitored in both 2018 and 2019 these ten streams are analysed individually for each year as weather conditions and or crop types in the catchments differed between the years the hydrological catchments of these small streams were mostly 30 km2 mean 19 km2 with an agricultural land cover ranging from 22 to 100 mean 75 although the selection of agricultural stream monitoring sites and respective catchments showed a higher percentage of agricultural land cover than average german small stream catchments we estimate the level of pesticide pollution to be representative for german agricultural streams in general see si representativity analysis urban land cover accounted for less than 5 in the majority of stream catchments see si figs 1 and 2 the streams were sampled from the beginning of april to mid july covering the intense application period of pesticides in early summer szöcs et al 2017 weisner et al 2021 the samplings were carried out in two different ways i grab samples n 450 were taken on a regular three week cycle comparable to the monthly samplings performed under the wfd grab sampling was thus carried out irrespective of weather and discharge conditions ii additionally the streams were sampled directly after rainfall assumed to cause surface runoff eds n 312 using automatic sampling devices collecting time integrated composite samples triggered by a significant water level increase for details see si in total an average of 4 5 grab samples and 3 1 eds samples was collected per site all water samples were cooled below 4 c during sampling and transport and analysed within four days for 75 pesticides and 33 pesticide metabolites using lc ms ms see si for substance list and halbach et al 2021 for the analytical method the selection of pesticide analytes was compiled from a prior study by wick et al 2019 taking into account i a pesticide s current use statistics in relation to its toxicity ii measured concentrations in previous monitoring programmes and iii its compatibility with a multi substance method for chemical analysis the selected analyte spectrum overlapped with the list of ps and rbsp for two and 22 pesticides respectively see si table 2 pyrethroid insecticides and the herbicide glyphosate are expected potential risk drivers for aquatic ecosystems that were omitted due to analytical limitations nonetheless we consider that the analyte spectrum covered the majority of ecotoxicologically relevant pesticides at the time 2 3 pesticide surface water thresholds we applied three different types of pesticide surface water thresholds to assess the ecological relevance of measured concentrations the wfd based eqs the regulatory acceptable concentrations rac derived during the authorisation of plant protection products containing the pesticides uba 2019 and the field based acceptable concentrations acfield liess et al 2021a the eqs values were taken from the list of ps and german rbsp according to the surface water ordinance bgbl 2016 annex 6 8 to account for the duration of exposure there are two different eqs under the wfd i the annual average eqs aa eqs covering long term effects normally derived on the basis of chronic toxicity data and ii maximum acceptable concentration eqs mac eqs which covers short term effects normally derived on the basis of acute toxicity data european commission 2018 aa eqs are therefore used to assess time averaged long term concentration levels while mac eqs are used to assess short term peak concentrations aa eqs were available for 24 pesticides three insecticides three fungicides 18 herbicides and mac eqs were available for ten of these 24 pesticides two insecticides one fungicide seven herbicides when comparing mac eqs to the rac and acfield we also considered pesticides that are listed as rbsp in other eu member states see si table 2 eea 2021 and or were not included in the stream monitoring analyte spectrum see si table 3 the racs as thresholds derived within the environmental risk assessment of plant protection products were obtained from uba 2019 as each plant protection product containing a specific pesticide active ingredient requires re authorisation prior to use racs were available for all pesticides analysed n 75 eleven insecticides 25 fungicides 39 herbicides the metabolites methiocarb sulfoxide and prothioconazole desthio are also assigned a rac due to their elevated ecotoxicological potential the racs applied in this study reflect the regulatory status when monitoring was carried out in 2018 and 2019 individual racs may have been adjusted in the meantime as the plant protection products may have been reauthorised taking new scientific knowledge into account both rac and mac eqs assess concentration maxima but originate from different legal frameworks and differ in terms of the definition of the protection goal and the precise derivation approach if a mac eqs is exceeded then counteractive measures must be initiated while compliance with racs is not legally required the acfield was derived on the basis of field observations by liess et al 2021a by linking a stream s peak exposure to its ecological status as reflected by the invertebrate community this threshold aims for 95 of streams to show a good or high ecological status in terms of the invertebrate based indicator spearpesticides which responds specifically to pesticide pressure an acfield was only assigned to the 22 pesticides eleven insecticides eight fungicides three herbicides for which freshwater invertebrates were considered the most sensitive organism group according to uba 2019 referred to in this article as primarily invertebrate toxic pesticides from here in contrast to the eqs or rac this threshold incorporates other environmental stresses present in the field that interact with pesticide toxicity e g other pesticides nutrients temperature or competition all thresholds are listed in si table 2 2 4 evaluation of risk indicated by threshold exceedances exceedances of the rac mac eqs and acfield were determined by comparing the measured concentration ci of pesticide or pesticide metabolite i to the relevant threshold a threshold exceedance is indicated by a risk quotient rq greater than 1 1 r q c i t h r e s h o l d i to determine exceedances for the aa eqs the average of all measured concentrations of the pesticide i is divided by the threshold 2 r q aa eqs mean c i aa eq s i in the wfd compliant assessment the monthly sampled concentrations are commonly averaged over an entire year and then compared to the aa eqs lawa ao 2019 since the stream samples of this study were taken only during the period of intense pesticide application our averaging period only ranged from april to july this limited averaging period may result in a higher risk than if considering the year as a whole which would include months with no or reduced pesticide application particularly in winter weisner et al 2021 however unlike in practice the wfd guidance document also explicitly advises that averaging periods should be shorter than a year when episodic exposure is known which will also be discussed below see chapter 3 1 european commission 2018 therefore we also considered a best case scenario including hypothetical measurements in which no pesticides were detected in the months when no samplings took place and calculated annual average concentrations following the german guidance see si and lawa ao 2019 all calculations were performed using the statistical software r version 3 5 1 and all plots were created using the r package ggplot2 version 3 2 0 r core team 2018 wickham 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 reason 1 sampling pesticides here we discuss the time and sites to sample surface waters for pesticides firstly the wfd sampling frequencies and intervals must be regarded as unsuitable with respect to the seasonal application of pesticides and their event related input the rainfall event driven sampling eds used in our refined monitoring approach captured on average 8 3 times higher pesticide concentration peaks 95th percentile compared to common grab sampling as performed under the wfd see fig 1 and si table 2 halbach et al 2021 liess et al 2021a for the metabolites analysed eds concentration peaks exceeded the relevant grab sample concentration on average by a factor of 3 8 eds detected higher total pesticide concentrations compared to grab sampling in 80 of streams n 81 as a consequence eds increased the probability that an exceedance of the maximum acceptable concentration environmental quality standard mac eqs would be detected by a factor of four respective exceedances were identified in 3 n 16 of grab samples and 12 n 35 of eds samples restricting our analysis to grab sampling caused 16 of the 30 streams with mac eqs exceedances to go unnoticed eds was thus indispensable to adequately monitor pesticide toxicity peaks as shown in multiple studies bundschuh et al 2014 lorenz et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2017 it is these peak concentrations that were shown to determine the ecological status of a surface water liess et al 2021a ohe et al 2011 schäfer et al 2012 by investigating the concentration differences depending on weather conditions szöcs et al 2017 and halbach et al 2021 confirmed the periodic occurrence of pesticides in surface waters on runoff relevant days however wfd compliant grab sampling following a regular schedule coincided with such runoff relevant days in only 7 of samplings minimizing the likelihood of capturing relevant concentration peaks rainfall 10 mm d norman et al 2020 and spycher et al 2018 found that regular grab sampling needed to be performed at a high frequency of 12 24 h to capture transient peaks adequately for optimal cost benefit we therefore recommend supplementing the usual grab sampling with eds sampling during the main period of pesticide application and following rainfall events this can also be performed with less elaborate methods than automated sampling devices for example simple bottle samplers liess and ohe 2005 the monthly wfd samplings also cover periods outside the growing season when no relevant pesticide inputs are expected accordingly the assessment of chronic exposure through compliance with annual average eqs aa eqs involves averaging all monthly measurements for the entire year lawa ao 2019 however pesticide application frequencies peaking in april may weisner et al 2021 were shown to directly relate to measured toxicity peaks in streams in april june liess et al 1999 spycher et al 2018 the current aa eqs assessment under the wfd thus causes a downscaling of time averaged concentrations which conceals exceedances of aa eqs this is in contrast to the wfd guidance explicitly stating that when the exposure pattern for a substance is known to be episodic e g many pesticides the averaging period may be a shorter period than a year european commission 2018 so far this guidance has been disregarded in practical implementation the scheduling of sampling and the corresponding averaging period for the aa eqs assessment thus need to account for the substance specific periodic occurrence of pesticides for larger rivers the timing of sampling may be of less relevance as pesticide exposure may occur in flattened peaks as inputs from different tributaries arrive successively secondly the selection of sampling sites currently monitored under the wfd is biased resulting in unrepresentative estimations of the status of surface waters and contributing to the underestimation of pesticide risk wolfram et al 2021 estimated a median catchment area of 238 km2 of european surface waters monitored under the wfd while the median catchment area of the natural river network is less than 20 km2 small streams are thus underrepresented in the wfd monitoring site selection while being particularly susceptible to pesticide pollution lorenz et al 2017 schulz 2004 stehle and schulz 2015b szöcs et al 2017 this especially concerns small waters with catchments of 10 km2 which are completely omitted from regular wfd monitoring and are not required to achieve good status despite making up approximately two thirds of the entire river network bfn 2021 for these we observed the same concerning level of pesticide pollution the number of rac exceedances detected between streams with catchments of 10 km2 n 65 and 10 km2 was comparable n 36 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 6 we therefore recommend that the current monitoring performed in the context of the wfd be shifted more towards small water bodies 30 100 km2 and even include smaller waters with catchments of 10 km2 3 2 reason 2 measuring pesticide contamination in this section we discuss issues related to the chemical analysis following water sampling firstly we found the spectrum of pesticide analytes to be measured under the wfd to be outdated and inconsistent all 108 pesticides and metabolites detected in this study were chosen on the basis of their expected environmental relevance see chapter 2 2 however only 24 of the 75 detected pesticides are subject to mandatory monitoring under the wfd and assigned an eqs two priority substances ps and 22 river basin specific pollutants rbsp see si table 2 accordingly wfd compliant monitoring of the 101 streams identified eleven pesticides that exceeded their eqs if only grab samples were counted or 16 if eds were included we also found that pesticides not listed in the wfd occurred in ecologically relevant concentrations with 31 pesticides and one metabolite grab samples only or 37 pesticides and two metabolites eds included exceeding the regulatory acceptable concentrations racs see si table 2 for aclonifen and metazachlor the eqs but not the rac was exceeded by contrast 31 rac exceeding pesticides were identified that would have gone unnoticed in wfd monitoring see si fig 4 of the ten pesticides most frequently found in concentrations exceeding their rac only three are included in the wfd spectrum of analytes none of the four pesticides that most frequently caused rac exceedances thiacloprid clothianidin methiocarb and fipronil 54 of rac exceedances are listed as a ps or rbsp these results are supported by tsaboula et al 2016 who identified 71 pesticides that required monitoring based on a multi criteria prioritisation in a large greek river basin while only small fractions of 13 and 6 pesticides were ps and rbps respectively accordingly moschet et al 2014 found that when measurements were restricted to pesticides listed as ps in a swiss stream monitoring campaign 80 of threshold exceedances remained undetected this significantly influences the status classification of surface waters wfd compliant pesticide monitoring would yield a good status for 65 n 66 of the streams investigated in this study see fig 2 only in 12 n 12 of streams more than one pesticide exceeding the eqs would have been detected by including eds samples and racs to assess additional pesticide analytes only 19 n 19 of streams were found to achieve good status with respect to pesticides almost two thirds of the streams 64 n 65 exhibited at least two rac exceeding pesticides wfd compliant monitoring and assessment therefore failed to detect the unacceptable pesticide risk rac exceedance for 57 of agricultural streams and 72 of the pesticides consequently the list of analytes to be monitored under the wfd by far does not include the majority of environmentally relevant pesticides at the same time we found that approximately three quarters n 49 of pesticides considered under the wfd were no longer approved for use in germany eu pesticides database of the european commission as of july 2021 in contrast of the 301 different pesticides currently approved for use in germany only 6 n 18 are subject to mandatory analysis under the wfd previous investigations have already emphasized that prioritization monitoring and assessment mostly cover long known substances while those of emerging concern remain disregarded brack et al 2017 heiss and küster 2015 thiacloprid for example was responsible for 25 of rac exceedances showing the highest rate of exceedances in our study thiacloprid along with other neonicotinoids was placed on the so called watch list which brings together candidates for an updated list of ps in 2015 in 2020 however its use for plant protection was banned across the eu european commission 2020 not yet listed as a ps thiacloprid has probably already peaked in terms of environmental relevance in the stream monitoring campaign clothianidin methiocarb and fipronil were also often measured in concentrations exceeding the rac these substances have not been monitored under the wfd and were also banned for plant protection in recent years nevertheless substitutes e g anthranilic diamides like chlorantraniliprole schmidt jeffris and nault 2016 will fill the emerging gap and if the aim is to avoid unexpected ecological consequences environmental concentrations must be monitored directly when a compound is used in significant amounts the list of wfd pesticide analytes and the corresponding eqs must therefore respond more rapidly to the continuously changing spectrum of pesticides applied and relevant in the environment the watch list needs to be updated before the candidate substance s environmental relevance peaks this could be achieved by monitoring a wide range of pesticides in a representative selection of agricultural surface waters and through regular dialogue with pesticide regulators familiar with the dynamics of the current use pesticide spectrum for now we recommend that environmental authorities in charge of monitoring extend the mandatory analyte spectrum to include pesticides currently used e g on the basis of sales quantities as published by the federal office of consumer protection and food safety bvl 2021 for germany or identified as drivers of risk in this study see si table 2 to classify measured concentrations when eqs are not available we suggest using the acfield for invertebrate toxic pesticides liess et al 2021a and the rac for pesticides primarily affecting other organism groups uba 2019 to assess concentration maxima the swiss ecotox centre has also derived chronic and acute quality standards for many pesticides not assigned an aa or mac eqs following the official guidance oekotoxzentrum 2021 that may not provide sufficient protection though see reason 3 below furthermore the spectrum of rbsp to be measured by an eu member state involves two deficiencies i increasing the monitoring effort and extending the rbsp spectrum involves additional costs for monitoring and possible risk mitigation measures by providing less monitoring data the obligation to initiate such measures can be circumvented thus penalising ambitions to protect the environment ii under the wfd rbsp are monitored in a certain surface water if they were considered beforehand to be discharged in significant quantities whether an rbsp is discharged in significant quantities in a specific water body and needs to be integrated in routine wfd monitoring is difficult to evaluate reliably as long as the rbsp is not measured monitoring capacities for almost 10 000 wfd water bodies in germany alone are limited and do not allow all pollutants discharged in significant quantities to be precisely identified in advance meanwhile continuous changes in agricultural use and pesticide application schemes make it more difficult to monitor relevant rbsp arle et al 2016 moreover the wfd does not define what significant quantities are with the result that different interpretations prevail in the eu member states we therefore support the integration of rbsp monitoring into the chemical status assessment as proposed by brack et al 2017 the separate assessment of ps for chemical status and rbsp for determining ecological status unjustifiably implies different monitoring intensities and complicates the interpretation of the effect of chemicals on the ecological status the proposed integration would also have the positive side effect of harmonizing monitoring ambitions as all eu member states would monitor the same list of rbsp assigned harmonized eqs to take into account regional differences in pollution patterns and risk drivers eu member states might omit analytes of negligible concern for their region or river basin such a negligible concern would have to be convincingly demonstrated on a regular basis by representative measurements pesticide sales and application quantities or exposure modelling in addition to the insufficient analyte spectrum analytical capacities hinder measuring the pesticide contamination several pesticides are so toxic for aquatic organisms that their acceptable concentrations in the water phase are below common analytical limits of detection this partly concerns legacy compounds like heptachlor and dichlorvos but also current use neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides the aa eqs for imidacloprid and cypermethrin for example are only 2 ng l and 80 pg l concentrations too low to be quantified by the commissioned laboratories in the wfd monitoring jarosch 2018 moschet et al 2014 rösch et al 2019 weißbach and stricker 2020 eqs exceedances may therefore remain unmeasured raising the question of how to adequately monitor such toxic compounds and whether their use is generally justifiable when the resulting risk cannot be reliably assessed 3 3 reason 3 assessing pesticide effects here we address the assessment of potential ecological consequences of measured concentrations by applying regulatory thresholds firstly we raise concerns regarding the capacity of current regulatory thresholds to adequately assess pesticide risk we compared the absolute values of mac eqs including other member states rbsp with the german racs and the field based acceptable concentrations acfield liess et al 2021a all of which aim to assess acute pesticide risks rac and mac eqs values differed for 29 of the 31 analysed pesticides that are assigned both thresholds but were on average comparable log transformed paired t test p 0 4 all four pesticides that are assigned mac eqs and acfield values imidacloprid dimethoate pirimicarb and ethofumesate exhibit a mac eqs greater than the respective acfield by a mean factor of 16 geometric mean min 2 4 max 195 see fig 3 the rac exceeded the corresponding acfield values for 90 n 20 of compared pesticides racs were significantly higher than acfield values log transformed paired t test p 0 001 by a mean factor of 4 2 geometric mean n 22 min 0 04 max 56 5 consequently applying the mostly lower acfield classified more streams as being at risk than the eqs or rac showing 96 n 97 of agricultural streams as failing to achieve good status see si fig 4 the general comparability of absolute values of mac eqs and rac and the divergence from the acfield are largely due to the differing assessment factors afs applied in the respective threshold derivation mac eqs and rac rely on comparable or partly equal afs aiming to account for the uncertainties relating to the transferability of effects from artificial test systems to the field to extrapolate from acute toxicity tests to the field for invertebrates for example the guidance for the derivation of mac eqs and rac propose afs of 100 efsa 2013 european commission 2018 while afs of mac eqs and rac are generally based on estimations derived from artificial test systems the af determined for the acfield is calibrated to pesticide effects observed in the field following this approach liess et al 2021a determined an af for acute toxicity tests of almost 2000 required to protect vulnerable species in the field resulting in the mostly lower acfield values this insufficiency of current afs is supported by several other studies relating pesticide concentrations to effects on invertebrates under field conditions significant shifts in stream invertebrate communities were demonstrated at concentrations of one 100th of the concentration causing 50 of organisms to display effects in acute toxicity tests knillmann et al 2018 liess and ohe 2005 münze et al 2017 ohe et al 2011 schäfer et al 2012 found that the relative abundance of sensitive species decreased by 27 61 with an af of 100 and estimated that an af of 1000 10 000 was required to avoid pesticide related effects in addition the richness of invertebrate families was found to decrease in the field when concentration maxima exceeded levels equalling one tenth of regulatory thresholds beketov et al 2013 stehle and schulz 2015a in contrast to these field investigations an af of ten to 100 was estimated as sufficient to extrapolate from single species acute toxicity tests to multi species micro and mesocosms brock and van wijngaarden 2012 van wijngaarden et al 2015 these test systems however fail to realistically represent environmental conditions and to account for factors that increase the sensitivity of organisms in the field these include the joint toxicity of co occurring pesticides weisner et al 2021 additional environmental stress beermann et al 2018 complex trophic interactions leading to indirect effects miller et al 2020 delayed effects appearing after the runtime of the test rasmussen et al 2017 sequential pesticide exposure wiberg larsen et al 2020 and the insensitivity of commonly studied biological metrics liess and beketov 2011 all these investigations indicate that regulatory thresholds are too high to protect aquatic ecosystems this inadequacy of regulatory thresholds is also supported by an extreme variability between eqs for a single rbsp in different eu member states when national rbsp overlap with divergences amounting to as much as a factor of 100 000 despite a common guideline for the derivation of thresholds arle et al 2016 this is despite an absence of evidence that effect thresholds vary by such magnitude across geographic regions instead this underlines the regulatory uncertainty when predicting effect thresholds from experimental data further efforts are therefore needed to validate regulatory thresholds based on field observations also for aa eqs and considering groups of organisms other than invertebrates for many pesticides algae plants or fish are the first organism groups to show effects leblanc 1984 but still lack a suitable bioindicator for pesticide stress which is required to validate the relevant regulatory thresholds and afs besides the question whether eqs are protective enough we raise concerns regarding the availability of mac eqs to assess concentration maxima for the 24 pesticides to be analysed both under the wfd in germany and in our study only ten are assigned a mac eqs however the remaining fourteen pesticides also showed a periodically increased occurrence following rain events mean eds grab sample concentration ratio 9 5 fig 1 the guideline theoretically requires that exposure duration be taken into account since exposure may also occur intermittently for short periods e g coinciding with storm events european commission 2018 but once again the implementation has so far disregarded this requirement in conclusion there is strong evidence that compliance with current regulatory thresholds does not ensure a good ecological status in the field we therefore recommend the use of acfield values validated by field observations for invertebrate toxic pesticides however a field based validation of mac eqs for pesticides primarily affecting organism groups other than invertebrates as well as aa eqs in general is lacking the comparability of status assessments throughout the eu and the coherence of initiation of risk reducing strategies requires an eu wide harmonization of eqs for pesticides and other rbsp furthermore there is no logical reason to separately define divergent pesticide thresholds for acceptable concentration maxima as for the rac under regulation ec no 1107 2009 and the eqs under the wfd following the recommendations of brack et al 2017 and schäfer et al 2019 coexisting legal frameworks should thus be more interconnected where their scopes overlap in order to harmonize protection goals 3 4 our findings in the light of eu wide results even if pesticide risk drivers are expected to vary locally due to differing cropping patterns and pest pressures pesticide pressure and related ecological risks were found to be comparable for surface waters across european regions despite differences in agricultural use intensities schreiner et al 2021 stehle and schulz 2015b wolfram et al 2021 we thus assume that our findings quantifying pesticide risk are generally transferable to other regions beyond our german study area however our results differ distinctly from eu wide wfd compliant assessments by applying the rac we found 81 of the streams investigated to be at risk due to pesticides see fig 2 racs were exceeded in 38 n 38 of streams by herbicides and in 75 n 76 of streams by insecticides an eu wide assessment of wfd monitoring data covering the period 2007 to 2017 found only 5 15 and 3 8 of surface waters failing to achieve a good status due to herbicides and insecticides respectively mohaupt et al 2020 this discrepancy is partly rooted in our focus on surface waters in the agricultural landscape more importantly we conclude that the discrepancy in results is due to the issues associated with the wfd monitoring strategy as outlined above which apply to all eu member states 4 conclusions wfd sampling chemical analysis and assessment of measured concentrations are insufficient to identify pesticide risks in surface waters as a consequence the chemical status of surface waters is overestimated and the contribution of pesticides to the ecological status is underestimated under the wfd we propose legal and practical adjustments that would enable refined and more realistic wfd pesticide monitoring this will i help explain and narrow the gap between the chemical and ecological status of surface water bodies also requiring the consideration of suitable ecological indicators that respond to pesticide pressure and ii implement an adequate pesticide post registration monitoring that enables a shift in the prospective pesticide risk assessment from non validated exposure and effect predictions to actual environmental exposure and protective thresholds as shown in this study current governmental monitoring under the wfd is only of very limited use for such validation as critical pesticides and threatened surface waters remain undetected following the polluter pays principle the european parliament has already suggested in the plant protection products regulation that the additional costs for specific pesticide monitoring could be co financed by plant protection product manufacturers early identification of risk drivers and immediate feedback to pesticide regulators is key to reducing the proportion of surface waters that fail to achieve a good chemical and ecological status 20 years after the implementation of the wfd the failure to come closer to meeting the envisaged good status for european surface water bodies underlines the necessity to substantially improve the monitoring and assessment strategy credit authorship contribution statement oliver weisner conceptualization methodology
