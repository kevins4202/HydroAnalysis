13430,electrocoagulation is a process that consists in the production of coagulant species by the dissolution of a sacrificial anode this work presents by the first time the performance of a downflow column electrochemical reactor dcer to conduct an electrocoagulation process to remove organic and inorganic matter from wastewater 6 l of a chocolate industry a deep flow battery connected to a solar panel was used to energize the aluminium electrodes the studied variables were electrical current i 1 58 a and 3 16 a and liquid volumetric flowrate ql 0 032 l s and 0 060 l s the response variables were cod and color removal it was concluded that during the first 5 min the interaction of both variables exerts the most significant effect on cod removal while for the rest of the treatment the effect of i is more statistically significant than ql regarding color an 80 was removed during the first 5 min of treatment it was also concluded that i 3 16 a and ql 0 06 l s were the conditions to reach the maximum cod and color removal 63 and 97 respectively in addition the hydrogen production was theoretically estimated to be 0 26 l after 20 min of treatment a cost analysis was conducted by taking into account the sludge management electrode consumption electricity consumption by electrodes and pump the calculated cost was 4 01 usd m3 a second order adsorption model was found to provide an excellent fitting of the experimental cod and color data keywords hydrogen production aluminium electrodes food industry electrochemical reactors electrocoagulators 1 introduction world population is constantly growing and this implies an increased consumption of services medicines chemical products clothes food and commodities the environmental impact of these industries is undeniable and the chocolate industry is not the exception in order to satisfy the worldwide demand chocolate is produced in large quantities every year 1 2 the chocolate industry generates different kind of waste like volatile compounds di and tri terpenes flavonoids polyphenols pyrroles methylxanthines aldehydes phospholipids mixtures ketones liquid cocoa butter triglycerides aliphatic alcohols glycolipids furans sterols and saturated fats 3 4 therefore the chocolate industry wastewater must be treated before being discharged and to do so biological treatments have been preferred this type of treatments however are lengthy and require a fine control of operational variables for the microorganisms to survive 5 this has motivated the assessment of alternative treatments like the electrochemical ones among electrochemical methods electrocoagulation ec allows to treat water with organic matter and suspended solids ec combines flotation coagulation and oxidation or reduction of pollutant compounds 6 in ec an anode and a cathode are necessary to carry out the treatment the anode works as a sacrificial electrode and by in situ electro dissolution provides the system with the coagulating agent this anode can be made of aluminium copper magnesium iron zinc and stainless steel 7 9 and in contact with the wastewater leads to hydrolysis products hydroxo metal species that are effective in the destabilization of pollutants concomitantly the reduction of water in the cathode produces hydrogen gas bubbles and hydroxide ions this increases ph in the bulk solution and produces sludge at the water surface and this facilitates its removal when al electrodes are used the following reactions are expected to proceed 10 anode 1 a l s a l a q 3 3 e cathode 2 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 o h a q in aqueous medium the following reactions might take place eqs 3 4 11 13 3 a l 3 3 o h a l o h 3 s 4 n a l o h 3 a l n o h 3 n different pollutants that have been successfully removed by ec are dyes suspended solids heavy metals fluorides hardness arsenic phosphates and pesticides 14 19 this process is typically conducted in batch electrochemical cells with continuous stirring at industrial scale however this might lead to mass transfer limitations thus reducing pollutants removal effectiveness in addition the electricity consumption sometimes limits the application of ec this work aimed to assess a rather novel technology in the field of electrochemistry a downflow column electrochemical reactor dcer this in an ejector type reactor that was originally conceived as gas absorber later on it evolved as three phase reactor 20 this is the first work where such a technology is applied to conduct an electrocoagulation process aluminium electrodes were used and an effluent from the chocolate industry was treated thus the effectiveness of the process was established it is also worth pointing out that the electrodes were energized by a deep flow battery connected to a solar panel in order to reduce the cost by electricity consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples the wastewater is typically transported from a chocolate industry to a treatment plant the sampling was conducted right before entering the treatment plant the wastewater was collected in 20 l plastic containers and kept at 4 c until treatment however the characterization was conducted within 24 h of collection 2 2 electrocoagulation treatment dcer consists of a downward parallel flow column that is shaped like a cylinder 100 cm of height and 5 cm of diameter with a capacity of 2 l the system is depicted in fig 1 it can be observed that the liquid phase is fed at the top of the column and recirculated through the whole system during the total treatment time this technology exploits an orifice at the top of the column to produce a venturi effect that promotes mass transfer the breaking vessel is a 5 l stainless steel reservoir with the following dimensions 20 10 2 m in diameter and 15 9 10 2 m in height there is a stainless steel coil heat exchanger placed inside this reservoir by means of this coil the temperature is kept constant since the pump transfers thermal energy to the solution the aluminium electrodes one pair of plates for the anode and one pair for the cathode were placed inside the column between each pair of aluminium plates there was a 0 5 cm gap and between the anode and cathode the separation distance was 1 10 2 m the aluminium plates dimensions were 92 5 10 2 m in length 0 318 10 2 m of thickness and a width of 2 4 10 2 m the total volume occupied by the electrodes was 0 282 l and therefore the total free volume inside the column was 1 682 l nevertheless at all experiments a total volume of 6 l was used and the studied liquid volumetric flowrates were 0 032 and 0 06 l s the samples 20 10 3 l were taken at the point indicated in fig 1 the energy was supplied by a deep flow battery charged by a solar panel connected to a charge controller this arrangement allowed to have a constant electrical current during the whole treatment despite using solar energy the electrical current supplied was 1 58 and 3 16 a the initial conductivity of the sample 785 8 μs cm was not enough to achieve the aforementioned electrical current values thus sodium sulfate 1 m was added in order to increase the conductivity up to 1680 μs cm the working ph was 6 4 initial ph of the wastewater sample at all experiments the treatment time was 1 h and were carried out by duplicate 2 3 methods of analysis the wastewater sample characterization was carried out according to apha 21 in this context turbidity ph color total and faecal coliforms chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 electrical conductivity sulphates nitrites nitrates ammoniacal nitrogen phosphates fluorides chlorides fe cu na k mg al and ca were determined for turbidity a 20 ml sample was analysed in a hf scientific micro100 laboratory turbidimeter the ph was monitored with a ph meter hanna hi98190 and the electrical conductivity with an ion450 radiometer regarding color the samples 10 ml were not filtered before this analysis thus the reported results correspond to the apparent colour this parameter was measured in a hach dr5000 spectrometer at 455 nm according to the pt co color method for the analysis of fluorides 0 5 ml of tisab ii solution were added to 5 ml of sample and the concentration of f was determined by a selective electrode with a hanna hi83308 instruments potentiometer nitrites and ammoniacal nitrogen were determined by the hach method using the reagents tnt 835 and tnt 83 respectively the metals concentration fe cu na k mg al and ca was determined by atomic absorption with a spectraa 240 fs spectrophotometer the following analyses were performed using mexican standards total and faecal coliforms nmx aa 42 1987 chemical oxygen demand cod nmx aa 030 2 scfi 2011 in a hach dr5000 spectrometer biochemical oxygen demand bod5 nmx aa 028 scfi 2001 in a hanna hi 2400 instrument phosphates nmx aa 029 scfi 2001 was analysed by a colorimetric method chlorides nmx aa 073 scfi 2001 was analysed by a colorimetric titrometric method nitrates nmx aa 079 scfi 2001 and sulphates nmx aa 074 scfi 2014 by using a lambda 25 uv vis perkin elmer spectrometer the sludge was quantified by determination of settleable solids in raw and treated wastewater in ml l according to the mexican standard nmx aa 004 scfi 2000 22 once the sample was filtered the sludge was dried for 24 h at 105 c and then weighed 2 4 gas production in order to determine the volume of produced gas the shutting down method was applied this consists in simultaneously closing down the inlet and the exit valve of the dcer and switching off the pump by this means the gas dispersion bubbles collapses and a gas volume is observed on top of the liquid phase since the column was made of transparent glass this allowed to measure the volume occupied by the produced gas the plausible composition of the produced gas was established by considering the stoichiometry of the reactions where the expected gases h2 o2 n2 and cl2 are being produced and also consumed this analysis and its results are presented in section 3 3 2 5 species formation and quantification in order to establish the conditions ph interval at which the al oh 3 is predominant given a specific al iii concentration and the ionic strength a speciation diagram was generated via medusa program 23 the speciation diagram was generated at 3 16 a and at 30 min of treatment the ionic strength was calculated by using the ions concentration according to eq 5 24 5 i s 1 2 z i 2 c i here is is ionic strength ci is concentration mol l zi is the ionic charge and the summation was carried out for all ionic species present in the medium fe2 cu2 na k mg2 al3 and ca2 the amount of material released from the anode to the solution was calculated by faraday s law eq 6 25 6 e c e l e c t r o d e k g m 3 i t m a n e f v 1000 where f is the faraday s constant 96 485 c mol i is electrical current a t is time s v is volume m3 n e is equal to the number of electrons and ma is al atomic mass g mol the faradaic efficiency was calculated under the best treatment conditions by means of eq 7 26 7 f e o c t c where oc observed coagulant is the experimentally determined mass of coagulant kg m3 and tc theoretical coagulant is the amount of coagulant released ecelectrodo kg m3 calculated by eq 6 the resulting ionic strength was 0 042 m and the al iii concentration was 3 28 mm these values were used to generate the speciation diagram with the purpose of ensuring that the flocs al oh 3 responsible for the organic and inorganic matter removal are being electro generated at the treatment ph 2 6 cost analysis according to literature 27 32 the cost of the ec treatment is the sum of the energy cost and electrode wear in this work the energy consumption of the pump and the cost generated by the sludge management were added as shown in eq 8 33 8 o p e r a t i o n c o s t a e c e l e c t r o d e e n e r g y b e c p u m p e n e r g y c e c e

currency per kwh 36 the exchange rate for mxn to usd was considered as 1 usd 22 68 mxn 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of industrial wastewater the physicochemical characteristics of the chocolate industry wastewater before ec treatment are summarized in table 1 the initial sample ph was 6 4 and was not adjusted at any time all the experiments were carried out at this initial value the chocolate industry sample showed a high organic content cod 1732 mg l and bod5 1399 8 mg l the biodegradability index bod5 cod was 0 8 so the wastewater sample was easily biodegradable in addition apparent color 1560 pt co units and turbidity 512 4 ntu were ascribed to a high content of colloidal matter so this type of water is suitable to be treated by ec the sample also had microbiological matter faecal and total coliforms 1 4 106 and 1 7 106 mpn this is because a fraction of the wastewater comes from the toilets this also explains the presence of nitrogen in the form of nitrites and nitrates 37 the inorganic matter was also quantified 711 4 mg l so4 2 this amount is the available for precipitation with the electrogenerated coagulant the determined phosphates concentration 26 9 mg l is low in the context of chocolate industry wastewater it is worth noticing that the removal of phosphorous and nitrogen is important to reduce excessive growth of algae and the oxygen depletion of the water body at the time of being discharged fluorides 0 3 mg l and chlorides 169 7 mg l were also detected chlorides might oxidize at the anode and indirectly promote the oxidation of organic matter by producing chlorine gas or hypochlorite in aqueous solution the physicochemical characterization and the determination of anions and cations were of great importance to calculate the ionic strength 0 042 m and to generate the speciation diagram figure s1 according to this diagram at ph 6 4 al oh 3 is produced this occurs by means of reaction 3 and this resulted in a ph increase there are in mexico two standards that regulate the pollutants concentration in waters to be discharged either in rivers and lakes nom 001 semarnat 1996 38 or in the municipal sewage nom 002 semarnat 1996 39 according to these standards the daily discharge of bod5 and cu should not be higher than 150 and 15 mg l respectively from the contaminants found in the chocolate industry wastewater table 1 only these two are regulated table 1 also summarizes the results of the physicochemical characterization of the wastewater after 30 min of treatment under i 3 16 a and ql 0 06 l s as shown in section 3 2 these were the experimental conditions at which the maximum cod and color removal were achieved in the shortest time as can be seen in table 1 the ph at the end of the treatment increased to 7 4 and this was ascribed to the produced aluminum hydroxides organic parameters as cod decreased from 1732 to 640 5 mg l achieving a removal efficiency of 63 bod was reduced from 1399 8 329 6 mg l 76 5 thus the biodegradability index also decreased to 0 5 which is consistent with less biodegradable matter after applying the ec treatment turbidity and color were successfully removed 92 6 and 96 9 respectively this can be ascribed to the suspended colloids being eliminated by their adsorption in the flocs microbiological parameters were decreased considerably after ec treatment faecal and total coliforms 200 mpn 100 ml were detected inorganic anions like sulphates were removed 26 9 probably as aluminium sulfate according to speciation diagrams the optimum precipitation of sulphates is ph 2 4 so the initial sample ph 6 4 did not favor this mechanism phosphates were also diminished 40 9 nevertheless this removal percentage was not as high as expected and this could be ascribed to two reasons the first one is related to the soluble chemical form at ph 6 4 as di hydrogen and hydrogen phosphate h2po4 and hpo4 2 according to the speciation diagram phosphates can precipitate at ph 12 the second reason of low removal could be associated to a relative low concentration of aluminum hydroxide that although efficiently removes cod and color was not enough to act as a chelating agent for phosphates and other anions on the other hand an increase of ammoniacal nitrogen from 10 mg l to 18 mg l was observed this could be associated to the oxidation of organic nitrogen due to the formation of chlorine gas by the anodic oxidation of chloride ions according to eq 10 10 2 c l c l 2 2 e clo might be produced by eq 11 11 h 2 o c l 2 2 c l o 2 h these species are also responsible for the disinfection process nitrates were reduced from 1 4 to 1 1 mg l 21 4 and nitrites from 0 9 to 0 4 mg l 55 4 this could be ascribed to the following electrochemical reactions 40 12 n o 3 h 2 o 2 e n o 2 2 o h 13 n o 3 3 h 2 o 5 e 1 2 n 2 6 o h 14 n o 3 6 h 2 o 8 e n h 3 9 o h 15 n o 2 2 h 2 o 3 e 1 2 n 2 4 o h 16 n o 2 5 h 2 o 6 e n h 3 7 o h 17 n o 2 4 h 2 o 4 e n h 2 o h 5 o h 18 n o 3 2 h 2 o n h 3 2 o 2 o h according to these reactions nitrite ions act as intermediate products and further react with water to generate nitrogen gas ammonia and hydroxylamine nh2oh reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas is the desired process but ammonia is usually formed and this might be the main reason for the ammoniacal nitrogen to increase after the ec treatment see table 1 although mexican standards nom 001 semarnat 1996 and nom 002 semarnat 1996 38 39 do not regulate the al concentration this was calculated with faraday s law the measured concentration in a sample without ph adjustment to avoid solids precipitation was 99 5 10 3 kg m3 the difference between the theoretical 88 35 10 3 kg m3 and measured al concentration could be associated to the super faradaic efficiency 41 which was calculated to be 112 6 by means of eq 7 3 2 effect of electrical current and volumetric flowrate fig 2 shows there is an important effect of i on both cod and colour removal according to fig 2 the liquid volumetric flowrate also exerts an important effect on cod removal but not on colour this effect is more pronounced in the first minutes of treatment and will be further discussed later in this section the effect of electrical current was expected because enhances anodic dissolution and therefore the amount of al released into solution actually the results in fig 2 suggest this step the released of the al into solution as limiting of the process when changing liquid volumetric flowrate what is actually changing is the contact time and the space velocity within the column where the electrodes are placed in this work this contact time τ refers to the time that the liquid volume where the electrodes are placed 1 68 l spends in contact with the electrodes and it can also be defined as the time per pass per the electrochemical section it is worth to remember that in this section the following steps are occurring i the electrochemical generation of al3 reaction 1 ii the transport of such ions to the bulk solution iii formation of coagulating species reactions 3 4 and iv bonding of certain pollutants to the coagulating species it is also worth clarifying that steps iii and iv might proceed also in the rest of the system i e piping pump and breaking vessel thus contact time is the available time for step i and ii to proceed per pass and not per treatment the latter treatment time is the total time that the liquid was recirculated through the whole system until the energy source was off this treatment time was 1 h for all experiments two liquid volumetric flowrates were tested 0 032 l s and 0 06 l s the corresponding contact times were 53 and 28 s respectively if this time is used in the faraday law the amount of al3 per pass can be calculated table 2 summarizes these values also as a function of applied electrical current also it can be observed in table 2 the effect of liquid volumetric flowrate and i on the initial cod removal rate it can be observed that there is not an effect on initial cod removal rate of applied electrical current at low volumetric flowrates since the generated al3 per pass increases when the applied electrical current increases then the observed increase in initial cod removal rate when the volumetric flowrate and the applied current increase can be ascribed to an improvement in step i and in mass transport so the other two steps are also enhanced the mass transport would be enhanced due to the increase in velocity and therefore in turbulence when only ql is increased and i is kept at its lowest value rcod o decreases despite the higher turbulence associated to the increase in velocity this can be ascribed to the lower amount of al3 generated per pass see table 2 fig 3 shows the effect of both variables electrical current and liquid volumetric flowrate on ph profiles it can be observed that at all experiments ph increases when treatment time increases the liquid volumetric flowrate affects the increase on ph only at low electrical currents while its effect is practically negligible at the highest applied electrical current the observed increase in ph is due to the generation of hydroxide ions in the medium 42 in order to establish the statistical significance of each studied variable a two factor ql and i anova with two replicas was conducted the response variables were color and cod removal table 3 summarizes the results of the aforementioned statistical analysis within a 95 level of confidence p 0 05 the relative value of f variances ratio was the criterion to decide whether or not the effect of a variable was statistically significant if fcal fcrit then the effect was considered significant 43 hence from the results shown in table 3 it can be concluded that regarding color the effect of i is more significant than ql effect this is truth only after 5 min of treatment in the first 5 min none of the studied variables appear to be more significant than the other regarding cod removal the results in table 3 indicate that the statistical significance of each variable changes with time interestingly enough in the first 5 min of treatment the factor that exerts the most significant effect is the interaction of both variables ql and i after 5 min however the variable with the most significant effect is only i this confirms that what limits the process in the first 5 min of treatment is the concentration of al3 into solution which is dictated by steps i and ii a higher ql not only improves mass transfer by increasing turbulence but also contributes to homogenize the al3 concentration in a shorter time than at a lower ql after 5 min the factor with the most significant effect is i this suggests a merely chemical step becoming the controlling one after five minutes this can be either step iii or iv step iii might be discarded since ph in the first 15 min only varies between 6 4 and 7 and therefore only al oh 3 is expected according to the speciation diagram step iv however not only depends on the concentration of the coagulating species but on the chemical affinity between these species and the ones remained in solution after 5 min a change in slope is evident in fig 2 this indicates that the compounds with chemical affinity with the coagulant species are being depleted therefore it can be concluded that after 5 min step iv becomes the controlling step because the concentration of the species to chemically bound to the coagulant has decreased 3 3 cost analysis in this work the electrode consumption was 88 35 10 3 kg al lost m3 the electrode energy consumption was 2 54 kwh m3 the pump energy consumption was 93 25 kwh m3 and the sludge production was equal to 119 2 10 3 kg m3 69 ml l the cost of this treatment was 4 01 usd m3 this cost was calculated taking into account the energy consumed by the pump the generated sludge and the electrodes wear the energy consumption and electrode wear calculated in this work were lower than those reported in other works albeit to treat other type of wastewater slaughterhouse wastewater 4 19 0 12 kw h m3 and 1 29 0 00 kg m3 44 sugar industry wastewater 42 kw h m3 and 0 795 kg m3 45 and dairy industry wastewater 45 kw h and 1 566 kg m3 46 it is worth pointing out that in these works cod was removed between 82 96 4 the cost of the photovoltaic installation was usd 284 68 this was calculated by taking into account the cost of one solar battery of deep cycle cale of 12 v 110ah usd 132 78 one solar panel iusa of 375 w usd 138 77 and one solar charge controller anself of 20a 12 v 24 v usd 13 13 because the life of solar panels is around 20 years the investment cost is considered minimum 3 4 gas production during the studied process the production of h2 n2 and cl2 gases is expected according to reactions 2 10 13 and 15 o2 generation might be occurring by the following reaction at the anode 19 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e it is worth pointing out that the gas produced was first dispersed in the liquid phase as bubbles and near to the end of treatment the mixture was accumulated on top of the column in any case a displacement of the liquid phase was observed the displaced liquid volume was accommodated in the breaking vessel see fig 1 the produced volume of gas was quantified by the method described in section 2 5 and it was 0 36 l after 30 min of treatment based on this volume and on the stoichiometry of reactions 2 and 19 the theoretical value of produced hydrogen and oxygen was 0 24 l and 0 12 respectively this would represent the minimum expected h2 content in the produced gas mixture however other authors 47 studied the electrocoagulation of surface water with al electrodes and determined that the h2 content was higher than 92 6 due to reactions 1 and 2 being predominant while reaction 19 was demonstrated to occur but at much lower extent regarding cl2 this gas is likely to be consumed via two reactions eq 11 and by reaction with the nitrogen organic matter thus its concentration in the resulting gas mixture can be assumed negligible regarding n2 its theoretical produced volume was calculated by the measured initial and final concentration of no3 and no2 and by taking into account the stoichiometry of reactions 13 and 15 based on this the produced n2 volume by reactions 15 and 17 after 30 min of treatment would be 1 3 ml and 2 9 ml respectively it is worth keeping in mind that these volumes were calculated considering that all the amount of removed nitrites and nitrates were consumed solely by reactions 13 and 15 however as previously mentioned in section 3 1 these ions are also likely to be consumed in reactions 12 14 16 and 18 and therefore the expected produced n2 is lower than the aforementioned thus as in the case of cl2 the total theoretical volume of produced n2 can be considered negligible in comparison with the theoretical h2 volume based on this analysis the obtained gas is expected to be rich in h2 at least 67 v v we believe that the ability of the system of retaining the hydrogen within the system is an important advantage of this technology for further applications the hydrogen produced in this way can be continuously taken out of the system and conducted to be used as reagent to other processes like fischer tropsch or co2 reduction 48 3 5 modelling one process that takes place at the electrodes surface specifically at the anode is the production of al3 according to reaction 1 the coagulation process then occurs by adsorption of the pollutants onto the flocs that have been formed thus the removal of pollutants by coagulation can be modelled as an adsorption process in this case a second order adsorption model was tested eq 20 20 d q d t k l q e q 2 this equation is solved by separating variables and integration considering that q 0 when t 0 and is qt at any treatment time the result is given by eq 21 21 t q t 1 k e q e 2 1 q e t where qt is the concentration of pollutants removed by coagulation at a given treatment time t and can be calculated according to eq 22 22 q t v c 0 c t m where v is the volume of treated wastewater and m is the mass of dissolved electrode which is a function of the applied current by substituting eq 22 in 21 and by grouping constants the following equation is obtained 23 t 1 c t c o b m t where ct is the chemical oxygen demand in mg l or color at any treatment time t while co is the initial chemical oxygen demand mg l or initial color b c 0 m v 1 k 2 q e 2 and m c t m v 1 q e k2 is the kinetic constant of second order adsorption model the group of constants b and m were found by plotting t 1 c c 0 vs t the obtained values are summarized in table 4 for both color and cod removal the excellent fitting of the experimental data by the second order adsorption model is also demonstrated in fig 4 therefore it can be concluded that the experimental data are well represented by eq 24 that is obtained by rearranging eq 23 24 c t c o 1 t m b t 4 conclusions a downflow column electrochemical reactor was successfully assessed by the first time in the electrocoagulation process using al electrodes to remediate wastewater from a chocolate industry a maximum of cod and color removal 63 and 97 respectively was reached after 20 min of treatment using an electrical current of 3 16 a and a liquid volumetric flowrate of 0 06 l s approximately 0 26 l of h2 are produced at this treatment time it was concluded that the first 5 min of the treatment are critical regarding cod and color removal in this period of time the interaction of electrical current and liquid volumetric flowrate is the factor with the most significant effect on cod removal regarding color removal it was concluded that there is not an appreciable difference in the effect of any of the studied variables until 10 min where the effect of electrical current became statistically significant the cost of this treatment was 4 01 usd m3 the treated effluent fulfils the mexican standard nom 02 semarnat 1996 the resulting data are well represented by a second order adsorption model declaration of

13430,electrocoagulation is a process that consists in the production of coagulant species by the dissolution of a sacrificial anode this work presents by the first time the performance of a downflow column electrochemical reactor dcer to conduct an electrocoagulation process to remove organic and inorganic matter from wastewater 6 l of a chocolate industry a deep flow battery connected to a solar panel was used to energize the aluminium electrodes the studied variables were electrical current i 1 58 a and 3 16 a and liquid volumetric flowrate ql 0 032 l s and 0 060 l s the response variables were cod and color removal it was concluded that during the first 5 min the interaction of both variables exerts the most significant effect on cod removal while for the rest of the treatment the effect of i is more statistically significant than ql regarding color an 80 was removed during the first 5 min of treatment it was also concluded that i 3 16 a and ql 0 06 l s were the conditions to reach the maximum cod and color removal 63 and 97 respectively in addition the hydrogen production was theoretically estimated to be 0 26 l after 20 min of treatment a cost analysis was conducted by taking into account the sludge management electrode consumption electricity consumption by electrodes and pump the calculated cost was 4 01 usd m3 a second order adsorption model was found to provide an excellent fitting of the experimental cod and color data keywords hydrogen production aluminium electrodes food industry electrochemical reactors electrocoagulators 1 introduction world population is constantly growing and this implies an increased consumption of services medicines chemical products clothes food and commodities the environmental impact of these industries is undeniable and the chocolate industry is not the exception in order to satisfy the worldwide demand chocolate is produced in large quantities every year 1 2 the chocolate industry generates different kind of waste like volatile compounds di and tri terpenes flavonoids polyphenols pyrroles methylxanthines aldehydes phospholipids mixtures ketones liquid cocoa butter triglycerides aliphatic alcohols glycolipids furans sterols and saturated fats 3 4 therefore the chocolate industry wastewater must be treated before being discharged and to do so biological treatments have been preferred this type of treatments however are lengthy and require a fine control of operational variables for the microorganisms to survive 5 this has motivated the assessment of alternative treatments like the electrochemical ones among electrochemical methods electrocoagulation ec allows to treat water with organic matter and suspended solids ec combines flotation coagulation and oxidation or reduction of pollutant compounds 6 in ec an anode and a cathode are necessary to carry out the treatment the anode works as a sacrificial electrode and by in situ electro dissolution provides the system with the coagulating agent this anode can be made of aluminium copper magnesium iron zinc and stainless steel 7 9 and in contact with the wastewater leads to hydrolysis products hydroxo metal species that are effective in the destabilization of pollutants concomitantly the reduction of water in the cathode produces hydrogen gas bubbles and hydroxide ions this increases ph in the bulk solution and produces sludge at the water surface and this facilitates its removal when al electrodes are used the following reactions are expected to proceed 10 anode 1 a l s a l a q 3 3 e cathode 2 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 o h a q in

suspended solids heavy metals fluorides hardness arsenic phosphates and pesticides 14 19 this process is typically conducted in batch electrochemical cells with continuous stirring at industrial scale however this might lead to mass transfer limitations thus reducing pollutants removal effectiveness in addition the electricity consumption sometimes limits the application of ec this work aimed to assess a rather novel technology in the field of electrochemistry a downflow column electrochemical reactor dcer this in an ejector type reactor that was originally conceived as gas absorber later on it evolved as three phase reactor 20 this is the first work where such a technology is applied to conduct an electrocoagulation process aluminium electrodes were used and an effluent from the chocolate industry was treated thus the effectiveness of the process was established it is also worth pointing out that the electrodes were energized by a deep flow battery connected to a solar panel in order to reduce the cost by electricity consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples the wastewater is typically transported from a chocolate industry to a treatment plant the sampling was conducted right before entering the treatment plant the wastewater was collected in 20 l plastic containers and kept at 4 c until treatment however the characterization was conducted within 24 h of collection 2 2 electrocoagulation treatment dcer consists of a downward parallel flow column that is shaped like a cylinder 100 cm of height and 5 cm of diameter with a capacity of 2 l the system is depicted in fig 1 it can be observed that the liquid phase is fed at the top of the column and recirculated through the whole system during the total treatment time this technology exploits an orifice at the top of the column to produce a venturi effect that promotes mass transfer the breaking vessel is a 5 l stainless steel reservoir with the following dimensions 20 10 2 m in diameter and 15 9 10 2 m in height there is a stainless steel coil heat exchanger placed inside this reservoir by means of this coil the temperature is kept constant since the pump transfers thermal energy to the solution the aluminium electrodes one pair of plates for the anode and one pair for the cathode were placed inside the column between each pair of aluminium plates there was a 0 5 cm gap and between the anode and cathode the separation distance was 1 10 2 m the aluminium plates dimensions were 92 5 10 2 m in length 0 318 10 2 m of thickness and a width of 2 4 10 2 m the total volume occupied by the electrodes was 0 282 l and therefore the total free volume inside the column was 1 682 l nevertheless at all experiments a total volume of 6 l was used and the studied liquid volumetric flowrates were 0 032 and 0 06 l s the samples 20 10 3 l were taken at the point indicated in fig 1 the energy was supplied by a deep flow battery charged by a solar panel connected to a charge controller this arrangement allowed to have a constant electrical current during the whole treatment despite using solar energy the electrical current supplied was 1 58 and 3 16 a the initial conductivity of the sample 785 8 μs cm was not enough to achieve the aforementioned electrical current values thus sodium sulfate 1 m was added in order to increase the conductivity up to 1680 μs cm the working ph was 6 4 initial ph of the wastewater sample at all experiments the treatment time was 1 h and were carried out by duplicate 2 3 methods of analysis the wastewater sample characterization was carried out according to apha 21 in this context turbidity ph color total and faecal coliforms chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 electrical conductivity sulphates nitrites nitrates ammoniacal nitrogen phosphates fluorides chlorides fe cu na k mg al and ca were determined for turbidity a 20 ml sample was analysed in a hf scientific micro100 laboratory turbidimeter the ph was monitored with a ph meter hanna hi98190 and the electrical conductivity with an ion450 radiometer regarding color the samples 10 ml were not filtered before this analysis thus the reported results correspond to the apparent colour this parameter was measured in a hach dr5000 spectrometer at 455 nm according to the pt co color method for the analysis of fluorides 0 5 ml of tisab ii solution were added to 5 ml of sample and the concentration of f was determined by a selective electrode with a hanna hi83308 instruments potentiometer nitrites and ammoniacal nitrogen were determined by the hach method using the reagents tnt 835 and tnt 83 respectively the metals concentration fe cu na k mg al and ca was determined by atomic absorption with a spectraa 240 fs spectrophotometer the following analyses were performed using mexican standards total and faecal coliforms nmx aa 42 1987 chemical oxygen demand cod nmx aa 030 2 scfi 2011 in a hach dr5000

analysed by a colorimetric titrometric method nitrates nmx aa 079 scfi 2001 and sulphates nmx aa 074 scfi 2014 by using a lambda 25 uv vis perkin elmer spectrometer the sludge was quantified by determination of settleable solids in raw and treated wastewater in ml l according to the mexican standard nmx aa 004 scfi 2000 22 once the sample was filtered the sludge was dried for 24 h at 105 c and then weighed 2 4 gas production in order to determine the volume of produced gas the shutting down method was applied this consists in simultaneously closing down the inlet and the exit valve of the dcer and switching off the pump by this means the gas dispersion bubbles collapses and a gas volume is observed on top of the liquid phase since the column was made of transparent glass this allowed to measure the volume occupied by the produced gas the plausible composition of the produced gas was established by considering the stoichiometry of the reactions where the expected gases h2 o2 n2 and cl2 are being produced and also consumed this analysis and its results are presented in section 3 3 2 5 species formation and quantification in order to establish the conditions ph interval at which the al oh 3 is predominant given a specific al iii concentration and the ionic strength a speciation diagram was generated via medusa program 23 the speciation diagram was generated at 3 16 a and at 30 min of treatment the ionic strength was calculated by using the ions concentration according to eq 5 24 5 i s 1 2 z i 2 c i here is is ionic strength ci is concentration mol l zi is the ionic charge and the summation was carried out for all ionic species present in the medium fe2 cu2 na k mg2 al3 and ca2 the amount of material released from the anode to the solution was calculated by

experimentally determined mass of coagulant kg m3 and tc theoretical coagulant is the amount of coagulant released ecelectrodo kg m3 calculated by eq 6 the resulting ionic strength was 0 042 m and the al iii concentration was 3 28 mm these values were used to generate the speciation diagram with the purpose of ensuring that the flocs al oh 3 responsible for the organic and inorganic matter removal are being electro generated at the treatment ph 2 6 cost analysis according to literature 27 32 the cost of the ec treatment is the sum of the energy cost and electrode wear in this work the energy

currency per kwh 36 the exchange rate for mxn to usd was considered as 1 usd 22 68 mxn 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of industrial wastewater the physicochemical characteristics of the chocolate industry wastewater before ec treatment are summarized in table 1 the initial sample ph was 6 4 and was not adjusted at any time all the experiments were carried out at this initial value the chocolate industry sample showed a high organic content cod 1732 mg l and bod5 1399 8 mg l the biodegradability index bod5 cod was 0 8 so the wastewater sample was easily biodegradable in addition apparent color 1560 pt co units and turbidity 512 4 ntu were ascribed to a high content of colloidal matter so this type of water is suitable to be treated by ec the sample also had microbiological matter faecal and total coliforms 1 4 106 and 1 7 106 mpn this is because a fraction of the wastewater comes from the toilets this also explains the presence of nitrogen in the form of nitrites and nitrates 37 the inorganic matter was also quantified 711 4 mg l so4 2 this amount is the available for precipitation with the electrogenerated coagulant the determined phosphates concentration 26 9 mg l is low in the context of chocolate industry wastewater it is worth noticing that the removal of phosphorous and nitrogen is important to reduce excessive growth of algae and the oxygen depletion of the water body at the time of being discharged fluorides 0 3 mg l and chlorides 169 7 mg l were also detected chlorides might oxidize at the anode and indirectly promote the oxidation of organic matter by producing chlorine gas or hypochlorite in aqueous solution the physicochemical characterization and the determination of anions and cations were of great importance to calculate the ionic strength 0 042 m and to generate the speciation diagram figure s1 according to this diagram at ph 6 4 al oh 3 is produced this occurs by means of reaction 3 and this resulted in a ph increase there are in mexico two standards that regulate the pollutants concentration in waters to be discharged either in rivers and lakes nom 001 semarnat 1996 38 or in the municipal sewage nom 002 semarnat 1996 39 according to these standards the daily discharge of bod5 and cu should not be higher than 150 and 15 mg l respectively from the contaminants found in the chocolate industry wastewater table 1 only these two are regulated table 1 also summarizes the results of the physicochemical characterization of the wastewater after 30 min of treatment under i 3 16 a and ql 0 06 l s as shown in section 3 2 these were the experimental conditions at which the maximum cod and color removal were achieved in the shortest time as can be seen in table 1 the ph at the end of the treatment increased to 7 4 and this was ascribed to the produced aluminum hydroxides organic parameters as cod decreased from 1732 to 640 5 mg l achieving a removal efficiency of 63 bod was reduced from 1399 8 329 6 mg l 76 5 thus the biodegradability index also decreased to 0 5 which is consistent with less biodegradable matter after applying the ec treatment turbidity and color were successfully removed 92 6 and 96 9 respectively this can be ascribed to the suspended colloids being eliminated by their adsorption in the flocs microbiological parameters were decreased considerably after ec treatment faecal and total coliforms 200 mpn 100 ml were detected inorganic anions like sulphates were removed 26 9 probably as aluminium sulfate according to speciation diagrams the optimum precipitation of sulphates is ph 2 4 so the initial sample ph 6 4 did not favor this mechanism phosphates were also diminished 40 9 nevertheless this removal percentage was not as high as expected and this could be ascribed to two reasons the first one is related to the soluble chemical form at ph 6 4 as di hydrogen and hydrogen phosphate h2po4 and hpo4 2 according to the speciation diagram phosphates can precipitate at ph 12 the second reason of low removal could be associated to a relative low concentration of aluminum hydroxide that although efficiently removes cod and color was not enough to act as a chelating agent for phosphates and other anions on the other hand an increase of ammoniacal nitrogen from 10 mg l to 18 mg l was observed this could be associated to the oxidation of organic nitrogen due to the formation of chlorine gas by the anodic oxidation of chloride ions according to eq 10 10 2 c l c l 2 2 e clo might be produced by eq 11 11 h 2 o c l 2 2 c l o 2 h these species are also responsible for the disinfection process nitrates were reduced from 1 4 to 1 1 mg l 21 4 and nitrites from 0 9 to 0 4 mg l 55 4 this could be ascribed to the following electrochemical reactions 40 12 n o 3 h 2 o 2 e n o 2 2 o h 13 n o 3 3 h 2 o 5 e 1 2 n 2 6 o h 14 n o 3 6 h 2 o 8 e n h 3 9 o h 15 n o 2 2 h 2 o 3 e 1 2 n 2 4 o h 16 n o 2 5 h 2 o 6 e n h 3 7 o h 17 n o 2 4 h 2 o 4 e n h 2 o h 5 o h 18 n o 3 2 h 2 o n h 3 2 o 2 o h according to these reactions nitrite ions act as intermediate products and further react with water to generate nitrogen gas ammonia and hydroxylamine nh2oh reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas is the desired process but ammonia is usually formed and this might be the main reason for the ammoniacal nitrogen to increase after the ec treatment see table 1 although mexican standards nom 001 semarnat 1996 and nom 002 semarnat 1996 38 39 do not regulate the al concentration this was calculated with faraday s law the measured concentration in a sample without ph adjustment to avoid solids precipitation was 99 5 10 3 kg m3 the difference between the theoretical 88 35 10 3 kg m3 and measured al concentration could be associated to the super faradaic efficiency 41 which was calculated to be 112 6 by means of eq 7 3 2 effect of electrical current and volumetric flowrate fig 2 shows there is an important effect of i on both cod and colour removal according to fig 2 the liquid volumetric flowrate also exerts an important effect on cod removal but not on colour this effect is more pronounced in the first minutes of treatment and will be further discussed later in this section the effect of electrical current was expected because enhances anodic dissolution and therefore the amount of al released into solution actually the results in fig 2 suggest this step the released of the al into solution as limiting of the process when changing liquid volumetric flowrate what is actually changing is the contact time and the space velocity within the column where the electrodes are placed in this work this contact time τ refers to the time that the liquid volume where the electrodes are placed 1 68 l spends in contact with the electrodes and it can also be defined as the time per pass per the electrochemical section it is worth to remember that in this section the following steps are occurring i the electrochemical generation of al3 reaction 1 ii the transport of such ions to the bulk solution iii formation of coagulating species reactions 3 4 and iv bonding of certain pollutants to the coagulating species it is also worth clarifying that steps iii and iv might proceed also in the rest of the system i e piping pump and breaking vessel thus contact time is the available time for step i and ii to proceed per pass and not per treatment the latter treatment time is the total time that the liquid was recirculated through the whole system until the energy source was off this treatment time was 1 h for all experiments two liquid volumetric flowrates were tested 0 032 l s and 0 06 l s the corresponding contact times were 53 and 28 s respectively if this time is used in the faraday law the amount of al3 per pass can be calculated table 2 summarizes these values also as a function of applied electrical current also it can be observed in table 2 the effect of liquid volumetric flowrate and i on the initial cod removal rate it can be observed that there is not an effect on initial cod removal rate of applied electrical current at low volumetric flowrates since the generated al3 per pass increases when the applied electrical current increases then the observed increase in initial cod removal rate when the volumetric flowrate and the applied current increase can be ascribed to an improvement in step i and in mass transport so the other two steps are also enhanced the mass transport would be enhanced due to the increase in velocity and therefore in turbulence when only ql is increased and i is kept at its lowest value rcod o decreases despite the higher turbulence associated to the increase in velocity this can be ascribed to the lower amount of al3 generated per pass see table 2 fig 3 shows the effect of both variables electrical current and liquid volumetric flowrate on ph profiles it can be observed that at all experiments ph increases when treatment time increases the liquid volumetric flowrate affects the increase on ph only at low electrical currents while its effect is practically negligible at the highest applied electrical current the observed increase in ph is due to the generation of hydroxide ions in the medium 42 in order to establish the statistical significance of each studied variable a two factor ql and i anova with two replicas was conducted the response variables were color and cod removal table 3 summarizes the results of the aforementioned statistical analysis within a 95 level of confidence p 0 05 the relative value of f variances ratio was the criterion to decide whether or not the effect of a variable was statistically significant if fcal fcrit then the effect was considered significant 43 hence from the results shown in table 3 it can be concluded that regarding color the effect of i is more significant than ql effect this is truth only after 5 min of treatment in the first 5 min none of the studied variables appear to be more significant than the other regarding cod removal the results in table 3 indicate that the statistical significance of each variable changes with time interestingly enough in the first 5 min of treatment the factor that exerts the most significant effect is the interaction of both variables ql and i after 5 min however the variable with the most significant effect is only i this confirms that what limits the process in the first 5 min of treatment is the concentration of al3 into solution which is dictated by steps i and ii a higher ql not only improves mass transfer by increasing turbulence but also contributes to homogenize the al3 concentration in a shorter time than at a lower ql after 5 min the factor with the most significant effect is i this suggests a merely chemical step becoming the controlling one after five minutes this can be either step iii or iv step iii might be discarded since ph in the first 15 min only varies between 6 4 and 7 and therefore only al oh 3 is expected according to the speciation diagram step iv however not only depends on the concentration of the coagulating species but on the chemical affinity between these species and the ones remained in solution after 5 min a change in slope is evident in fig 2 this indicates that the compounds with chemical affinity with the coagulant species are being depleted therefore it can be concluded that after 5 min step iv becomes the controlling step because the concentration of the species to chemically bound to the coagulant has decreased 3 3 cost analysis in this work the electrode consumption was 88 35 10 3 kg al lost m3 the electrode energy consumption was 2 54 kwh m3 the pump energy consumption was 93 25 kwh m3 and the sludge production was equal to 119 2 10 3 kg m3 69 ml l the cost of this treatment was 4 01 usd m3 this cost was calculated taking into account the energy consumed by the pump the generated sludge and the electrodes wear the energy consumption and electrode wear calculated in this work were lower than those reported in other works albeit to treat other type of wastewater slaughterhouse wastewater 4 19 0 12 kw h m3 and 1 29 0 00 kg m3 44 sugar industry wastewater 42 kw h m3 and 0 795 kg m3 45 and dairy industry wastewater 45 kw h and 1 566 kg m3 46 it is worth pointing out that in these works cod was removed between 82 96 4 the cost of the photovoltaic installation was usd 284 68 this was calculated by taking into account the cost of one solar battery of deep cycle cale of 12 v 110ah usd 132 78 one solar panel iusa of 375 w usd 138 77 and one solar charge controller anself of 20a 12 v 24 v usd 13 13 because the life of solar panels is around 20 years the investment cost is considered minimum 3 4 gas production during the studied process the production of h2 n2 and cl2 gases is expected according to reactions 2 10 13 and 15 o2 generation might be occurring by the following reaction at the anode 19 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e it is worth pointing out that the gas produced was first dispersed in the liquid phase as bubbles and near to the end of treatment the mixture was accumulated on top of the column in any case a displacement of the liquid phase was observed the displaced liquid volume was accommodated in the breaking vessel see fig 1 the produced volume of gas was quantified by the method described in section 2 5 and it was 0 36 l after 30 min of treatment based on this volume and on the stoichiometry of reactions 2 and 19 the theoretical value of produced hydrogen and oxygen was 0 24 l and 0 12 respectively this would represent the minimum expected h2 content in the produced gas mixture however other authors 47 studied the electrocoagulation of surface water with al electrodes and determined that the h2 content was higher than 92 6 due to reactions 1 and 2 being predominant while reaction 19 was demonstrated to occur but at much lower extent regarding cl2 this gas is likely to be consumed via two reactions eq 11 and by reaction with the nitrogen organic matter thus its concentration in the resulting gas mixture can be assumed negligible regarding n2 its theoretical produced volume was calculated by the measured initial and final concentration of no3 and no2 and by taking into account the stoichiometry of reactions 13 and 15 based on this the produced n2 volume by reactions 15 and 17 after 30 min of treatment would be 1 3 ml and 2 9 ml respectively it is worth keeping in mind that these volumes were calculated considering that all the amount of removed nitrites and nitrates were consumed solely by reactions 13 and 15 however as previously mentioned in section 3 1 these ions are also likely to be consumed in reactions 12 14 16 and 18 and therefore the expected produced n2 is lower than the aforementioned thus as in the case of cl2 the total theoretical volume of produced n2 can be considered negligible in comparison with the theoretical h2 volume based on this analysis the obtained gas is expected to be rich in h2 at least 67 v v we believe that the ability of the system of retaining the hydrogen within the system is an important advantage of this technology for further applications the hydrogen produced in this way can be continuously taken out of the system and conducted to be used as reagent to other processes like fischer tropsch or co2 reduction 48 3 5 modelling one process that takes place at the electrodes surface specifically at the anode is the production of al3 according to reaction 1 the coagulation process then occurs by adsorption of the pollutants onto the flocs that have been formed thus the removal of pollutants by coagulation can be modelled as an adsorption process in this case a second order adsorption model was tested eq 20 20 d q d t k l q e q 2 this equation is solved by separating variables and integration considering that q 0 when t 0 and is qt at any treatment time the result is given by eq 21 21 t q t 1 k e q e 2 1 q e t where qt is the concentration of pollutants removed by coagulation at a given treatment time t and can be calculated according to eq 22 22 q t v c 0 c t m where v is the volume of treated wastewater and m is the mass of dissolved electrode which is a function of the applied current by substituting eq 22 in 21 and by grouping constants the following equation is obtained 23 t 1 c t c o b m t where ct is the chemical oxygen demand in mg l or color at any treatment time t while co is the initial chemical oxygen demand mg l or initial color b c 0 m v 1 k 2 q e 2 and m c t m v 1 q e k2 is the kinetic constant of second order adsorption model the group of constants b and m were found by plotting t 1 c c 0 vs t the obtained values are summarized in table 4 for both color and cod removal the excellent fitting of the experimental data by the second order adsorption model is also demonstrated in fig 4 therefore it can be concluded that the experimental data are well represented by eq 24 that is obtained by rearranging eq 23 24 c t c o 1 t m b t 4 conclusions a downflow column electrochemical reactor was successfully assessed by the first time in the electrocoagulation process using al electrodes to remediate wastewater from a chocolate industry a maximum of cod and color removal 63 and 97 respectively was reached after 20 min of treatment using an electrical current of 3 16 a and a liquid volumetric flowrate of 0 06 l s approximately 0 26 l of h2 are produced at this treatment time it was concluded that the first 5 min of the treatment are critical regarding cod and color removal in this period of time the interaction of electrical current and liquid volumetric flowrate is the factor with the most significant effect on cod removal regarding color removal it was concluded that there is not an appreciable difference in the effect of any of the studied variables until 10 min where the effect of electrical current became statistically significant the cost of this treatment was 4 01 usd m3 the treated effluent fulfils the mexican standard nom 02 semarnat 1996 the resulting data are well represented by a second order adsorption model declaration of

13431,this study evaluated the effects of chemically enhanced primary treatment cept on co treatment of landfill leachate and sewage in publicly owned treatment works potws two most frequently used coagulants in cept ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate were studied bulk organic matter ph variation uv absorption etc were evaluated during the treatment processes 54 74 organic matter removal was achieved by ferric and aluminum coagulants ferric coagulant was found to perform better for organic matter removal than aluminum in most cases notably ferric chloride coagulation increased the uv absorbance of treated leachate significantly by up to 10 times while aluminum sulphate only slightly decreased it theoretical models are discussed to elucidate co precipitation behaviors under various ph scenarios it is exacerbated by the complexes formed by ferric and organic matter which have characteristic light absorption in the uv range the formation of such complexes is supported by the fourier transform infra red ftir spectroscopy in addition the volatile acids in leachate were found to play an important role in mediating ph through their buffering capacity keywords landfill leachate chemically enhanced primary treatment uv quenching phenomenon dissolved organic carbon metal complexation 1 introduction in the usa 50 60 of the municipal solid waste msw is disposed of in landfills as it is the most economical and convenient method based on an us epa survey 1 in landfills a large volume of leachate is generated continuously based on an survey by the environmental research and education foundation eref approximately 27 billion liters of leachate was generated in 2017 in the u s 2 more than 60 of the landfill leachate is discharged to publicly owned treatment works potws in the u s as it is convenient and cost effective 2 4 in a landfill the cost of leachate management contributes the highest portion among all operation and maintenance hence co treatment with sewage in potws is the most common practice for leachate disposal 5 over the recent decade potws have been switching from chlorination to other disinfection alternatives because chlorine disinfection has been found to produce secondary contamination due to production of disinfectant by products dbps uv disinfection is a promising method because it is highly effective dbp free chemical free etc however landfill leachate that contains a high concentration of organic matter can interfere with the uv disinfection process as the recalcitrant organic matter can strongly absorb the uv light 6 7 even after upfront biological treatment the residual recalcitrant organic matter further interferes with the downstream uv disinfection in potws 8 hence potws are prudential on accepting landfill leachate 4 in wastewater treatment practices potws operating with a uv disinfection unit typically requires 60 65 transmittance at 254 nm wavelength to achieve the appropriate level of disinfection 9 chemically enhanced primary treatment cept is a chemical treatment used in potws to enhance the removal of suspended solids organic matter and nutrients such as phosphorus in the cept process chemical coagulants are typically added to the primary sedimentation basin cept can help reduce the solids and organic loading rate on biological treatment the treatment infrastructure requirement and overall capital cost 10 cept process is also considered to be a cost effective method for wastewater treatment in developing countries 11 as it is advantageous in saving footprint 12 has low energy requirement 13 and is easy to operate and maintain 14 the efficiency of cept in a primary treatment facility depends on the type and dose of coagulant ph level temperature and alkalinity 15 hence cept which is coagulation flocculation in essence can potentially remove the recalcitrant organic matter carried by landfill leachate and potentially have beneficial impacts on the uv disinfection during sewage leachate co treatment in potws however it has also been found that coagulant with metal salts can increase the uv absorbance due to the interaction between metal cations and organic matter or macromolecules such as humic acid such phenomenon has been reported in previous studies where interaction between ferric ion and organic macromolecules increases the uv absorbance 16 17 in this experimental study the overall goal is to mimic the scenario that sewage and landfill leachate are co treated in a potw using cept methods in order to evaluate the overall treatment efficacy and beneficial effects of cept for the co treatment especially the effects on the uv quenching phenomenon the objectives are a to evaluate the overall organic matter removal performance of cept in co treatment of landfill leachate and sewage b to reveal the exacerbating effect of uv quenching by cept and c to provide theoretical explanations for the effects of cept on uv quenching 2 materials and methods 2 1 leachate sample leachate samples were collected from landfill sites a and b in virginia and ohio respectively in each landfill site leachate samples were collected from two different zones denoted as normal leachate and concentrated leachate respectively leachate samples were collected by landfill site engineers and was shipped to the research laboratory in an opaque sealed bucket in 5 gallon sealed opaque buckets shipped to the research laboratory and stored at 4 c before further testing and analysis the concentrated leachates were collected from zones experiencing elevated temperature while normal leachates were collected from zone with normal conditions landfills or the zones in landfills experiencing elevated temperature have been found to generate acidic and concentrated leachates with high organic matter and metal concentration 18 table 1 shows the characteristics of the raw leachate collected from the two different zones in each site it was observed that the normal leachate and concentrated leachate are very different in terms of physical chemical and biochemical characteristics as reported in table 1 water quality parameters for the normal leachate samples from both sites had ph in the neutral to alkaline range 7 and had lower bod 1300 4000 mg l and cod 18 000 mg l concentration levels while both the concentrated leachate samples that were collected from elevated temperature zone were found to acidic ph 5 5 and significantly higher bod 30 000 mg l and cod 100 000 mg l concentration level however in terms of nitrogen all leachate samples showed similar concentration levels in the range of 2000 mg l where majority of the total nitrogen was contributed approx 50 75 by ammoniacal nitrogen these characteristics of leachate are similar to previously reported values 18 2 2 coagulants 97 102 ferric chloride cas 10025 77 1 with molecular weight of 270 3 g mol beantown chemical hudson nh usa and 99 99 aluminum sulphate cas 10043 01 3 with molecular weight of 342 15 g mol vwr international radnor pa usa were used as coagulants ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate were chosen as coagulants as they are industrially accepted and widely applied in water and wastewater treatment in primary treatment stock solutions of the coagulants were prepared and stored at 4 c for experimental use the concentration of prepared stock solutions of ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate was 10 g l application of stock solution is preferred compared to adding solid coagulant for testing since the dissolved coagulants can mix rapidly compared to the solid coagulant for every coagulation experiment fresh stock solutions were prepared on weekly basis for quality control 2 3 experimental setup jar test experiments were set up to replicate cept treatment experiments were carried out using a velp flocculator jar testers with six paddles cole parmer vernon hills il usa that comply with astm d2035 19 samples were prepared by mixing 5 leachate and 95 sewage to mimic the blending of sewage and landfill leachate in potws then coagulation flocculation tests were performed on these samples prior to running any jar test samples were brought to room temperature and filtered through 0 45 μm filter paper the 10 g l of stock solutions for each coagulant was used to add the coagulants to each jar with different doses for this study no fixed coagulant range was predetermined as the normal leachate and concentrated leachate had significantly different organic matter concentration levels hence in this study the coagulant dose was added in increments of 200 mg l using the 10 g l stock solution until a plateau trend was observed in the organic matter removal indicating a maximum percentage removal achievable as per the standard method astm d 2035 19 1 min of rapid mixing at 100 rpm and 30 min of slow mixing at 25 rpm was performed after the addition of coagulant stock solution to each jar at different doses after the mixing 30 min was considered for settlement of precipitates the supernatants from the jar test were collected after filtering through 0 45 μm filter paper to remove precipitates completely the filtered supernatants were collected and stored at 4 c for further analysis the same coagulation flocculation experiments were conducted for a mixture of 5 leachate and 95 de ionized water for a to compare the result with co treatment of landfill leachate and sewage and b to determine whether sewage has a different effect on the treatment than water de ionized water was collected from a benchtop milli q water purification system milliporesigma burlington ma usa for the experiments the results for the experiments for 5 leachate and 95 de ionized water have been shown in the supporting documents for reference 2 4 chemical analysis all the tests were carried out by following standard methods provided by american public health association apha 19 all the glassware

one key factor for uv spectroscopy was filtering the supernatant by 0 45 μm filter paper to avoid any error in uv absorbance testing due to solids in the supernatant as suspended and colloidal solids can scatter the light and cause the change in the value of uv absorbance samples for ft ir spectroscopy were prepared by freeze drying the supernatants and preparing kcl pellet with a hydraulic press

spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa was used for generating ft ir spectra provided in the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic matter removal fig 1 shows the cod removal for normal and concentrated leachate samples from sites a and b by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively fig 1 a is for site a as shown in fig 1 a the cod concentration of site a normal leachate was decreased from 990 mg l to 459 mg l and 365 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively and the cod concentration of site a concentrated leachate decreased from 4592 mg l to 3136 mg l and 3178 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively as shown in fig 1 a maximum cod removal of 63 35 by aluminum sulphate and 31 71 by ferric chloride was achieved for site a normal and concentrated leachates respectively figs 1 b is for site b as shown in fig 1 b cod concentration of site b normal leachate decreased from 898 mg l to 232 mg l and 521 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively and cod concentration of site b concentrated leachate as shown in fig 1 b decreased from 5320 mg l to 3825 mg l and 5020 mg l to 3990 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively as shown in fig 1 b maximum cod removal of 74 16 and 28 1 was achieved by ferric chloride for site b normal and concentrated leachates respectively for a conventional primary sedimentation tank or clarifier the expected percentage removal for organic matter is 25 40 20 although for enhanced treatment such as cept the expected percentage removal is 50 70 21 based on fig 1 treatment performance of both the coagulants for sites a and b normal leachate was in typical range of cept method however neither aluminum sulphate nor ferric chloride could perform effectively for sites a and b concentrated leachate although not a monitored parameter for potws discharging limits toc is an important parameter to indicate the organic carbon concentration as organic carbon or the compounds containing organic carbon are the major contributor to uv absorbance fig 2 shows toc removal for normal and concentrated leachate samples from sites a and b by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively fig 2 a is for site a as shown toc concentration of normal leachate decreased from about 180 mg l to 93 2 mg l and 90 0 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively for concentrated leachate 1800 mg l of toc was decreased to 1 103 8 mg l and 1 217 5 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively as shown in fig 2 a a maximum toc removal of 53 8 by aluminum sulphate and 38 8 by ferric chloride was achieved for site a normal and concentrated leachates respectively fig 2 b is for site b for normal leachate the toc concentration dropped from 133 4 mg l to 59 0 mg l and 97 9 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively for concentrated leachate toc concentration decreased from 1 700 0 mg l to 1 196 5 mg l and 1 358 0 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively as shown in fig 2 b a maximum of 63 9 and 31 6 of toc concentration was removed by ferric chloride from site b normal and concentrated leachates respectively figs 1 and 2 provide the evidence to the effectiveness of cept in the removal of organic matter from leachate sewage co treatment based on several previous published works it was found that the amount of coagulant dose required for coagulation flocculation process is directly related to the initial concentration of organic matter in the leachate sample 22 26 compared to these previous studies in this study coagulant dose was applied in increment of 200 mg l until a flat curve was obtained for organic matter removal to evaluate the coagulant dose required for coagulation flocculation for two leachate samples that have significantly different water quality characteristics especially organic matter and ph few studies show similar removal efficiency with this study at higher coagulant dose and at lower ph level 27 28 these studies also show that ferric chloride tends to perform better in organic matter removal compared to other coagulants such as aluminum sulphate poly aluminum chloride pac ferrous sulphate and ferrous chloride supporting the result in this study previous studies provide following points for leachate treatment with coagulation and flocculation i high coagulant dose is required for both ferric and alum for high strength leachate ii cod removal is extremely difficult in case of high strength leachate than low strength leachate due to low biodegradability iii ferric chloride tends to perform better in cod removal than aluminum sulphate like the studies mentioned above this study shows that high dosage is required to achieve higher organic matter removal from highly concentrated landfill leachates by cept however in terms of practical application using such high coagulant dose may raise concern in term of cost chemical handling sludge production and dissolved solids of high coagulant dosage in addition the difference of organics removal rates of normal leachates up to 74 in terms of cod and 64 in terms of toc and concentrated leachates up to 32 in terms of cod and 39 in terms of toc is caused by their different organic compositions in normal leachate samples both sites a and b a considerable portion of cod is contributed by recalcitrant humic substances which are higher molecular weight and prone to be removed with coagulation flocculation 7 while concentrated leachate samples in both sites a and b contain a significant amount of short chain organic acids shown in table 1 that tend to stay soluble in a coagulation flocculation process and limited removal could be achieved 29 while the percentage removal is lower for the concentrated leachate samples the mass removal on a unit volume basis is higher than that for normal leachate samples 3 2 change in ph ph is a major factor that affects the effectiveness of the coagulation flocculation and precipitation processes due to the different solubility of the metal ion at different ph and the availability of hydroxyl group for complexation for that purpose the change in ph was recorded to observe the effects of ph on treatment performance and solubility of ferric and aluminum ion in the supernatant after the treatment fig 3 shows the change in ph in all four samples by both ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate as mentioned above for optimum removal of contaminants ph for both ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate should be in an optimum range of 5 5 8 5 30 if ph is below 5 the solubility of both metal ions will increase and impact the coagulation flocculation performance as shown in fig 3 a decrease in ph was observed due to the addition of both ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate however different trends were observed for aluminum sulphate and ferric chloride aluminum sulphate did not cause any dramatic change in ph for either normal or concentrated leachate from sites a and b after aluminum sulphate was dosed the ph decreased from 7 6 to 6 and from 6 6 to 5 for site a normal and concentrated leachate respectively and for site b aluminum sulphate lowered the ph from 8 16 to 5 16 and from 6 4 to 4 7 for normal and concentrated leachate respectively different from aluminum based coagulant ferric chloride caused much greater ph change especially for normal leachate samples the change in ph caused by ferric chloride for normal leachate from sites a and b was found significant fig 3 shows that when more than 540 mg l of ferric chloride was dosed the ph dropped dramatically to 2 or lower for normal leachate from both sites a and b meanwhile ferric chloride did not have such impact on ph level for concentrated leachate from sites a and b for concentrated leachate from sites a and b the ph reduced from 6 6 to 3 9 and from 6 4 to 3 54 respectively fig 3 shows that when ferric chloride is dosed in high amounts it will reduce the ph below 5 which is a solubility threshold for ferric ions below which hydrolyzed ferric complexes become soluble previous studies on various coagulants have also showed similar results where ph plays a vital role in effective in coagulation or charge neutralization necessary for nom removal a study showed that when ph 4 both ferric and aluminum hydrolyze to form hexa aqua complexes in aqueous medium that are more unstable and soluble at acidic ph and undergo further hydrolysis to reduce the ph even more acidic 31 32 the different behaviors of ph change during ferric chloride coagulation between normal and concentrated leachates are believed due to the buffer effect of the high level of short chain organic acids in found in leachate samples short chain organic acids or volatile acids vas are weak organic acids and their conjugate base stay in equilibrium in a solvent in this case leachate volatile acids have lower dissociation constant pka value which gives them the buffer capacity or resistance in simple terms towards the change in ph some commonly known volatile acids are acetic acid butyric acid propionic acid etc these acids are also considered as volatile fatty acids vfas that are typically produced during the acidogenesis phase during decomposition of organic waste in landfills volatile acids vas test was conducted for raw leachate sample only to understand how the concentration levels of these acids play a role in change in ph during coagulation by providing a buffer capacity to the leachate volatile acids vas test determined that leachate a and b normal sample had a total vas concentration of 785 mg l and 1628 mg l respectively while concentrated leachate for a and b had 22 850 mg l and 27 700 mg l of va concentration respectively as shown in figure s8 hence concentrated leachate had significantly higher vas concentration than normal leachate for both a and b sample carbon chain may vary in volatile acids hence total volatile acid concentration was measured in mg l as ch3cooh acetic acid by connecting the results from the change in ph and the volatile acids test it can be said that there is a possibility of observing residual soluble metal cations after coagulation but the observation for normal and concentrated sample would be significantly different due to high buffer capacity from volatile acids concentrated leachate samples can handle more ferric than normal before residual fe increases that results in increase in the uv absorbance post coagulation figs 4 and 5 provide the results obtained for residual ferric and aluminum concentration in the supernatants it is shown that for all the leachate samples the concentration of aluminum decreased and reached approximately zero even for higher coagulant dose however a different trend was observed for ferric chloride for normal leachate from sites a and b it can be seen from fig 4 that after a certain amount of ferric chloride dose i e 540 mg l the residual ferric concentration increased and kept on increasing with the dose also when compared to fig 3 after 540 mg l of ferric chloride dose the ph dropped below 5 and as aforementioned soluble hydrolyzed ferric complexes increases resulting in increase in residual ferric post coagulation while for concentrated leachate from sites a and b it was found that for the lowest dose the residual ferric concentration increased after a higher dose was applied it decreased then increased again after 900 mg l or more dose of ferric chloride was applied the increase of iron concentration coincides with the ph drop as shown in fig 3 similarly when more than 900 mg l of ferric chloride was added for concentrated leachate from site a and b the ph dropped below 5 as shown in fig 3 resulting in increased residual ferric post treatment in form of soluble hydrolyzed ferric complexes as shown in fig 4 and the reason stated above it can be said that the removal of uv254 absorbance significantly depends on residual metal concentration and ph and this study aims to explain the correlation between ph residual metal concentration and uv254 absorbance and its effect on uv removal for domestic wastewater optimum ph for the coagulation process is 6 8 for ferric chloride and 6 9 for aluminum sulphate 21 while for landfill leachate previous studies show that the optimum ph required is 7 10 5 for both ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate 23 24 26 33 34 in some practices ph is adjusted before coagulation to improve the removal efficiency of primary treatment however potws do not always adjust the ph as introduction of extra chemicals may increase the cost of operation elevate the effluent dissolved solids and may have aftereffects on the downstream processes hence in this study ph adjustment was not carried out 3 3 co precipitation behaviors of ferric chloride as function of ph fig 6 illustrates the hypothetical models that can explicate the co precipitation behaviors of ferric chloride and leachate organic matter in this study under various ph scenarios 3 3 1 scenario 1 ph is in neutral range above 6 scenario 1 a when the ph was in the neutral range i e above 6 the coagulation mechanism followed precipitation and sweep flocculation for both leachate a and b normal and concentrated as shown in figs 3 and 4 for leachate a and b normal from coagulant dose 180 mg l to 540 mg l precipitation and sweep flocculation was observed and no residual ferric was detected similarly for leachate a and b concentrated from coagulant dose 360 mg l to 900 mg l coagulation mechanism followed by precipitation and sweep flocculation minimal residual ferric concentration was found fig 6 a shows the stepwise coagulation mechanism for precipitation and sweep flocculation an effective coagulation occurs when critical coagulation concentration ccc is used where the critical coagulation concentration ccc can be defined as the minimum concentration of cations required to neutralize and destabilize the anionic organic matter for coagulation of colloidal particles hence effective coagulation such as this can be achieved when ph of the solution colloidal concentration in the solution and critical coagulant concentration ccc are in relation with each other as shown in figure s9 taken from 35 36 for zone 2 and zone 4 fig 6 a shows the coagulation mechanism for scenario 1 a where precipitation and sweep flocculation take place scenario 1 b however as shown in fig 4 for leachate a and b concentrated when 180 mg l of ferric chloride was dosed the residual ferric concentration was found to increase even when the ph was close to 6 such observation is explained by the concept of critical coagulant concentration ccc and colloidal or particulate matter concentration 4 a study 4 discusses the relation between ccc and colloidal concentration and indicated that when the colloidal organic matter concentration is low the required ccc is higher compared to the case of high colloidal organic matter concentration figure s9 shows the relationship between ccc and colloidal concentration 35 36 in this study the organic matter is classified as humic like substances high molecular weight compounds and short chain organic acids the colloidal organic matter refers to the humic like substances which are more settleable and can be destabilized much easily than short chain organic acids studies have shown that normal leachate and concentrated leachate have different proportions of humic like substances and humic like substance fraction is higher in normal leachate than concentrated leachate 5 6 29 37 in this study it is shown that organic matter in normal leachate is humic like substances dominated while concentrated leachate short chain organic acids dominated due to insufficient amount of colloidal concentration and coagulant dosage this condition is observed for concentrated leachate which has lower proportion of humic like substance compared to normal leachate this scenario corresponds to the point x shown in figure s9 the mechanism for this scenario is shown in fig 6 b 3 3 2 scenario 2 ph is acidic below 6 based on previous theories optimum ph for ferric chloride coagulation is 5 8 where residual metal concentration increased below ph 5 3 4 similarly in this study it was observed that the residual ferric concentration increased when ph dropped below 5 for example after dosing 540 mg l of ferric chloride the ph dropped below 5 and the residual metal concentration increased for leachate a and b normal as shown in figs 3 and 4 and after dosing 900 mg l of ferric chloride the ph dropped below 5 for leachate a and b concentrated which resulted in increase in residual ferric concentration as shown in figs 3 and 4 the sudden drop in ph observed by ferric chloride dosing for leachate a and b normal is due to excess amount of ferric chloride added which cause the coagulation to go beyond the degree of destabilization and the flocs get re stabilized in the water becoming soluble and increasing the residual concentration of ferric chloride 38 39 after a certain degree of destabilization the leftover concentration of colloidal organic matter will be insufficient for further coagulation and excess coagulant will stay in the water increasing the turbidity of the supernatant as shown in figure s9 zone 3 destabilization region refers to such condition where the colloidal concentration is too low relative to coagulant dosage fig 6 c shows the mechanism of how the residual ferric concentration increases due to insufficient leftover colloidal concentration in the water due to the varied outcomes in coagulation theories behind coagulation mechanism can only provide a qualitative approximation of the entire mechanism selection of the type and dose of coagulant depends on the characteristics of the coagulant the concentration and type of particulates concentration and characteristics of nom water temperature and water quality due to the interdependence of these ﬁve elements prediction of the optimum coagulant combination from characteristics of the particulates and the water quality is not yet possible 39 3 4 uv absorbance figs 4 and 5 represents the result of the uv absorbance at different coagulant doses in normal and concentrated leachates for ferric and aluminum respectively as observed the two coagulants showed different patterns for uv absorbance for aluminum sulphate the uv absorbance decreases with higher coagulant dose for all cases as shown in fig 5 along with decrease in residual aluminum concentration on the contrary ferric chloride caused significant increase of uv absorbance in the case of normal leachate from sites a and b the uv absorbance decreased at lower dosage but after a certain threshold when ph drops below 5 resulting in increased soluble hydrolysed ferric complexes the uv absorbance started to increase proportionally with coagulant dose higher than the threshold point however beyond the threshold point the colour of the supernatant begins to turn yellowish orange and gradually becomes bright red at higher dose of ferric chloride on the other hand in the case of concentrated leachate from both sites a and b a different trend was observed uv absorbance increased with coagulant dose when 180 mg l ferric chloride was added then decreased as more coagulant was dosed as mentioned in scenario 1 b in fig 6 the ccc was lower than the required amount for the colloidal concentration in both concentrated leachate a and b in turn the level of destabilization required for floc generation for sweep flocculation was not met and colloidal fraction stays in a suspended state in the solution without being settled this colloidal fraction in the supernatant was observed to even pass through 0 45 μm syringe filter when the supernatants from leachate a and b concentrated were tested for uv absorbance the suspended colloidal fraction in the solution can cause increase in uv absorbance by means of absorbance or light scattering however when the leachate a and b concentrated were subjected to a higher coagulant dose the required ccc was met and the level of destabilization required for sweep flocculation was achieved and no colloidal fraction was observed in suspended state in the supernatant hence after adding more than 180 mg l ferric chloride the uv absorbance was observed to decrease during experiments it was observed that the supernatant turns hazy due to formation of micro colloids that do not settle and stay suspended which can cause the uv absorbance to increase due to light scattering from fig 4 the elevation of supernatant uv absorbance coincides with the increase in residual soluble ferric concentration which indicates a possible relevance between ferric cation and uv absorbance similar phenomenon was observed and reported in previous studies that reported the influence of ferric ion in uv absorbance at 254 nm 16 40 41 few other studies showed that it was the hydrolysed species of iron iii and their concentration responsible for uv absorbance 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 however it was found in some studies that the presence of iron iii along with dom nom in environmental conditions and the iteration between iron iii and dom was the cause of increased uv absorbance 17 49 50 44 45 51 55 one study even supports the results found in this study where removal efficiency for humic acid decreased when ph dropped below 4 5 and the study states that below ph 4 5 humic acid becomes more neutral while hydrolysed species of ferric becomes more positive and the complexes undergo charge reversal resulting in repulsion between ha and hydrolysed ferric reducing the overall removal of humic acid 56 more specifically the formation of organometal complex compound between ferric and recalcitrant organic matter or dom that hypothetically has characteristic absorption in the uv range previous studies have shown metal complexation between organic matter and metal ions and ammonia exist in the natural environment surface water and wastewater treatment processes etc 57 60 hence in this study supported by the previous studies the phenomenon of metal complexation between ferric and organic matter and its impact on uv absorbance is further explained in this study the metal ion refers to ferric fe 3 and the ligand is the dissolved organic matter present in the leachate ferric cation fe 3 has 6 empty orbitals and it can accept 6 electrons from a donor ligand allowing it to form 6 coordinate covalent bonds with 6 anionic ligands 59 as the dissolved organic matter have different functional groups that can act as binding sites electron donors for metal complexes such as carboxylic cooh phenolic oh amine nh2 nitro no etc but the major functional group present is the carboxylic and phenolic group certain dissolved organic matter dom model such as humic acid also show that metal is partially bonded to water molecule at the oxygen atom as a binding site and partially bound to oxygen present in hydroxyl part of the carboxylic and phenolic group 57 hence in this study the major functional groups present in the dom i e carboxylic and phenolic group have been considered elemental analysis of landfill leachate show that oxygen is the second most abundant element in organic compounds 29 dissolved organic matter humic substance consists approximately 30 40 oxygen depending upon the source which is second to carbon 50 60 6 due to availability and an extra pair of electrons to donate oxygen presents itself as the most suitable binding site for metal complexes in dom humic substance which is also supported by a recent study 61 ferric and oxygen from dom form metal complex with ml6 m metal and l ligand structure and octahedral geometry 57 59 one such example of dom iron complexation is kleinhempel s model of humic substance 57 the ml6 orbital diagram of the fe o coordinate covalent bond is shown in figure s10 38 59 62 63 when the metal complex is formed the 3d orbital in ferric splits into eg and t2g orbital with different energy level than before as explained by crystal field theory and ligand field theory 64 65 39 the difference in energy is represented by δ in the figure compared to the initial ferric orbital the energy required by an electron to jump from t2g to eg increases when the 3d orbital splits into eg and t2g 38 66 70 due to this increase electron absorb higher amount of energy in form of photons from light to jump from t2g to eg in this study it is hypothesized that the energy required to make the electron transition matches that of uv light in electromagnetic spectrum hence it suggests that when metal complexes are formed with fe o bond the uv absorbance increases 3 5 ft ir analysis ft ir spectroscopy serves as a tool to identify the organic functional groups present in the sample figs 7 a b c and d show the ftir spectra for normal and concentrated leachates from sites a and b before and after ferric chloride coagulation it is shown that functional groups such as alcohol and carboxylic oh alkane ch alkene cc sulfoxide so and halogen compound cx were found in normal leachate from sites a and b in addition to similar functional groups with normal leachates ester co and nitro compound no were found in concentrated leachates for sites a and b 71 various studies on different materials have shown that fe o bond mostly exists in the region 600 400 cm 1 or below 400 cm 1 ir spectrum region and also the structure of the fe dom fe humic complex 72 73 74 61 75 77 these studies have used different ferric solution and organic compounds to analyse the fe o bond similarly in this study it was observed that the absorbance peak increased post treatment in the region below 600 cm 1 for the leachate sample treated with ferric chloride this increase in absorbance below 600 cm 1 wave number is hypothesized to be due to fe o bond stretch that occurs in the metal complex formed from covalent co ordinate between ferric ion and oxygen in organic ligands in this case humic acid macromolecules not only the peak increased with increase in ferric dosage but also it was noticed that the peak for oh also increased and shifted towards lower wave number indicating that the ferric cation maybe causing an increase in the stretch of oh bond it was also observed that for the raw sample the peak in the region 600 400 cm 1 shows a decreasing trend for both normal and concentrated leachate from sites a and b while the coagulation flocculation supernatant from highest coagulant dose shows a clear peak in that region the above evidence indicates and supports the theory of possible metal complexation between ferric cation and dom 4 conclusions in this study lab scale tests with coagulants were conducted for blended landfill leachate and sewage to mimic the co treatment in potws main findings are as below 1 both aluminium and ferric coagulants performed well for organic matter removal during landfill leachate and sewage cotreatment for both aluminium and ferric coagulants organic matter removal efficacy for normal leachate is better than concentrated leachate for normal leachate 64 toc and 74 of cod removal were achieved for concentrated leachate 39 toc and 32 of cod removal were achieved however in terms of mass based removal per unit volume of sample concentrated leachate had higher organic matter removal than normal leachate samples 2 ferric coagulant can cause significant uv abs increase while aluminium cannot the high uv abs coincide with high residual ferric concentration it is hypothetically believed that the uv abs increase is caused by the complexation of soluble ferric and leachate organic matter which produce the fe o complex with the molecular structure that has characteristic absorption in the uv range the fe o structure is proved by ft ir spectra 3 both aluminium and ferric coagulants lowered the ph during the coagulation flocculation process for landfill leachate ferric lowered ph more than aluminium in all cases particularly ph value dropped dramatically to less than 2 by ferric for normal leachate no dramatic ph drop was observed for the concentrated leachates due to the buffer effects of high levels of organic acids weak acids 4 the relationship between colloidal destabilization and coagulant dose under various ph scenarios can be elucidated by theoretical models presented in this study the critical coagulant concentration is required to completely destabilize the anionic organic molecules while not exceeding the maximum allowable coagulant dose beyond which concentration of residual metal cations can

13431,this study evaluated the effects of chemically enhanced primary treatment cept on co treatment of landfill leachate and sewage in publicly owned treatment works potws two most frequently used coagulants in cept ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate were studied bulk organic matter ph variation uv absorption etc were evaluated during the treatment processes 54 74 organic matter removal was achieved by ferric and aluminum coagulants ferric coagulant was found to perform better for organic matter removal than aluminum in most cases notably ferric chloride coagulation increased the uv absorbance of treated leachate significantly by up to 10 times while aluminum sulphate only slightly decreased it theoretical models are discussed to elucidate co precipitation behaviors under various ph scenarios it is exacerbated by the complexes formed by ferric and organic matter which have characteristic light absorption in the uv range the formation of such complexes is supported by the fourier transform infra red ftir spectroscopy in addition the volatile acids in leachate were found to play an important role in mediating ph through their buffering capacity keywords landfill leachate chemically enhanced primary treatment uv quenching phenomenon dissolved organic carbon metal complexation 1 introduction in the usa 50 60 of the municipal solid waste msw is disposed of in landfills as it is the most economical and convenient method based on an us epa survey 1 in landfills a large volume of leachate is generated continuously based on an survey by the environmental research and education foundation eref approximately 27 billion liters of leachate was generated in 2017 in the u s 2 more than 60 of the landfill leachate is discharged to publicly owned treatment works potws in the u s as it is convenient and cost effective 2 4 in a landfill the cost of leachate management contributes the highest portion among all operation and maintenance hence co treatment with sewage in potws is the most common practice for leachate disposal 5 over the recent decade potws have been switching from chlorination to other disinfection alternatives because chlorine disinfection has been found to produce secondary contamination due to production of disinfectant by products dbps uv disinfection is a promising method because it is highly effective dbp free chemical free etc however landfill leachate that contains a high concentration of organic matter can interfere with the uv disinfection process as the recalcitrant organic matter can strongly absorb the uv light 6 7 even after upfront biological treatment the residual recalcitrant organic matter further interferes with the downstream uv disinfection in potws 8 hence potws are prudential on accepting landfill leachate 4 in wastewater treatment practices potws operating with a uv disinfection unit typically requires 60 65 transmittance at 254 nm wavelength to achieve the appropriate level of disinfection 9 chemically enhanced primary treatment cept is a chemical treatment used in potws to enhance the removal of suspended solids organic matter and nutrients such as phosphorus in the cept process chemical coagulants are typically added to the primary sedimentation basin cept can help reduce the solids and organic loading rate on biological treatment the treatment infrastructure requirement and overall capital cost 10 cept process is also considered to be a cost effective method for wastewater treatment in developing countries 11 as it is advantageous in saving footprint 12 has low energy requirement 13 and is easy to operate and maintain 14 the efficiency of cept in a primary treatment facility depends on the type and dose of coagulant ph level temperature and alkalinity 15 hence cept which is coagulation flocculation in essence can potentially remove the recalcitrant organic matter carried by landfill leachate and potentially have beneficial impacts on the uv disinfection during sewage leachate co treatment in potws however it has also been found that coagulant with metal salts can increase the uv absorbance due to the interaction between metal cations and organic matter or macromolecules such as humic acid such phenomenon has been reported in previous studies where interaction between ferric ion and organic macromolecules increases the uv absorbance 16 17 in this experimental study the overall goal is to mimic the scenario that sewage and landfill leachate are co treated in a potw using cept methods in order to evaluate the overall treatment efficacy and beneficial effects of cept for the co treatment especially the effects on the uv quenching phenomenon the objectives are a to evaluate the overall organic matter removal performance of cept in co treatment of landfill leachate and sewage b to reveal the exacerbating effect of uv quenching by cept and c to provide theoretical explanations for the effects of cept on uv quenching 2 materials and methods 2 1 leachate sample leachate samples were collected from landfill sites a and b in virginia and ohio respectively in each landfill site leachate samples were collected from two different zones denoted as normal leachate and concentrated leachate respectively leachate samples were collected by landfill site engineers and was shipped to the research laboratory in an opaque sealed bucket in 5 gallon sealed opaque buckets shipped to the research laboratory and stored at 4 c before further testing and analysis the concentrated leachates were collected from zones experiencing elevated temperature while normal leachates were collected from zone with normal conditions landfills or the zones in landfills experiencing elevated temperature have been found to generate acidic and concentrated leachates with high organic matter and metal concentration 18 table 1 shows the characteristics of the raw leachate collected from the two different zones in each site it was observed that the normal leachate and concentrated leachate are very different in terms of physical chemical and biochemical characteristics as reported in table 1 water quality parameters for the normal leachate samples from both sites had ph in the neutral to alkaline range 7 and had lower bod 1300 4000 mg l and cod 18 000 mg l concentration levels while both the concentrated leachate samples that were collected from elevated temperature zone were found to acidic ph 5 5 and significantly higher bod 30 000 mg l and cod 100 000 mg l concentration level however in terms of nitrogen all leachate samples showed similar concentration levels in the range of 2000 mg l where majority of the total nitrogen was contributed approx 50 75 by ammoniacal nitrogen these characteristics of leachate are similar to previously reported values 18 2 2 coagulants 97 102 ferric chloride cas 10025 77 1 with molecular weight of 270 3 g mol beantown chemical hudson nh usa and 99 99 aluminum sulphate cas 10043 01 3 with molecular weight of 342 15 g mol vwr international radnor pa usa were used as coagulants ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate were chosen as coagulants as they are industrially accepted and widely applied in water and wastewater treatment in primary treatment stock solutions of the coagulants were prepared and stored at 4 c for experimental use the concentration of prepared stock solutions of ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate was 10 g l application of stock solution is preferred compared to adding solid coagulant for testing since the dissolved coagulants can mix rapidly compared to the solid coagulant for every coagulation experiment fresh stock solutions were prepared on weekly basis for quality control 2 3 experimental setup jar test experiments were set up to replicate cept treatment experiments were carried out using a velp flocculator jar testers with six paddles cole parmer vernon hills il usa that comply with astm d2035 19 samples were prepared by mixing 5 leachate and 95 sewage to mimic the blending of sewage and landfill leachate in potws then coagulation flocculation tests were performed on these samples prior to running any jar test samples were brought to room temperature and filtered through 0 45 μm filter paper the 10 g l of stock solutions for each coagulant was used to add the coagulants to each jar with different doses for this study no fixed coagulant range was predetermined as the normal leachate and concentrated leachate had significantly different organic matter concentration levels hence in this study the coagulant dose was added in increments of 200 mg l using the 10 g l stock solution until a plateau trend was observed in the organic matter removal indicating a maximum percentage removal achievable as per the standard method astm d 2035 19 1 min of rapid mixing at 100 rpm and 30 min of slow mixing at 25 rpm was performed after the addition of coagulant stock solution to each jar at different doses after the mixing 30 min was considered for settlement of precipitates the supernatants from the jar test were collected after filtering through 0 45 μm filter paper to remove precipitates completely the filtered supernatants were collected and stored at 4 c for further analysis the same coagulation flocculation experiments were conducted for a mixture of 5 leachate and 95 de ionized water for a to compare the result with co treatment of landfill leachate and sewage and b to determine whether sewage has a different effect on the treatment than water de ionized water was collected from a benchtop milli q water purification system milliporesigma burlington ma usa for the experiments the results for the experiments for 5 leachate and 95 de ionized water have been shown in the supporting documents for reference 2 4 chemical analysis all the tests were carried out by following standard methods provided by american public health association apha 19 all the glassware

laboratory refillable ph electrode hach loveland co usa toc was tested using toc analyzer teledyne tekmar mason oh usa with three trials for each sample to obtain accurate results and were averaged to measure the standard deviation for accuracy checks and quality control the uv absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 254 nm using hach dr6000 spectrophotometer with a 1 cm wide quartz cuvette one key factor for uv spectroscopy was filtering the supernatant by 0 45 μm filter paper to avoid any error in uv absorbance testing due to solids in the supernatant as suspended and colloidal solids can scatter the light and cause the change in the value of uv absorbance samples for ft ir spectroscopy were prepared by freeze drying the supernatants and preparing kcl pellet with a hydraulic press 20 ml of each supernatant was freeze dried using freezone legacy freeze dryers labconco corporation kansas city mo usa as the moisture in the sample can interfere with ftir spectra nicolet is50 ftir spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa was used for generating ft ir spectra provided in the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic matter removal fig 1 shows the cod removal for normal and concentrated leachate samples from sites a and b by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively fig 1 a is for site a as shown in fig 1 a the cod concentration of site a normal leachate was decreased from 990 mg l to 459 mg l and 365 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively and the cod concentration of site a concentrated leachate decreased from 4592 mg l to 3136 mg l and 3178 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively as shown in fig 1 a maximum cod removal of 63 35 by aluminum sulphate and 31 71 by ferric chloride was achieved for site a normal and concentrated leachates respectively figs 1 b is for site b as shown in fig 1 b cod concentration of site b normal leachate decreased from 898 mg l to 232 mg l and 521 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively and cod concentration of site b concentrated leachate as shown in fig 1 b decreased from 5320 mg l to 3825 mg l and 5020 mg l to 3990 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively as shown in fig 1 b maximum cod removal of 74 16 and 28 1 was achieved by ferric chloride for site b normal and concentrated leachates respectively for a conventional primary sedimentation tank or clarifier the expected percentage removal for organic matter is 25 40 20 although for enhanced treatment such as cept the expected percentage removal is 50 70 21 based on fig 1 treatment performance of both the coagulants for sites a and b normal leachate was in typical range of cept method however neither aluminum sulphate nor ferric chloride could perform effectively for sites a and b concentrated leachate although not a monitored parameter for potws discharging limits toc is an important parameter to indicate the organic carbon concentration as organic carbon or the compounds containing organic carbon are the major contributor to uv absorbance fig 2 shows toc removal for normal and concentrated leachate samples from sites a and b by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively fig 2 a is for site a as shown toc concentration of normal leachate decreased from about 180 mg l to 93 2 mg l and 90 0 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively for concentrated leachate 1800 mg l of toc was decreased to 1 103 8 mg l and 1 217 5 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively as shown in fig 2 a a maximum toc removal of 53 8 by aluminum sulphate and 38 8 by ferric chloride was achieved for site a normal and concentrated leachates respectively fig 2 b is for site b for normal leachate the toc concentration dropped from 133 4 mg l to 59 0 mg l and 97 9 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively for concentrated leachate toc concentration decreased from 1 700 0 mg l to 1 196 5 mg l and 1 358 0 mg l by ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate respectively as shown in fig 2 b a maximum of 63 9 and 31 6 of toc concentration was removed by ferric chloride from site b normal and concentrated leachates respectively figs 1 and 2 provide the evidence to the effectiveness of cept in the removal of organic matter from leachate sewage co treatment based on several previous published works it was found that the amount of coagulant dose required for coagulation flocculation process is directly related to the initial concentration of organic matter in the leachate sample 22 26 compared to these previous studies in this study coagulant dose was applied in increment of 200 mg l until a flat curve was obtained for organic matter removal to evaluate the coagulant dose required for coagulation flocculation for two leachate samples that have significantly different water quality characteristics especially organic matter and ph few studies show similar removal efficiency with this study at higher coagulant dose and at lower ph level 27 28 these studies also show that ferric chloride tends to perform better in organic matter removal compared to other coagulants such as aluminum sulphate poly aluminum chloride pac ferrous sulphate and ferrous chloride supporting the result in this study previous studies provide following points for leachate treatment with coagulation and flocculation i high coagulant dose is required for both ferric and alum for high strength leachate ii cod removal is extremely difficult in case of high strength leachate than low strength leachate due to low biodegradability iii ferric chloride tends to perform better in cod removal than aluminum sulphate like the studies mentioned above this study shows that high dosage is required to achieve higher organic matter removal from highly concentrated landfill leachates by cept however in terms of practical application using such high coagulant dose may raise concern in term of cost chemical handling sludge production and dissolved solids of high coagulant dosage in addition the difference of organics removal rates of normal leachates up to 74 in terms of cod and 64 in terms of toc and concentrated leachates up to 32 in terms of cod and 39 in terms of toc is caused by their different organic compositions in normal leachate samples both sites a and b a considerable portion of cod is contributed by recalcitrant humic substances which are higher molecular weight and prone to be removed with coagulation flocculation 7 while concentrated leachate samples in both sites a and b contain a significant amount of short chain organic acids shown in table 1 that tend to stay soluble in a coagulation flocculation process and limited removal could be achieved 29 while the percentage removal is lower for the concentrated leachate samples the mass removal on a unit volume basis is higher than that for normal leachate samples 3 2 change in ph ph is a major factor that affects the effectiveness of the coagulation flocculation and precipitation processes due to the different solubility of the metal ion at different ph and the availability of hydroxyl group for complexation for that purpose the change in ph was recorded to observe the effects of ph on treatment performance and solubility of ferric and aluminum ion in the supernatant after the treatment fig 3 shows the change in ph in all four samples by both ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate as mentioned above for optimum removal of contaminants ph for both ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate should be in an optimum range of 5 5 8 5 30 if ph is below 5 the solubility of both metal ions will increase and impact the coagulation flocculation performance as shown in fig 3 a decrease in ph was observed due to the addition of both ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate however different trends were observed for aluminum sulphate and ferric chloride aluminum sulphate did not cause any dramatic change in ph for either normal or concentrated leachate from sites a and b after aluminum sulphate was dosed the ph decreased from 7 6 to 6 and from 6 6 to 5 for site a normal and concentrated leachate respectively and for site b aluminum sulphate lowered the ph from 8 16 to 5 16 and from 6 4 to 4 7 for normal and concentrated leachate respectively different from aluminum based coagulant ferric chloride caused much greater ph change especially for normal leachate samples the change in ph caused by ferric chloride for normal leachate from sites a and b was found significant fig 3 shows that when more than 540 mg l of ferric chloride was dosed the ph dropped dramatically to 2 or lower for normal leachate from both sites a and b meanwhile ferric chloride did not have such impact on ph level for concentrated leachate from sites a and b for concentrated leachate from sites a and b the ph reduced from 6 6 to 3 9 and from 6 4 to 3 54 respectively fig 3 shows that when ferric chloride is dosed in high amounts it will reduce the ph below 5 which is a solubility threshold for ferric ions below which hydrolyzed ferric complexes become soluble previous studies on various coagulants have also showed similar results where ph plays a vital role in effective in coagulation or charge neutralization necessary for nom removal a study showed that when ph 4 both ferric and aluminum hydrolyze to form hexa aqua complexes in aqueous medium that are more unstable and soluble at acidic ph and undergo further hydrolysis to reduce the ph even more acidic 31 32 the different behaviors of ph change during ferric chloride coagulation between normal and concentrated leachates are believed due to the buffer effect of the high level of short chain organic acids in found in leachate samples short chain organic acids or volatile acids vas are weak organic acids and their conjugate base stay in equilibrium in a solvent in this case leachate volatile acids have lower dissociation constant pka value which gives them the buffer capacity or resistance in simple terms towards the change in ph some commonly known volatile acids are acetic acid butyric acid propionic acid etc these acids are also considered as volatile fatty acids vfas that are typically produced during the acidogenesis phase during decomposition of organic waste in landfills volatile acids vas test was conducted for raw leachate sample only to understand how the concentration levels of these acids play a role in change in ph during coagulation by providing a buffer capacity to the leachate volatile acids vas test determined that leachate a and b normal sample had a total vas concentration of 785 mg l and 1628 mg l respectively while concentrated leachate for a and b had 22 850 mg l and 27 700 mg l of va concentration respectively as shown in figure s8 hence concentrated leachate had significantly higher vas concentration than normal leachate for both a and b sample carbon chain may vary in volatile acids hence total volatile acid concentration was measured in mg l as ch3cooh acetic acid by connecting the results from the change in ph and the volatile acids test it can be said that there is a possibility of observing residual soluble metal cations after coagulation but the observation for normal and concentrated sample would be significantly different due to high buffer capacity from volatile acids concentrated leachate samples can handle more ferric than normal before residual fe increases that results in increase in the uv absorbance post coagulation figs 4 and 5 provide the results obtained for residual ferric and aluminum concentration in the supernatants it is shown that for all the leachate samples the concentration of aluminum decreased and reached approximately zero even for higher coagulant dose however a different trend was observed for ferric chloride for normal leachate from sites a and b it can be seen from fig 4 that after a certain amount of ferric chloride dose i e 540 mg l the residual ferric concentration increased and kept on increasing with the dose also when compared to fig 3 after 540 mg l of ferric chloride dose the ph dropped below 5 and as aforementioned soluble hydrolyzed ferric complexes increases resulting in increase in residual ferric post coagulation while for concentrated leachate from sites a and b it was found that for the lowest dose the residual ferric concentration increased after a higher dose was applied it decreased then increased again after 900 mg l or more dose of ferric chloride was applied the increase of iron concentration coincides with the ph drop as shown in fig 3 similarly when more than 900 mg l of ferric chloride was added for concentrated leachate from site a and b the ph dropped below 5 as shown in fig 3 resulting in increased residual ferric post treatment in form of soluble hydrolyzed ferric complexes as shown in fig 4 and the reason stated above it can be said that the removal of uv254 absorbance significantly depends on residual metal concentration and ph and this study aims to explain the correlation between ph residual metal concentration and uv254 absorbance and its effect on uv removal for domestic wastewater optimum ph for the coagulation process is 6 8 for ferric chloride and 6 9 for aluminum sulphate 21 while for landfill leachate previous studies show that the optimum ph required is 7 10 5 for both ferric chloride and aluminum sulphate 23 24 26 33 34 in some practices ph is adjusted before coagulation to improve the removal efficiency of primary treatment however potws do not always adjust the ph as introduction of extra chemicals may increase the cost of operation elevate the effluent dissolved solids and may have aftereffects on the downstream processes hence in this study ph adjustment was not carried out 3 3 co precipitation behaviors of ferric chloride as function of ph fig 6 illustrates the hypothetical models that can explicate the co precipitation behaviors of ferric chloride and leachate organic matter in this study under various ph scenarios 3 3 1 scenario 1 ph is in neutral range above 6 scenario 1 a when the ph was in the neutral range i e above 6 the coagulation mechanism followed precipitation and sweep flocculation for both leachate a and b normal and concentrated as shown in figs 3 and 4 for leachate a and b normal from coagulant dose 180 mg l to 540 mg l precipitation and sweep flocculation was observed and no residual ferric was detected similarly for leachate a and b concentrated from coagulant dose 360 mg l to 900 mg l coagulation mechanism followed by precipitation and sweep flocculation minimal residual ferric concentration was found fig 6 a shows the stepwise coagulation mechanism for precipitation and sweep flocculation an effective coagulation occurs when critical coagulation concentration ccc is used where the critical coagulation concentration ccc can be defined as the minimum concentration of cations required to neutralize and destabilize the anionic organic matter for coagulation of colloidal particles hence effective coagulation such as this can be achieved when ph of the solution colloidal concentration in the solution and critical coagulant concentration ccc are in relation with each other as shown in figure s9 taken from 35 36 for zone 2 and zone 4 fig 6 a shows the coagulation mechanism for scenario 1 a where precipitation and sweep flocculation take place scenario 1 b however as shown in fig 4 for leachate a and b concentrated when 180 mg l of ferric chloride was dosed the residual ferric concentration was found to increase even when the ph was close to 6 such observation is explained by the concept of critical coagulant concentration ccc and colloidal or particulate matter concentration 4 a study 4 discusses the relation between ccc and colloidal concentration and indicated that when the colloidal organic matter concentration is low the required ccc is higher compared to the case of high colloidal organic matter concentration figure s9 shows the relationship between ccc and colloidal concentration 35 36 in this study the organic matter is classified as humic like substances high molecular weight compounds and short chain organic acids the colloidal organic matter refers to the humic like substances which are more settleable and can be destabilized much easily than short chain organic acids studies have shown that normal leachate and concentrated leachate have different proportions of humic like substances and humic like substance fraction is higher in normal leachate than concentrated leachate 5 6 29 37 in this study it is shown that organic matter in normal leachate is humic like substances dominated while concentrated leachate short chain organic acids dominated due to insufficient amount of colloidal concentration and coagulant dosage this condition is observed for concentrated leachate which has lower proportion of humic like substance compared to normal leachate this scenario corresponds to the point x shown in figure s9 the mechanism for this scenario is shown in fig 6 b 3 3 2 scenario 2 ph is acidic below 6 based on previous theories optimum ph for ferric chloride coagulation is 5 8 where residual metal concentration increased below ph 5 3 4 similarly in this study it was observed that the residual ferric concentration increased when ph dropped below 5 for example after dosing 540 mg l of ferric chloride the ph dropped below 5 and the residual metal concentration increased for leachate a and b normal as shown in figs 3 and 4 and after dosing 900 mg l of ferric chloride the ph dropped below 5 for leachate a and b concentrated which resulted in increase in residual ferric concentration as shown in figs 3 and 4 the sudden drop in ph observed by ferric chloride dosing for leachate a and b normal is due to excess amount of ferric chloride added which cause the coagulation to go beyond the degree of destabilization and the flocs get re stabilized in the water becoming soluble and increasing the residual concentration of ferric chloride 38 39 after a certain degree of destabilization the leftover concentration of colloidal organic matter will be insufficient for further coagulation and excess coagulant will stay in the water increasing the turbidity of the supernatant as shown in figure s9 zone 3 destabilization region refers to such condition where the colloidal concentration is too low relative to coagulant dosage fig 6 c shows the mechanism of how the residual ferric concentration increases due to insufficient leftover colloidal concentration in the water due to the varied outcomes in coagulation theories behind coagulation mechanism can only provide a qualitative approximation of the entire mechanism selection of the type and dose of coagulant depends on the characteristics of the coagulant the concentration and type of particulates concentration and characteristics of nom water temperature and water quality due to the interdependence of these ﬁve elements prediction of the optimum coagulant combination from characteristics of the particulates and the water quality is not yet possible 39 3 4 uv absorbance figs 4 and 5 represents the result of the uv absorbance at different coagulant doses in normal and concentrated leachates for ferric and aluminum respectively as observed the two coagulants showed different patterns for uv absorbance for aluminum sulphate the uv absorbance decreases with higher coagulant dose for all cases as shown in fig 5 along with decrease in residual aluminum concentration on the contrary ferric chloride caused significant increase of uv absorbance in the case of normal leachate from sites a and b the uv absorbance decreased at lower dosage but after a certain threshold when ph drops below 5 resulting in increased soluble hydrolysed ferric complexes the uv absorbance started to increase proportionally with coagulant dose higher than the threshold point however beyond the threshold point the colour of the supernatant begins to turn yellowish orange and gradually becomes bright red at higher dose of ferric chloride on the other hand in the case of concentrated leachate from both sites a and b a different trend was observed uv absorbance increased with coagulant dose when 180 mg l ferric chloride was added then decreased as more coagulant was dosed as mentioned in scenario 1 b in fig 6 the ccc was lower than the required amount for the colloidal concentration in both concentrated leachate a and b in turn the level of destabilization required for floc generation for sweep flocculation was not met and colloidal fraction stays in a suspended state in the solution without being settled this colloidal fraction in the supernatant was observed to even pass through 0 45 μm syringe filter when the supernatants from leachate a and b concentrated were tested for uv absorbance the suspended colloidal fraction in the solution can cause increase in uv absorbance by means of absorbance or light scattering however when the leachate a and b concentrated were subjected to a higher coagulant dose the required ccc was met and the level of destabilization required for sweep flocculation was achieved and no colloidal fraction was observed in suspended state in the supernatant hence after adding more than 180 mg l ferric chloride the uv absorbance was observed to decrease during experiments it was observed that the supernatant turns hazy due to formation of micro colloids that do not settle and stay suspended which can cause the uv absorbance to increase due to light scattering from fig 4 the elevation of supernatant uv absorbance coincides with the increase in residual soluble ferric concentration which indicates a possible relevance between ferric cation and uv absorbance similar phenomenon was observed and reported in previous studies that reported the influence of ferric ion in uv absorbance at 254 nm 16 40 41 few other studies showed that it was the hydrolysed species of iron iii and their concentration responsible for uv absorbance 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 however it was found in some studies that the presence of iron iii along with dom nom in environmental conditions and the iteration between iron iii and dom was the cause of increased uv absorbance 17 49 50 44 45 51 55 one study even supports the results found in this study where removal efficiency for humic acid decreased when ph dropped below 4 5 and the study states that below ph 4 5 humic acid becomes more neutral while hydrolysed species of ferric becomes more positive and the complexes undergo charge reversal resulting in repulsion between ha and hydrolysed ferric reducing the overall removal of humic acid 56 more specifically the formation of organometal complex compound between ferric and recalcitrant organic matter or dom that hypothetically has characteristic absorption in the uv range previous studies have shown metal complexation between organic matter and metal ions and ammonia exist in the natural environment surface water and wastewater treatment processes etc 57 60 hence in this study supported by the previous studies the phenomenon of metal complexation between ferric and organic matter and its impact on uv absorbance is further explained in this study the metal ion refers to ferric fe 3 and the ligand is the dissolved organic matter present in the leachate ferric cation fe 3 has 6 empty orbitals and it can accept 6 electrons from a donor ligand allowing it to form 6 coordinate covalent bonds with 6 anionic ligands 59 as the dissolved organic matter have different functional groups that can act as binding sites electron donors for metal complexes such as carboxylic cooh phenolic oh amine nh2 nitro no etc but the major functional group present is the carboxylic and phenolic group certain dissolved organic matter dom model such as humic acid also show that metal is partially bonded to water molecule at the oxygen atom as a binding site and partially bound to oxygen present in hydroxyl part of the carboxylic and phenolic group 57 hence in this study the major functional groups present in the dom i e carboxylic and phenolic group have been considered elemental analysis of landfill leachate show that oxygen is the second most abundant element in organic compounds 29 dissolved organic matter humic substance consists approximately 30 40 oxygen depending upon the source which is second to carbon 50 60 6 due to availability and an extra pair of electrons to donate oxygen presents itself as the most suitable binding site for metal complexes in dom humic substance which is also supported by a recent study 61 ferric and oxygen from dom form metal complex with ml6 m metal and l ligand structure and octahedral geometry 57 59 one such example of dom iron complexation is kleinhempel s model of humic substance 57 the ml6 orbital diagram of the fe o coordinate covalent bond is shown in figure s10 38 59 62 63 when the metal complex is formed the 3d orbital in ferric splits into eg and t2g orbital with different energy level than before as explained by crystal field theory and ligand field theory 64 65 39 the difference in energy is represented by δ in the figure compared to the initial ferric orbital the energy required by an electron to jump from t2g to eg increases when the 3d orbital splits into eg and t2g 38 66 70 due to this increase electron absorb higher amount of energy in form of photons from light to jump from t2g to eg in this study it is hypothesized that the energy required to make the electron transition matches that of uv light in electromagnetic spectrum hence it suggests that when metal complexes are formed with fe o bond the uv absorbance increases 3 5 ft ir analysis ft ir spectroscopy serves as a tool to identify the organic functional groups present in the sample figs 7 a b c and d show the ftir spectra for normal and concentrated leachates from sites a and b before and after ferric chloride coagulation it is shown that functional groups such as alcohol and carboxylic oh alkane ch alkene cc sulfoxide so and halogen compound cx were found in normal leachate from sites a and b in addition to similar functional groups with normal leachates ester co and nitro compound no were found in concentrated leachates for sites a and b 71 various studies on different materials have shown that fe o bond mostly exists in the region 600 400 cm 1 or below 400 cm 1 ir spectrum region and also the structure of the fe dom fe humic complex 72 73 74 61 75 77 these studies have used different ferric solution and organic compounds to analyse the fe o bond similarly in this study it was observed that the absorbance peak increased post treatment in the region below 600 cm 1 for the leachate sample treated with ferric chloride this increase in absorbance below 600 cm 1 wave number is hypothesized to be due to fe o bond stretch that occurs in the metal complex formed from covalent co ordinate between ferric ion and oxygen in organic ligands in this case humic acid macromolecules not only the peak increased with increase in ferric dosage but also it was noticed that the peak for oh also increased and shifted towards lower wave number indicating that the ferric cation maybe causing an increase in the stretch of oh bond it was also observed that for the raw sample the peak in the region 600 400 cm 1 shows a decreasing trend for both normal and concentrated leachate from sites a and b while the coagulation flocculation supernatant from highest coagulant dose shows a clear peak in that region the above evidence indicates and supports the theory of possible metal complexation between ferric cation and dom 4 conclusions in this study lab scale tests with coagulants were conducted for blended landfill leachate and sewage to mimic the co treatment in potws main findings are as below 1 both aluminium and ferric coagulants performed well for organic matter removal during landfill leachate and sewage cotreatment for both aluminium and ferric coagulants organic matter removal efficacy for normal leachate is better than concentrated leachate for normal leachate 64 toc and 74 of cod removal were achieved for concentrated leachate 39 toc and 32 of cod removal were achieved however in terms of mass based removal per unit volume of sample concentrated leachate had higher organic matter removal than normal leachate samples 2 ferric coagulant can cause significant uv abs increase while aluminium cannot the high uv abs coincide with high residual ferric concentration it is hypothetically believed that the uv abs increase is caused by the complexation of soluble ferric and leachate organic matter which produce the fe o complex with the molecular structure that has characteristic absorption in the uv range the fe o structure is proved by ft ir spectra 3 both aluminium and ferric coagulants lowered the ph during the coagulation flocculation process for landfill leachate ferric lowered ph more than aluminium in all cases particularly ph value dropped dramatically to less than 2 by ferric for normal leachate no dramatic ph drop was observed for the concentrated leachates due to the buffer effects of high levels of organic acids weak acids 4 the relationship between colloidal destabilization and coagulant dose under various ph scenarios can be elucidated by theoretical models presented in this study the critical coagulant concentration is required to completely destabilize the anionic organic molecules while not exceeding the maximum allowable coagulant dose beyond which concentration of residual metal cations can

the biosynthesis of copper nanoparticles cu nps the color of supernatants from treated cu polluted media provided a first indication of cu based nps formation in the aqueous phase analysis by fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis observations of cell morphology and algal regrowth experiments after treatment showed that algal viability was crucial for efficient cu2 reduction to cu nps uv vis

is a frequently encountered metal contaminant in municipal wastewater it has adverse environmental effects on receiving water bodies and reduces the quality of the biosolids below the standard required for their use as fertilizer or safe disposal exceedances often relate to various industrial sources and the use of cu containing pesticides in conventional and organic agriculture 1 while a wide range of metabolic processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes requires cu increased concentration can have detrimental effects on organisms for example contaminated coastal seawater has been found to exhibit decreased biodiversity 2 elevated cu levels in the environment can cause co selection for antibiotic resistance 3 and poses an additional threat to coral health in warming oceans 4 free or weakly complexed copper can also be harmful to humans 5 in general free cupric ion cu2 is evidently very toxic cu chemical species 6 7 removal of trace metals in the 10 100 mg l 1 concentration range from wastewater is costly and challenging to achieve with the electrochemical and physicochemical methods typically employed drawbacks to the conventional approaches of metal polluted wastewater treatment include demanding chemical and energy requirements and the formation of hazardous biosolids or other waste byproducts that require specific disposal 8 12 an attractive alternative to these approaches is offered by the biosynthesis of zero valent metals alloys or inorganic organic composites which take place together with the bioremediation process this promising biotechnological approach has the potential to remove trace concentration of metal ions improving the quality of biosolids while producing no toxic waste and reducing the cost of wastewater treatment the production of various nanosized particles by prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms has been reported through both intracellular or extracellular routes a wide variety of organisms also form organic inorganic composites with an ordered structure using biopolymers such as proteins and microbe cells different physical and chemical conditions exposure time microorganism species and strains

alone has many advantages regarding cost speed simplicity and scalability it is also environment friendly as it does not require organic solvents or any other hazardous chemicals and has low energy demands 14 15 just as the recovery of precious metals has been proposed to reduce the cost of wastewater treatment 10 the recovery of many other biominerals may be of significant value 15 17 the importance of algae in wastewater treatment based on nutrient assimilation and valuable biomass formation is well documented the biosynthesis of silver palladium silver chloride gold zinc oxide and copper nps among others by algae have been reported 18 19 barwal et al 2011 described the formation of silver nps snp by cellular proteins of c reinhardtii most proteins associated with biosynthesis and stabilization of snp were part of cellular oxido reductive processes 20 however various functional groups of algal phytochemicals such as polysaccharides alkaloids polyphenols and proteins can serve as effective metal reducing capping and stabilizing agent in the biosynthesis of metallic nps 18 21 22 posewitz et al 2009 reported that numerous species of chlamydomonas produce hydrogen which can contribute to the reduction of metal pollutants standard electrode potentials e at 25 c and 101 325 kpa 1 atm predict the ability of h2 to reduce cuprous ion cu and cu2 to zero valent cu as well as two other major metal contaminants hg2 and cr6 to their less toxic forms hg and cr3 23 therefore h2 producing algae are expected to facilitate the reduction of cu2 and the formation of metallic cu a powerful tool for sustained h2 production in c reinhardtii was observed to be sulfur deprivation 24 25 31 no published study yet has investigating bioremediation of the common metal pollutant cu2 coupled with the biosynthesis of valuable cu based nps in the wastewater like complex nutrient media by ubiquitous green microalga the main objective of this research was to study the ability of the wild type wt strain of green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii c reinhardtii for the bioremediation of heavily cu polluted municipal wastewater and simultaneous production of valuable cu nps bioremediation and biosynthesis were carried out in aerobic and anoxic conditions in a complete tris acetate phosphate tap medium that simulated raw municipal wastewater table s1 and sulfur free tap tap s the wastewater s characteristics listed in table s1 were collected from reports of two local wastewater treatment plants wwtp from the food and agriculture organization fao 26 and scientific publications 27 29 successful cu2 bioremediation and cu based nps biosynthesis was initially assessed based on media color change and uv vis analysis of their supernatant total cu concentration cut and free cu2 concentration cuf was then determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy aas and with a cupric ion selective electrode ise respectively this was analyzed alongside ph and algal metabolic activity reliable determination of algal viability during treatment enabled the fluorescein diacetate fda method cell morphology observations and algal regrowth several control experiments were conducted to rigorously assess cu2 bioremediation and cu nps biosynthesis by algae including the use of a light sensitive rubisco rbc strain of algae the wt strain of algae under dark conditions and ultrasonicated algal culture followed by cu exposure dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy stem high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds were used for direct observation of nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of media and cu2 solutions tap medium was prepared according to guidelines from the chlamydomonas resource center crc at the university of minnesota usa 30 to create tap s medium 5 g of mgso4 7h2o and hunter s trace elements hte were replaced by 4 12 g of mgcl2 6h2o and sulfur free hunter s trace elements hte s respectively hte and hte s were purchased from crc a stock solution of cu2 10 g l 1 was prepared by dissolving cucl2 2h2o fischer scientific usa in ddh2o and stored at 5 7 c tap and tap

foil algal cultures were maintained in a solid medium under a low photon flux of 5 10 μmol m 2 s 1 or in dim light for up to 6 months after being received from crc liquid cultures were grown in erlenmeyer flasks at a photon flux density of 30 μmol m 2 s 1 or in dim light in an orbital shaker at 100 rpm and 26 28 c for new algal culture a loopful of algae from solid tap medium was transferred into 50 ml of liquid tap media and grown to the mid exponential phase a 10 ml aliquot of cell suspension was used to prepare 150 ml of culture then grown to the late exponential phase small oval and motile cells with a cell density of 3 6 106 cells ml 1 were harvested by centrifugation at 1000x g for 5 min at 23 c twice and resuspended in tap or tap s medium algal intactness and motility were preserved during the described procedures based on the procedures reported by melis et al 2000 and pinto et al 2013 algal samples were inspected by optical microscope at 100x and 400x magnification for their motility size shape and contaminations cells stained with lugol s iodine solution 10 μl per 1 ml of algal cultures were counted with a hemocytometer 2 3 algal treatment of cu polluted media algal cultures were placed into 250 ml borosilicate reagent bottles covered with an h2 tight modular lid without or with an outlet for gases borosilicate reagent bottles and stirring bars were washed in 20 hno3 technical grade overnight between experiments lids were made of multiple distributors for bottles d612 08 screw joints d598 06 and d593 06 an airtight tube s1815 04 and gaskets h973 14 for sampling bohlender germany for the aerobic tap s culture the reagent bottle was covered with a cotton plug aerobic tap sample was prepared with the modular lid which enabled accurate sampling of gases that had evolved during treatment anaerobic conditions were not created as photosynthesis was not inhibited in the setup cultures were incubated at 25 c with minimal stirring at continuous low moderate illumination of 40 μmol m 2 s 1 measured inside bottles the setup is shown in fig s1 to estimate the amount of h2 produced by the algal culture 2 ml of gas was drawn from the headspace of the culture and analyzed by mass spectrometry thermostar pfeiffer vacuum germany algal cultures were pre incubated for 3 5 days by which time a significant amount of h2 accumulated in the headspace of anaerobic tap s cultures other samples were treated in the same way to provide comparable experimental conditions after the pre incubation period cu2 was injected into the media to the final concentration of 10 mg l 1 samples were collected at day 0 2 h and during 1 2 and 3 days after metal addition algae were sonicated with an ultrasonic homogenizer labsonic m sartorius group germany on ice repeatedly in 20 s intervals until the absorbance of about 1 au at 260 nm was measured after sonication samples with impaired algal cells were incubated with cu2 for 1 h uv vis absorption spectra were then recorded for uncontaminated and cu spiked supernatants the experiments were repeated two to eight times the control sonication experiments were not repeated 2 4 analysis of supernatants supernatants with biosynthesized cu nps were separated from algae by centrifugation at 11 000x g for 10 min at room temperature immediately after centrifugation formation of cu based nps was monitored on a lambda 35 uv vis spectrometer perkinelmer usa between 200 700 nm for each sample up to one week after treatment cut was determined with aas spectraa 10 instrument varian usa before analysis samples were digested with hno3 analytical grade with the final concentration of 1 cuf was measured with an ise by using a direct calibration procedure a cupric half cell electrode was used in combination with the double junction reference electrode thermo fischer scientific usa measurement of ph was performed alongside measurement of cuf microscopy characterization of cu nps was done by transmission electron microscope tem jem 2100f jeol japan operated at 200 kv images were obtained using a charge couple device ccd camera the microscope is equipped with a scanning transmission electron microscope stem unit operated with an annular dark field detector and an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds x max 80 t oxford instruments uk which enables spatially resolved elemental analysis tem samples were prepared by dipping a 400 mesh nickel grid coated by amorphous c lacey supporting film into supernatant and air drying several samples were also analyzed after being aged on the tem grid between analyses supernatants were stored at 5 7 c 2 5 analysis of algae algal morphology enzymatic capacity for fluorescein diacetate fda cleavage and cell capability for the retention of the fluorescent product were analyzed immediately after sampling using an axio observer z1 epifluorescence microscope zeiss germany algal capability to recover after cu2 bioremediation was evaluated by regrowing cells in a transparent 96 well microtiter plate containing tap medium cell size morphology and motility were examined in a bright field selected samples were analyzed by differential interference contrast dic microscopy enzymatic activity and cell membrane integrity was assessed by green fluorescence of cells stained by fda sigma usa using a 38 he gfp filter set for green fluorescent protein the fda probe was prepared and handled as recommended by jochem 1999 with some modifications briefly stock solution of fda of 5 mg l 1 was made in acetone and stored at 20 c the working solution was a 50 fold dilution of stock solution in ddh2o fda 3 μl was added to100 μl of algal culture and incubated at rt in the dark for 20 min cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 1000x g for 5 min at rt resuspended in 20 μl of filter sterilized 0 9 nacl and observed under the microscope for regrowth experiment algae were harvested by centrifugation at 1000x g for 5 min at 23 c and resuspended in tap medium equal volumes of algal cultures and tap were combined in microplate wells the microtiter plate was covered with a transparent lid and wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation before being placed under a continuous illumination of 30 μmol m 2 s 1 for a week in an orbital shaker at 100 rpm at 26 28 c optical microscopy indicated that dark green cultures were the densest and contained motile cells 2 6 statistical analysis mean values and standard deviations sd were calculated normality test was performed and outliers were identified with dixon s q test to test for the homogeneity of variances leven s test was applied one way analysis of variance anova and post hoc tukey test determined significantly different mean absorption values at around 250 nm or exactly at 250 nm for samples without peak absorbance and to determine the significantly different mean ph values significantly different mean cut and mean cuf values were determined with welch s test as the homogeneity assumption was violated for these two variables 34 the selected confidence level was 95 multivariate plots were applied for graphical presentation of the inter relations among absorbance ph cut cuf h2 and algal viability 3 results and discussion 3 1 optical properties of algae treated cu polluted media supernatants the color of anaerobic tap s culture with abundant h2 photoproduction and the addition of 10 mg l 1 cu2 tap s an h2 wt 10cu fig s2a turned green during treatment algae in aerobic cu polluted tap s medium tap s a wt 10cu and tap medium tap a wt 10cu formed brown supernatants fig 1 a control sample of anaerobic tap s culture that photoproduced h2 and contained a small amount of cu2 0 4 mg l 1 for optimal algal growth tap s an h2 0 4cu wt was only lightly colored at the end of the experiment other cu polluted control samples remained colorless including anaerobic tap s media i without algae tap s no algae 10cu ii with algae kept in dark conditions tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu and iii with rbc mutant tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu the observed color change of media upon treatment are in agreement with previously reported green syntheses of cu based nps 21 35 39 tatsuma 2013 discussed that metal clusters with a diameter of 2 nm absorb light based on electron transition from occupied to unoccupied orbitals while larger nps up to several hundred nm absorb and scatter light by localized surface plasmon resonance spr optical properties including resonance wavelength and absorption intensity depend on particle size shape orientation spacing and dielectric environments 40 the colorless supernatants formed in control samples suggest the absence of cu2 reduction and nps synthesis while color change is a widely used indicator of cu based np biosynthesis insight can be gained from the light absorbance of samples by uv vis absorption spectroscopy as has been used in previous studies that characterized semiconductor nps 41 absorption peaks at 246 258 nm were observed for the samples shown in fig 2 a d and for the control sample tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu fig s3a characteristic of cu and cuo nps due to dipole oscillation 37 42 44 absorbance peak intensity for different samples and treatment times can be seen in fig 2f smaller features were observed between 500 300 nm for the three primary samples under study fig 2a c possibly related to cu2o nps 45 cuo nps 37 46 or sub 10 nm cu nps with thin cuo shell 21 47 therefore in accordance with observed color change uv vis absorption spectra confirmed the biosynthesis of metallic cu or cuo nps and provided some evidence for the existence of cu2o nps the spr peak at 570 nm characteristic of cu nps was not seen for any of the samples the absence of this peak has been rationalised previously due to the formation of cuo or cucl2 layers around nps and the small size of cu nps in the sample 36 39 43 47 this is supported by the lack of an intense absorbance observed at 570 nm known to be an spr feature creighton and eadon 1991 as a possible result of low concentration and polydisperse cu nps given that the green and brown colors of these samples correspond to the absorption at 570 nm for metallic cu nps a small broad uv peak characteristic of cu and cuo nps appeared for control samples tap s an h2 0 4cu wt fig 2d and tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu fig s3a likely due to the small amount of copper in the former and the suboptimal dark conditions for photosynthetic algal cells in the latter decreasing metabolic activity and nps formation characteristic uv peak did not form for control samples tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu fig s3b and tap s an no alga 10cu fig s3c the light sensitive rbc culture was not capable of np synthesis following extensive destruction during irradiation fig s3b irradiation alone is not capable of nps synthesis either fig s3c slightly elevated levels of h2 in tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu and tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu samples fig s2b c did not improve nps formation according to uv vis spectra in agreement with observed color change during treatment the supernatant of sonicated algae spiked with cu2 after sonication exhibited increased absorbance at 250 nm without the defined peak shape associated with cu and cuo nps fig 2e black curve that absorbance was ascribed to soluble complexes of cu2 with cellular components of impaired algal cells 48 as supernatants of sonicated algal cells without addition of cu2 displayed less absorption in the 200 300 nm range fig 2e red curve similar absorption spectra shape in the 250 300 nm range was observed of supernatants for 2 h polluted anaerobic and aerobic tap s cultures fig 2a b day 0 spectra and cu2 polluted sonicated algal culture the observation indicated formation of soluble complexes of cu2 with algal biomolecules at the beginning of cu2 bioremediation and slower initiation of biosynthesis of cu nps delayed nucleation in cu nps synthesis following the formation of soluble complexes of cu2 with biomolecules can be the rationale for observed pattern in absorbance increase for tap s an h2 0 4cu wt fig 2d and tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu fig s3a supernatants in contrast for tap a wt 10cu supernatant immediately after cu2 addition uv peak appeared indicating the presence of more or more active biomolecules in this culture sulfur depletion decreased the rate of nps formation in tap s medium and low concentration of cu2 additionally in non polluted control culture uv vis spectra recorded after one month of samples storage at 5 7 c indicated just minor changes in absorption fig s4a therefore the aqueous solutions of cu nps remained stable at least up to 1 month at 5 7 c that aqueous phase stability of biosynthesized cu nps was observed before it was attributed to the strongly capped sulfur containing amino acids cysteine methionine 36 49 other biomolecules might be involved in formation of stable solution of nps according to arya et al 21 3 2 cut cuf and ph in supernatants of algae treated cu polluted media if absorption peaks correspond to cu or cuo nps supernatants should be depleted of free cu2 and cu must remain in media after treatment therefore analysis of cut and cuf in supernatants was performed cuf in control tap s samples indicated the extent of cu2 complexation with algal biomolecules and the influence of algal metabolic activity on bioremediation and biosynthesis concomitant ph measurements were taken to assess influence on cu speciation 50 and as an indication of algal metabolic activity aas measurements of supernatant cut at the end of the treatment showed that most of the initial cu remained in the media after algae were removed fig 3 a up to 20 of cu was removed with algae from the primary samples tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10cu and tap a wt 10cu about 30 of cu was removed from the tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu control sample a decrease of 5 of cut was observed for the tap s no algae 10cu control sample after being illuminated for 7 days providing evidence of algae independent sedimentation of cu in irradiated media only a small decrease in cut was observed for the tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu control sample algae from aerobic tap s supernatant were brown providing another indication that some nps were inside or attached to algal cells removed from media together with algae therefore analysis of cut after treatment in the three primary samples under study and the control samples with cu2 treatment in dark conditions and with irradiated light sensitive rbc strain of alga suggested the involvement of algal cell with intact cell structure in cu2 adsorption reduction and cu nps synthesis suggested occurrence of cu2 interactions with algae in processes of bioremediation and biosynthesis is supported by the brown appearance of algal biomass in brown aerobic tap s medium reduction and cell surface adsorption of metal ion au3 has already been demonstrated for pristine unicellular green alga 51 however acidic conditions ph 3 5 are most favorable for metal ion sorption 8 which was not observed in any of the samples fig 3a cupric ise measurements showed that in the tap s no algae 10cu control sample most of the cu was in the form of free cu2 about 4 mg l 1 of free cu2 remained in the media of the control samples tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu and tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu after 3 days of treatment fig 3a conversely only small amount 1 mg l 1 of free cu2 was left in the primary samples tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10cu and tap a wt 10cu cupric ise therefore demonstrated the removal of toxic free cu2 from polluted media by metabolically active algae ise also showed the absence of cu2 complexation and reduction in tap s no algae 10cu control sample cell constituents released from light damaged light sensitive rbc cells did not adequately bind cu2 in addition low algal metabolic activity in a suboptimal dark condition may have given rise to reduced complexation and transformation of free cu2 inferred already from optical analysis measurements of cuf are consistent with the pourbaix diagram potential ph diagram of cu 50 chemical equilibrium should move from cuf towards precipitates of cupric oxide cuo cuprous oxide cu2o or metallic cu in the primary samples tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10c and tap a wt 10cu at the measured ph values fig 3a graphical presentation of inter relations between variables showed a strong positive correlation between absorbance and ph and mostly confirms a negative correlation between ph and cuf in different samples fig 3b the largest ph value 8 were observed for aerobic media biosynthesis of more stable and smaller cu nps at higher ph has already been demonstrated podstawczyk et al 2019 at larger ph negative charge and the reducing power of various functional groups of phytochemicals increases 18 for both cu polluted and non polluted media where significant h2 production was measured tap s an h2 wt 10cu and tap s an h2 0 4cu wt the final ph was around 7 7 therefore an increase in the ph was probably a consequence of normal and preserved cell metabolism and was not influenced by exposure to a high level of cu the ph of the tap s no algae 10cu control sample did not change substantially from an initial value of 7 0 during treatment the same was observed for control samples tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu and tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu indicating diminished algal metabolism and viability viability treated as a dichotomous variable based on semi quantitative evaluation by fluorescence microscopy and auxiliary indicators ph and algal morphology was positively correlated with ph and negatively with cuf as can be seen in the scatterplots presented in fig 3b this implies that algal viability is required to remove cuf efficiently from the media cellular activity of viable alga can act through changes in media ph providing biomolecules that act as complexing agents reductants capping and stabilizing agents algal cell surface vacuoles and vesicles also provide local environments with distinct ph ion concentration shape size enzyme catalytic activity chemical and physical properties of other biomolecules which might influence the formation and stability of the particles 18 52 53 a small percentage 5 of cut was removed in aged anaerobic tap s an h2 wt 10cu supernatant during storage in contrast aged aerobic tap and tap s showed stable cut values however there were no statistically significant differences in cut cuf or ph values between cu polluted fresh and aged primary samples tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10cu and tap a wt 10cu fig s4b samples showed stable ph cut and cuf values on aging and were not found to be inter related with photoproduced h2 fig 3b conter to our predictions 3 3 direct analysis of cu nps by tem tem studies were conducted to provide proof of the biosynthesis of stable sub 10 nm phase pure metallic cu nps in the three primary samples tem and eds analysis were performed on supernatants that had indicated presence of cu cuo nps based on optical cut cuf and ph analysis supernatants from analyzed tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10cu and tap a wt 10cu were found to contain nps with similar morphology and size which suggest similar mechanism of nps biosynthesis in all three samples the dark field stem fig 4 a overlapped with the cu signal map from eds fig 4b and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem fig 4c d indicated the presence of polydisperse spherical and well dispersed sub 10 nm cu nps the crystallinity of the cu nps in all samples was confirmed by observed lattice fringes in 5 6 nm nps at high resolution lattice d spacing values of 0 21 nm and 0 18 nm that appeared in different particles fig 4c d were ascribed to 111 and 200 crystal planes of metallic cu the planes 111 for cuo and cu2o crystallites with lattice d spacing values of 0 23 nm and 0 25 nm were not found in any of the nps analyzed crystals containing sulfur chlorine or phosphorus in addition to copper were not found tem analysis of tap s a wt 10cu supernatant aged in the ambient atmosphere on the tem grid for several weeks still demonstrated the presence of pure cu nps fig s5 broader size distribution suggest the formation of nps through multiple nucleation events 17 organic ligands with high affinity for metal surfaces might protect sub 10 nm cu nps from further growth and oxidation during nucleation and growth processes 17 36 41 43 54 55 indeed stem and eds analysis demonstrated the co localization of cu nps with large c rich organic objects 1 μm on the tem grid supporting film in all three samples one such objects is presented in fig 5 surface organic ligands can have both beneficial or detrimental effects on the properties of bare nps 41 56 3 4 algal viability during the treatments algal viability was evaluated by following changes in cell morphology and fda enzymatic cleavage and intracellular retention of the fluorescent product the algae from tap s an h2 wt 10cu and tap s a wt 10cu samples lost their swimming ability and surface smoothness figs 6 a b and s6c fluorescence of fluorescein also decreased significantly for 3 day cu exposed algae fig 6a b on the contrary at least part of the algae of tap a wt 10cu culture were still viable at the end of the 3 day treatment flagella on the bright field micrograph are evidence of the motility of a healthy part of the culture algae did not appear distended in the bright field and dic tap medium contains sulfur that prevents cu hyperaccumulation inside cells still cut analysis showed that the total amount of cu inside or attached to algal cells after 3 days of treatment was similar for all tree primary cultures in both tap and tap s media fast development of strong brown color and intense absorption peak characteristic of cu nps in tap a wt 10cu sample also suggest quick cu2 reduction and formation of cu nps strong green fluorescence which appeared for a large part of the culture is yet another evidence of the algal viability figs 6c and s6 however viability decreased gradually during the 3 day bioremediation of tap s an h2 wt 10cu and tap s a wt 10cu samples decrease in algal viability coincided with an increase in absorbance for a peak characteristic of cu nps in uv vis spectra figs 2a b and 6 f algae in the tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu control sample were small lost their motility and had diminished viability as demonstrated by faint green fluorescence fig 6d in agreement with previous analysis of absorbance ph and cuf the smooth appearance of cells suggested limited intracellular accumulation of cu in contrast a larger amount of cu was attached with algae cut analysis that indicated that metal adsorption on the cell surface is a passive process complete absence of green fluorescence was observed for the light sensitive rbc strain of c reinhardtii the cells in rbc culture appeared severely damaged fig 6e therefore algal viability was confirmed to be vital for the efficient transformation of excess cu2 into cu nps under the conditions tested the detailed underlying mechanism of cu nps synthesis in c reinhardtii remains to be distinguished after treatment of cu polluted media for different periods algal regrowth was examined by placing algae in fresh nutrient media i e wastewater like tap medium in small wells of a sterile transparent microplate for a week algal samples were collected from the reactors at 2 h day 0 and 1 2 and 3 days after cu2 addition the algae collected from the tap a wt 10cu sample regrew into viable dense algal cultures with highly motile cells that appeared as dark green cultures in the microplate wells fig 7 first line algae from three tap s an h2 wt 10cu samples had small regrowth after exposure to cu for 1 2 and 3 days a profuse culture recovery was observed only for 2 h of exposure to cu fig 7 second fifth and seventh lines a combination of sulfate deprivation anoxia required for h2 production and cu exposure combined with irradiation impaired algae considerably the observed impairments manifested in reduced cu nps synthesis as suggested by uv vis spectra fig 2a in contrast significant algal recovery was observed from the tap s a wt 10cu culture regardless of the cu treatment length the algae recovered into dark green cultures fig 7 fourth line the algae from tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu culture showed limited viability by the fluorescent fda method and preserved cell integrity in the bright field fig 6d this algal culture recovered better than the h2 producing culture algal regrowth was successful for all cu pollution exposure times fig 7 third line the anaerobic tap s culture of the light sensitive algal strain rbc was destroyed after the cu treatment under moderate light conditions as indicated by bright field micrographs fig 6e however the rbc cells successfully recovered in the microplate wells under the low moderate light conditions in fresh nutrient media fig 7 sixth line recovery was slower than for the wt algae from the aerobic tap a wt 10cu or tap s a wt 10cu samples but faster than for the wt algae from the tap s an h2 wt 10cu samples regardless of the relatively high cu pollution previously observed to be toxic for the wt c reinhardtii 60 the algal culture was still able to recover once cu exposure had ended the regrowth method provided additional evidence for the importance of algal viability for efficient cu nps synthesis furthermore the regrowth method has demonstrated that after cu bioremediation and cu nps recovery from temporally high cu industrial discharge algae may continue to be used in wastewater treatment 4 conclusions treatment of cu polluted wastewater like complex nutrient media with c reinhardtii in aerobic and anoxic conditions with photoproduced h2 formed brown and green media supernatants cupric ise demonstrated the removal of toxic free cu2 from polluted media by algal treatment aas measurements revealed cu s persistence in media after treatment while the uv vis spectra provided evidence for the formation of cu based nps experiments conducted with the impaired light sensitive rbc strain of c reinhardtii and with sonicated algal cells disprove only the formation of soluble cu complexes with cellular components together with experiments conducted in dark conditions these experiments also suggest that viable algae are required for cu nps biosynthesis algal viability assessment by fda method cell morphology observations and post treatment regrowth of algae confirmed efficient biosynthesis of cu nps by metabolically more active and less impaired algal cultures tem observations of supernatants proved the existence of stable sub 10 nm phase pure metallic cu nps in different samples biosynthesized cu nps were co localized with organic objects in all three samples analyzed by tem organic ligands appear to be responsible for protecting cu nps from further growth agglomeration and oxidation between and after biosynthesis the observed affinity of biomineralized cu nps for organic objects promises cu nps recovery from complex media by tailored organic adsorbent in the next step funding information this work was supported by the european regional development fund and ministry of

13432,environmentally benign algae mediated biosynthesis of valuable copper based materials in wastewater combined with cupric ion cu2 bioremediation has the potential to reduce the cost of wastewater treatment and generate high quality biosolids this study investigated the ability of a wild type strain of chlamydomonas reinhardtii to bioremediate free cu2 in wastewater like nutrient media during the biosynthesis of copper nanoparticles cu nps the color of supernatants from treated cu polluted media provided a first indication of cu based nps formation in the aqueous phase analysis by fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis observations of cell morphology and algal regrowth experiments after treatment showed that algal viability was crucial for efficient cu2 reduction to cu nps uv vis absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that sulfur free medium which enables sustained hydrogen photoproduction in alga was not the most efficient in nps formation dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy stem images overlapped with cu signal map from energy dispersive x ray spectrometry eds and high resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of polydisperse spherical and well dispersed sub 10 nm cu nps crystallites exclusively in algae treated heavily cu polluted media 10 mg l 1 stem and eds also demonstrated the affinity of cu nps for carbon rich organic objects overall this study demonstrates the feasibility of cu2 bioremediation from the wastewater like complex nutrient media and the simultaneous biosynthesis of cu nps by viable green microalga keywords chlamydomonasreinhardtii viable microalga simulated municipal wastewater cupric ion bioremediation hydrogen photoproduction copper nanoparticle biosynthesis 1 introduction copper cu is a frequently encountered metal contaminant in municipal wastewater it has adverse environmental effects on receiving water bodies and reduces the quality of the biosolids below the standard required for their use as fertilizer or safe disposal exceedances often relate to various industrial sources and the use of cu containing pesticides in conventional and organic agriculture 1 while a wide range of metabolic processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes requires cu increased concentration can have detrimental effects on organisms for example contaminated coastal seawater has been found to exhibit decreased biodiversity 2 elevated cu levels in the environment can cause co selection for antibiotic resistance 3 and poses an additional threat to coral health in warming oceans 4 free or weakly complexed copper can also be harmful to humans 5 in general free cupric ion cu2 is evidently very toxic cu chemical species 6 7 removal of trace metals in the 10 100 mg l 1 concentration range from wastewater is costly and challenging to achieve with the electrochemical and physicochemical methods typically employed drawbacks to the conventional approaches of metal polluted wastewater treatment include demanding chemical and energy requirements and the formation of hazardous biosolids or other waste byproducts that require specific disposal 8 12 an attractive alternative to these approaches is offered by the biosynthesis of zero valent metals alloys or inorganic organic composites which take place together with the bioremediation process this promising biotechnological approach has the potential to remove trace concentration of metal ions improving the quality of biosolids while producing no toxic waste and reducing the cost of wastewater treatment the production of various nanosized particles by prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms has been reported through both intracellular or extracellular routes a wide variety of organisms also form organic inorganic composites with an ordered structure using biopolymers such as proteins and microbe cells different physical and chemical conditions exposure time microorganism species and strains and biomineralization scaffold proteins can control the rate of particle formation size and morphology of bio produced nanoparticles nps 13 from the perspective of np production biological synthesis alone has many advantages regarding cost speed simplicity and scalability it is also environment friendly as it does not require organic solvents or any other hazardous chemicals and has low energy demands 14 15 just as the recovery of precious metals has been proposed to reduce the cost of wastewater treatment 10 the recovery of many other biominerals may be of significant value 15 17 the importance of algae in wastewater treatment based on nutrient assimilation and valuable biomass formation is well documented the biosynthesis of silver palladium silver chloride gold zinc oxide and copper nps among others by algae have been reported 18 19 barwal et al 2011 described the formation of silver nps snp by cellular proteins of c reinhardtii most proteins associated with biosynthesis and stabilization of snp were part of cellular oxido reductive processes 20 however various functional groups of algal phytochemicals such as polysaccharides alkaloids polyphenols and proteins can serve as effective metal reducing capping and stabilizing agent in the biosynthesis of metallic nps 18 21 22 posewitz et al 2009 reported that numerous species of chlamydomonas produce hydrogen which can contribute to the reduction of metal pollutants standard electrode potentials e at 25 c and 101 325 kpa 1 atm predict the ability of h2 to reduce cuprous ion cu and cu2 to zero valent cu as well as two other major metal contaminants hg2 and cr6 to their less toxic forms hg and cr3 23 therefore h2 producing algae are expected to facilitate the reduction of cu2 and the formation of metallic cu a powerful tool for sustained h2 production in c reinhardtii was observed to be sulfur deprivation 24 25 31 no published study yet has investigating bioremediation of the common metal pollutant cu2 coupled with the biosynthesis of valuable cu based nps in the wastewater like complex nutrient media by ubiquitous green microalga the main objective of this research was to study the ability of the wild type wt strain of green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii c reinhardtii for the bioremediation of heavily cu polluted municipal wastewater and simultaneous production of valuable cu nps bioremediation and biosynthesis were carried out in aerobic and anoxic conditions in a complete tris acetate phosphate tap medium that simulated raw municipal wastewater table s1 and sulfur free tap tap s the wastewater s characteristics listed in table s1 were collected from reports of two local wastewater treatment plants wwtp from the food and agriculture organization fao 26 and scientific publications 27 29 successful cu2 bioremediation and cu based nps biosynthesis was initially assessed based on media color change and uv vis analysis of their supernatant total cu concentration cut and free cu2 concentration cuf was then determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy aas and with a cupric ion selective electrode ise respectively this was analyzed alongside ph and algal metabolic activity reliable determination of algal viability during treatment enabled the fluorescein diacetate fda method cell morphology observations and algal regrowth several control experiments were conducted to rigorously assess cu2 bioremediation and cu nps biosynthesis by algae including the use of a light sensitive rubisco rbc strain of algae the wt strain of algae under dark conditions and ultrasonicated algal culture followed by cu exposure dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy stem high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds were used for direct observation of nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of media and cu2 solutions tap medium was prepared according to guidelines from the chlamydomonas resource center crc at the university of minnesota usa 30 to create tap s medium 5 g of mgso4 7h2o and hunter s trace elements hte were replaced by 4 12 g of mgcl2 6h2o and sulfur free hunter s trace elements hte s respectively hte and hte s were purchased from crc a stock solution of cu2 10 g l 1 was prepared by dissolving cucl2 2h2o fischer scientific usa in ddh2o and stored at 5 7 c tap and tap

foil algal cultures were maintained in a solid medium under a low photon flux of 5 10 μmol m 2 s 1 or in dim light for up to 6 months after being received from crc liquid cultures were grown in erlenmeyer flasks at a photon flux density of 30 μmol m 2 s 1 or in dim light in an orbital shaker at 100 rpm and 26 28 c for new algal culture a loopful of algae from solid tap medium was transferred into 50 ml of liquid tap media and grown to the mid exponential phase a 10 ml aliquot of cell suspension was used to prepare 150 ml of culture then grown to the late exponential phase small oval and motile cells with a cell density of 3 6 106 cells ml 1 were harvested by centrifugation at 1000x g for 5 min at 23 c twice and resuspended in tap or tap s medium algal intactness and motility were preserved during the described procedures based on the procedures reported by melis et al 2000 and pinto et al 2013 algal samples were inspected by optical microscope at 100x and 400x magnification for their motility size shape and contaminations cells stained with lugol s iodine solution 10 μl per 1 ml of algal cultures were counted with a hemocytometer 2 3 algal treatment of cu polluted media algal cultures were placed into 250 ml borosilicate reagent bottles covered with an h2 tight modular lid without or with an outlet for gases borosilicate reagent bottles and stirring bars were washed in 20 hno3 technical grade overnight between experiments lids were made of multiple distributors for bottles d612 08 screw joints d598 06 and d593 06 an airtight tube s1815 04 and gaskets h973 14 for sampling bohlender germany for the aerobic tap s culture the reagent bottle was covered with a cotton plug aerobic tap sample was prepared with the modular lid which enabled accurate sampling of gases that had evolved during treatment anaerobic conditions were not created as photosynthesis was not inhibited in the setup cultures were incubated at 25 c with minimal stirring at continuous low moderate illumination of 40 μmol m 2 s 1 measured inside bottles the setup is shown in fig s1 to estimate the amount of h2 produced by the algal culture 2 ml of gas was drawn from the headspace of the culture and analyzed by mass spectrometry thermostar pfeiffer vacuum germany algal cultures were pre incubated for 3 5 days by which time a significant amount of h2 accumulated in the headspace of anaerobic tap s cultures other samples were treated in the same way to provide comparable experimental conditions after the pre incubation period cu2 was injected into the media to the final concentration of 10 mg l 1 samples were collected at day 0 2 h and during 1 2 and 3 days after metal addition algae were sonicated with an ultrasonic homogenizer labsonic m sartorius group germany on ice repeatedly in 20 s intervals until the absorbance of about 1 au at 260 nm was measured after sonication samples with impaired algal cells were incubated with cu2 for 1 h uv vis absorption spectra were then recorded for uncontaminated and cu spiked supernatants the experiments were repeated two to eight times the control sonication experiments were not repeated 2 4 analysis of supernatants supernatants with biosynthesized cu nps were separated from algae by centrifugation at 11 000x g for 10 min at room temperature immediately after centrifugation formation of cu based nps was monitored on a lambda 35 uv vis spectrometer perkinelmer usa between 200 700 nm for each sample up to one week after treatment cut was determined with aas spectraa 10 instrument varian usa before analysis samples were digested with hno3 analytical grade with the final concentration of 1 cuf was measured with an ise by using a direct calibration procedure a cupric half cell electrode was used in combination with the double junction reference electrode thermo fischer scientific usa measurement of ph was performed alongside measurement of cuf microscopy characterization of cu nps was done by transmission electron microscope tem jem 2100f jeol japan operated at 200 kv images were obtained using a charge couple device ccd camera the microscope is equipped with a scanning transmission electron microscope stem unit operated with an annular dark field detector and an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds x max 80 t oxford instruments uk which enables spatially resolved elemental analysis tem samples were prepared by dipping a 400 mesh nickel grid coated by amorphous c lacey supporting film into supernatant and air drying several samples were also analyzed after being aged on the tem grid between analyses supernatants were stored at 5 7 c 2 5 analysis of algae algal morphology enzymatic capacity for fluorescein diacetate fda cleavage and cell capability for the retention of the fluorescent product were analyzed immediately after sampling using an axio observer z1 epifluorescence microscope zeiss germany algal capability to recover after cu2 bioremediation was evaluated by regrowing cells in a transparent 96 well microtiter plate containing tap medium cell size morphology and motility were examined in a bright field selected samples were analyzed by differential interference contrast dic microscopy enzymatic activity and cell membrane integrity was assessed by green fluorescence of cells stained by fda sigma usa using a 38 he gfp filter set for green fluorescent protein the fda probe was prepared and handled as recommended by jochem 1999 with some modifications briefly stock solution of fda of 5 mg l 1 was made in acetone and stored at 20 c the working solution was a 50 fold dilution of stock solution in ddh2o fda 3 μl was added to100 μl of algal culture and incubated at rt in the dark for 20 min cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 1000x g for 5 min at rt resuspended in 20 μl of filter sterilized 0 9 nacl and observed under the microscope for regrowth experiment algae were harvested by centrifugation at 1000x g for 5 min at 23 c and resuspended in tap medium equal volumes of algal cultures and tap were combined in microplate wells the microtiter plate was covered with a transparent lid and wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation before being placed under a continuous illumination of 30 μmol m 2 s 1 for a week in an orbital shaker at 100 rpm at 26 28 c optical microscopy indicated that dark green cultures were the densest and contained motile cells 2 6 statistical analysis mean values and standard deviations sd were calculated normality test was performed and outliers were identified with dixon s q test to test for the homogeneity of variances leven s test was applied one way analysis of variance anova and post hoc tukey test determined significantly different mean absorption values at around 250 nm or exactly at 250 nm for samples without peak absorbance and to determine the significantly different mean ph values significantly different mean cut and mean cuf values were determined with welch s test as the homogeneity assumption was violated for these two variables 34 the selected confidence level was 95 multivariate plots were applied for graphical presentation of the inter relations among absorbance ph cut cuf h2 and algal viability 3 results and discussion 3 1 optical properties of algae treated cu polluted media supernatants the color of anaerobic tap s culture with abundant h2 photoproduction and the addition of 10 mg l 1 cu2 tap s an h2 wt 10cu fig s2a turned green during treatment algae in aerobic cu polluted tap s medium tap s a wt 10cu and tap medium tap a wt 10cu formed brown supernatants fig 1 a control sample of anaerobic tap s culture that photoproduced h2 and contained a small amount of cu2 0 4 mg l 1 for optimal algal growth tap s an h2 0 4cu wt was only lightly colored at the end of the experiment other cu polluted control samples remained colorless including anaerobic tap s media i without algae tap s no algae 10cu ii with algae kept in dark conditions tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu and iii with rbc mutant tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu the observed color change of media upon treatment are in agreement with previously reported green syntheses of cu based nps 21 35 39 tatsuma 2013 discussed that metal clusters with a diameter of 2 nm absorb light based on electron transition from occupied to unoccupied orbitals while larger nps up to several hundred nm absorb and scatter light by localized surface plasmon resonance spr optical properties including resonance wavelength and absorption intensity depend on particle size shape orientation spacing and dielectric environments 40 the colorless supernatants formed in control samples suggest the absence of cu2 reduction and nps synthesis while color change is a widely used indicator of cu based np biosynthesis insight can be gained from the light absorbance of samples by uv vis absorption spectroscopy as has been used in previous studies that characterized semiconductor nps 41 absorption peaks at 246 258 nm were observed for the samples shown in fig 2 a d and for the control sample tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu fig s3a characteristic of cu and cuo nps due to dipole oscillation 37 42 44 absorbance peak intensity for different samples and treatment times can be seen in fig 2f smaller features were observed between 500 300 nm for the three primary samples under study fig 2a c possibly related to cu2o nps 45 cuo nps 37 46 or sub 10 nm cu nps with thin cuo shell 21 47 therefore in accordance with observed color change uv vis absorption spectra confirmed the biosynthesis of metallic cu or cuo nps and provided some evidence for the existence of cu2o nps the spr peak at 570 nm characteristic of cu nps was not seen for any of the samples the absence of this peak has been rationalised previously due to the formation of cuo or cucl2 layers around nps and the small size of cu nps in the sample 36 39 43 47 this is supported by the lack of an intense absorbance observed at 570 nm known to be an spr feature creighton and eadon 1991 as a possible result of low concentration and polydisperse cu nps given that the green and brown colors of these samples correspond to the absorption at 570 nm for metallic cu nps a small broad uv peak characteristic of cu and cuo nps appeared for control samples tap s an h2 0 4cu wt fig 2d and tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu fig s3a likely due to the small amount of copper in the former and the suboptimal dark conditions for photosynthetic algal cells in the latter decreasing metabolic activity and nps formation characteristic uv peak did not form for control samples tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu fig s3b and tap s an no alga 10cu fig s3c the light sensitive rbc culture was not capable of np synthesis following extensive destruction during irradiation fig s3b irradiation alone is not capable of nps synthesis either fig s3c slightly elevated levels of h2 in tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu and tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu samples fig s2b c did not improve nps formation according to uv vis spectra in agreement with observed color change during treatment the supernatant of sonicated algae spiked with cu2 after sonication exhibited increased absorbance at 250 nm without the defined peak shape associated with cu and cuo nps fig 2e black curve that absorbance was ascribed to soluble complexes of cu2 with cellular components of impaired algal cells 48 as supernatants of sonicated algal cells without addition of cu2 displayed less absorption in the 200 300 nm range fig 2e red curve similar absorption spectra shape in the 250 300 nm range was observed of supernatants for 2 h polluted anaerobic and aerobic tap s cultures fig 2a b day 0 spectra and cu2 polluted sonicated algal culture the observation indicated formation of soluble complexes of cu2 with algal biomolecules at the beginning of cu2 bioremediation and slower initiation of biosynthesis of cu nps delayed nucleation in cu nps synthesis following the formation of soluble complexes of cu2 with biomolecules can be the rationale for observed pattern in absorbance increase for tap s an h2 0 4cu wt fig 2d and tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu fig s3a supernatants in contrast for tap a wt 10cu supernatant immediately after cu2 addition uv peak appeared indicating the presence of more or more active biomolecules in this culture sulfur depletion decreased the rate of nps formation in tap s medium and low concentration of cu2 additionally in non polluted control culture uv vis spectra recorded after one month of samples storage at 5 7 c indicated just minor changes in absorption fig s4a therefore the aqueous solutions of cu nps remained stable at least up to 1 month at 5 7 c that aqueous phase stability of biosynthesized cu nps was observed before it was attributed to the strongly capped sulfur containing amino acids cysteine methionine 36 49 other biomolecules might be involved in formation of stable solution of nps according to arya et al 21 3 2 cut cuf and ph in supernatants of algae treated cu polluted media if absorption peaks correspond to cu or cuo nps supernatants should be depleted of free cu2 and cu must remain in media after treatment therefore analysis of cut and cuf in supernatants was performed cuf in control tap s samples indicated the extent of cu2 complexation with algal biomolecules and the influence of algal metabolic activity on bioremediation and biosynthesis concomitant ph measurements were taken to assess influence on cu speciation 50 and as an indication of algal metabolic activity aas measurements of supernatant cut at the end of the treatment showed that most of the initial cu remained in the media after algae were removed fig 3 a up to 20 of cu was removed with algae from the primary samples tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10cu and tap a wt 10cu about 30 of cu was removed from the tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu control sample a decrease of 5 of cut was observed for the tap s no algae 10cu control sample after being illuminated for 7 days providing evidence of algae independent sedimentation of cu in irradiated media only a small decrease in cut was observed for the tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu control sample algae from aerobic tap s supernatant were brown providing another indication that some nps were inside or attached to algal cells removed from media together with algae therefore analysis of cut after treatment in the three primary samples under study and the control samples with cu2 treatment in dark conditions and with irradiated light sensitive rbc strain of alga suggested the involvement of algal cell with intact cell structure in cu2 adsorption reduction and cu nps synthesis suggested occurrence of cu2 interactions with algae in processes of bioremediation and biosynthesis is supported by the brown appearance of algal biomass in brown aerobic tap s medium reduction and cell surface adsorption of metal ion au3 has already been demonstrated for pristine unicellular green alga 51 however acidic conditions ph 3 5 are most favorable for metal ion sorption 8 which was not observed in any of the samples fig 3a cupric ise measurements showed that in the tap s no algae 10cu control sample most of the cu was in the form of free cu2 about 4 mg l 1 of free cu2 remained in the media of the control samples tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu and tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu after 3 days of treatment fig 3a conversely only small amount 1 mg l 1 of free cu2 was left in the primary samples tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10cu and tap a wt 10cu cupric ise therefore demonstrated the removal of toxic free cu2 from polluted media by metabolically active algae ise also showed the absence of cu2 complexation and reduction in tap s no algae 10cu control sample cell constituents released from light damaged light sensitive rbc cells did not adequately bind cu2 in addition low algal metabolic activity in a suboptimal dark condition may have given rise to reduced complexation and transformation of free cu2 inferred already from optical analysis measurements of cuf are consistent with the pourbaix diagram potential ph diagram of cu 50 chemical equilibrium should move from cuf towards precipitates of cupric oxide cuo cuprous oxide cu2o or metallic cu in the primary samples tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10c and tap a wt 10cu at the measured ph values fig 3a graphical presentation of inter relations between variables showed a strong positive correlation between absorbance and ph and mostly confirms a negative correlation between ph and cuf in different samples fig 3b the largest ph value 8 were observed for aerobic media biosynthesis of more stable and smaller cu nps at higher ph has already been demonstrated podstawczyk et al 2019 at larger ph negative charge and the reducing power of various functional groups of phytochemicals increases 18 for both cu polluted and non polluted media where significant h2 production was measured tap s an h2 wt 10cu and tap s an h2 0 4cu wt the final ph was around 7 7 therefore an increase in the ph was probably a consequence of normal and preserved cell metabolism and was not influenced by exposure to a high level of cu the ph of the tap s no algae 10cu control sample did not change substantially from an initial value of 7 0 during treatment the same was observed for control samples tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu and tap s an lowh2 rbc 10cu indicating diminished algal metabolism and viability viability treated as a dichotomous variable based on semi quantitative evaluation by fluorescence microscopy and auxiliary indicators ph and algal morphology was positively correlated with ph and negatively with cuf as can be seen in the scatterplots presented in fig 3b this implies that algal viability is required to remove cuf efficiently from the media cellular activity of viable alga can act through changes in media ph providing biomolecules that act as complexing agents reductants capping and stabilizing agents algal cell surface vacuoles and vesicles also provide local environments with distinct ph ion concentration shape size enzyme catalytic activity chemical and physical properties of other biomolecules which might influence the formation and stability of the particles 18 52 53 a small percentage 5 of cut was removed in aged anaerobic tap s an h2 wt 10cu supernatant during storage in contrast aged aerobic tap and tap s showed stable cut values however there were no statistically significant differences in cut cuf or ph values between cu polluted fresh and aged primary samples tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10cu and tap a wt 10cu fig s4b samples showed stable ph cut and cuf values on aging and were not found to be inter related with photoproduced h2 fig 3b conter to our predictions 3 3 direct analysis of cu nps by tem tem studies were conducted to provide proof of the biosynthesis of stable sub 10 nm phase pure metallic cu nps in the three primary samples tem and eds analysis were performed on supernatants that had indicated presence of cu cuo nps based on optical cut cuf and ph analysis supernatants from analyzed tap s an h2 wt 10cu tap s a wt 10cu and tap a wt 10cu were found to contain nps with similar morphology and size which suggest similar mechanism of nps biosynthesis in all three samples the dark field stem fig 4 a overlapped with the cu signal map from eds fig 4b and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem fig 4c d indicated the presence of polydisperse spherical and well dispersed sub 10 nm cu nps the crystallinity of the cu nps in all samples was confirmed by observed lattice fringes in 5 6 nm nps at high resolution lattice d spacing values of 0 21 nm and 0 18 nm that appeared in different particles fig 4c d were ascribed to 111 and 200 crystal planes of metallic cu the planes 111 for cuo and cu2o crystallites with lattice d spacing values of 0 23 nm and 0 25 nm were not found in any of the nps analyzed crystals containing sulfur chlorine or phosphorus in addition to copper were not found tem analysis of tap s a wt 10cu supernatant aged in the ambient atmosphere on the tem grid for several weeks still demonstrated the presence of pure cu nps fig s5 broader size distribution suggest the formation of nps through multiple nucleation events 17 organic ligands with high affinity for metal surfaces might protect sub 10 nm cu nps from further growth and oxidation during nucleation and growth processes 17 36 41 43 54 55 indeed stem and eds analysis demonstrated the co localization of cu nps with large c rich organic objects 1 μm on the tem grid supporting film in all three samples one such objects is presented in fig 5 surface organic ligands can have both beneficial or detrimental effects on the properties of bare nps 41 56 3 4 algal viability during the treatments algal viability was evaluated by following changes in cell morphology and fda enzymatic cleavage and intracellular retention of the fluorescent product the algae from tap s an h2 wt 10cu and tap s a wt 10cu samples lost their swimming ability and surface smoothness figs 6 a b and s6c fluorescence of fluorescein also decreased significantly for 3 day cu exposed algae fig 6a b on the contrary at least part of the algae of tap a wt 10cu culture were still viable at the end of the 3 day treatment flagella on the bright field micrograph are evidence of the motility of a healthy part of the culture algae did not appear distended in the bright field and dic tap medium contains sulfur that prevents cu hyperaccumulation inside cells still cut analysis showed that the total amount of cu inside or attached to algal cells after 3 days of treatment was similar for all tree primary cultures in both tap and tap s media fast development of strong brown color and intense absorption peak characteristic of cu nps in tap a wt 10cu sample also suggest quick cu2 reduction and formation of cu nps strong green fluorescence which appeared for a large part of the culture is yet another evidence of the algal viability figs 6c and s6 however viability decreased gradually during the 3 day bioremediation of tap s an h2 wt 10cu and tap s a wt 10cu samples decrease in algal viability coincided with an increase in absorbance for a peak characteristic of cu nps in uv vis spectra figs 2a b and 6 f algae in the tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu control sample were small lost their motility and had diminished viability as demonstrated by faint green fluorescence fig 6d in agreement with previous analysis of absorbance ph and cuf the smooth appearance of cells suggested limited intracellular accumulation of cu in contrast a larger amount of cu was attached with algae cut analysis that indicated that metal adsorption on the cell surface is a passive process complete absence of green fluorescence was observed for the light sensitive rbc strain of c reinhardtii the cells in rbc culture appeared severely damaged fig 6e therefore algal viability was confirmed to be vital for the efficient transformation of excess cu2 into cu nps under the conditions tested the detailed underlying mechanism of cu nps synthesis in c reinhardtii remains to be distinguished after treatment of cu polluted media for different periods algal regrowth was examined by placing algae in fresh nutrient media i e wastewater like tap medium in small wells of a sterile transparent microplate for a week algal samples were collected from the reactors at 2 h day 0 and 1 2 and 3 days after cu2 addition the algae collected from the tap a wt 10cu sample regrew into viable dense algal cultures with highly motile cells that appeared as dark green cultures in the microplate wells fig 7 first line algae from three tap s an h2 wt 10cu samples had small regrowth after exposure to cu for 1 2 and 3 days a profuse culture recovery was observed only for 2 h of exposure to cu fig 7 second fifth and seventh lines a combination of sulfate deprivation anoxia required for h2 production and cu exposure combined with irradiation impaired algae considerably the observed impairments manifested in reduced cu nps synthesis as suggested by uv vis spectra fig 2a in contrast significant algal recovery was observed from the tap s a wt 10cu culture regardless of the cu treatment length the algae recovered into dark green cultures fig 7 fourth line the algae from tap s an lowh2 dark wt 10cu culture showed limited viability by the fluorescent fda method and preserved cell integrity in the bright field fig 6d this algal culture recovered better than the h2 producing culture algal regrowth was successful for all cu pollution exposure times fig 7 third line the anaerobic tap s culture of the light sensitive algal strain rbc was destroyed after the cu treatment under moderate light conditions as indicated by bright field micrographs fig 6e however the rbc cells successfully recovered in the microplate wells under the low moderate light conditions in fresh nutrient media fig 7 sixth line recovery was slower than for the wt algae from the aerobic tap a wt 10cu or tap s a wt 10cu samples but faster than for the wt algae from the tap s an h2 wt 10cu samples regardless of the relatively high cu pollution previously observed to be toxic for the wt c reinhardtii 60 the algal culture was still able to recover once cu exposure had ended the regrowth method provided additional evidence for the importance of algal viability for efficient cu nps synthesis furthermore the regrowth method has demonstrated that after cu bioremediation and cu nps recovery from temporally high cu industrial discharge algae may continue to be used in wastewater treatment 4 conclusions treatment of cu polluted wastewater like complex nutrient media with c reinhardtii in aerobic and anoxic conditions with photoproduced h2 formed brown and green media supernatants cupric ise demonstrated the removal of toxic free cu2 from polluted media by algal treatment aas measurements revealed cu s persistence in media after treatment while the uv vis spectra provided evidence for the formation of cu based nps experiments conducted with the impaired light sensitive rbc strain of c reinhardtii and with sonicated algal cells disprove only the formation of soluble cu complexes with cellular components together with experiments conducted in dark conditions these experiments also suggest that viable algae are required for cu nps biosynthesis algal viability assessment by fda method cell morphology observations and post treatment regrowth of algae confirmed efficient biosynthesis of cu nps by metabolically more active and less impaired algal cultures tem observations of supernatants proved the existence of stable sub 10 nm phase pure metallic cu nps in different samples biosynthesized cu nps were co localized with organic objects in all three samples analyzed by tem organic ligands appear to be responsible for protecting cu nps from further growth agglomeration and oxidation between and after biosynthesis the observed affinity of biomineralized cu nps for organic objects promises cu nps recovery from complex media by tailored organic adsorbent in the next step funding information this work was supported by the european regional development fund and ministry of

13433,greener technologies with high efficiency and cost effectiveness are highly in need to degrade and mineralize the recalcitrant contaminants in water hydrodynamic cavitation hc which is generated by pressure and velocity variation in the system has gained attention in wastewater treatment due to its scalability high energy efficiency minimized toxic solvent usage and simpler reactor design despite having multiple advantages over conventional biological oxidation industrial scale usage of hc has not gained enough popularity due to its relatively higher cost than existing processes this review paper focuses on the application of hydrodynamic cavitation in dye treatment and provides an overview of studies on dye degradation using hydrodynamic cavitation alone or in combination with other oxidation processes the effects of different operational geometric and physicochemical properties of solutions on the process performance have been analyzed and optimum values of different parameters for the treatment of different dyes have been mentioned different combinative approaches hc ozone hc fenton s reagent hc photocatalysis hc hydrogen peroxide have also been discussed and comparative studies among them have been performed future directions have been addressed to carefully control the drawbacks associated with the processes detailed cost estimation and trade off analysis for mineralization of dyes using hc at industrial scale operation has been performed and feasibility of performing hc in large scale has been confirmed where data reaction rate constant cavitation number optimum pressure available from lab scale analysis are taken as basis for scaling up overall hydrodynamic cavitation offers promise for industrial application especially compared to the more traditionally applied ultrasound based treatments keywords hydrodynamic cavitation dye degradation advanced oxidation cost estimation combination approaches 1 introduction the effluents from textile industries contain a large variety of synthetic dyes because up to 20 of total dyes produced is lost in the effluents during the different stages of processing 1 amongst the dyes used in the textile paper or leather industry between 50 70 are azo dyes 2 3 synthetic dyes can have significant impact on the environment and pose a health risk due to their stability toxicity and hazardous properties the synthetic nitrogen containing dyes especially azo dyes can be toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic and their complete removal is of utmost importance in wastewater treatment processes 4 dye degradation can be employed using conventional biological oxidation 5 6 but the drawbacks of biological processes include long treatment times formation of sludge incomplete degradation and formation of microbe inhibiting byproducts 7 for example cripps et al 8 reported that phanerochaete chrysosporium was capable of degrading orange ii tropaeofin o congo red azure b though almost 5 days were required to reach 63 93 decolorization depending on the dye chao and lee 9 reported that 3 days were required for degrading 90 of orange g using phanerochaete chrysosporium capalash and sharma 10 also used p chrysosporium for studying degradation efficiency of 18 azo dyes but only eight could be degraded that too with 40 70 as the decoloration efficacy other technologies currently used to treat dye containing effluents are membrane separation 11 adsorption 12 coagulation based processes 13 and irradiations 14 drawbacks of membrane based technologies include high equipment and regeneration costs caking fouling and temperature limitation sometimes secondary effluent is generated which needs additional treatment significant amount of sludge is produced in electrokinetic coagulation 15 and it also shows poor degradation efficacy with acid dyes coupled with higher cost of treatment based on high cost of applied chemicals as ferrous sulfate ferric chloride etc 16 electrochemical destruction is also effective in degrading dyes 17 but again high cost of electricity makes it economically not feasible silica gel although effective in basic dye removal drives different side reactions e g air binding which prevent commercial application 15 irradiation process is only effective in lab scale and also needs a very high amount of dissolved oxygen 16 considering the associated problems with most of the applied processes it can be said that advanced oxidation processes aops in general offers promise for treatment of wastewater containing dyes multiple reports have indeed been published on effective removal of dyes using aops like ozonation uv fenton oxidation photocatalysis and cavitation 18 19 these processes involve the generation and attack of highly reactive and oxidizing radicals by individual or combined processes to degrade organic pollutants aops are highly effective in mineralization but require chemicals that can be expensive relative to biological process costs 20 hydrodynamic cavitation hc is an efficient oxidation technique that has been reported for over a decade individually or in combination with other aops for degradation of a wide range of organic pollutants in wastewater 21 cavitation involves the formation growth and implosion of microbubble cavities depending on the spatial pressure variation in the liquid the physical and chemical transformations of the pollutants occur in the hotspot region after collapse of microbubbles leading to intense localized temperatures and pressures the physical effects include microjet streaming and high local turbulence importantly the chemical effects including generation of free radicals are more controlling for degradation of pollutants in hc pressure variation is created using flow variation in constriction or by using swirling jet or vortex diode employing vortex flow stator rotor type cavitational reactors have also gained attention in recent studies hc offers promising application due to the ease of operation lower material and chemical costs and possibility of continuous large scale operation another form of cavitation is ultrasound acoustic cavitation ac where cavitation is generated by passing ultrasound wave 20 khz through the medium periodic compression and rarefaction cycles are generated due to the passage of ultrasound in rarefaction cycle cavities are formed by increasing intermolecular distance and in following compression cycle cavities are compressed and collapsed both of the cavitation processes lead to generation of hotspots where local temperature reaches 1000 10 000 k and pressure goes upto 100 1000 bar 22 gogate and bhosale 23 observed that cavitational yield was higher for hc as compared to ac where both were applied for degradation of orange acid ii oa ii and brilliant green bg they also reported that synergistic effect was more when chemical oxidants were used along with hc rather than ac saharan et al 2 3 have also reported that cavitational yield in hc was 13 times higher than that of ac for degradation of acid red 88 dye benito et al 24 showed that time scales for bubble growth and collapse are smaller for ac than hc cavitation has indeed been reported in several studies including coupled processes with other aops such as photocatalysis ozonation fenton s reagent and carbon tetrachloride to bring out better degree of mineralization 25 30 2 31 3 32 there have been multiple reviews published on textile wastewater treatment and dye degradation using aops these reports explain the mechanisms and the effect of several process parameters in detail with respect to the chemistry of treatment the complexity of the textile wastewater matrix with the presence of various dyes including other persistent and semi volatile organic compounds makes the treatment methodology complex since hydrodynamic cavitation with aops can non selectively attack all the pollutants in the matrix it can be employed as a tertiary process in wastewater treatment systems in the case of real wastewater containing high strength of radical scavengers such as carbonate or bicarbonate ions a pretreatment strategy say in terms of ph adjustment will be useful another concern for the real wastewater is presence of salts but this would help the efficacy of hydrodynamic cavitation based on the salting effects that lead to presence of pollutants at favorable positions in the collapsing cavities giving higher extents of degradation analysis of literature revealed that the major drawback of using cavitation for wastewater treatment is the lack of detailed costing reports and a compiled evidence of effectiveness across different dyes a study of cost estimation of hydrodynamic cavitation is thus necessary for critical examination of its application similarly the literature analysis revealed that there have been several reports on the use of cavitation for water and wastewater treatment these reviews on cavitation report a variety of group of compounds ranging from conventional organic to emerging contaminants 33 while some of the reviews discuss cavitation based treatment of dyes in short detailed effect of various parameters and cost estimation information specifically for dyes is missing in literature to the best of our knowledge no review on cavitation discusses treatment of dyes and the cost estimation of the process along with discussing the trade offs observed in costs that need to be studied and understood while scaling up this process the techno economic analysis is very important for the design engineers to make a proper selection of the wastewater treatment strategy including the operating parameters for example makuzi et al 34 presented such analysis based on the processes such as ultraviolet irradiations chlorination and membrane separations considered as individual and combined treatment approaches applied for the sewage treatment literature analysis revealed that such approach has been lacking for hydrodynamic cavitation as the treatment strategy and dyes as the pollutant being considered thereby reflecting the importance of the current review in addition critical examination on scaling up potential has gained attention for making cavitation industrially feasible on an industrial scale due to the dissipation of large power over a large volume control on temperature pressure residence time and liquid properties become very important to ensure optimum results from the chemical reactions parameters that need careful consideration during scaling up are the choice of number size of venturi orifice divergence angle ratio of throat to pipe diameter temperature and pressure intrinsic physio chemical properties of the medium presence of solid particles dissolved gases in liquid energy loss due to convection radiation throughout residence time and erosion on reactor pipe surfaces 35 uniform distribution of cavitational activity is important in the reactor to avoid skewing of scale up procedure in the current study we have analyzed in detail the reports till date on dye degradation as to best of our knowledge a review on dye degradation for only hydrodynamic cavitation based processes has never been reported in the context of operational strategies cost estimation and trade off analysis in this review paper we have presented an estimation of overall capital cost and yearly operation and maintenance cost for mineralization of reactive red 120 dye using hc venturi based system guidelines for the selection of proper combination based methods have also been presented to optimize the total cost thereby establishing overall importance of the work 2 fundamentals of hydrodynamic cavitation and applications for dye degradation hydrodynamic cavitation is based on the formation of cavities when the local pressure inside the cavitating device falls below the vapor pressure of the liquid medium this is employed by the use of an orifice or venturi tube swirling jet vortex diode or stator rotor type devices orifice venturi type devices are most common due to their simpler geometry in these devices high pressure flow on the sudden constriction leads to pressure variations further the pressure is recovered downstream as the flow area increases leading to the subsequent collapse of the cavities additionally a significant loss of energy as a permanent pressure drop downstream of constriction yields high intensity fluid turbulence hotspots are generated due to intense localized temperatures and pressures where the generation of free radicals brings out chemical effects that are harnessed for contaminant degradation 19 36 37 the intensity of cavitation in a cavitating chamber is expressed as dimensionless cavitation number 2 3 c v p 2 p v 1 2 ƍ v 0 2 where p2 denotes the recovered downstream discharge pressure pv ƍ and v0 are the vapor pressure the density of the liquid and the velocity at the throat respectively generally the inception of cavitation occurs at cv 1 and the effect becomes significant at cv values less than 1 typically 0 1 to 0 4 in few cases inception cv may be greater than 1 when solids and dissolved gases are present in the liquid providing additional nuclei for the generation of cavities orifice and venturi based cavitation devices have been widely used as they are considered to be optimum in terms of the trade off between cavitation intensity and cost effectiveness cavitation in venturi is mostly regarded as stable whereas cavitation in the orifice is transient in stable cavitation lower amplitude oscillations of bubbles occur above their equilibrium size whereas in transient cavitation the size of cavities increases many folds of their initial size and cavity oscillates more intensely and collapses more violently cavitational yields vary with variation in geometrical parameters such as device perimeter throat area divergence angle pipe area and operational parameters such as temperature pressure ph initial concentration and initial nuclei radius thus these parameters are needed to be adequately selected while designing and running the cavitational reactor orifices and venturis have also been used widely for the degradation of dyes 2 25 27 38 39 3 the orifice can be of single or multiple holes with varying flow area to have control over the intensity of cavitation similarly venturis are available in different shapes e g slit circular elliptical in venturi pressure recovery is gradual due to small divergent angle and cavities get enough time to attain their maximum size before collapsing but for orifice plate the pressure recovery is sudden and cavities don t get enough time to reach their maximum size and transfer energy efficiently thus energy transfer efficacy of cavity collapse and cavitational yield is more for venturi due to higher active cavitational volume higher reduction in color and toc is generally observed in venturi for example rajoriya et al 30 31 observed that higher decolorization efficiency was obtained using slit venturi flow area 3 14 mm2 as compared to all the six orifice plates flow area 7 065 mm2 for three orifices and 3 14 mm2 for another three orifices used for degradation of reactive blue 13 slit venturi gave almost 47 decolorization whereas orifice plate having same α ratio of throat perimeter to cross section area and β ratio of throat area to pipe cross section area value gave only 31 decolorization mishra and gogate 27 also reported that venturi gave more intense cavitation than single hole orifice at similar level of operating pressure for degradation of rhodamine b at optimum pressure venturi cv 0 091 gave 26 degradation whereas orifice cv 0 099 gave 22 degradation after 120 min of treatment thus generally speaking venturi is more effective as compared to orifice although sometimes if large cavitation bubble clouds occur there may be inter bubble coalescence and recombination reactions among the generated radicals which reduces the cavitational yield in venturi in addition to orifice and venturi many other cavitating devices have been applied which are now discussed chakinala et al 40 used liquid whistle reactor as the hc configuration in combination with advanced fenton s process zero valent iron pieces and hydrogen peroxide for hc the mixing chamber consisted of an orifice and a blade two effluents used were complex mixture of substituted phenolic compounds and pink colored dyestuff solutions the orifice and the blade were kept at an adjustable distance from each other and at the end of mixing chamber valve was connected to influence the pressure liquid jet of high velocity was produced in the orifice this liquid jet directly had impact against the edge of the blade kept near the orifice thus the flowing liquid shed vortices which were perpendicular to the original flow occurring in between the orifice and the blade this created a steady oscillation due to which pressure fluctuations occurred on the cavitating bubbles generated at the orifice the blade created a situation which was equivalent to presence of two orifices in a single system giving beneficial results for extent of degradation for effluent 1 under optimized conditions around 60 of toc removal and 85 cod removal were observed after 150 min of treatment for effluent 2 70 toc and similar cod removals were reported after 150 min wang et al 41 performed a study regarding chemical effects of swirling jet cavitation for degradation of rhodamine b the effect of swirling jet was compared with that of ultrasound induced cavitation the swirling chamber was kept inside the combined chamber and was connected to sidewall of combined chamber by holders in the swirling chamber four rectangular tangential injection ports existed in the sidewall fig 1 water was first pumped into the combination chamber and then it entered the swirling chamber through the injection ports a swirling jet of water was generated when it passed through the swirling cavitation chamber at the center region where pressure became very low when the pressure fell below the liquid vapor pressure vapor bubbles cavities were generated after getting ejected from the swirling chamber the jet had an impact against the bottom surface of the combined chamber where due to high pressure stagnation region the vapor bubbles imploded and hotspots were generated using swirling jet cavitational yield obtained was 49 5 10 7 mg j whereas for 20 khz and 40 khz ultrasound reactor the yields were 2 78 10 7 mg j and 2 93 10 7 mg j respectively wang et al 42 performed another study on degradation of rhodamine b using swirling jet cavitation combined with hydrogen peroxide very high cavity volume and surface area was reported to be generated by this type of cavitation 61 2 degradation was observed using swirling jet and it increased to 98 9 when coupled with 100 mg l h2o2 wang et al 43 44 also performed degradation of reactive brilliant red k 2bp using swirling jet cavitation ultrasound cavitation and both in combination with hydrogen peroxide sonolysis and hydrogen peroxide assisted sonolysis gave 1 7 10 7 mg j and 5 25 10 7 mg j as the cavitational yield respectively whereas swirling jet and swirling jet combined with hydrogen peroxide gave much higher cavitational yield as 2 88 10 6 mg j and 1 56 10 5 mg j respectively mancuso et al 45 used a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor ecowirl as shown in fig 2 based on swirling jet cavitation for degradation of rhodamine b sodium hypochlorite naocl was also used for intensification comparative study between swirling jet cavitator and orifice plate was also presented the swirling jet reactor consisted of i one pre swirling chamber having frustum conical shape with six injection ports and ii one double cone chamber for holding the cavitation the radial vortex was divided into six single vortices by the injection ports upstream diameter as 10 mm downstream diameter as 8 mm a braided stream of helical shape was generated along the axis of the jet due to centrifugal force the pressure at the center region of the braided stream became low when the pressure fell below the vapor pressure of the liquid vapor bubbles cavities generated the pre swirling chamber accelerated the braided stream as well as shook the treatment solution the braided stream was ejected to the double cone chamber from the frustum conical shaped pre swirling chamber and impacted against the perpendicular structure where pressure rose and vapor bubbles collapsed it was reported that the helical vortex field produced more than 1000 pulses per second it was also reported that degradation was 8 6 for orifice whereas it reached to much higher 14 7 for swirling jet reactor it was attributed to lower downstream pressure 0 85 bar for swirling jet as compared to orifice plate 0 30 bar at similar operating pressure 2 0 bar thus higher pressure drop occurred in swirling jet reactor moreover under similar operating conditions swirling jet reactor gave 1 3 times more cavitational yield as compared to orifice plate 83 4 degradation was observed after 37 min when naocl 4 mg l was combined with swirling jet demonstrating intensification for the combination effect of geometry was also studied for the ecowirl reactor it was demonstrated that for double cone chamber extent of degradation decreased and pressure drop increased with increasing length of the cylinder in the middle of the double cone the increasing length increased the chance of bubble coalescence and decreased the intensity of bubble collapse in another depiction of combination approach wang et al 46 performed degradation of reactive brilliant red k 2bp using combination of swirling jet cavitation and fenton s reagent the dye was 14 and 5 degraded using swirling jet cavitation and ultrasound cavitation respectively after 60 min of treatment the degradation reached 91 and 79 respectively after 60 min when these two processes were combined with fenton s reagent again demonstrating benefits of combination another design reported for hydrodynamic cavitation is vortex diode 47 vortex diode also employs rotational swirling flows and the basic design constitutes a tangential port axial cylindrical port and chamber connecting the two ports vortex diode allows multiple flow configurations as forward and reverse 48 in the forward configuration flow enters through the axial port whereas in the reverse flow flow enters through the tangential port again the generation of cavitation occurs when the local pressure falls below the vapor pressure of the liquid medium at the given operating temperature cavities are transferred to the high pressure region where the collapse occurs releasing intense energy and creating cavitating conditions the performance of the vortex diode was compared with the orifice in terms of the cavitational yield it was reported that cavitation yields for the degradation of acetone mek and toluene used as model pollutants were 1 31 10 3 1 31 10 3 and 4 02 10 3 mg j respectively for orifice configuration whereas for the vortex diode the values were higher at 11 1 10 3 11 8 10 3 and 32 2 10 3 mg j respectively 47 in another study 49 the efficacy of vortex diode was reported for the fertilizer industry yielding very high reduction in the cod as well as ammoniacal nitrogen the following sections provide an overview of reported studies on cavitation assisted degradation of dyes with the understanding into effect of various parameters on the process performance table 1 also presents a summary of different works related to dye degradation using hc also elucidating the details of the cavitation devices and important obtained results 3 effects of operating and design parameters of hc 3 1 effect of design parameters for orifice based systems the design parameters used to study the performance are the ratio of total hole perimeter to total flow area α and the ratio of throat area to pipe cross section area β rajoriya et al 30 31 reported that keeping the flow area constant if the throat perimeter is increased then the frequency of turbulence increases cavities collapse more violently and generation of intense collapse pressure follows moreover when α is higher for a specific flow area more cavities are generated and thus higher cavitation yield is observed the decolorization rate of rb13 was observed to increase with an increase of α from 1 33 to 2 28 and slightly decreased thereafter when increased to 4 14 indicating the existence of an optimum value beyond which the negative effect of cavity clouds takes over 30 31 sivakumar and pandit 55 reported that when multiple circular hole orifices were used for degradation of rhodamine b the degradation rate increased from 2 67 10 5 to 5 33 10 5 sec 1 when α was increased from 0 8 to 4 they observed that the orifice plate having a large number of holes having a smaller diameter high value of α was more favorable as compared to the plate having a small number of larger holes for the same reason rectangular or elliptical shaped holes are preferred over circular holes having the same area the value of β is dependent on the cavitation number and volumetric flow rate in the system rajoriya et al 30 31 varied β from 0 011 to 0 025 and it was reported that plates with higher β value generated a greater number of cavities and resulted in a higher rate of decolorization on the other hand sivakumar and pandit 55 reported that the degradation rate of rhodamine b showed a decrease with increasing β value in the range of 0 022 to 0 139 it was explained as collapse pressure increases with a decreasing flow area of the liquid medium and cavitational yield being proportional to the magnitude of collapse pressure degradation rate decreases with increasing β value a similar result was observed by vichare et al 56 for the decomposition of ki cavitation number has been reported to be in the range of 0 15 0 29 for optimum degradation efficiencies 57 and the throat area should be chosen accordingly madhu et al 58 used 4 types of orifices 1 mm 5 holes 2 mm 1 hole 3 mm 1 hole 4 mm 1 hole for degradation of malachite green and methyl violet and it was observed that orifice with 2 mm hole diameter showed the minimum cavitation number for the orifice with 5 holes pressure drop reduced and thus cavitation intensity decreased moreover this orifice resulted in formation of quite a large number of bubbles which coalesced they observed that with increasing β cavitational intensity decreased for venturi based systems throat geometry throat size and divergence angles decide the cavitational intensity and yield it was reported by saharan et al 59 60 that degradation in slit venturi was10 higher than that in circular venturi for degradation of orange g the reason was illustrated as a higher ratio of throat perimeter to cross sectional area in slit venturi bashir et al 61 performed an optimization study based on cfd using venturi of different geometrical parameters circular and slit venturi they suggested that the ratio of perimeter to the cross sectional area of flow decides the number of cavities being generated in the venturi for slit venturi the maximum size of the cavity is also dependent on the ratio of throat length to its height the collapse rate for cavities is dependent on the angle of the divergence at a larger divergence angle the venturi behaves similar to an orifice and cavities collapse immediately without reaching maximum size as a conclusion they suggested that slit venturi with α 2 7 and slit height equal to its length 1 1 ratio with a half divergence angle of 5 5 may be considered as an optimum geometry for obtaining the best cavitational yield the length of the cavitational zone and the number of cavitational events were observed to be lower in the case of circular venturi as compared to the slit venturi li et al 99 reported that the intensities of cavitational effect first showed an increase and then decreased when the perimeter was increased for circular venturi for the specific case of degradation of rhodamine b thus at an optimum perimeter of the circular venturi the cavitation effect was observed to be the strongest square venturi gave more intense cavitation compared to circular venturis of the same throat area for square venturi of half divergence angles 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 degradation extents were 42 91 58 32 and 36 35 respectively after 150 min rajoriya et al 30 31 also reported the optimum half divergence angle to be 6 5 for degradation of reactive blue 13 half divergence angle between 5 5 to 6 5 has been typically observed to give the best cavitation efficiency 62 59 63 60 64 65 a general overview of various orifice venturi systems and their effect on dye degradation has been provided in fig 3 3 2 effect of operating parameters 3 2 1 effect of inlet pressure when inlet pressure increases the intensity of turbulence and energy dissipation rate increases as a result a greater number of bubbles are generated as well as bubble collapse intensity increases this leads to a higher generation of hydroxyl radicals which intensify the cavitation based reactions moreover with increasing pressure the volumetric flow rate of the liquid also increases thus the number of passes of the liquid through the reactor increases which elevates the residence time for cavitation but this phenomenon occurs until a certain number density of cavities is reached beyond a certain pressure the number density of bubbles becomes so much that coalescence of bubbles occurs resulting in incomplete or cushioned collapse and a decrease in the rate of degradation thus an optimum pressure is needed depending on cavitating device geometry and types of reactant molecules saharan et al 2 3 performed degradation of reactive red 120 dye in a venturi reactor along with h2o2 with varying pressure in the range of 3 10 bar the rate of degradation showed a rise with increasing pressure until the pressure value reached 5 bar beyond 5 bar excess generation of cavities occurred and the downstream area got entirely filled with cavities these cavities coalesced and formed a cavity cloud which is named choked cavitation after the onset of choked cavitation the rate of degradation decreased with a further increase in inlet pressure gore et al 25 also varied inlet pressure in the range of 3 8 bar and observed that extent and rate of decolorization increased with an increasing inlet pressure of the venturi and then decreased after a certain value 5 bar for degradation of reactive orange 4 dye rajoriya et al 30 31 varied pressure in the range of 3 11 bar for circular and slit venturi and observed optimum pressure to be at 5 bar for degradation of rhodamine 6 g mishra and gogate 27 varied pressure in the range of 2 9 5 8 atm for degradation of rhodamine b using orifice and venturi they observed that extent of degradation increased until the pressure reached 4 84 atm at 5 8 atm inlet pressure the extent of degradation dropped slightly due to the onset of super cavitation kumar et al 39 also studied the degradation of methylene blue in a venturi reactor along with h2o2 and photocatalysis they varied the inlet pressure in the range of 1 10 bar and observed that the rate of degradation increased until 5 bar rajoriya et al 66 also observed optimum pressure to be 5 bar when inlet pressure was varied in the range of 3 10 bar in a venturi for degradation of textile industry effluent there are many other studies on dye degradation that have reported optimum pressure between 4 and 5 bars 23 50 52 53 67 in all cases it was mentioned that beyond a certain pressure due to the appearance of cavity cloud the collapse activity was dampened which led to a downfall in the extent of treatment it is ideal to keep the pressure between 4 and 5 bars due to the tradeoff between degradation efficiency and cost of treatment 3 2 2 effect of temperature temperature is a crucial factor for the liquid vaporization process and reaction kinetics thus it is an important parameter that affects the rate of cavitation process and degradation yield vapor pressure of liquid increases with increasing temperature and thus the cavitation bubbles tend to have higher vapor content which leads to cushioning effects and bubbles collapses less violently 68 but the number of free radicals also increases with increasing temperature and so does the kinetic rate constants for oxidation or the radical reactions making the overall effect often unpredictable gogate and bhosale 23 observed that low temperature was favorable for enhancing the decolorization of acid orange ii and brilliant green rate constants decreased from 4 04 10 3 min 1 to 3 12 10 3 min 1 and 9 55 10 3 min 1 to 2 12 10 3 min 1 when the temperature was increased from 20 c to 40 c for acid orange ii and brilliant green respectively mishra and gogate 27 observed that when the temperature was increased from 30 to 40 c the extent of degradation increased for the degradation of rhodamine b they reported that with increasing operating temperature the number of bubbles generated increased marginally yi et al 69 varied temperature in the range of 15 c 35 c for degradation of rhodamine b they observed an increase in degradation with increasing temperature for the range of 15 25 c afterwards a decrease in oxidation rate was seen with a further increase in temperature li et al 99 varied the temperature in the range of 30 50 c for degradation of rhodamine b using hc along with fe3 doped tio2 they observed that the degradation ratio first increased and then decreased with an increase in temperature at 40 c demonstrated as optimum the highest degradation ratio was observed wang et al 42 performed the degradation of rhodamine b using swirling jet cavitation along with h2o2 where they varied the temperature in the range of 30 60 c they observed that the degradation ratio increased with an increase in temperature from 30 50 c but after that the degradation declined with further increase in temperature dhanke and wagh 70 and wang et al 43 44 also observed a similar weakening in degradation performance beyond 50 c while it is important that the result is higher degradation efficiency obtained at optimum temperature it is important to elucidate the cost at which it is being obtained room temperature operations do not require additional cooling or heating media and costs related to them are also avoided if room temperatures lie between 20 30 c additional heat exchange systems are generally not cost intensive while they are a requirement in winters or colder regions and can add up to 15 of total costs in 5 years of operation which need to be evaluated against the obtained benefits generally there is heating in the system due to a continuous operation and that can also be harnessed for a positive temperature effect without the requirement of external energy overall a cost to benefit analysis is indeed required to balance the expected benefits of higher treatment with the required energy costs 3 2 3 effect of ph several studies have suggested that acidic ph is more favorable for the degradation of dyes in hc reactors bhat and gogate 21 report that more than 90 of dye degradation studies with hydrodynamic cavitation have shown enhanced performance at acidic ph this phenomenon has been explained based on the pka values of dyes and that dyes are present in a molecular state at acidic ph at this molecular state the dye molecules exhibit hydrophobicity thus they tend to stay at the liquid gas interface where the hydroxyl radicals are present in much higher concentrations so as to facilitate direct attack and bring out the necessary changes on the other side if the medium is basic the dye molecules become ionized and hydrophilic thus they stay in the bulk of the liquid in the bulk fraction of the liquid the hydroxyl radicals participate in recombination reactions and very few of them remain available for the dyes for oxidation thus due to insufficient supply of hydroxyl radical the extent of degradation of dye molecules become lower saharan et al 2 3 reported that only 10 of the total hydroxyl radicals generated can diffuse in the bulk of the liquid the optimum ph value for the degradation of dye is dependent on the specific dye s dissociation constant pka saharan et al 2 3 varied the ph in the range of 2 11 for the degradation of reactive red 120 dye they obtained the maximum color and toc reduction at ph 2 kumar et al 39 performed decolorization of methylene blue using h2o2 and photocatalyst they observed that decolorization decreased from 32 32 to 3 896 when ph was increased from 2 to 10 wang et al 43 44 varied ph in the range of 2 10 for degradation of reactive brilliant red k 2bp using swirling jet cavitation along with h2o2 they observed that degradation reached 97 2 at ph 2 after 120 min whereas the degradation was 48 4 at ph 10 after a similar time of treatment in addition to the presence of hydroxyl radicals at interfaces in a higher amount they suggested another two reasons for higher degradation at acidic conditions 1 higher concentration of co3 2 and hco3 ions at higher ph which could act as free radical scavengers 2 higher h2o2 decomposition to form hydroxyl radicals in acidic medium gore et al 25 also varied solution ph in the range of 2 10 for studying the degradation of reactive orange 4 dye using hc combined with h2o2 and ozone they observed that maximum decolorization of 37 23 was obtained at ph value 2 after 120 min of treatment whereas at ph 10 only 4 6 decolorization was observed after similar treatment time mishra and gogate 27 performed the degradation of rhodamine b using hc h2o2 fenton s reagent and carbon tetrachloride they varied the medium ph in the range of 2 5 11 and observed that at ph 2 5 maximum degradation 59 3 occurred gogate and bhosale 23 also reported that for degradation of orange acid ii and brilliant green using hc in combination with other intensifying agents h2o2 na2s2o8 naocl maximum color removal was observed at ph 3 in their study experiments were conducted at five different ph values 2 3 4 7 8 and it was demonstrated that ph 2 and 3 only showed a marginal difference in the extent of degradation directing the selection of ph 3 as the optimum though most studies have reported acidic conditions are better some studies also report better degradation performance under alkaline conditions for example rajoriya et al 30 31 performed degradation of rhodamine 6 g using hc combined with h2o2 and ozone they varied the solution ph in the range of 2 12 and observed that decolorization rate was higher at basic medium than at acidic medium at 10 ph maximum decolorization was observed it happened because the rhodamine 6 g molecules became hydrophobic at basic conditions due to charge transfer occurring from amine nitrogen to aromatic rings it is thus essential that pilot scale studies be performed to confirm the effects of ph for the specific dye also it is important to weigh the benefits in degradation against the costs required for ph adjustment and also subsequent neutralization as the discharge of effluent is generally expected at neutral ph 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration initial concentration is attributed as another important parameter for dye degradation in most of the studies it has been reported that the extent of degradation decreases with increasing initial concentration the degradation ratio typically decreases due to higher loading of the substrate with a fixed number of hydroxyl radicals generated 57 the number of radicals generated is only dependent on the cavitating conditions and is independent of initial concentration thus the percentage of dye degraded with respect to the initial amount of dye may decrease but it is also important to understand that the total number of moles of dye degraded per unit volume per unit time increases and also the effect on rate constant for degradation needs to be looked at for determining the volume of the reactor and residence time we need to know the rate of degradation rather than the percentage of reduction saharan et al 59 60 observed that for degradation of orange g the rate of degradation increased with an increasing initial concentration of dye till an optimum value rajoriya et al 30 31 observed that extent of degradation of reactive blue 13 decreased from 47 to 19 with an increase in initial concentration from 30 ppm to 60 ppm dhanke and wagh 70 also observed that extent of degradation of acid red 18 was inversely proportional to its initial concentration at 15 20 25 and 30 ppm of initial concentration 75 2 72 1 60 1 and 50 4 degradation were obtained respectively after 180 min of treatment yi et al 69 observed that for the degradation of rhodamine b with an increase in initial concentration from 20 μmol l to 30 μmol l the degradation rate and extent of degradation increased but beyond 30 μmol l the degradation rate reduced marginally with a further increase in concentration li et al 99 also observed that the degradation ratio of rhodamine b first showed a rise and then showed a degreasing trend when initial concentration was increased keeping other parameters constant the optimum concentration of the dye was reported to be 10 mg l where 91 11 of degradation was observed cai et al 38 performed decolorization of orange g using hc along with the fenton process when they varied the concentration in the range of 10 mg l to 100 mg l it was observed that 10 mg l and 20 mg l initial concentration followed almost the same curve for decolorization but afterwards for 40 mg l 80 mg l and 100 mg l as the initial concentration the difference in decolorization extent was vivid and clear at 10 mg l initial concentration the decolorization extent was 90 4 whereas it fell to 47 3 for initial concentration value as 100 mg l moreover the decolorization rate was significantly higher at the beginning of the experiment owing to the fact that most of the h2o2 got converted into hydroxyl radicals within the first 20 min of reaction only wang et al 43 44 observed that the percentage degradation reduces from 99 to 28 by increasing the dye loading from 20 to 200 mg l it is thus important to understand that selecting optimum conditions for the initial concentration is must and this will strongly dependent on the rate of generation of hydroxyl radicals and its utilization rate also though it appears that higher extents of degradation are observed at lower concentrations dilution may not be an effective solution always as this will increase the total volume of the effluent to be treated making it imperative to decide on the tradeoff between the extents of treatment and volumes to be treated 3 3 effect of physicochemical properties of liquid among the physicochemical properties of the liquid cavitation is influenced by liquid vapor pressure viscosity and surface tension 3 3 1 effect of liquid vapor pressure vapor pressure is directly dependent on the temperature of the solution when vapor pressure is high vapor content in the cavity is also high thus cushioning effect occurs by continuous condensation of vapor and the intensity of bubble collapse decreases 71 but the number of cavities generated also shows a rise with increasing vapor pressure also the cavitation number falls when the vapor pressure of the liquid increases moreover the onset of a cavitation becomes easier if the liquid has very high vapor pressure these two opposing phenomena take place simultaneously and thus a threshold vapor pressure exists where cavitation effects are maximum gogate et al 72 reported that the resultant pressure pulse due to the collapse of a single cavity decreased when liquid vapor pressure was increased suslick et al 73 reported that the rate of iodine liberation due to the decomposition of ki weissler reaction decreased with increasing temperature i e increase in the vapor pressure of the liquid studies on bubble dynamics have shown that with an increase in temperature viscosity and surface tension decrease but vapor pressure shows a rise thus bubble collapse intensity decreases in general lower vapor pressure has been suggested for enhanced benefits thus the selection of proper liquid medium is necessary depending on the specific application if less intensity collapse is enough for the particular application say for example cell disruption or water treatment for disinfection higher vapor pressure liquid can be used otherwise lower vapor pressure of the liquid is desirable especially when higher intensities are required for example in the case of wastewater treatment 3 3 2 effect of viscosity threshold pressure of cavitation increases with increasing viscosity since a stronger natural cohesive force is needed to be overcome at higher viscosity thus lower viscosity of the liquid is desirable ivany and hammitt 74 observed that shear viscosity increased the liquid pressure at the wall of the bubbles during the collapse for incompressible liquids the bubble wall velocity showed a decline when viscosity was increased for compressible liquids when the bubble radius was small bubble wall velocity increased with increasing viscosity they also found out that after the collapse of a bubble the dissipated viscous energy in an incompressible liquid was almost 40 hp which was in support of the fact that significantly high local temperature is generated after the collapse they also observed that when the viscosity value was too small bubble collapse was significantly slowed down for both compressible and incompressible liquids whereas moderate viscosity values did not have a significant effect on the collapse rate gogate and pandit 75 reported that if the viscosity of liquid becomes high more pressure energy will be required to overcome the cohesive force and thus threshold pressure value will increase senthilkumar 71 reported that variation of bubble collapse conditions with increasing viscosity were almost insignificant for newtonian liquids gogate et al 72 carried out simulations for newtonian liquids with various viscosity values where it was observed that when viscosity increased the cavity collapse conditions did not change much in the viscosity range of 0 6 cp an increase in the viscosity value slightly increased the collapse pressure of bubbles but in that case a lower number of nuclei was subjected to cavitational condition thus the positive effect was nullified and the overall result was somewhere on the negative side but on the other side for non newtonian liquids having high viscosity the viscoelastic forces dampened the violent collapse of the cavity to a large extent overall it can be said that effect of viscosity will be marginal at lower values but at too high values there will reduced generation of cavitation events leading to lower intensification effects 3 3 3 effect of surface tension when the surface tension is more bubble contraction and collapse becomes more violent which increases the collapse temperature and pressure but surface tensional force opposes the creation and growth phase of the bubble thus due to surface tension cavitation inception becomes delayed also the size of gas or vapor nuclei is determined by surface tension when a cavity stays at stable equilibrium with its surrounding liquid medium surface tensional force becomes p σ 2 σ r where σ is the surface tension and r is the radius of the bubble also the vapor pressure of the nearby liquid changes due to the formation of nuclei of vapor bubbles according to kelvin s equation which is given as p v p s a t e x p 2 v l σ r t r where pv psat vl r t denote actual vapor pressure vapor pressure at saturation condition the molar volume of liquid universal gas constant and absolute temperature respectively due to the concave curvature of liquid with respect to vapor the actual vapor pressure of the liquid becomes less than the vapor pressure when the surface is flat thus for incipient cavitation the local pressure has to fall even below the vapor pressure of the liquid it is important to note that in the case of wastewater treatment applications water satisfies the required criteria for physicochemical properties and hence cavitation can be effectively generated in the reactor leading to beneficial results off course a primary treatment in terms of oil removal may be required in case there is a large quantum of oil present in the effluent in the case of fiber materials present in the wastewater primary treatment methods like sedimentation and decantation are used it can thus said that proper pretreatment will be useful in tailoring the conditions for effective treatment 4 combination approaches for wastewater treatment intensification in the treatment of dyes can be achieved by combining hc with strong oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide ozone carbon tetrachloride sodium persulfate fenton s reagent and photocatalysts due to the synergistic generation of additional free radicals the extent of degradation and mineralization is expected to increase 76 the degree of intensification and required oxidant loading are dependent on the properties of the molecule being degraded performing optimization studies are important to maximize the yield as outlined in this section for different combination approaches and making the study feasible at a commercial scale application for combination based approaches the degree of intensification is expressed as a synergetic index which is based on an improvement in the kinetic rate constant obtained for the combination over the sum of the rate constants for the processes performed individually the obtained synergitic index for different combinations is typically dependent on the specific pollutant or the composition of effluent and need to be established using studies as outlined now 4 1 degradation using hc h2o2 hydrogen peroxide acts as an additional source for hydroxyl radicals in the cavitational hotspot region and it is well established that hydrogen peroxide intensifies degradation in combination with cavitation 53 it is also important to note that beyond a certain loading of h2o2 it may act as a radical scavenger 77 where due to recombination reactions degradation efficiency is reduced thus an optimum loading of h2o2 is required to obtain the desired extent of degradation the reactions taking place for the generation of radicals are as follows 78 h 2 o 2 2 o h o h h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o o h h o 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o o h d y e o h c o 2 h 2 o i n t e r m e d i a t e s wang et al 42 performed the degradation of rhodamine b using swirling jet cavitation combined with h2o2 the study used terephthalic acid dianion ta to determine the relative amount of hydroxyl radicals produced ta reacts with hydroxyl radicals to form hydroxyterephthalate hta which is stable and fluorescent a much stronger fluorescence spectrum was observed when hc was combined with h2o2 this indicated a remarkable enhancement in the generation of hydroxyl radicals and a synergetic effect between hc and h2o2 for degradation of rhodamine b an overview of various reports dealing with combination of hc and hydrogen peroxide can be found in table 2 4 2 degradation using hc o3 ozone has been recognized as a highly effective oxidant oxidation potential of 2 08 v as it dissociates into molecular oxygen o2 and nascent oxygen o this nascent oxygen reacts with water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals the reactions taking place in ozonation in the presence of energy dissipation are as follows 78 o 3 o 2 o h 2 o h o h o h 2 o 2 o h d y e o h c o 2 h 2 o i n t e r m e d i a t e s an overview of use of ozone as an additional oxidant in hydrodynamic cavitation process can be found in table 2 gore et al 25 performed the degradation of reactive orange 4 dye using hc combined with ozone they reported that ozonation of organic molecules can happen in two ways 1 at basic ph ozone molecules dissociate to give nascent oxygen and generate hydroxyl radicals in reaction with water molecules and those radicals participate in oxidation reactions 2 at acidic ph ozone molecules directly attack the pollutant molecules as an electrophile few drawbacks were also pointed out when ozone is individually applied for degradation e g high energy required for ozone generation sensitivity towards ph and high selectivity towards organic molecules but these drawbacks could be overcome if ozonation is done in combination with other processes hc h2o2 ultrasound uv rajoriya et al 66 performed the treatment of textile dyeing industry effluent using hc combined with ozone they varied the ozone feed rate from 1 g h to 5 g h and reported that maximum toc and cod reduction was seen at the ozone flow rate of 3 g h at this optimum loading 48 toc reduction and 22 72 cod reduction were observed after 120 min whereas only hc gave 17 toc reduction and 12 cod reduction after a similar time another important aspect of the study was that lower efficacy with 41 toc reduction and 12 cod reduction was seen if ozone was injected in the solution tank instead of the throat of venturi the reason for this higher conversion at the addition at throat of venturi was explained as 1 at venturi throat as ozone molecules were directly in the cavitating conditions a higher number of radicals was produced 2 high turbulence in the reactor core helped in higher dispersion of ozone molecules 3 higher contact time between ozone and dye molecules happened in between the venturi and storage tank the synergetic coefficient obtained in the combined hc ozonation process was 1 42 under the best conditions 4 3 degradation using hc fenton s reagent fenton s reagent contains ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide it intensifies the degradation process by regeneration of ferrous ions which enhance the generation of hydroxyl radicals in most of the research works it has been observed that an optimum ratio of ferrous sulfate to hydrogen peroxide exists excessive addition of ferrous sulfate may lead to high tds generation as well as an increment in cod 38 use of fenton s reagent alone suffers from two major disadvantages 1 need to control ph in the range 2 4 2 requirement of sludge disposal the use of fenton s reagent in various combined treatment processes can eliminate some of the drawbacks and also drive high efficiency in oxidizing recalcitrant dye molecules based on the chain of radical reactions illustrated below that ensures regeneration of oxidizing species and fe2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o

industry effluent using hc along with other aops it was observed that only h2o2 was not enough for the mineralization of the dye molecules because of their highly complex nature use of fenton s reagent helped in overcoming the scavenging nature of h2o2 study performed at fixed 5 ml of h2o2 per liter of dye solution and varying feso4 7h2o h2o2 ratio as 1 1 1 2 1 5 and 1 10 established that at optimum ratio of 1 5 48 toc reduction occurred within only 15 min almost complete decolorization 97 7 was observed after 60 min and 38 cod was removed after 120 min at optimum loading to determine the synergetic effect the experiment of mineralization was also carried out using fenton s reagent alone where it was observed that at an optimum ratio of 1 5 only 10 9 toc reduction occurred the synergetic coefficient was obtained as 2 48 the combination approach gave higher toc cod and color removal in comparison with hc o3 and hc o2 badmus et al 81 mentioned that the application of only iron ii sulfate could help in getting rid of environmental hazards related to h2o2 but several drawbacks of this process were also mentioned e g excessive generation of iron sludge the existence of elemental iron in the effluent and formation of a wide range of complex materials they also studied the effect of combined hydrogen peroxide iron sulfate h2o2 fe2 and hydrogen peroxide green nano zero valent iron h2o2 nfe on decolorization efficiency they processed 1 mg l h2o2 with 1 mg l iron ii sulfate fenton s reagent and 1 mg l nano zero valent iron advanced fenton s reagent separately in jet loop hc the fenton s reagent gave 97 1 and 54 0 decolorization respectively with and without hc similarly advanced fenton s reagent gave 98 6 and 78 4 decolorization respectively with and without hc the reason for enhanced decolorization efficiency for advanced fenton s process was explained as zero valent iron can accommodate three units of electrons whereas iron with oxidation state 2 can only accommodate one unit of an electron the toc reduction obtained was 40 6 6 2 17 5 65 7 and 74 3 respectively using only hc only fenton only advanced fenton hc fenton and hc advanced fenton respectively clearly demonstrating the efficacy of hc advanced fenton approach cai et al 38 performed experiments by locating fe in two different positions in the tank and 35 cm away from the orifice plate it was observed that fe located 35 cm away could easily access the cavitation bubbles thus the generation of hydroxyl radicals was higher it can be thus said that an optimum ratio of fenton s reagent is important and also use of advanced fenton process based on elemental iron seems to be a better option as compared to feso4 attributed to lower sludge generation 4 4 degradation using hc photocatalysis the heterogeneous photocatalysis process has been widely applied method for the degradation of dyes it involves a semiconductor photocatalyst tio2 or zno which absorbs photons of energy greater than or equal to the band gap of the material the excited electrons after absorbing the energy move to the conduction band from the valence band and leave holes behind these electron hole pairs participate in redox reactions with water hydroxide ion or oxygen to generate hydroxyl radicals the photocatalyst remains unchanged in the process and no consumable chemical is needed or sludge requiring disposal is generated 83 to optimize the portion of solar spectrum the catalyst absorbs tio2 has been doped with transition metal ions v cr mn fe ni as well as ag au ru which alter the band gap and shift the tio2 absorption band from uv region into the visible region s e m i c o n d u c t o r m e t a l o x i d e m o h v m o h e h h 2 o h o h 2 h 2 h 2 o 2 h h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 2 o h e o 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o h h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 2 o h d y e o h c o 2 h 2 o i n t e r m e d i a t e s the combination of photocatalysis with hc is successful as the turbulence generated is able to overcome the mass transfer resistances associated with photocatalysis the catalyst particles may provide additional nuclei for cavitational bubble growth but the excessive presence of them may hinder the bubble growth stage also effective irradiation of penetrating light may be hindered and interaction between photocatalyst and light may decrease when loading value crosses an optimum value thus after a certain catalyst loading value extent of removal will not show any rise 51 or even reduce depending on the system in addition to the catalyst loading the extent of doping is also an important parameter to look at bethi et al 82 mentioned that excess loading of dopant may lead to recombination reactions between electron and holes which reduces the decolorization extent in general use of combined approach of hc with photocatalysis will show higher effects as compared to the individual approaches though the results for improved performance will always depend on the specific pollutant see data in table 2 4 5 degradation using hc and other advanced oxidants several other combination approaches have been reported by researchers over years mishra and gogate 27 performed the degradation of rhodamine b using hc combined with ccl4 the mechanism of degradation was based on the generation of chlorine free radicals due to the degradation of chloroalkanes the loading of ccl4 applied was 1 g l with a 10 ppm initial concentration of dye the decolorization and toc reduction obtained were 82 and 34 respectively after 120 min of treatment whereas only hc gave 59 3 decolorization and 30 toc reduction after a similar amount of time but it was also shown that ccl4 was not as efficient as h2o2 or fenton s reagent for degradation the possible reason was that the existing cavitating conditions could not dissociate ccl4 enough to generate an equivalent amount of free radicals as it generated in the case of h2o2 or fenton s reagent bethi et al 52 performed the degradation of crystal violet dye using hc and poly acrylic acid bentonite nano composite hydro gel it was observed that 66 75 and 77 dye removal and 59 66 and 66 toc removal occurred when the clay content in the hydro gel was 0 g 0 5 g and 1 g respectively it was thus observed that decolorization only increased significantly upto clay content of 0 5 g the attributed reason was that at high clay loading water intake by the gel was hindered and thus lower swelling of hydro gel occurs moreover excessive clay may form agglomerates within the hydrogel matrix thus active sites for water penetration decreases when the hydro gel loading was varied as 10 20 30 and 40 g for 500 mg l dye stock solution 63 75 80 and 80 decolorization of dye was observed at these loading values respectively the synergetic index for toc removal was obtained to be 1 20 at optimum hydro gel loading under best condition of ph 2 3 96 color removal and 70 toc removal was observed in the hybrid process after 90 min of the operation time whereas only hc gave 20 decolorization and 17 toc reduction gogate and bhosale 23 investigated degradation of orange acid ii and brilliant green using oxidizing agents as h2o2 na2s2o8 and naocl along with hc for orange acid ii when h2o2 loading increased from 95 2 mg l to 571 2 mg l degradation increased from 60 to 96 and the increase was steady without any downfall for brilliant green however when h2o2 loading increased from 95 2 mg l to 244 8 mg l degradation increased from 77 to 86 and after that the extent of degradation decreased for degradation of orange acid ii using na2s2o8 the extent of degradation was 94 at 44 52 mg l loading and almost 100 at 535 72 mg l loading for brilliant green the extent of degradation increased marginally at lower oxidant loading and an insignificant effect was observed at higher oxidant loading using naocl for orange acid ii 100 decolorization was observed within 20 min using oxidant loading of 1250 59 mg l degradation of brilliant green using naocl was not performed it was reported that brilliant green was easier to oxidize and even with a minute amount of oxidant very quick decolorization occurred thus detailed investigation on the loading of oxidant was not performed further for orange acid ii h2o2 na2s2o8 and naocl gave cavitational yield 9 71 10 6 1 10 5 and 8 08 10 5 mg j respectively when combined with hc for brilliant green 8 75 10 6 and 9 67 10 6 mg j cavitational yield were obtained using h2o2 and na2s2o8 combined with hc baradaran and sadeghi 53 performed the degradation of coomassie brilliant blue using a combination of hc h2o2 and activated persulfate kps optimum h2o2 and kps loading were obtained to be 676 1 mg l and 541 1 mg l at 7 1 bar more than 92 decolorization was obtained at this optimum condition although the working mechanism of two different oxidants seems to be independent of each other apparently it was suggested that inter conversion among radicals may take place and multi step and un selective reaction pathways of radicals and their scavenging effects occur thus increase in oxidant loading beyond a certain concentration may prevent radicals formation and diminish the decolorization reaction rate considerably in the decolorization process the synergetic coefficient was 2 11 whereas for the mineralization process it was 1 16 73 2 mineralization was obtained after 60 min for combination whereas hc h2o2 and kps gave 27 1 30 2 and 4 1 mineralization individually after 60 min of treatment time mancuso et al 45 performed decolorization of rhodamine b using swirling jet cavitation along with naocl at initial dye concentration 3 mg l the concentration of naocl was varied in the range of 0 5 4 0 mg l the extent of decolorization was observed to be increasing with increasing naocl concentration at 4 mg l oxidant loading a maximum 94 decolorization was observed after 169 min of treatment at minimum loading 0 5 mg l 31 decolorization was observed after 169 min whereas degradation was less than 20 using only swirling jet cavitation moreover 83 4 decolorization was observed within only 37 min using a combination of swirling jet induced cavitation and naocl 4 0 mg l clearly highlighting the beneficial effects of the combination approach jung et al 84 performed decolorization of acid orange 7 using an orifice plate which was kept under electric field they varied the applied voltage within the range of 5 v to 100 v and allowed a 40 min reaction time the dye and nacl concentration were kept fixed at 10 mg l and 2 5 g l they observed that the extent of decolorization increased with increasing voltage at 60 v 100 decolorization was observed although 50 v and 60 v gave an almost similar extent of degradation only 0 3 less in the case of 50 v 1 5 times more electrical energy was needed for operation at 60 v thus 50 v was chosen as the optimum where 95 39 decolorization was reported after 22 5 min of treatment and almost 100 after 40 min the inlet pressure and ph values were kept at 3 5 kgf cm2 and 2 they optimized the operational conditions statistically using response surface methodology rsm with box behnken design bbd according to this model at optimum conditions of inlet pressure as 3 9 kgf cm2 ph of 3 and applied voltage of 37 7 v complete decolorization could occur after 40 min which was also verified experimentally 5 cost estimation and analysis trade offs between degradation efficiency and costs have always been mentioned but not been quantitatively studied regularly 21 85 86 cost estimation by mahamuni and adewuyi 86 for us reactor scale up in the application of dye degradation has been shown in table 4 for an overview of cost estimation in this paper the authors have considered a venturi device for capital costs and trade off analysis a venturi device is generally considered more expensive than fabricating an orifice plate and several studies have shown a better degradation performance for a venturi because of a gradient constriction as opposed to a sudden construction in an orifice 27 59 60 for the current study a parameterized model was developed to relate the performance of a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor to operating costs the first order degradation rate constants for only hydrodynamic cavitation were obtained for rhodamine b degradation 27 41 42 the variables in the process used were time of treatment inlet pressure and reactor volume the flow rate depends on the pressure and obtained for a specific type of venturi 27 this study takes into consideration the pressure value based on most reports where the degradation percentage or the rate of degradation is optimum at 4 5 bar pressure the results for the parameterized model are summarized in fig 4 there is a direct relationship between the cost of treatment to inlet pressure and time of treatment fig 4a higher pressure and higher time lead to higher costs while the cost is slightly more sensitive to time as compared to pressure the slope of the gradient there s an inverse relation between the volume of the reactor and costs fig 4b a higher volume of the reactor was reciprocated with a lower number of passes fig 4c higher volume leads to a decrease in the cost per unit volume processed it is recommended to increase the volume of the reactor such that the number of passes remains the same by adjusting the time and flow rate it is very clear that the number of passes pressure and time increase costs while reactor volume might decrease normalized costs the degradation percentage depends on the rate constants obtained from the literature and peaks at an optimum pressure of 5 in this case fig 4d this can also be extrapolated to studies where optimum pressure is between 4 and 6 bars the section that is ideal for scale up is marked in blue and has a blank dashed boundary fig 4d this section is further reproduced in the subsequent figures to help identify the ideal degradation percentage with the same conditions costs show a different trend not following the degradation percentages fig 4e when it comes to cost the ideal section for scale up lies in the upper left corner while the ideal degradation lies in the mid right range this trade off needs to be addressed when optimizing the process for a scale up this can be addressed by the use of costs that are normalized to both volume and a decrease in concentration fig 4f such a cod concentration normalized cost has been well reported in such a normalization both the sections mentioned earlier lie in the blue region which is the ideal region the lowest cost lies in the mid range and this section can now be considered for scale up while this analysis can be used for other studies it might not necessarily reflect trends that are similar to other studies the authors suggest that such a trade off analysis might be necessary for deciding on the application of hc in real wastewater treatment processes and can form the basis for scale up and pilot plant studies a detailed scale up costing analysis was performed table 3 and appendix a with the designs of venturi used for analysis given in fig 5 and fig 6 the total annual operating cost has been obtained to be 39 74 thousand gallons of water treated which is much lower than the cost estimated by mahamuni and adewuyi 86 for scaling up of ultrasound acoustic cavitation shown in table 3 in conventional biological treatment processes capital cost is around 2 m and operating cost varies in the range of 5 to 10 per 1000 gallons of water treated most reports on dye degradation study the degradation in synthetic lab scale samples the costing analysis takes into consideration the need of higher load of additional oxidants for real wastewater with higher and more complex contaminant loading based on previously published studies on real wastewater treatment 87 88 this is consistent with data from cost analysis on an individual lab scale basis reported in literature 89 the chemical costs taken into consideration are based on maximum load of oxidants required in real systems where hc can be applied as a tertiary treatment this load may be lesser which will decrease the overall cost of treatment chemical costs contribute to a major part of overall costs approximately 41 in a commercially applied system fig 7 and this percentage can be lesser based on the real water matrix and the stage of application it is very important to take the effect of oxidants into consideration for cost analysis due to a high contribution of chemical costs to overall costs a comparison of energy required per unit order and corresponding cost required per unit order has been compiled for several published papers reporting the pressures and flow rates table 5 the recently published report on the degradation of brilliant blue using a venturi device stands out with the lowest cost per order and this can be attributed to the 99 degradation observed in the study 90 most reports on only hc systems report between 20 50 degradation of several dyes cako et al 90 also reports the 99 degradation with only 1 7 bar of input pressure which is significantly lower than the pressure average of 3 5 5 5 observed in other published reports in comparison between a venturi an orifice and swirling jet cavitating device both venturi and swirling jet have consistently yielded lower cost per order than an orifice table 5 the cost per order of degradation with venturi device for rhodamine b degradation is the lowest at 0 01 0 04 l 1 while orifice can go up to 0 06 l 1 even though the number of reports on swirling jet device or vortex diode are comparative less 91 94 as compared to venturi devices they can be promising with respect to their cost per order 0 03 0 04 l 1 though it also depends on the specific system investigated for the study all recently reported studies 2018 2020 have demonstrated a low cost per order 0 01 0 02 l 1 due to a comparatively higher degradation percentages reported based on the studies on the three devices the use of venturi is demonstrated to be the most cost efficient including the degradation efficacy and scale up prospects closely followed by the swirling jet device or the vortex diode it is also seen based on the comparison of costs of treatments for different processes that the combination approaches involving hc generally require lower costs as compared to approaches involving ultrasound table 6 as reported by thanekar and gogate 76 6 conclusions this review article highlights the significance of hc in dye treatment despite having higher treatment costs than conventional existing methods such as biological oxidation it has the potential to find usage in large scale applications due to its simple reactor design zero sludge production high energy efficiency and less supervision required also hc has shown higher scalability energy efficiency and cavitational yield compared to ac among hc devices orifice and venturi has been widely used by researchers for the degradation of dyes in most of the studies slit venturi has provided the maximum cavitational yield compared to circular venturi or single hole orifice the other types of hc devices as rotational cavitating devices such as vortex diode are yet to find extensive use in dye degradation effect of different design parameters of rotational cavitating devices and their comparison with venturi and orifice in terms of cavitational yield or scalability is yet to be performed in most of the studies optimum pressure has been observed to be around 5 bar temperature is kept around 30 35 c to diminish the additional cost for heating circulating cooling water is needed on large scale to prevent temperature rise in the reactor especially at higher power dissipation significant temperature rise may alter the vapor pressure also and thus the cavitation number ph value of 2 3 ha s shown maximum efficiency in lab scale but in large scale applications the obtained benefits from low ph should be weighed against the operating cost since very low ph could require a significant amount of hcl for adjustment as well alkali in subsequent neutralization before discharge higher α value has been recommended in most of the studies for higher cavitational intensity whereas β value should be optimized depending on the particular application the optimum half divergence angle for the case of venturi has been observed to be in between 5 5 to 6 5 the use of additional chemicals and oxidants is the major cost contributor to cavitation based processes the trade off between use of chemicals for intensified degradation is always seen with respect to cost of treatment cost trade offs are an important consideration while scaling up the process a venturi device is the most efficient as compared to other cavitation device types with respect to cost per order from the cost analysis performed for degradation of reactive red 120 on an industrial scale hc has proven to have greater cost efficiency compared to ac coupled with ease of scale up declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgement authors would

13433,greener technologies with high efficiency and cost effectiveness are highly in need to degrade and mineralize the recalcitrant contaminants in water hydrodynamic cavitation hc which is generated by pressure and velocity variation in the system has gained attention in wastewater treatment due to its scalability high energy efficiency minimized toxic solvent usage and simpler reactor design despite having multiple advantages over conventional biological oxidation industrial scale usage of hc has not gained enough popularity due to its relatively higher cost than existing processes this review paper focuses on the application of hydrodynamic cavitation in dye treatment and provides an overview of studies on dye degradation using hydrodynamic cavitation alone or in combination with other oxidation processes the effects of different operational geometric and physicochemical properties of solutions on the process performance have been analyzed and optimum values of different parameters for the treatment of different dyes have been mentioned different combinative approaches hc ozone hc fenton s reagent hc photocatalysis hc hydrogen peroxide have also been discussed and comparative studies among them have been performed future directions have been addressed to carefully control the drawbacks associated with the processes detailed cost estimation and trade off analysis for mineralization of dyes using hc at industrial scale operation has been performed and feasibility of performing hc in large scale has been confirmed where data reaction rate constant cavitation number optimum pressure available from lab scale analysis are taken as basis for scaling up overall hydrodynamic cavitation offers promise for industrial application especially compared to the more traditionally applied ultrasound based treatments keywords hydrodynamic cavitation dye degradation advanced oxidation cost estimation combination approaches 1 introduction the effluents from textile industries contain a large variety of synthetic dyes because up to 20 of total dyes produced is lost in the effluents during the different stages of processing 1 amongst the dyes used in the textile paper or leather industry between 50 70 are azo dyes 2 3 synthetic dyes can have significant impact on the environment and pose a health risk due to their stability toxicity and hazardous properties the synthetic nitrogen containing dyes especially azo dyes can be toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic and their complete removal is of utmost importance in wastewater treatment processes 4 dye degradation can be employed using conventional biological oxidation 5 6 but the drawbacks of biological processes include long treatment times formation of sludge incomplete degradation and formation of microbe inhibiting byproducts 7 for example cripps et al 8 reported that phanerochaete chrysosporium was capable of degrading orange ii tropaeofin o congo red azure b though almost 5 days were required to reach 63 93 decolorization depending on the dye chao and lee 9 reported that 3 days were required for degrading 90 of orange g using phanerochaete chrysosporium capalash and sharma 10 also used p chrysosporium for studying degradation efficiency of 18 azo dyes but only eight could be degraded that too with 40 70 as the decoloration efficacy other technologies currently used to treat dye containing effluents are membrane separation 11 adsorption 12 coagulation based processes 13 and irradiations 14 drawbacks of membrane based technologies include high equipment and regeneration costs caking fouling and temperature limitation sometimes secondary effluent is generated which needs additional treatment significant amount of sludge is produced in electrokinetic coagulation 15 and it also shows poor degradation efficacy with acid dyes coupled with higher cost of treatment based on high cost of applied chemicals as ferrous sulfate ferric chloride etc 16 electrochemical destruction is also effective in degrading dyes 17 but again high cost of electricity makes it economically not feasible silica gel although effective in basic dye removal drives different side reactions e g air binding which prevent commercial application 15 irradiation process is only effective in lab scale and also needs a very high amount of dissolved oxygen 16 considering the associated problems with most of the applied processes it can be said that advanced oxidation processes aops in general offers promise for treatment of wastewater containing dyes multiple reports have indeed been published on effective removal of dyes using aops like ozonation uv fenton oxidation photocatalysis and cavitation 18 19 these processes involve the generation and attack of highly reactive and oxidizing radicals by individual or combined processes to degrade organic pollutants aops are highly effective in mineralization but require chemicals that can be expensive relative to biological process costs 20 hydrodynamic cavitation hc is an efficient oxidation technique that has been reported for over a decade individually or in combination with other aops for degradation of a wide range of organic pollutants in wastewater 21 cavitation involves the formation growth and implosion of microbubble cavities depending on the spatial pressure variation in the liquid the physical and chemical transformations of the pollutants occur in the hotspot region after collapse of microbubbles leading to intense localized temperatures and pressures the physical effects include microjet streaming and high local turbulence importantly the chemical effects including generation of free radicals are more controlling for degradation of pollutants in hc pressure variation is created using flow variation in constriction or by using swirling jet or vortex diode employing vortex flow stator rotor type cavitational reactors have also gained attention in recent studies hc offers promising application due to the ease of operation lower material and chemical costs and possibility of continuous large scale operation another form of cavitation is ultrasound acoustic cavitation ac where cavitation is generated by passing ultrasound wave 20 khz through the medium periodic compression and rarefaction cycles are generated due to the passage of ultrasound in rarefaction cycle cavities are formed by increasing intermolecular distance and in following compression cycle cavities are compressed and collapsed both of the cavitation processes lead to generation of hotspots where local temperature reaches 1000 10 000 k and pressure goes upto 100 1000 bar 22 gogate and bhosale 23 observed that cavitational yield was higher for hc as compared to ac where both were applied for degradation of orange acid ii oa ii and brilliant green bg they also reported that synergistic effect was more when chemical oxidants were used along with hc rather than ac saharan et al 2 3 have also reported that cavitational yield in hc was 13 times higher than that of ac for degradation of acid red 88 dye benito et al 24 showed that time scales for bubble growth and collapse are smaller for ac than hc cavitation has indeed been reported in several studies including coupled processes with other aops such as photocatalysis ozonation fenton s reagent and carbon tetrachloride to bring out better degree of mineralization 25 30 2 31 3 32 there have been multiple reviews published on textile wastewater treatment and dye degradation using aops these reports explain the mechanisms and the effect of several process parameters in detail with respect to the chemistry of treatment the complexity of the textile wastewater matrix with the presence of various dyes including other persistent and semi volatile organic compounds makes the treatment methodology complex since hydrodynamic cavitation with aops can non selectively attack all the pollutants in the matrix it can be employed as a tertiary process in wastewater treatment systems in the case of real wastewater containing high strength of radical scavengers such as carbonate or bicarbonate ions a pretreatment strategy say in terms of ph adjustment will be useful another concern for the real wastewater is presence of salts but this would help the efficacy of hydrodynamic cavitation based on the salting effects that lead to presence of pollutants at favorable positions in the collapsing cavities giving higher extents of degradation analysis of literature revealed that the major drawback of using cavitation for wastewater treatment is the lack of detailed costing reports and a compiled evidence of effectiveness across different dyes a study of cost estimation of hydrodynamic cavitation is thus necessary for critical examination of its application similarly the literature analysis revealed that there have been several reports on the use of cavitation for water and wastewater treatment these reviews on cavitation report a variety of group of compounds ranging from conventional organic to emerging contaminants 33 while some of the reviews discuss cavitation based treatment of dyes in short detailed effect of various parameters and cost estimation information specifically for dyes is missing in literature to the best of our knowledge no review on cavitation discusses treatment of dyes and the cost estimation of the process along with discussing the trade offs observed in costs that need to be studied and understood while scaling up this process the techno economic analysis is very important for the design engineers to make a proper selection of the wastewater treatment strategy including the operating parameters for example makuzi et al 34 presented such analysis based on the processes such as ultraviolet irradiations chlorination and membrane separations considered as individual and combined treatment approaches applied for the sewage treatment literature analysis revealed that such approach has been lacking for hydrodynamic cavitation as the treatment strategy and dyes as the pollutant being considered thereby reflecting the importance of the current review in addition critical examination on scaling up potential has gained attention for making cavitation industrially feasible on an industrial scale due to the dissipation of large power over a large volume control on temperature pressure residence time and liquid properties become very important to ensure optimum results from the chemical reactions parameters that need careful consideration during scaling up are the choice of number size of venturi orifice divergence angle ratio of throat to pipe diameter temperature and pressure intrinsic physio chemical properties of the medium presence of solid particles dissolved gases in liquid energy loss due to convection radiation throughout residence time and erosion on reactor pipe surfaces 35 uniform distribution of cavitational activity is important in the reactor to avoid skewing of scale up procedure in the current study we have analyzed in detail the reports till date on dye degradation as to best of our knowledge a review on dye degradation for only hydrodynamic cavitation based processes has never been reported in the context of operational strategies cost estimation and trade off analysis in this review paper we have presented an estimation of overall capital cost and yearly operation and maintenance cost for mineralization of reactive red 120 dye using hc venturi based system guidelines for the selection of proper combination based methods have also been presented to optimize the total cost thereby establishing overall importance of the work 2 fundamentals of hydrodynamic cavitation and applications for dye degradation hydrodynamic cavitation is based on the formation of cavities when the local pressure inside the cavitating device falls below the vapor pressure of the liquid medium this is employed by the use of an orifice or venturi tube swirling jet vortex diode or stator rotor type devices orifice venturi type devices are most common due to their simpler geometry in these devices high pressure flow on the sudden constriction leads to pressure variations further the pressure is recovered downstream as the flow area increases leading to the subsequent collapse of the cavities additionally a significant loss of energy as a permanent pressure drop downstream of constriction yields high intensity fluid turbulence hotspots are generated due to intense localized temperatures and pressures where the generation of free radicals brings out chemical effects that are harnessed for contaminant degradation 19 36 37 the intensity of cavitation in a cavitating chamber is expressed as dimensionless cavitation number 2 3 c v p 2 p v 1 2 ƍ v 0 2 where p2 denotes the recovered downstream discharge pressure pv ƍ and v0 are the vapor pressure the density of the liquid and the velocity at the throat respectively generally the inception of cavitation occurs at cv 1 and the effect becomes significant at cv values less than 1 typically 0 1 to 0 4 in few cases inception cv may be greater than 1 when solids and dissolved gases are present in the liquid providing additional nuclei for the generation of cavities orifice and venturi based cavitation devices have been widely used as they are considered to be optimum in terms of the trade off between cavitation intensity and cost effectiveness cavitation in venturi is mostly regarded as stable whereas cavitation in the orifice is transient in stable cavitation lower amplitude oscillations of bubbles occur above their equilibrium size whereas in transient cavitation the size of cavities increases many folds of their initial size and cavity oscillates more intensely and collapses more violently cavitational yields vary with variation in geometrical parameters such as device perimeter throat area divergence angle pipe area and operational parameters such as temperature pressure ph initial concentration and initial nuclei radius thus these parameters are needed to be adequately selected while designing and running the cavitational reactor orifices and venturis have also been used widely for the degradation of dyes 2 25 27 38 39 3 the orifice can be of single or multiple holes with varying flow area to have control over the intensity of cavitation similarly venturis are available in different shapes e g slit circular elliptical in venturi pressure recovery is gradual due to small divergent angle and cavities get enough time to attain their maximum size before collapsing but for orifice plate the pressure recovery is sudden and cavities don t get enough time to reach their maximum size and transfer energy efficiently thus energy transfer efficacy of cavity collapse and cavitational yield is more for venturi due to higher active cavitational volume higher reduction in color and toc is generally observed in venturi for example rajoriya et al 30 31 observed that higher decolorization efficiency was obtained using slit venturi flow area 3 14 mm2 as compared to all the six orifice plates flow area 7 065 mm2 for three orifices and 3 14 mm2 for another three orifices used for degradation of reactive blue 13 slit venturi gave almost 47 decolorization whereas orifice plate having same α ratio of throat perimeter to cross section area and β ratio of throat area to pipe cross section area value gave only 31 decolorization mishra and gogate 27 also reported that venturi gave more intense cavitation than single hole orifice at similar level of operating pressure for degradation of rhodamine b at optimum pressure venturi cv 0 091 gave 26 degradation whereas orifice cv 0 099 gave 22 degradation after 120 min of treatment thus generally speaking venturi is more effective as compared to orifice although sometimes if large cavitation bubble clouds occur there may be inter bubble coalescence and recombination reactions among the generated radicals which reduces the cavitational yield in venturi in addition to orifice and venturi many other cavitating devices have been applied which are now discussed chakinala et al 40 used liquid whistle reactor as the hc configuration in combination with advanced fenton s process zero valent iron pieces and hydrogen peroxide for hc the mixing chamber consisted of an orifice and a blade two effluents used were complex mixture of substituted phenolic compounds and pink colored dyestuff solutions the orifice and the blade were kept at an adjustable distance from each other and at the end of mixing chamber valve was connected to influence the pressure liquid jet of high velocity was produced in the orifice this liquid jet directly had impact against the edge of the blade kept near the orifice thus the flowing liquid shed vortices which were perpendicular to the original flow occurring in between the orifice and the blade this created a steady oscillation due to which pressure fluctuations occurred on the cavitating bubbles generated at the orifice the blade created a situation which was equivalent to presence of two orifices in a single system giving beneficial results for extent of degradation for effluent 1 under optimized conditions around 60 of toc removal and 85 cod removal were observed after 150 min of treatment for effluent 2 70 toc and similar cod removals were reported after 150 min wang et al 41 performed a study regarding chemical effects of swirling jet cavitation for degradation of rhodamine b the effect of swirling jet was compared with that of ultrasound induced cavitation the swirling chamber was kept inside the combined chamber and was connected to sidewall of combined chamber by holders in the swirling chamber four rectangular tangential injection ports existed in the sidewall fig 1 water was first pumped into the combination chamber and then it entered the swirling chamber through the injection ports a swirling jet of water was generated when it passed through the swirling cavitation chamber at the center region where pressure became very low when the pressure fell below the liquid vapor pressure vapor bubbles cavities were generated after getting ejected from the swirling chamber the jet had an impact against the bottom surface of the combined chamber where due to high pressure stagnation region the vapor bubbles imploded and hotspots were generated using swirling jet cavitational yield obtained was 49 5 10 7 mg j whereas for 20 khz and 40 khz ultrasound reactor the yields were 2 78 10 7 mg j and 2 93 10 7 mg j respectively wang et al 42 performed another study on degradation of rhodamine b using swirling jet cavitation combined with hydrogen peroxide very high cavity volume and surface area was reported to be generated by this type of cavitation 61 2 degradation was observed using swirling jet and it increased to 98 9 when coupled with 100 mg l h2o2 wang et al 43 44 also performed degradation of reactive brilliant red k 2bp using swirling jet cavitation ultrasound cavitation and both in combination with hydrogen peroxide sonolysis and hydrogen peroxide assisted sonolysis gave 1 7 10 7 mg j and 5 25 10 7 mg j as the cavitational yield respectively whereas swirling jet and swirling jet combined with hydrogen peroxide gave much higher cavitational yield as 2 88 10 6 mg j and 1 56 10 5 mg j respectively mancuso et al 45 used a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor ecowirl as shown in fig 2 based on swirling jet cavitation for degradation of rhodamine b sodium hypochlorite naocl was also used for intensification comparative study between swirling jet cavitator and orifice plate was also presented the swirling jet reactor consisted of i one pre swirling chamber having frustum conical shape with six injection ports and ii one double cone chamber for holding the cavitation the radial vortex was divided into six single vortices by the injection ports upstream diameter as 10 mm downstream diameter as 8 mm a braided stream of helical shape was generated along the axis of the jet due to centrifugal force the pressure at the center region of the braided stream became low when the pressure fell below the vapor pressure of the liquid vapor bubbles cavities generated the pre swirling chamber accelerated the braided stream as well as shook the treatment solution the braided stream was ejected to the double cone chamber from the frustum conical shaped pre swirling chamber and impacted against the perpendicular structure where pressure rose and vapor bubbles collapsed it was reported that the helical vortex field produced more than 1000 pulses per second it was also reported that degradation was 8 6 for orifice whereas it reached to much higher 14 7 for swirling jet reactor it was attributed to lower downstream pressure 0 85 bar for swirling jet as compared to orifice plate 0 30 bar at similar operating pressure 2 0 bar thus higher pressure drop occurred in swirling jet reactor moreover under similar operating conditions swirling jet reactor gave 1 3 times more cavitational yield as compared to orifice plate 83 4 degradation was observed after 37 min when naocl 4 mg l was combined with swirling jet demonstrating intensification for the combination effect of geometry was also studied for the ecowirl reactor it was demonstrated that for double cone chamber extent of degradation decreased and pressure drop increased with increasing length of the cylinder in the middle of the double cone the increasing length increased the chance of bubble coalescence and decreased the intensity of bubble collapse in another depiction of combination approach wang et al 46 performed degradation of reactive brilliant red k 2bp using combination of swirling jet cavitation and fenton s reagent the dye was 14 and 5 degraded using swirling jet cavitation and ultrasound cavitation respectively after 60 min of treatment the degradation reached 91 and 79 respectively after 60 min when these two processes were combined with fenton s reagent again demonstrating benefits of combination another design reported for hydrodynamic cavitation is vortex diode 47 vortex diode also employs rotational swirling flows and the basic design constitutes a tangential port axial cylindrical port and chamber connecting the two ports vortex diode allows multiple flow configurations as forward and reverse 48 in the forward configuration flow enters through the axial port whereas in the reverse flow flow enters through the tangential port again the generation of cavitation occurs when the local pressure falls below the vapor pressure of the liquid medium at the given operating temperature cavities are transferred to the high pressure region where the collapse occurs releasing intense energy and creating cavitating conditions the performance of the vortex diode was compared with the orifice in terms of the cavitational yield it was reported that cavitation yields for the degradation of acetone mek and toluene used as model pollutants were 1 31 10 3 1 31 10 3 and 4 02 10 3 mg j respectively for orifice configuration whereas for the vortex diode the values were higher at 11 1 10 3 11 8 10 3 and 32 2 10 3 mg j respectively 47 in another study 49 the efficacy of vortex diode was reported for the fertilizer industry yielding very high reduction in the cod as well as ammoniacal nitrogen the following sections provide an overview of reported studies on cavitation assisted degradation of dyes with the understanding into effect of various parameters on the process performance table 1 also presents a summary of different works related to dye degradation using hc also elucidating the details of the cavitation devices and important obtained results 3 effects of operating and design parameters of hc 3 1 effect of design parameters for orifice based systems the design parameters used to study the performance are the ratio of total hole perimeter to total flow area α and the ratio of throat area to pipe cross section area β rajoriya et al 30 31 reported that keeping the flow area constant if the throat perimeter is increased then the frequency of turbulence increases cavities collapse more violently and generation of intense collapse pressure follows moreover when α is higher for a specific flow area more cavities are generated and thus higher cavitation yield is observed the decolorization rate of rb13 was observed to increase with an increase of α from 1 33 to 2 28 and slightly decreased thereafter when increased to 4 14 indicating the existence of an optimum value beyond which the negative effect of cavity clouds takes over 30 31 sivakumar and pandit 55 reported that when multiple circular hole orifices were used for degradation of rhodamine b the degradation rate increased from 2 67 10 5 to 5 33 10 5 sec 1 when α was increased from 0 8 to 4 they observed that the orifice plate having a large number of holes having a smaller diameter high value of α was more favorable as compared to the plate having a small number of larger holes for the same reason rectangular or elliptical shaped holes are preferred over circular holes having the same area the value of β is dependent on the cavitation number and volumetric flow rate in the system rajoriya et al 30 31 varied β from 0 011 to 0 025 and it was reported that plates with higher β value generated a greater number of cavities and resulted in a higher rate of decolorization on the other hand sivakumar and pandit 55 reported that the degradation rate of rhodamine b showed a decrease with increasing β value in the range of 0 022 to 0 139 it was explained as collapse pressure increases with a decreasing flow area of the liquid medium and cavitational yield being proportional to the magnitude of collapse pressure degradation rate decreases with increasing β value a similar result was observed by vichare et al 56 for the decomposition of ki cavitation number has been reported to be in the range of 0 15 0 29 for optimum degradation efficiencies 57 and the throat area should be chosen accordingly madhu et al 58 used 4 types of orifices 1 mm 5 holes 2 mm 1 hole 3 mm 1 hole 4 mm 1 hole for degradation of malachite green and methyl violet and it was observed that orifice with 2 mm hole diameter showed the minimum cavitation number for the orifice with 5 holes pressure drop reduced and thus cavitation intensity decreased moreover this orifice resulted in formation of quite a large number of bubbles which coalesced they observed that with increasing β cavitational intensity decreased for venturi based systems throat geometry throat size and divergence angles decide the cavitational intensity and yield it was reported by saharan et al 59 60 that degradation in slit venturi was10 higher than that in circular venturi for degradation of orange g the reason was illustrated as a higher ratio of throat perimeter to cross sectional area in slit venturi bashir et al 61 performed an optimization study based on cfd using venturi of different geometrical parameters circular and slit venturi they suggested that the ratio of perimeter to the cross sectional area of flow decides the number of cavities being generated in the venturi for slit venturi the maximum size of the cavity is also dependent on the ratio of throat length to its height the collapse rate for cavities is dependent on the angle of the divergence at a larger divergence angle the venturi behaves similar to an orifice and cavities collapse immediately without reaching maximum size as a conclusion they suggested that slit venturi with α 2 7 and slit height equal to its length 1 1 ratio with a half divergence angle of 5 5 may be considered as an optimum geometry for obtaining the best cavitational yield the length of the cavitational zone and the number of cavitational events were observed to be lower in the case of circular venturi as compared to the slit venturi li et al 99 reported that the intensities of cavitational effect first showed an increase and then decreased when the perimeter was increased for circular venturi for the specific case of degradation of rhodamine b thus at an optimum perimeter of the circular venturi the cavitation effect was observed to be the strongest square venturi gave more intense cavitation compared to circular venturis of the same throat area for square venturi of half divergence angles 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 degradation extents were 42 91 58 32 and 36 35 respectively after 150 min rajoriya et al 30 31 also reported the optimum half divergence angle to be 6 5 for degradation of reactive blue 13 half divergence angle between 5 5 to 6 5 has been typically observed to give the best cavitation efficiency 62 59 63 60 64 65 a general overview of various orifice venturi systems and their effect on dye degradation has been provided in fig 3 3 2 effect of operating parameters 3 2 1 effect of inlet pressure when inlet pressure increases the intensity of turbulence and energy dissipation rate increases as a result a greater number of bubbles are generated as well as bubble collapse intensity increases this leads to a higher generation of hydroxyl radicals which intensify the cavitation based reactions moreover with increasing pressure the volumetric flow rate of the liquid also increases thus the number of passes of the liquid through the reactor increases which elevates the residence time for cavitation but this phenomenon occurs until a certain number density of cavities is reached beyond a certain pressure the number density of bubbles becomes so much that coalescence of bubbles occurs resulting in incomplete or cushioned collapse and a decrease in the rate of degradation thus an optimum pressure is needed depending on cavitating device geometry and types of reactant molecules saharan et al 2 3 performed degradation of reactive red 120 dye in a venturi reactor along with h2o2 with varying pressure in the range of 3 10 bar the rate of degradation showed a rise with increasing pressure until the pressure value reached 5 bar beyond 5 bar excess generation of cavities occurred and the downstream area got entirely filled with cavities these cavities coalesced and formed a cavity cloud which is named choked cavitation after the onset of choked cavitation the rate of degradation decreased with a further increase in inlet pressure gore et al 25 also varied inlet pressure in the range of 3 8 bar and observed that extent and rate of decolorization increased with an increasing inlet pressure of the venturi and then decreased after a certain value 5 bar for degradation of reactive orange 4 dye rajoriya et al 30 31 varied pressure in the range of 3 11 bar for circular and slit venturi and observed optimum pressure to be at 5 bar for degradation of rhodamine 6 g mishra and gogate 27 varied pressure in the range of 2 9 5 8 atm for degradation of rhodamine b using orifice and venturi they observed that extent of degradation increased until the pressure reached 4 84 atm at 5 8 atm inlet pressure the extent of degradation dropped slightly due to the onset of super cavitation kumar et al 39 also studied the degradation of methylene blue in a venturi reactor along with h2o2 and photocatalysis they varied the inlet pressure in the range of 1 10 bar and observed that the rate of degradation increased until 5 bar rajoriya et al 66 also observed optimum pressure to be 5 bar when inlet pressure was varied in the range of 3 10 bar in a venturi for degradation of textile industry effluent there are many other studies on dye degradation that have reported optimum pressure between 4 and 5 bars 23 50 52 53 67 in all cases it was mentioned that beyond a certain pressure due to the appearance of cavity cloud the collapse activity was dampened which led to a downfall in the extent of treatment it is ideal to keep the pressure between 4 and 5 bars due to the tradeoff between degradation efficiency and cost of treatment 3 2 2 effect of temperature temperature is a crucial factor for the liquid vaporization process and reaction kinetics thus it is an important parameter that affects the rate of cavitation process and degradation yield vapor pressure of liquid increases with increasing temperature and thus the cavitation bubbles tend to have higher vapor content which leads to cushioning effects and bubbles collapses less violently 68 but the number of free radicals also increases with increasing temperature and so does the kinetic rate constants for oxidation or the radical reactions making the overall effect often unpredictable gogate and bhosale 23 observed that low temperature was favorable for enhancing the decolorization of acid orange ii and brilliant green rate constants decreased from 4 04 10 3 min 1 to 3 12 10 3 min 1 and 9 55 10 3 min 1 to 2 12 10 3 min 1 when the temperature was increased from 20 c to 40 c for acid orange ii and brilliant green respectively mishra and gogate 27 observed that when the temperature was increased from 30 to 40 c the extent of degradation increased for the degradation of rhodamine b they reported that with increasing operating temperature the number of bubbles generated increased marginally yi et al 69 varied temperature in the range of 15 c 35 c for degradation of rhodamine b they observed an increase in degradation with increasing temperature for the range of 15 25 c afterwards a decrease in oxidation rate was seen with a further increase in temperature li et al 99 varied the temperature in the range of 30 50 c for degradation of rhodamine b using hc along with fe3 doped tio2 they observed that the degradation ratio first increased and then decreased with an increase in temperature at 40 c demonstrated as optimum the highest degradation ratio was observed wang et al 42 performed the degradation of rhodamine b using swirling jet cavitation along with h2o2 where they varied the temperature in the range of 30 60 c they observed that the degradation ratio increased with an increase in temperature from 30 50 c but after that the degradation declined with further increase in temperature dhanke and wagh 70 and wang et al 43 44 also observed a similar weakening in degradation performance beyond 50 c while it is important that the result is higher degradation efficiency obtained at optimum temperature it is important to elucidate the cost at which it is being obtained room temperature operations do not require additional cooling or heating media and costs related to them are also avoided if room temperatures lie between 20 30 c additional heat exchange systems are generally not cost intensive while they are a requirement in winters or colder regions and can add up to 15 of total costs in 5 years of operation which need to be evaluated against the obtained benefits generally there is heating in the system due to a continuous operation and that can also be harnessed for a positive temperature effect without the requirement of external energy overall a cost to benefit analysis is indeed required to balance the expected benefits of higher treatment with the required energy costs 3 2 3 effect of ph several studies have suggested that acidic ph is more favorable for the degradation of dyes in hc reactors bhat and gogate 21 report that more than 90 of dye degradation studies with hydrodynamic cavitation have shown enhanced performance at acidic ph this phenomenon has been explained based on the pka values of dyes and that dyes are present in a molecular state at acidic ph at this molecular state the dye molecules exhibit hydrophobicity thus they tend to stay at the liquid gas interface where the hydroxyl radicals are present in much higher concentrations so as to facilitate direct attack and bring out the necessary changes on the other side if the medium is basic the dye molecules become ionized and hydrophilic thus they stay in the bulk of the liquid in the bulk fraction of the liquid the hydroxyl radicals participate in recombination reactions and very few of them remain available for the dyes for oxidation thus due to insufficient supply of hydroxyl radical the extent of degradation of dye molecules become lower saharan et al 2 3 reported that only 10 of the total hydroxyl radicals generated can diffuse in the bulk of the liquid the optimum ph value for the degradation of dye is dependent on the specific dye s dissociation constant pka saharan et al 2 3 varied the ph in the range of 2 11 for the degradation of reactive red 120 dye they obtained the maximum color and toc reduction at ph 2 kumar et al 39 performed decolorization of methylene blue using h2o2 and photocatalyst they observed that decolorization decreased from 32 32 to 3 896 when ph was increased from 2 to 10 wang et al 43 44 varied ph in the range of 2 10 for degradation of reactive brilliant red k 2bp using swirling jet cavitation along with h2o2 they observed that degradation reached 97 2 at ph 2 after 120 min whereas the degradation was 48 4 at ph 10 after a similar time of treatment in addition to the presence of hydroxyl radicals at interfaces in a higher amount they suggested another two reasons for higher degradation at acidic conditions 1 higher concentration of co3 2 and hco3 ions at higher ph which could act as free radical scavengers 2 higher h2o2 decomposition to form hydroxyl radicals in acidic medium gore et al 25 also varied solution ph in the range of 2 10 for studying the degradation of reactive orange 4 dye using hc combined with h2o2 and ozone they observed that maximum decolorization of 37 23 was obtained at ph value 2 after 120 min of treatment whereas at ph 10 only 4 6 decolorization was observed after similar treatment time mishra and gogate 27 performed the degradation of rhodamine b using hc h2o2 fenton s reagent and carbon tetrachloride they varied the medium ph in the range of 2 5 11 and observed that at ph 2 5 maximum degradation 59 3 occurred gogate and bhosale 23 also reported that for degradation of orange acid ii and brilliant green using hc in combination with other intensifying agents h2o2 na2s2o8 naocl maximum color removal was observed at ph 3 in their study experiments were conducted at five different ph values 2 3 4 7 8 and it was demonstrated that ph 2 and 3 only showed a marginal difference in the extent of degradation directing the selection of ph 3 as the optimum though most studies have reported acidic conditions are better some studies also report better degradation performance under alkaline conditions for example rajoriya et al 30 31 performed degradation of rhodamine 6 g using hc combined with h2o2 and ozone they varied the solution ph in the range of 2 12 and observed that decolorization rate was higher at basic medium than at acidic medium at 10 ph maximum decolorization was observed it happened because the rhodamine 6 g molecules became hydrophobic at basic conditions due to charge transfer occurring from amine nitrogen to aromatic rings it is thus essential that pilot scale studies be performed to confirm the effects of ph for the specific dye also it is important to weigh the benefits in degradation against the costs required for ph adjustment and also subsequent neutralization as the discharge of effluent is generally expected at neutral ph 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration initial concentration is attributed as another important parameter for dye degradation in most of the studies it has been reported that the extent of degradation decreases with increasing initial concentration the degradation ratio typically decreases due to higher loading of the substrate with a fixed number of hydroxyl radicals generated 57 the number of radicals generated is only dependent on the cavitating conditions and is independent of initial concentration thus the percentage of dye degraded with respect to the initial amount of dye may decrease but it is also important to understand that the total number of moles of dye degraded per unit volume per unit time increases and also the effect on rate constant for degradation needs to be looked at for determining the volume of the reactor and residence time we need to know the rate of degradation rather than the percentage of reduction saharan et al 59 60 observed that for degradation of orange g the rate of degradation increased with an increasing initial concentration of dye till an optimum value rajoriya et al 30 31 observed that extent of degradation of reactive blue 13 decreased from 47 to 19 with an increase in initial concentration from 30 ppm to 60 ppm dhanke and wagh 70 also observed that extent of degradation of acid red 18 was inversely proportional to its initial concentration at 15 20 25 and 30 ppm of initial concentration 75 2 72 1 60 1 and 50 4 degradation were obtained respectively after 180 min of treatment yi et al 69 observed that for the degradation of rhodamine b with an increase in initial concentration from 20 μmol l to 30 μmol l the degradation rate and extent of degradation increased but beyond 30 μmol l the degradation rate reduced marginally with a further increase in concentration li et al 99 also observed that the degradation ratio of rhodamine b first showed a rise and then showed a degreasing trend when initial concentration was increased keeping other parameters constant the optimum concentration of the dye was reported to be 10 mg l where 91 11 of degradation was observed cai et al 38 performed decolorization of orange g using hc along with the fenton process when they varied the concentration in the range of 10 mg l to 100 mg l it was observed that 10 mg l and 20 mg l initial concentration followed almost the same curve for decolorization but afterwards for 40 mg l 80 mg l and 100 mg l as the initial concentration the difference in decolorization extent was vivid and clear at 10 mg l initial concentration the decolorization extent was 90 4 whereas it fell to 47 3 for initial concentration value as 100 mg l moreover the decolorization rate was significantly higher at the beginning of the experiment owing to the fact that most of the h2o2 got converted into hydroxyl radicals within the first 20 min of reaction only wang et al 43 44 observed that the percentage degradation reduces from 99 to 28 by increasing the dye loading from 20 to 200 mg l it is thus important to understand that selecting optimum conditions for the initial concentration is must and this will strongly dependent on the rate of generation of hydroxyl radicals and its utilization rate also though it appears that higher extents of degradation are observed at lower concentrations dilution may not be an effective solution always as this will increase the total volume of the effluent to be treated making it imperative to decide on the tradeoff between the extents of treatment and volumes to be treated 3 3 effect of physicochemical properties of liquid among the physicochemical properties of the liquid cavitation is influenced by liquid vapor pressure viscosity and surface tension 3 3 1 effect of liquid vapor pressure vapor pressure is directly dependent on the temperature of the solution when vapor pressure is high vapor content in the cavity is also high thus cushioning effect occurs by continuous condensation of vapor and the intensity of bubble collapse decreases 71 but the number of cavities generated also shows a rise with increasing vapor pressure also the cavitation number falls when the vapor pressure of the liquid increases moreover the onset of a cavitation becomes easier if the liquid has very high vapor pressure these two opposing phenomena take place simultaneously and thus a threshold vapor pressure exists where cavitation effects are maximum gogate et al 72 reported that the resultant pressure pulse due to the collapse of a single cavity decreased when liquid vapor pressure was increased suslick et al 73 reported that the rate of iodine liberation due to the decomposition of ki weissler reaction decreased with increasing temperature i e increase in the vapor pressure of the liquid studies on bubble dynamics have shown that with an increase in temperature viscosity and surface tension decrease but vapor pressure shows a rise thus bubble collapse intensity decreases in general lower vapor pressure has been suggested for enhanced benefits thus the selection of proper liquid medium is necessary depending on the specific application if less intensity collapse is enough for the particular application say for example cell disruption or water treatment for disinfection higher vapor pressure liquid can be used otherwise lower vapor pressure of the liquid is desirable especially when higher intensities are required for example in the case of wastewater treatment 3 3 2 effect of viscosity threshold pressure of cavitation increases with increasing viscosity since a stronger natural cohesive force is needed to be overcome at higher viscosity thus lower viscosity of the liquid is desirable ivany and hammitt 74 observed that shear viscosity increased the liquid pressure at the wall of the bubbles during the collapse for incompressible liquids the bubble wall velocity showed a decline when viscosity was increased for compressible liquids when the bubble radius was small bubble wall velocity increased with increasing viscosity they also found out that after the collapse of a bubble the dissipated viscous energy in an incompressible liquid was almost 40 hp which was in support of the fact that significantly high local temperature is generated after the collapse they also observed that when the viscosity value was too small bubble collapse was significantly slowed down for both compressible and incompressible liquids whereas moderate viscosity values did not have a significant effect on the collapse rate gogate and pandit 75 reported that if the viscosity of liquid becomes high more pressure energy will be required to overcome the cohesive force and thus threshold pressure value will increase senthilkumar 71 reported that variation of bubble collapse conditions with increasing viscosity were almost insignificant for newtonian liquids gogate et al 72 carried out simulations for newtonian liquids with various viscosity values where it was observed that when viscosity increased the cavity collapse conditions did not change much in the viscosity range of 0 6 cp an increase in the viscosity value slightly increased the collapse pressure of bubbles but in that case a lower number of nuclei was subjected to cavitational condition thus the positive effect was nullified and the overall result was somewhere on the negative side but on the other side for non newtonian liquids having high viscosity the viscoelastic forces dampened the violent collapse of the cavity to a large extent overall it can be said that effect of viscosity will be marginal at lower values but at too high values there will reduced generation of cavitation events leading to lower intensification effects 3 3 3 effect of surface tension when the surface tension is more bubble contraction and collapse becomes more violent which increases the collapse temperature and pressure but surface tensional force opposes the creation and growth phase of the bubble thus due to surface tension cavitation inception becomes delayed also the size of gas or vapor nuclei is determined by surface tension when a cavity stays at stable equilibrium with its surrounding liquid medium surface tensional force becomes p σ 2 σ r where σ is the surface tension and r is the radius of the bubble also the vapor pressure of the nearby liquid changes due to the formation of nuclei of vapor bubbles according to kelvin s equation which is given as p v p s a t e x p 2 v l σ r t r where pv psat vl r t denote actual vapor pressure vapor pressure at saturation condition the molar volume of liquid universal gas constant and absolute temperature respectively due to the concave curvature of liquid with respect to vapor the actual vapor pressure of the liquid becomes less than the vapor pressure when the surface is flat thus for incipient cavitation the local pressure has to fall even below the vapor pressure of the liquid it is important to note that in the case of wastewater treatment applications water satisfies the required criteria for physicochemical properties and hence cavitation can be effectively generated in the reactor leading to beneficial results off course a primary treatment in terms of oil removal may be required in case there is a large quantum of oil present in the effluent in the case of fiber materials present in the wastewater primary treatment methods like sedimentation and decantation are used it can thus said that proper pretreatment will be useful in tailoring the conditions for effective treatment 4 combination approaches for wastewater treatment intensification in the treatment of dyes can be achieved by combining hc with strong oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide ozone carbon tetrachloride sodium persulfate fenton s reagent and photocatalysts due to the synergistic generation of additional free radicals the extent of degradation and mineralization is expected to increase 76 the degree of intensification and required oxidant loading are dependent on the properties of the molecule being degraded performing optimization studies are important to maximize the yield as outlined in this section for different combination approaches and making the study feasible at a commercial scale application for combination based approaches the degree of intensification is expressed as a synergetic index which is based on an improvement in the kinetic rate constant obtained for the combination over the sum of the rate constants for the processes performed individually the obtained synergitic index for different combinations is typically dependent on the specific pollutant or the composition of effluent and need to be established using studies as outlined now 4 1 degradation using hc h2o2 hydrogen peroxide acts as an additional source for hydroxyl radicals in the cavitational hotspot region and it is well established that hydrogen peroxide intensifies degradation in combination with cavitation 53 it is also important to note that beyond a certain loading of h2o2 it may act as a radical scavenger 77 where due to recombination reactions degradation efficiency is reduced thus an optimum loading of h2o2 is required to obtain the desired extent of degradation the reactions taking place for the generation of radicals are as follows 78 h 2 o 2 2 o h o h h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o o h h o 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o o h d y e o h c o 2 h 2 o i n t e r m e d i a t e s wang et al 42 performed the degradation of rhodamine b using swirling jet cavitation combined with h2o2 the study used terephthalic acid dianion ta to determine the relative amount of hydroxyl radicals produced ta reacts with hydroxyl radicals to form hydroxyterephthalate hta which is stable and fluorescent a much stronger fluorescence spectrum was observed when hc was combined with h2o2 this indicated a remarkable enhancement in the generation of hydroxyl radicals and a synergetic effect between hc and h2o2 for degradation of rhodamine b an overview of various reports dealing with combination of hc and hydrogen peroxide can be found in table 2 4 2 degradation using hc o3 ozone has been recognized as a highly effective oxidant oxidation potential of 2 08 v as it dissociates into molecular oxygen o2 and nascent oxygen o this nascent oxygen reacts with water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals the reactions taking place in ozonation in the presence of energy dissipation are as follows 78 o 3 o 2 o h 2 o h o h o h 2 o 2 o h d y e o h c o 2 h 2 o i n t e r m e d i a t e s an overview of use of ozone as an additional oxidant in hydrodynamic cavitation process can be found in table 2 gore et al 25 performed the degradation of reactive orange 4 dye using hc combined with ozone they reported that ozonation of organic molecules can happen in two ways 1 at basic ph ozone molecules dissociate to give nascent oxygen and generate hydroxyl radicals in reaction with water molecules and those radicals participate in oxidation reactions 2 at acidic ph ozone molecules directly attack the pollutant molecules as an electrophile few drawbacks were also pointed out when ozone is individually applied for degradation e g high energy required for ozone generation sensitivity towards ph and high selectivity towards organic molecules but these drawbacks could be overcome if ozonation is done in combination with other processes hc h2o2 ultrasound uv rajoriya et al 66 performed the treatment of textile dyeing industry effluent using hc combined with ozone they varied the ozone feed rate from 1 g h to 5 g h and reported that maximum toc and cod reduction was seen at the ozone flow rate of 3 g h at this optimum loading 48 toc reduction and 22 72 cod reduction were observed after 120 min whereas only hc gave 17 toc reduction and 12 cod reduction after a similar time another important aspect of the study was that lower efficacy with 41 toc reduction and 12 cod reduction was seen if ozone was injected in the solution tank instead of the throat of venturi the reason for this higher conversion at the addition at throat of venturi was explained as 1 at venturi throat as ozone molecules were directly in the cavitating conditions a higher number of radicals was produced 2 high turbulence in the reactor core helped in higher dispersion of ozone molecules 3 higher contact time between ozone and dye molecules happened in between the venturi and storage tank the synergetic coefficient obtained in the combined hc ozonation process was 1 42 under the best conditions 4 3 degradation using hc fenton s reagent fenton s reagent contains ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide it intensifies the degradation process by regeneration of ferrous ions which enhance the generation of hydroxyl radicals in most of the research works it has been observed that an optimum ratio of ferrous sulfate to hydrogen peroxide exists excessive addition of ferrous sulfate may lead to high tds generation as well as an increment in cod 38 use of fenton s reagent alone suffers from two major disadvantages 1 need to control ph in the range 2 4 2 requirement of sludge disposal the use of fenton s reagent in various combined treatment processes can eliminate some of the drawbacks and also drive high efficiency in oxidizing recalcitrant dye molecules based on the chain of radical reactions illustrated below that ensures regeneration of oxidizing species and fe2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o

industry effluent using hc along with other aops it was observed that only h2o2 was not enough for the mineralization of the dye molecules because of their highly complex nature use of fenton s reagent helped in overcoming the scavenging nature of h2o2 study performed at fixed 5 ml of h2o2 per liter of dye solution and varying feso4 7h2o h2o2 ratio as 1 1 1 2 1 5 and 1 10 established that at optimum ratio of 1 5 48 toc reduction occurred within only 15 min almost complete decolorization 97 7 was observed after 60 min and 38 cod was removed after 120 min at optimum loading to determine the synergetic effect the experiment of mineralization was also carried out using fenton s reagent alone where it was observed that at an optimum ratio of 1 5 only 10 9 toc reduction occurred the synergetic coefficient was obtained as 2 48 the combination approach gave higher toc cod and color removal in comparison with hc o3 and hc o2 badmus et al 81 mentioned that the application of only iron ii sulfate could help in getting rid of environmental hazards related to h2o2 but several drawbacks of this process were also mentioned e g excessive generation of iron sludge the existence of elemental iron in the effluent and formation of a wide range of complex materials they also studied the effect of combined hydrogen peroxide iron sulfate h2o2 fe2 and hydrogen peroxide green nano zero valent iron h2o2 nfe on decolorization efficiency they processed 1 mg l h2o2 with 1 mg l iron ii sulfate fenton s reagent and 1 mg l nano zero valent iron advanced fenton s reagent separately in jet loop hc the fenton s reagent gave 97 1 and 54 0 decolorization respectively with and without hc similarly advanced fenton s reagent gave 98 6 and 78 4 decolorization respectively with and without hc the reason for enhanced decolorization efficiency for advanced fenton s process was explained as zero valent iron can accommodate three units of electrons whereas iron with oxidation state 2 can only accommodate one unit of an electron the toc reduction obtained was 40 6 6 2 17 5 65 7 and 74 3 respectively using only hc only fenton only advanced fenton hc fenton and hc advanced fenton respectively clearly demonstrating the efficacy of hc advanced fenton approach cai et al 38 performed experiments by locating fe in two different positions in the tank and 35 cm away from the orifice plate it was observed that fe located 35 cm away could easily access the cavitation bubbles thus the generation of hydroxyl radicals was higher it can be thus said that an optimum ratio of fenton s reagent is important and also use of advanced fenton process based on elemental iron seems to be a better option as compared to feso4 attributed to lower sludge generation 4 4 degradation using hc photocatalysis the heterogeneous photocatalysis process has been widely applied method for the degradation of dyes it involves a semiconductor photocatalyst tio2 or zno which absorbs photons of energy greater than or equal to the band gap of the material the excited electrons after absorbing the energy move to the conduction band from the valence band and leave holes behind these electron hole pairs participate in redox reactions with water hydroxide ion or oxygen to generate hydroxyl radicals the photocatalyst remains unchanged in the process and no consumable chemical is needed or sludge requiring disposal is generated 83 to optimize the portion of solar spectrum the catalyst absorbs tio2 has been doped with transition metal ions v cr mn fe ni as well as ag au ru which alter the band gap and shift the tio2 absorption band from uv region into the visible region s e m i c o n d u c t o r m e t a l o x i d e m o h v m o h e h h 2 o h o h 2 h 2 h 2 o 2 h h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 2 o h e o 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o h h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 2 o h d y e o h c o 2 h 2 o i n t e r m e d i a t e s the combination of photocatalysis with hc is successful as the turbulence generated is able to overcome the mass transfer resistances associated with photocatalysis the catalyst particles may provide additional nuclei for cavitational bubble growth but the excessive presence of them may hinder the bubble growth stage also effective irradiation of penetrating light may be hindered and interaction between photocatalyst and light may decrease when loading value crosses an optimum value thus after a certain catalyst loading value extent of removal will not show any rise 51 or even reduce depending on the system in addition to the catalyst loading the extent of doping is also an important parameter to look at bethi et al 82 mentioned that excess loading of dopant may lead to recombination reactions between electron and holes which reduces the decolorization extent in general use of combined approach of hc with photocatalysis will show higher effects as compared to the individual approaches though the results for improved performance will always depend on the specific pollutant see data in table 2 4 5 degradation using hc and other advanced oxidants several other combination approaches have been reported by researchers over years mishra and gogate 27 performed the degradation of rhodamine b using hc combined with ccl4 the mechanism of degradation was based on the generation of chlorine free radicals due to the degradation of chloroalkanes the loading of ccl4 applied was 1 g l with a 10 ppm initial concentration of dye the decolorization and toc reduction obtained were 82 and 34 respectively after 120 min of treatment whereas only hc gave 59 3 decolorization and 30 toc reduction after a similar amount of time but it was also shown that ccl4 was not as efficient as h2o2 or fenton s reagent for degradation the possible reason was that the existing cavitating conditions could not dissociate ccl4 enough to generate an equivalent amount of free radicals as it generated in the case of h2o2 or fenton s reagent bethi et al 52 performed the degradation of crystal violet dye using hc and poly acrylic acid bentonite nano composite hydro gel it was observed that 66 75 and 77 dye removal and 59 66 and 66 toc removal occurred when the clay content in the hydro gel was 0 g 0 5 g and 1 g respectively it was thus observed that decolorization only increased significantly upto clay content of 0 5 g the attributed reason was that at high clay loading water intake by the gel was hindered and thus lower swelling of hydro gel occurs moreover excessive clay may form agglomerates within the hydrogel matrix thus active sites for water penetration decreases when the hydro gel loading was varied as 10 20 30 and 40 g for 500 mg l dye stock solution 63 75 80 and 80 decolorization of dye was observed at these loading values respectively the synergetic index for toc removal was obtained to be 1 20 at optimum hydro gel loading under best condition of ph 2 3 96 color removal and 70 toc removal was observed in the hybrid process after 90 min of the operation time whereas only hc gave 20 decolorization and 17 toc reduction gogate and bhosale 23 investigated degradation of orange acid ii and brilliant green using oxidizing agents as h2o2 na2s2o8 and naocl along with hc for orange acid ii when h2o2 loading increased from 95 2 mg l to 571 2 mg l degradation increased from 60 to 96 and the increase was steady without any downfall for brilliant green however when h2o2 loading increased from 95 2 mg l to 244 8 mg l degradation increased from 77 to 86 and after that the extent of degradation decreased for degradation of orange acid ii using na2s2o8 the extent of degradation was 94 at 44 52 mg l loading and almost 100 at 535 72 mg l loading for brilliant green the extent of degradation increased marginally at lower oxidant loading and an insignificant effect was observed at higher oxidant loading using naocl for orange acid ii 100 decolorization was observed within 20 min using oxidant loading of 1250 59 mg l degradation of brilliant green using naocl was not performed it was reported that brilliant green was easier to oxidize and even with a minute amount of oxidant very quick decolorization occurred thus detailed investigation on the loading of oxidant was not performed further for orange acid ii h2o2 na2s2o8 and naocl gave cavitational yield 9 71 10 6 1 10 5 and 8 08 10 5 mg j respectively when combined with hc for brilliant green 8 75 10 6 and 9 67 10 6 mg j cavitational yield were obtained using h2o2 and na2s2o8 combined with hc baradaran and sadeghi 53 performed the degradation of coomassie brilliant blue using a combination of hc h2o2 and activated persulfate kps optimum h2o2 and kps loading were obtained to be 676 1 mg l and 541 1 mg l at 7 1 bar more than 92 decolorization was obtained at this optimum condition although the working mechanism of two different oxidants seems to be independent of each other apparently it was suggested that inter conversion among radicals may take place and multi step and un selective reaction pathways of radicals and their scavenging effects occur thus increase in oxidant loading beyond a certain concentration may prevent radicals formation and diminish the decolorization reaction rate considerably in the decolorization process the synergetic coefficient was 2 11 whereas for the mineralization process it was 1 16 73 2 mineralization was obtained after 60 min for combination whereas hc h2o2 and kps gave 27 1 30 2 and 4 1 mineralization individually after 60 min of treatment time mancuso et al 45 performed decolorization of rhodamine b using swirling jet cavitation along with naocl at initial dye concentration 3 mg l the concentration of naocl was varied in the range of 0 5 4 0 mg l the extent of decolorization was observed to be increasing with increasing naocl concentration at 4 mg l oxidant loading a maximum 94 decolorization was observed after 169 min of treatment at minimum loading 0 5 mg l 31 decolorization was observed after 169 min whereas degradation was less than 20 using only swirling jet cavitation moreover 83 4 decolorization was observed within only 37 min using a combination of swirling jet induced cavitation and naocl 4 0 mg l clearly highlighting the beneficial effects of the combination approach jung et al 84 performed decolorization of acid orange 7 using an orifice plate which was kept under electric field they varied the applied voltage within the range of 5 v to 100 v and allowed a 40 min reaction time the dye and nacl concentration were kept fixed at 10 mg l and 2 5 g l they observed that the extent of decolorization increased with increasing voltage at 60 v 100 decolorization was observed although 50 v and 60 v gave an almost similar extent of degradation only 0 3 less in the case of 50 v 1 5 times more electrical energy was needed for operation at 60 v thus 50 v was chosen as the optimum where 95 39 decolorization was reported after 22 5 min of treatment and almost 100 after 40 min the inlet pressure and ph values were kept at 3 5 kgf cm2 and 2 they optimized the operational conditions statistically using response surface methodology rsm with box behnken design bbd according to this model at optimum conditions of inlet pressure as 3 9 kgf cm2 ph of 3 and applied voltage of 37 7 v complete decolorization could occur after 40 min which was also verified experimentally 5 cost estimation and analysis trade offs between degradation efficiency and costs have always been mentioned but not been quantitatively studied regularly 21 85 86 cost estimation by mahamuni and adewuyi 86 for us reactor scale up in the application of dye degradation has been shown in table 4 for an overview of cost estimation in this paper the authors have considered a venturi device for capital costs and trade off analysis a venturi device is generally considered more expensive than fabricating an orifice plate and several studies have shown a better degradation performance for a venturi because of a gradient constriction as opposed to a sudden construction in an orifice 27 59 60 for the current study a parameterized model was developed to relate the performance of a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor to operating costs the first order degradation rate constants for only hydrodynamic cavitation were obtained for rhodamine b degradation 27 41 42 the variables in the process used were time of treatment inlet pressure and reactor volume the flow rate depends on the pressure and obtained for a specific type of venturi 27 this study takes into consideration the pressure value based on most reports where the degradation percentage or the rate of degradation is optimum at 4 5 bar pressure the results for the parameterized model are summarized in fig 4 there is a direct relationship between the cost of treatment to inlet pressure and time of treatment fig 4a higher pressure and higher time lead to higher costs while the cost is slightly more sensitive to time as compared to pressure the slope of the gradient there s an inverse relation between the volume of the reactor and costs fig 4b a higher volume of the reactor was reciprocated with a lower number of passes fig 4c higher volume leads to a decrease in the cost per unit volume processed it is recommended to increase the volume of the reactor such that the number of passes remains the same by adjusting the time and flow rate it is very clear that the number of passes pressure and time increase costs while reactor volume might decrease normalized costs the degradation percentage depends on the rate constants obtained from the literature and peaks at an optimum pressure of 5 in this case fig 4d this can also be extrapolated to studies where optimum pressure is between 4 and 6 bars the section that is ideal for scale up is marked in blue and has a blank dashed boundary fig 4d this section is further reproduced in the subsequent figures to help identify the ideal degradation percentage with the same conditions costs show a different trend not following the degradation percentages fig 4e when it comes to cost the ideal section for scale up lies in the upper left corner while the ideal degradation lies in the mid right range this trade off needs to be addressed when optimizing the process for a scale up this can be addressed by the use of costs that are normalized to both volume and a decrease in concentration fig 4f such a cod concentration normalized cost has been well reported in such a normalization both the sections mentioned earlier lie in the blue region which is the ideal region the lowest cost lies in the mid range and this section can now be considered for scale up while this analysis can be used for other studies it might not necessarily reflect trends that are similar to other studies the authors suggest that such a trade off analysis might be necessary for deciding on the application of hc in real wastewater treatment processes and can form the basis for scale up and pilot plant studies a detailed scale up costing analysis was performed table 3 and appendix a with the designs of venturi used for analysis given in fig 5 and fig 6 the total annual operating cost has been obtained to be 39 74 thousand gallons of water treated which is much lower than the cost estimated by mahamuni and adewuyi 86 for scaling up of ultrasound acoustic cavitation shown in table 3 in conventional biological treatment processes capital cost is around 2 m and operating cost varies in the range of 5 to 10 per 1000 gallons of water treated most reports on dye degradation study the degradation in synthetic lab scale samples the costing analysis takes into consideration the need of higher load of additional oxidants for real wastewater with higher and more complex contaminant loading based on previously published studies on real wastewater treatment 87 88 this is consistent with data from cost analysis on an individual lab scale basis reported in literature 89 the chemical costs taken into consideration are based on maximum load of oxidants required in real systems where hc can be applied as a tertiary treatment this load may be lesser which will decrease the overall cost of treatment chemical costs contribute to a major part of overall costs approximately 41 in a commercially applied system fig 7 and this percentage can be lesser based on the real water matrix and the stage of application it is very important to take the effect of oxidants into consideration for cost analysis due to a high contribution of chemical costs to overall costs a comparison of energy required per unit order and corresponding cost required per unit order has been compiled for several published papers reporting the pressures and flow rates table 5 the recently published report on the degradation of brilliant blue using a venturi device stands out with the lowest cost per order and this can be attributed to the 99 degradation observed in the study 90 most reports on only hc systems report between 20 50 degradation of several dyes cako et al 90 also reports the 99 degradation with only 1 7 bar of input pressure which is significantly lower than the pressure average of 3 5 5 5 observed in other published reports in comparison between a venturi an orifice and swirling jet cavitating device both venturi and swirling jet have consistently yielded lower cost per order than an orifice table 5 the cost per order of degradation with venturi device for rhodamine b degradation is the lowest at 0 01 0 04 l 1 while orifice can go up to 0 06 l 1 even though the number of reports on swirling jet device or vortex diode are comparative less 91 94 as compared to venturi devices they can be promising with respect to their cost per order 0 03 0 04 l 1 though it also depends on the specific system investigated for the study all recently reported studies 2018 2020 have demonstrated a low cost per order 0 01 0 02 l 1 due to a comparatively higher degradation percentages reported based on the studies on the three devices the use of venturi is demonstrated to be the most cost efficient including the degradation efficacy and scale up prospects closely followed by the swirling jet device or the vortex diode it is also seen based on the comparison of costs of treatments for different processes that the combination approaches involving hc generally require lower costs as compared to approaches involving ultrasound table 6 as reported by thanekar and gogate 76 6 conclusions this review article highlights the significance of hc in dye treatment despite having higher treatment costs than conventional existing methods such as biological oxidation it has the potential to find usage in large scale applications due to its simple reactor design zero sludge production high energy efficiency and less supervision required also hc has shown higher scalability energy efficiency and cavitational yield compared to ac among hc devices orifice and venturi has been widely used by researchers for the degradation of dyes in most of the studies slit venturi has provided the maximum cavitational yield compared to circular venturi or single hole orifice the other types of hc devices as rotational cavitating devices such as vortex diode are yet to find extensive use in dye degradation effect of different design parameters of rotational cavitating devices and their comparison with venturi and orifice in terms of cavitational yield or scalability is yet to be performed in most of the studies optimum pressure has been observed to be around 5 bar temperature is kept around 30 35 c to diminish the additional cost for heating circulating cooling water is needed on large scale to prevent temperature rise in the reactor especially at higher power dissipation significant temperature rise may alter the vapor pressure also and thus the cavitation number ph value of 2 3 ha s shown maximum efficiency in lab scale but in large scale applications the obtained benefits from low ph should be weighed against the operating cost since very low ph could require a significant amount of hcl for adjustment as well alkali in subsequent neutralization before discharge higher α value has been recommended in most of the studies for higher cavitational intensity whereas β value should be optimized depending on the particular application the optimum half divergence angle for the case of venturi has been observed to be in between 5 5 to 6 5 the use of additional chemicals and oxidants is the major cost contributor to cavitation based processes the trade off between use of chemicals for intensified degradation is always seen with respect to cost of treatment cost trade offs are an important consideration while scaling up the process a venturi device is the most efficient as compared to other cavitation device types with respect to cost per order from the cost analysis performed for degradation of reactive red 120 on an industrial scale hc has proven to have greater cost efficiency compared to ac coupled with ease of scale up declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgement authors would

13434,hydrophobic carriers were examined for geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol removal from water derived from an aquaculture system a combination of adsorption and biodegradation was found to underlie the removal of the off flavor compounds adsorption of these compounds by the carriers was unaffected by the presence of organic matter in the water to be treated a model based on adsorption desorption and first order degradation kinetics provided an accurate prediction for experimentally determined 2 methylisoborneol removal rates steady removal of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol as well as nitrate reduction were observed during long term operation of the plug flow reactors with water derived from an aquaculture facility metagenomic analysis of the microbial community on the carriers during long term operation of the reactors revealed a predominance of denitrifying bacteria it was found that geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol led to statistically significant changes in the abundances of 21 contigs that contained genes involved in terpene degradation this study shows that at low ambient concentrations of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol in nitrate and organic rich water such as found in aquaculture systems their biodegradation can be accomplished by terpene degrading denitrifiers that develop on hydrophobic carriers used for filtration of the contaminated water keywords adsorption biodegradation geosmin hydrophobic carriers 2 methylisoborneol microbial community structure 1 introduction due to overfishing global fisheries supplies continue to stabilize and even decline 1 this together with the growing demand for seafood has led to a rapid expansion of aquaculture in the last decades 2 by virtue of their compact design and with their efficient use of water resources recirculating aquaculture systems ras are considered a promising alternative for the more conventional aquaculture systems 3 with the development of these systems it has become increasingly apparent that off flavor of fish produced in ras is a major obstacle for their further expansion 4 6 the most common off flavor agents in fish culture systems are geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib in ras these secondary metabolites are predominantly produced by bacteria in both freshwater 7 8 and seawater systems 9 10 when present in the culture water these hydrophobic off flavor compounds rapidly accumulate in the fatty tissues of the fish and taint them with an earthy muddy taste and aroma affected fish become unmarketable even when containing very low concentrations of geosmin and mib 11 12 due to an increased public awareness of drinking water quality it is mainly in the drinking water industry that methods for geosmin and mib removal have been applied 13 among the various available removal methods ozonation 14 and activated carbon filtration 15 are most frequently applied for removal of these off flavor compounds from drinking water while effective for drinking water both methods are ineffective when used for treating organic rich water 16 21 with no effective geosmin and mib abatements methods available for treating organic rich water water exchange depuration is the only abatement method used in aquaculture systems this process is time consuming and depending on the duration of this depuration process requires substantial amounts of clean water 22 23 such excessive water usage as well as weight loss of the fish during the process 24 often lead to substantially higher production costs 25 biological removal of waterborne geosmin and mib has been studied to a limited extent removal of these off flavor compounds was observed in biological filters used in the drinking water industry 26 28 as well as in bacterial isolates 29 32 eaton and sandusky 30 reported on the degradation of geosmin by terpene degrading isolates pseudomonas sp sbr3 tpnb and rhodococcus wratislaviensis dlc cam while degradation of mib was reported for camphor degrading 29 and limonene degrading isolates 31 guttman and van rijn 32 reported on the isolation of three bacterial species rhodococcus variovorax and comamonas like species from the digestion basin of a pilot scale ras the latter isolates were able to grow on either geosmin or mib as sole carbon and energy sources as well as in the presence of other more available carbon sources in a follow up of the former study evidence was provided for geosmin and mib removal in the sludge layer of the digestion basin of the ras through a combination of adsorption and biodegradation 32 34 by means of incubation of sludge from the digestion basin in laboratory scale upflow reactor supplied with mib enriched ras water it was found that biodegradation accounted for 99 of the overall mib removal under steady state conditions 34 geosmin and mib enrichment of the sludge resulted in increased relative abundances of 12 distinct bacterial species many of which were denitrifiers 35 in the present study geosmin and mib removal from ras water was examined by use of an adsorption complex consisting of alginate and edible oil the geosmin and mib adsorption and biodegradation capacity of this hydrophobic complex was examined during batch incubation as well as during their incubation in plug flow reactors removal of mib by the reactors was successfully modelled by combining adsorption and first order bacterial degradation kinetics finally the taxonomical as well as functional characteristics of the microbial community on the carriers were examined during long term operation of plug flow reactors fed with geosmin and mib supplemented ras water 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of carriers alginate with a molecular mass of 60 70 kda containing 61 mannuronic acid and 39 guluronic acid sigma lv st louis mo usa was dissolved in distilled water 1 w w tween 80 sigma was added to the alginate solution at a final concentration of 1 w w soy oil 30 w w purchased at a local market was then added to the alginate tween solution carriers were obtained by dripping the solution into a stirred 1 w w solution of calcium chloride merck rehovot israel this procedure resulted in a spontaneous cross linking reaction that produced spherical carriers with an average diameter of about 4 mm the inclusion of oil resulted in numerous liquid sites of very tiny oil droplets embedded immobilized within the gel carriers and serving as sites for solubilization and adsorption of geosmin and mib 2 2 geosmin and mib removal by carriers during batch incubation incubation of the carriers was performed in duplicate in 120 ml pre sterilized air tight glass bottles at a concentration of 7 0 g carriers l 1 carriers wet weight 0 035 g l 1 were suspended in 100 ml of either autoclaved double distilled water ddw or autoclaved non filtered ras water ras water was derived from a fish basin of a zero discharge ras situated on campus 34 briefly the system consists of a fish basin from which water is led to two treatment steps 1 an aerobic trickling filter for nitrification of ammonia to nitrate and 2 an anaerobic digestion basin for digestion of organic matter and denitrification of nitrate to elemental nitrogen bottles were supplemented with geosmin or mib merck rehovot israel to a final concentration of 1 μg l 1 capped with butyl septa 20 mm supelco pa usa to avoid volatilization of geosmin and mib and incubated at room temperature for 24 h under gentle stirring to account for additional losses of geosmin and mib e g adsorption to septa headspace additional bottles without carriers were prepared in a similar fashion after 24 h of incubation 25 ml aliquots were aseptically withdrawn from each bottle for geosmin and mib analysis 2 3 plug flow reactors mib removal by the carriers was tested in 1 3 l cylindrical reactors diameter 7 5 cm ae fr40 aqua excell guangzhou china that were operated in an up flow mode for 6 weeks carriers 50 g were packed in small net bags and placed on top of a false bottom that was situated about 5 cm above the bottom of each reactor two reactors were fed with crude mib spiked ras water 1 μg mib l 1 using a peristaltic pump ism833c ismatec wertheim germany flow rate was set at 0 3 l h to yield a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 34 h in order to be able to distinguish between adsorption and bacterial degradation two additional reactors were operated with ras water supplemented with sodium azide 400 mg l 1 merck rehovot israel aliquots in duplicates for mib analysis were derived from the inlet and outlet ports of the reactors in an additional experimental run removal of geosmin and mib by the carriers was recorded over a period of 72 days four identical reactors similar to those described above containing 50 g of carriers were fed with crude ras water at a flow rate of 0 3 l h 1 hrt 4 34 h each reactor received ras water that was supplemented with either geosmin mib or methanol at a concentration of 1 μg l 1 each the methanol treatment was incorporated as a control since methanol is used as a solvent in commercial geosmin mib stock solutions reactors operated with unsupplemented ras water and reactors operated without carriers and fed with geosmin and mib supplemented ras water were used as additional controls periodically geosmin and mib as well as inorganic nitrogen were analyzed in the inlet and outlet of the reactors 2 4 model development in preliminary experiments geosmin and mib degrading bacteria were found to develop on the surface of the carriers with time hence for model development it was assumed that both adsorption desorption processes take place during the removal of mib by the carriers the equations of the model presented below augment those presented in 36 modelling of kinetics of removal from water by filtration was shown in the case of chemicals 37 38 bacteria 39 42 and recently for simultaneous removal of several cyanotoxins 43 the filtration model equations consider a solution containing several pollutants which reduce to eq 1 for a solution that includes a single pollutant e g mib whose molar concentration is c x t where x is a coordinate along the filter length and t is the time the model considers a cylindrical reactor with a cross section a and length l the reactor is filled with a sorbent carrier sites in this case whose molar concentration of adsorption sites is r0 the bottom and top of the filter are at the coordinates x 0 and x l respectively mib concentration at the inlet c0 is constant i e c x t c0 for x 0 where t denotes time 1 dc x t dt v c x t x c1 c x t r x t d1 rl x t in which rl x t is the concentration of occupied sites in eq 1 v denotes the flow velocity in the filter pores it is given by 2 v qv a f in which qv is the flow rate volume time and f is the fraction of pore volume out of the total volume of the filter r x t denotes the molar concentration of free adsorbing sites i e 3 r x t r0 rl x t c1 is the forward rate constant of adsorption m 1 min 1 and d1 min 1 is the rate constant of dissociation degradation of mib was assumed to occur by bacteria in the carriers according to eq 4 4 drl x t dt c1 c x t r x t d1 k rl x t in which k min 1 is the rate constant of sorbed mib degraded by the bacteria the use of first order degradation of mib enables a simple treatment whose adequacy was demonstrated in closed and open systems in dispersion 34 as in azaria et al 34 in which geosmin and mib removal by sludge in dispersion was modelled it was assumed that degradation of one mib molecule increases the number of free adsorption sites in the carriers by one for testing mass conservation of mib the concentration of degraded mib is given by db x t which is obtained by 5 ddb x t dt k rl x t the numerical solution of the above equations was essentially similar to that described in nir et al 36 37 who employed a taylor series expansion the program can yield the concentration of pollutants at any value of x and t and the total amounts in any layer of the filter mass conservation was tested for both the pollutant mib and adsorption sites the numerical solution of eqs 1 to 5 yielded in all cases a steady state i e for any filtered volumes after a given time the emerging concentration of mib and its adsorbed concentration remain constant whereas the mib is degraded at a constant rate the calculations required the knowledge of the quantities c0 which are known and r0 and the rate constants c1 d1 and k eqs 1 4 5 the total molar concentration of adsorption sites for mib sorption was determined from experiments in dispersion in the presence of azide under conditions of a relatively low concentration of sorbing material 1 g l 1 of carriers and a relatively high concentration of mib 20 μg l 1 then r0 was deduced for other concentrations of carriers as in nir et al 36 37 the filtration experiment in the presence of azide provided the parameters c1 and d1 at short and longer times respectively subsequently the parameter k the rate constant of degradation of mib was determined from filtration of water untreated by azide 2 5 metagenomic analyses following 72 days of operation the carriers were removed from the reactors and transferred to 50 ml sterile test tubes carriers were kept overnight at 20 c after removing excess water from the test tubes by centrifugation at 10 733 g for 5 min mpw 352r mpw med instruments warsaw poland the carriers were then freeze dried at 49 c loc 1 christ osterode am harz germany until complete dryness dna extraction from the freeze dried carriers was conducted using dneasy powerbiofilm kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacturer s protocol the extraction was conducted in triplicates i e three samples were taken from each treatment quantification and quality verification of the extracted dna were performed with a nanodrop spectrophotometer nd 1000 wilmington de usa pair end shotgun metagenome sequencing from gdna a total of 12 samples was conducted on an illumina hiseq2500 dna was sheared to 450bp this resulted in 12 668 016 pair end raw reads per sample on average p value 0 037 de novo assembly was performed using the spades assembler 44 on the concatenation of raw illumina reads from all samples 101 nt k mers automated annotations for each contig were generated using prokka 45 contigs shorter than 1000bp or shorter than 5000bp but without any annotation from prokka were removed from the assembly contigs were then mapped to the ncbi non redundant nucleotide database using blastn 46 only hits with e value 1e 8 and percent identity 50 or alignment length 1000bp were retained taxonomic summaries per read were obtained using megan s least common ancestor algorithm 47 and then summarized across all reads to create counts per taxon sample wise contig quantification was performed by mapping the raw reads from each individual sample to the contigs with bwa mem 48 and counting the number of reads mapped to each contig contig abundances were normalized to counts per million cpm for relative abundance differential contig abundance tests were computed with edger 49 50 on raw counts both as a multi group test over all treatment groups using edger s generalized linear models and as pairwise comparisons using exacttest raw reads were first merged into single long fragments using pear 51 and merged reads were mapped to the ncbi non redundant protein database using diamond 52 taxonomic summaries per read were obtained using megan s least common ancestor algorithm 47 and then summarized across all reads to create counts per taxon raw counts were normalized to counts per million cpm for relative abundance functional profiling was performed using super focus 53 with parameters a diamond db db 100 n 0 raw counts were normalized to counts per million cpm for relative abundance all original sequences generated by the illumina hiseq 2500 were deposited at the sequence read archive sra under the bioproject prjna689661 2 6 water quality analyses geosmin and mib were analyzed by means of the solid phase microextraction spme method as described by lloyd et al 54 samples 25 ml were supplemented with 6 g of nacl and incubated in crimp cap vials with a total volume of 40 ml vials were heated to 65 c in a water bath for 30 min hereafter spme fibers 50 30um dvb car pdms stableflex supelco bellefonte pa usa were manually injected through the teflon faced silicone septa supelco bellefonte pa usa of the airtight vials for headspace extraction of mib and or geosmin for 20 min the fibers were then injected for 1 5 min at 250 c into the splitless operated injector of a hp5890 palo alto ca usa gas chromatograph coupled to a flame ionized detector gc fid the gc was operated with an mdn 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m x25

and quantification of both off flavor compounds at concentrations exceeding 20 ng l 1 for inorganic nitrogen analyses water samples were collected in triplicate in 15 ml plastic test tubes filtered cellulose filter paper 8 μm pore size whatman pa usa and diluted with double distilled water as needed nitrate as no3 n was determined spectrophotometrically uv 165pc shimadzu japan according to apha 55 nitrite as no2 n was determined according to strickland and parsons 56 and total ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and nh4 n as described by bower and holm hansen 57 total organic carbon toc concentrations in the ras water was measured using a toc vcsh total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan as described by saadi et al 58 3 results 3 1 adsorption of off flavor compounds by carriers adsorption of the off flavor compounds by the carriers was examined during their incubation for 24 h in a batch mode fig 1 the results indicate very small removal efficiency without the carriers with the carriers a higher removal efficiency was found for geosmin the more hydrophobic of the two compounds fig 1 furthermore geosmin and mib removal efficiencies of the carriers differed only slightly between those incubated in either sterilized ras water total organic carbon content 38 2 5 mg l 1 or sterilized distilled water fig 1 3 2 modelling mib removal by carriers removal of mib from ras water was examined in plug flow reactors for a period of 6 weeks control reactors were operated in which biological activity was inhibited by azide while in the azide supplemented reactors mib removal ceased after 48 h of operation in non azide supplemented reactors a steady removal of 80 of the influent mib values was observed from 24 h until the end of the experimental period fig 2 the above findings suggest that both adsorption and biodegradation play a role in the mib removal by the carriers while most probably due to a saturation of the adsorption sites mib removal ceased in azide treated reactors a combination of adsorption and biological degradation allowed continued mib removal by the carriers in the non azide treated reactors a model was developed that accurately predicted the experimentally observed mib removal by the carriers table 1 it should be noted that the same model parameters materials methods equations 1 5 were used for all reactors degradation kinetics were included for calculation of mib removal in the reactors that operated without azide addition except for the first hour of operation the model produced a good fit with the observed mib removal by the reactors the lower than predicted experimentally determined mib concentrations after 30 min and 60 min of operation were probably a result of a physical rearrangement of the carriers upon initiation of the water flow through the reactors after one week of operation only non azide treated reactors were sampled for an additional 5 weeks a removal of more than 80 of the supplemented mib was observed at all sampling times with a good fit to values predicted by the model table 1 it is remarkable that the model prediction at 24 h was adequate to yield 19 remaining concentrations of mib after 1 6 weeks during which the experimental values fluctuated around the predicted value 3 3 removal of geosmin mib and inorganic nitrogen by plug flow reactors reactors fed with geosmin and mib supplemented ras water were operated for 72 days during this period each reactor treated approximately 0 52 m3 of crude ras water removal of geosmin and mib by the carriers was evident from the onset of the experiment with 82 8 and 71 5 removal efficiency at day 1 for geosmin and mib respectively fig 3 hereafter geosmin and mib removal efficiencies ranged from 65 9 to 90 1 and 64 6 90 4 respectively in reactors without carriers only minor changes between inlet and outlet geosmin and mib concentrations were detected during the first ten days of operation fig 3 in order to avoid geosmin and mib production under aerobic conditions 6 anoxic conditions within the reactors were obtained by operating them at relatively long hydraulic retention times 4 3 h under these conditions a significant nitrate reduction was observed in all reactors with average nitrate removal rates of 4 86 mg no3 n g carriers 1 day 1 in the control reactors and 6 29 6 87 5 16 mg no3 n g carriers 1 day 1 in reactors fed with mib geosmin and methanol respectively fig 4 the production of nitrite was evident in all reactors after 2 days of operation with mean inlet nitrite concentrations of 0 73 0 07 mg no2 n l 1 and mean outlet concentrations of 6 13 6 01 5 66 and 5 48 mg no2 n l 1 in the mib geosmin and methanol supplemented and the control reactors respectively supplementary fig 1 hereafter the nitrite outlet concentrations decreased gradually until no significant differences between inlet and outlet could be detected after day 10 supplementary fig 1 the observed nitrate removal and temporary nitrite accumulation pointed to denitrification activity in the reactors such activity was further supported by the finding that the ph increased during the filtration process average inlet ph values ranged from 6 91 to 7 70 while outlet ph values were higher and ranged from 7 1 to 8 32 from day 1 onward supplementary fig 1 no significant differences were detected between inlet and outlet ammonia concentrations supplementary fig 1 3 4 taxonomical and functional changes in the microbial community structure microbial communities were made up primarily of bacteria with negligible contributions by archaea and eukaryotes proteobacteria comprised by far the most dominant phylum in all treatments and their relative abundance remained constant at 80 82 of reads for all treatments supplementary fig 2 additional phyla in order of their relative abundance were bacteroidetes 5 4 6 0 firmicutes 3 2 3 4 and actinobacteria 2 2 2 8 when proteobacteria were inspected at the class level no significant differences in relative abundance were found between the different treatments fig 5 betaproteobacteria were most prevalent 36 7 41 5 in the mib geosmin methanol and control treatments with no significant differences between treatments they were followed by gammaproteobacteria 22 9 25 5 and alphaproteobacteria 17 1 22 1 fig 5 the ten most dominant species in the various treatments are summarized in table 2 the most prominent species in all treatments was pseudomonas aeruginosa with a relative abundance between 6 0 6 9 in the various treatments followed by alicycliphilus denitrificans 2 7 4 2 burkholderia pseudomallei 2 9 3 3 and comamonas granuli 2 3 2 4 no significant differences were found in the relative abundance of these ten most dominant species between treatments with respect to functional changes the assembly of the metagenomes resulted in 68 090 contigs with a total length of 746 mbp which harbored 697 265 annotated genes genes encoding for enzymes involved in terpene degradation were detected in all samples totaling 1200 0 16 unique gene copies in the metagenomes whereas the frequency of these genes was higher in the mib treated reactor 15 837 reads per million no significant differences were found between this treatment and geosmin treated 11 638 methanol treated 14 400 and control 13 494 reactors fig 6 furthermore it was found fig 6 that the majority of these genes were closely related to monoterpene epsilon lactone hydrolase between 35 2 41 8 of the total terpene degradation genes that were detected in the samples derived from the various treatments limonene 1 2 monooxygenase between 26 4 29 3 and limonene hydroxylase between19 8 and 21 8 additional genes involved in terpene degradation were fig 6 linalool 8 monooxygenase between 0 9 2 0 cytochrome p 450terp between 1 5 and 2 1 trans carveol dehydrogenase between 3 4 and 4 7 and genes involved in the degradation of camphor cam operon between 5 6 and 6 1 differential abundance analyses of contigs encoding for terpene degradation resulted in significant higher frequencies of 21 contigs in the geosmin and mib treatments as compared to the control treatments these contigs could be affiliated with 11 bacterial genera three of the contigs allowed for taxonomic assignment at the species level table 3 compared to controls and the geosmin supplemented reactors 10 contigs were significantly more abundant in the carriers harvested from the mib supplemented reactors these latter contigs harbored the following genes limonene 1 2 monooxygenase acidovorax sp js42 rhizobiales spp 6 oxocamphor hydrolase actinobacteria spp monoterpene epsilon lactone hydrolase anaerolinea thermophila linalool 8 monooxygenase bacteroidetes spp putidaredoxin reductase betaproteobacteria spp thauera sp linalool dehydratase isomerase rhizobiales spp and 5 oxo hydroxycamphor dehydrogenase unassigned for geosmin eight contigs with terpene degradation genes were significantly more abundant as compared to carriers from the controls and the mib supplemented reactors two contigs with genes encoding for limonene hydroxylase azoarcus sp deltaproteobacteria spp and an additional six contigs with genes limonene 1 2 monooxygenase limonene 1 2 epoxide hydrolase putidaredoxin reductase cytochrome p 450terp and linalool dehydratase isomerase that were affiliated with a single species parvibaculum lavamentivorans as compared to carriers from the control reactors four additional contigs were enriched in carriers derived from both the geosmin and mib supplemented reactors and contained genes annotated as linalool 8 monooxygenase burkholderiales spp limonene 1 2 monooxygenase thauera aminoaromatica mz1t limonene hydroxylase unassigned and monoterpene epsilon lactone hydrolase unassigned 4 discussion in this study a hydrophobic complex was formed by addition of edible oil to alginate gels edible oil was chosen due to its ability to be included in a very highproportion within a gel 59 furthermore the nature of oil as a fluid at ambient temperatures and the easy ability of its emulsification favored the choice for this hydrophobic complex it was found that the presence of organic matter in ras water only slightly reduced the geosmin and mib adsorption capacity of the complex similar to earlier studies with sludge derived from a ras 34 a combination of adsorption and biodegradation was found to underlie the removal of these compounds by the carriers based on geosmin and mib removal characteristics of the carriers and on the successful simulation of mib removal by the carriers we concluded that removal rates of the off flavor compounds by the carriers are dictated by the rate at which the adsorption sites occupied by either geosmin or mib are freed up through bacterial degradation of these compounds in the reactors examined in this study when a steady state was reached after about one day outlet geosmin and mib concentrations were 80 90 of the inlet concentrations at steady state long term operation of the reactors supplemented with geosmin and mib resulted in a significant increase in the abundance of 21 contigs with terpene degradation genes it should be noted that these contigs were associated with only a tiny fraction 0 001 of the total bacterial community three contigs allowed for taxonomic assignment at the species level while no information is available for terpene degradation by anaerolinea thermophile reports are available for terpene degradation by the other two species parvibaculum lavamentivorans and thauera aminoaromatica mz1t the former species harbored as much as six different contigs that contained genes associated with the degradation of monoterpenes table 3 surprisingly enrichment of contigs with these monoterpene degrading genes was only evident in the geosmin treated samples and not in the mib a monoterpene treated sample schleheck et al 60 reported on the presence of more than 50 enzyme coding genes related to terpenes degradation in the genome of p lavamentivorans in the latter study it was found that despite the abundance of these latter genes incubation of this isolate with common monoterpenes resulted in no growth 60 growth of this isolate on geosmin or mib was not examined in the latter study nor in other studies an additional contig affiliated with thauera aminoaromatica mz1t harbored a gene encoding for limonene 1 2 monooxygenase an nadh dependent oxidoreductase enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of an oxygen atom into inactive c h bonds of limonene 61 strains belonging to the thauera genus were found to be capable of utilizing monoterpenes under denitrifying conditions 62 63 it should be noted that also in a previous study 35 a high relative abundance of thauera was found in geosmin and mib enrichment sludge from the same ras examined in the present study while geosmin and mib supplementation resulted in the enrichment of specific contigs with terpene degradation genes the total number of contigs with genes associated with terpene degradation was not influenced by geosmin and mib supplementation this finding suggested that additional terpene like compounds were present in the ras water limonene is an additive in fish feed formulas 64 65 as such its presence in the feed might explain why many contigs including geosmin and mib enriched contigs contained genes affiliated with the limonene degradation pathway degradation of limonene a monocyclic monoterpene has been linked to geosmin and mib degradation eaton 31 showed that two limonene degrading bacteria were capable of metabolizing mib into odorless products after induction of enzymatic activity with limonene camphor degrading bacteria 29 and terpinene degrading bacteria 30 are additional terpene degraders found capable of geosmin and mib degradation these bacteria also require an enzymatic inducer for initiation of geosmin and mib degradation supply of the reactors with nitrate rich ras water resulted in nitrate removal in all reactors fig 4 of the ten most dominant species that developed during the operation of the reactors eight are known to be capable of denitrification namely alicycliphilus denitrificans 66 burkholderia pseudomallei 67 comamonas granuli 68 shinella sp dd12 69 and azospira oryzae 70 pseudomonas aeruginosa 71 and pseudomonas stutzeri 72 in summary it was demonstrated that by means of oil containing alginate carriers geosmin and mib could be effectively removed from organic rich water of a recirculating aquaculture system removal by the carriers took place through adsorption of the hydrophobic off flavor compounds and their subsequent biodegradation by bacterial communities on their surface long term operation of reactors containing the carriers for treatment of ras water with relatively low geosmin and mib concentrations revealed enrichment of the carriers with microorganisms associated with terpene degradation in addition denitrifiers were among the most abundant microorganisms developing on the carriers during such long term operation declaration of competing interest the authors

13434,hydrophobic carriers were examined for geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol removal from water derived from an aquaculture system a combination of adsorption and biodegradation was found to underlie the removal of the off flavor compounds adsorption of these compounds by the carriers was unaffected by the presence of organic matter in the water to be treated a model based on adsorption desorption and first order degradation kinetics provided an accurate prediction for experimentally determined 2 methylisoborneol removal rates steady removal of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol as well as nitrate reduction were observed during long term operation of the plug flow reactors with water derived from an aquaculture facility metagenomic analysis of the microbial community on the carriers during long term operation of the reactors revealed a predominance of denitrifying bacteria it was found that geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol led to statistically significant changes in the abundances of 21 contigs that contained genes involved in terpene degradation this study shows that at low ambient concentrations of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol in nitrate and organic rich water such as found in aquaculture systems their biodegradation can be accomplished by terpene degrading denitrifiers that develop on hydrophobic carriers used for filtration of the contaminated water keywords adsorption biodegradation geosmin hydrophobic carriers 2 methylisoborneol microbial community structure 1 introduction due to overfishing global fisheries supplies continue to stabilize and even decline 1 this together with the growing demand for seafood has led to a rapid expansion of aquaculture in the last decades 2 by virtue of their compact design and with their efficient use of water resources recirculating aquaculture systems ras are considered a promising alternative for the more conventional aquaculture systems 3 with the development of these systems it has become increasingly apparent that off flavor of fish produced in ras is a major obstacle for their further expansion 4 6 the most common off flavor agents in fish culture systems are geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib in ras these secondary metabolites are predominantly produced by bacteria in both freshwater 7 8 and seawater systems 9 10 when present in the culture water these hydrophobic off flavor compounds rapidly accumulate in the fatty tissues of the fish and taint them with an earthy muddy taste and aroma affected fish become unmarketable even when containing very low concentrations of geosmin and mib 11 12 due to an increased public awareness of drinking water quality it is mainly in the drinking water industry that methods for geosmin and mib removal have been applied 13 among the various available removal methods ozonation 14 and activated carbon filtration 15 are most frequently applied for removal of these off flavor compounds from drinking water while effective for drinking water both methods are ineffective when used for treating organic rich water 16 21 with no effective geosmin and mib abatements methods available for treating organic rich water water exchange depuration is the only abatement method used in aquaculture systems this process is time consuming and depending on the duration of this depuration process requires substantial amounts of clean water 22 23 such excessive water usage as well as weight loss of the fish during the process 24 often lead to substantially higher production costs 25 biological removal of waterborne geosmin and mib has been studied to a limited extent removal of these off flavor compounds was observed in biological filters used in the drinking water industry 26 28 as well as in bacterial isolates 29 32 eaton and sandusky 30 reported on the degradation of geosmin by terpene degrading isolates pseudomonas sp sbr3 tpnb and rhodococcus wratislaviensis dlc cam while degradation of mib was reported for camphor degrading 29 and limonene degrading isolates 31 guttman and van rijn 32 reported on the isolation of three bacterial species rhodococcus variovorax and comamonas like species from the digestion basin of a pilot scale ras the latter isolates were able to grow on either geosmin or mib as sole carbon and energy sources as well as in the presence of other more available carbon sources in a follow up of the former study evidence was provided for geosmin and mib removal in the sludge layer of the digestion basin of the ras through a combination of adsorption and biodegradation 32 34 by means of incubation of sludge from the digestion basin in laboratory scale upflow reactor supplied with mib enriched ras water it was found that biodegradation accounted for 99 of the overall mib removal under steady state conditions 34 geosmin and mib enrichment of the sludge resulted in increased relative abundances of 12 distinct bacterial species many of which were denitrifiers 35 in the present study geosmin and mib removal from ras water was examined by use of an adsorption complex consisting of alginate and edible oil the geosmin and mib adsorption and biodegradation capacity of this hydrophobic complex was examined during batch incubation as well as during their incubation in plug flow reactors removal of mib by the reactors was successfully modelled by combining adsorption and first order bacterial degradation kinetics finally the taxonomical as well as functional characteristics of the microbial community on the carriers were examined during long term operation of plug flow reactors fed with geosmin and mib supplemented ras water 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of carriers alginate with a molecular mass of 60 70 kda containing 61 mannuronic acid and 39 guluronic acid sigma lv st louis mo usa was dissolved in distilled water 1 w w tween 80 sigma was added to the alginate solution at a final concentration of 1 w w soy oil 30 w w purchased at a local market was then added to the alginate tween solution carriers were obtained by dripping the solution into a stirred 1 w w solution of calcium chloride merck rehovot israel this procedure resulted in a spontaneous cross linking reaction that produced spherical carriers with an average diameter of about 4 mm the inclusion of oil resulted in numerous liquid sites of very tiny oil droplets embedded immobilized within the gel carriers and serving as sites for solubilization and adsorption of geosmin and mib 2 2 geosmin and mib removal by carriers during batch incubation incubation of the carriers was performed in duplicate in 120 ml pre sterilized air tight glass bottles at a concentration of 7 0 g carriers l 1 carriers wet weight 0 035 g l 1 were suspended in 100 ml of either autoclaved double distilled water ddw or autoclaved non filtered ras water ras water was derived from a fish basin of a zero discharge ras situated on campus 34 briefly the system consists of a fish basin from which water is led to two treatment steps 1 an aerobic trickling filter for nitrification of ammonia to nitrate and 2 an anaerobic digestion basin for digestion of organic matter and denitrification of nitrate to elemental nitrogen bottles were supplemented with geosmin or mib merck rehovot israel to a final concentration of 1 μg l 1 capped with butyl septa 20 mm supelco pa usa to avoid volatilization of geosmin and mib and incubated at room temperature for 24 h under gentle stirring to account for additional losses of geosmin and mib e g adsorption to septa headspace additional bottles without carriers were prepared in a similar fashion after 24 h of incubation 25 ml aliquots were aseptically withdrawn from each bottle for geosmin and mib analysis 2 3 plug flow reactors mib removal by the carriers was tested in 1 3 l cylindrical reactors diameter 7 5 cm ae fr40 aqua excell guangzhou china that were operated in an up flow mode for 6 weeks carriers 50 g were packed in small net bags and placed on top of a false bottom that was situated about 5 cm above the bottom of each reactor two reactors were fed with crude mib spiked ras water 1 μg mib l 1 using a peristaltic pump ism833c ismatec wertheim germany flow rate was set at 0 3 l h to yield a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 34 h in order to be able to distinguish between adsorption and bacterial degradation two additional reactors were operated with ras water supplemented with sodium azide 400 mg l 1 merck rehovot israel aliquots in duplicates for mib analysis were derived from the inlet and outlet ports of the reactors in an additional experimental run removal of geosmin and mib by the carriers was recorded over a period of 72 days four identical reactors similar to those described above containing 50 g of carriers were fed with crude ras water at a flow rate of 0 3 l h 1 hrt 4 34 h each reactor received ras water that was supplemented with either geosmin mib or methanol at a concentration of 1 μg l 1 each the methanol treatment was incorporated as a control since methanol is used as a solvent in commercial geosmin mib stock solutions reactors operated with unsupplemented ras water and reactors operated without carriers and fed with geosmin and mib supplemented ras water were used as additional controls periodically geosmin and mib as well as inorganic nitrogen were analyzed in the inlet and outlet of the reactors 2 4 model development in preliminary experiments geosmin and mib degrading bacteria were found to develop on the surface of the carriers with time hence for model development it was assumed that both adsorption desorption processes take place during the removal of mib by the carriers the equations of the model presented below augment those presented in 36 modelling of kinetics of removal from water by filtration was shown in the case of chemicals 37 38 bacteria 39 42 and recently for simultaneous removal of several cyanotoxins 43 the filtration model equations consider a solution containing several pollutants which reduce to eq 1 for a solution that includes a single pollutant e g mib whose molar concentration is c x t where x is a coordinate along the filter length and t is the time the model considers a cylindrical reactor with a cross section a and length l the reactor is filled with a sorbent carrier sites in this case whose molar concentration of adsorption sites is r0 the bottom and top of the filter are at the coordinates x 0 and x l respectively mib concentration at the inlet c0 is constant i e c x t c0 for x 0 where t denotes time 1 dc x t dt v c x t x c1 c x t r x t d1 rl x t in which rl x t is the concentration of occupied sites in eq 1 v denotes the flow velocity in the filter pores it is given by 2 v qv a f in which qv is the flow rate volume time and f is the fraction of pore volume out of the total volume of the filter r x t denotes the molar concentration of free adsorbing sites i e 3 r x t r0 rl x t c1 is the forward rate constant of adsorption m 1 min 1 and d1 min 1 is the rate constant of dissociation degradation of mib was assumed to occur by bacteria in the carriers according to eq 4 4 drl x t dt c1 c x t r x t d1 k rl x t in which k min 1 is the rate constant of sorbed mib degraded by the bacteria the use of first order degradation of mib enables a simple treatment whose adequacy was demonstrated in closed and open systems in dispersion 34 as in azaria et al 34 in which geosmin and mib removal by sludge in dispersion was modelled it was assumed that degradation of one mib molecule increases the number of free adsorption sites in the carriers by one for testing mass conservation of mib the concentration of degraded mib is given by db x t which is obtained by 5 ddb x t dt k rl x t the numerical solution of the above equations was essentially similar to that described in nir et al 36 37 who employed a taylor series expansion the program can yield the concentration of pollutants at any value of x and t and the total amounts in any layer of the filter mass conservation was tested for both the pollutant mib and adsorption sites the numerical solution of eqs 1 to 5 yielded in all cases a steady state i e for any filtered volumes after a given time the emerging concentration of mib and its adsorbed concentration remain constant whereas the mib is degraded at a constant rate the calculations required the knowledge of the quantities c0 which are known and r0 and the rate constants c1 d1 and k eqs 1 4 5 the total molar concentration of adsorption sites for mib sorption was determined from experiments in dispersion in the presence of azide under conditions of a relatively low concentration of sorbing material 1 g l 1 of carriers and a relatively high concentration of mib 20 μg l 1 then r0 was deduced for other concentrations of carriers as in nir et al 36 37 the filtration experiment in the presence of azide provided the parameters c1 and d1 at short and longer times respectively subsequently the parameter k the rate constant of degradation of mib was determined from filtration of water untreated by azide 2 5 metagenomic analyses following 72 days of operation the carriers were removed from the reactors and transferred to 50 ml sterile test tubes carriers were kept overnight at 20 c after removing excess water from the test tubes by centrifugation at 10 733 g for 5 min mpw 352r mpw med instruments warsaw poland the carriers were then freeze dried at 49 c loc 1 christ osterode am harz germany until complete dryness dna extraction from the freeze dried carriers was conducted using dneasy powerbiofilm kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacturer s protocol the extraction was conducted in triplicates i e three samples were taken from each treatment quantification and quality verification of the extracted dna were performed with a nanodrop spectrophotometer nd 1000 wilmington de usa pair end shotgun metagenome sequencing from gdna a total of 12 samples was conducted on an illumina hiseq2500 dna was sheared to 450bp this resulted in 12 668 016 pair end raw reads per sample on average p value 0 037 de novo assembly was performed using the spades assembler 44 on the concatenation of raw illumina reads from all samples 101 nt k mers automated annotations for each contig were generated using prokka 45 contigs shorter than 1000bp or shorter than 5000bp but without any annotation from prokka were removed from the assembly contigs were then mapped to the ncbi non redundant nucleotide database using blastn 46 only hits with e value 1e 8 and percent identity 50 or alignment length 1000bp were retained taxonomic summaries per read were obtained using megan s least common ancestor algorithm 47 and then summarized across all reads to create counts per taxon sample wise contig quantification was performed by mapping the raw reads from each individual sample to the contigs with bwa mem 48 and counting the number of reads mapped to each contig contig abundances were normalized to counts per million cpm for relative abundance differential contig abundance tests were computed with edger 49 50 on raw counts both as a multi group test over all treatment groups using edger s generalized linear models and as pairwise comparisons using exacttest raw reads were first merged into single long fragments using pear 51 and merged reads were mapped to the ncbi non redundant protein database using diamond 52 taxonomic summaries per read were obtained using megan s least common ancestor algorithm 47 and then summarized across all reads to create counts per taxon raw counts were normalized to counts per million cpm for relative abundance functional profiling was performed using super focus 53 with parameters a diamond db db 100 n 0 raw counts were normalized to counts per million cpm for relative abundance all original sequences generated by the illumina hiseq 2500 were deposited at the sequence read archive sra under the bioproject prjna689661 2 6 water quality analyses geosmin and mib were analyzed by means of the solid phase microextraction spme method as described by lloyd et al 54 samples 25 ml were supplemented with 6 g of nacl and incubated in crimp cap vials with a total volume of 40 ml vials were heated to 65 c in a water bath for 30 min hereafter spme fibers 50 30um dvb car pdms stableflex supelco bellefonte pa usa were manually injected through the teflon faced silicone septa supelco bellefonte pa usa of the airtight vials for headspace extraction of mib and or geosmin for 20 min the fibers were then injected for 1 5 min at 250 c into the splitless operated injector of a hp5890 palo alto ca usa gas chromatograph coupled to a flame ionized detector gc fid the gc was operated with an mdn 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m x25 mm of 0 25 μm film thickness supelco bellefonte pa usa helium was used as a carrier gas at constant flow rate of 1 ml min 1 oven temperature was held at 60 c for 0 5 min from injection increased to 100 c at 30 c min 1 followed by an increase to 185 c at 20 c min 1 and to 250 c at 40 c min 1 and this temperature was held for 2 3 min fid temperature was 280 c the above method allowed for detection and quantification of both off flavor compounds at concentrations exceeding 20 ng l 1 for inorganic nitrogen analyses water samples were collected in triplicate in 15 ml plastic test tubes filtered cellulose filter paper 8 μm pore size whatman pa usa and diluted with double distilled water as needed nitrate as no3 n was determined spectrophotometrically uv 165pc shimadzu japan according to apha 55 nitrite as no2 n was determined according to strickland and parsons 56 and total ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and nh4 n as described by bower and holm hansen 57 total organic carbon toc concentrations in the ras water was measured using a toc vcsh total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan as described by saadi et al 58 3 results 3 1 adsorption of off flavor compounds by carriers adsorption of the off flavor compounds by the carriers was examined during their incubation for 24 h in a batch mode fig 1 the results indicate very small removal efficiency without the carriers with the carriers a higher removal efficiency was found for geosmin the more hydrophobic of the two compounds fig 1 furthermore geosmin and mib removal efficiencies of the carriers differed only slightly between those incubated in either sterilized ras water total organic carbon content 38 2 5 mg l 1 or sterilized distilled water fig 1 3 2 modelling mib removal by carriers removal of mib from ras water was examined in plug flow reactors for a period of 6 weeks control reactors were operated in which biological activity was inhibited by azide while in the azide supplemented reactors mib removal ceased after 48 h of operation in non azide supplemented reactors a steady removal of 80 of the influent mib values was observed from 24 h until the end of the experimental period fig 2 the above findings suggest that both adsorption and biodegradation play a role in the mib removal by the carriers while most probably due to a saturation of the adsorption sites mib removal ceased in azide treated reactors a combination of adsorption and biological degradation allowed continued mib removal by the carriers in the non azide treated reactors a model was developed that accurately predicted the experimentally observed mib removal by the carriers table 1 it should be noted that the same model parameters materials methods equations 1 5 were used for all reactors degradation kinetics were included for calculation of mib removal in the reactors that operated without azide addition except for the first hour of operation the model produced a good fit with the observed mib removal by the reactors the lower than predicted experimentally determined mib concentrations after 30 min and 60 min of operation were probably a result of a physical rearrangement of the carriers upon initiation of the water flow through the reactors after one week of operation only non azide treated reactors were sampled for an additional 5 weeks a removal of more than 80 of the supplemented mib was observed at all sampling times with a good fit to values predicted by the model table 1 it is remarkable that the model prediction at 24 h was adequate to yield 19 remaining concentrations of mib after 1 6 weeks during which the experimental values fluctuated around the predicted value 3 3 removal of geosmin mib and inorganic nitrogen by plug flow reactors reactors fed with geosmin and mib supplemented ras water were operated for 72 days during this period each reactor treated approximately 0 52 m3 of crude ras water removal of geosmin and mib by the carriers was evident from the onset of the experiment with 82 8 and 71 5 removal efficiency at day 1 for geosmin and mib respectively fig 3 hereafter geosmin and mib removal efficiencies ranged from 65 9 to 90 1 and 64 6 90 4 respectively in reactors without carriers only minor changes between inlet and outlet geosmin and mib concentrations were detected during the first ten days of operation fig 3 in order to avoid geosmin and mib production under aerobic conditions 6 anoxic conditions within the reactors were obtained by operating them at relatively long hydraulic retention times 4 3 h under these conditions a significant nitrate reduction was observed in all reactors with average nitrate removal rates of 4 86 mg no3 n g carriers 1 day 1 in the control reactors and 6 29 6 87 5 16 mg no3 n g carriers 1 day 1 in reactors fed with mib geosmin and methanol respectively fig 4 the production of nitrite was evident in all reactors after 2 days of operation with mean inlet nitrite concentrations of 0 73 0 07 mg no2 n l 1 and mean outlet concentrations of 6 13 6 01 5 66 and 5 48 mg no2 n l 1 in the mib geosmin and methanol supplemented and the control reactors respectively supplementary fig 1 hereafter the nitrite outlet concentrations decreased gradually until no significant differences between inlet and outlet could be detected after day 10 supplementary fig 1 the observed nitrate removal and temporary nitrite accumulation pointed to denitrification activity in the reactors such activity was further supported by the finding that the ph increased during the filtration process average inlet ph values ranged from 6 91 to 7 70 while outlet ph values were higher and ranged from 7 1 to 8 32 from day 1 onward supplementary fig 1 no significant differences were detected between inlet and outlet ammonia concentrations supplementary fig 1 3 4 taxonomical and functional changes in the microbial community structure microbial communities were made up primarily of bacteria with negligible contributions by archaea and eukaryotes proteobacteria comprised by far the most dominant phylum in all treatments and their relative abundance remained constant at 80 82 of reads for all treatments supplementary fig 2 additional phyla in order of their relative abundance were bacteroidetes 5 4 6 0 firmicutes 3 2 3 4 and actinobacteria 2 2 2 8 when proteobacteria were inspected at the class level no significant differences in relative abundance were found between the different treatments fig 5 betaproteobacteria were most prevalent 36 7 41 5 in the mib geosmin methanol and control treatments with no significant differences between treatments they were followed by gammaproteobacteria 22 9 25 5 and alphaproteobacteria 17 1 22 1 fig 5 the ten most dominant species in the various treatments are summarized in table 2 the most prominent species in all treatments was pseudomonas aeruginosa with a relative abundance between 6 0 6 9 in the various treatments followed by alicycliphilus denitrificans 2 7 4 2 burkholderia pseudomallei 2 9 3 3 and comamonas granuli 2 3 2 4 no significant differences were found in the relative abundance of these ten most dominant species between treatments with respect to functional changes the assembly of the metagenomes resulted in 68 090 contigs with a total length of 746 mbp which harbored 697 265 annotated genes genes encoding for enzymes involved in terpene degradation were detected in all samples totaling 1200 0 16 unique gene copies in the metagenomes whereas the frequency of these genes was higher in the mib treated reactor 15 837 reads per million no significant differences were found between this treatment and geosmin treated 11 638 methanol treated 14 400 and control 13 494 reactors fig 6 furthermore it was found fig 6 that the majority of these genes were closely related to monoterpene epsilon lactone hydrolase between 35 2 41 8 of the total terpene degradation genes that were detected in the samples derived from the various treatments limonene 1 2 monooxygenase between 26 4 29 3 and limonene hydroxylase between19 8 and 21 8 additional genes involved in terpene degradation were fig 6 linalool 8 monooxygenase between 0 9 2 0 cytochrome p 450terp between 1 5 and 2 1 trans carveol dehydrogenase between 3 4 and 4 7 and genes involved in the degradation of camphor cam operon between 5 6 and 6 1 differential abundance analyses of contigs encoding for terpene degradation resulted in significant higher frequencies of 21 contigs in the geosmin and mib treatments as compared to the control treatments these contigs could be affiliated with 11 bacterial genera three of the contigs allowed for taxonomic assignment at the species level table 3 compared to controls and the geosmin supplemented reactors 10 contigs were significantly more abundant in the carriers harvested from the mib supplemented reactors these latter contigs harbored the following genes limonene 1 2 monooxygenase acidovorax sp js42

betaproteobacteria spp thauera sp linalool dehydratase isomerase rhizobiales spp and 5 oxo hydroxycamphor dehydrogenase unassigned for geosmin eight contigs with terpene degradation genes were significantly more abundant as compared to carriers from the controls and the mib supplemented reactors two contigs with genes encoding for limonene hydroxylase azoarcus sp deltaproteobacteria spp and an additional six contigs with genes limonene 1 2 monooxygenase limonene 1 2 epoxide hydrolase putidaredoxin reductase cytochrome p 450terp and linalool dehydratase isomerase that were affiliated with a single species parvibaculum lavamentivorans as compared to carriers from the control reactors four additional contigs were enriched in carriers derived from both the geosmin and mib supplemented reactors and contained genes annotated as linalool 8 monooxygenase burkholderiales spp limonene 1 2 monooxygenase thauera aminoaromatica mz1t limonene hydroxylase unassigned and monoterpene epsilon lactone hydrolase unassigned 4 discussion in this study a hydrophobic complex was formed by addition of edible oil to alginate gels edible oil was chosen due to its ability to be included in a very highproportion within a gel 59 furthermore the nature of oil as a fluid at ambient temperatures and the easy ability of its emulsification favored the choice for this hydrophobic complex it was found that the presence of organic matter in ras water only slightly reduced the geosmin and mib adsorption capacity of the complex similar to earlier studies with sludge derived from a ras 34 a combination of adsorption and biodegradation was found to underlie the removal of these compounds by the carriers based on geosmin and mib removal characteristics of the carriers and on the successful simulation of mib removal by the carriers we concluded that removal rates of the off flavor compounds by the carriers are dictated by the rate at which the adsorption sites occupied by either geosmin or mib are freed up through bacterial degradation of these compounds in the reactors examined in this study when a steady state was reached after about one day outlet geosmin and mib concentrations were 80 90 of the inlet concentrations at steady state long term operation of the reactors supplemented with geosmin and mib resulted in a significant increase in the abundance of 21 contigs with terpene degradation genes it should be noted that these contigs were associated with only a tiny fraction 0 001 of the total bacterial community three contigs allowed for taxonomic assignment at the species level while no information is available for terpene degradation by anaerolinea thermophile reports are available for terpene degradation by the other two species parvibaculum lavamentivorans and thauera aminoaromatica mz1t the former species harbored as much as six different contigs that contained genes associated with the degradation of monoterpenes table 3 surprisingly enrichment of contigs with these monoterpene degrading genes was only evident in the geosmin treated samples and not in the mib a monoterpene treated sample schleheck et al 60 reported on the presence of more than 50 enzyme coding genes related to terpenes degradation in the genome of p lavamentivorans in the latter study it was found that despite the abundance of these latter genes incubation of this isolate with common monoterpenes resulted in no growth 60 growth of this isolate on geosmin or mib was not examined in the latter study nor in other studies an additional contig affiliated with thauera aminoaromatica mz1t harbored a gene encoding for limonene 1 2 monooxygenase an nadh dependent oxidoreductase enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of an oxygen atom into inactive c h bonds of limonene 61 strains belonging to the thauera genus were found to be capable of utilizing monoterpenes under denitrifying conditions 62 63 it should be noted that also in a previous study 35 a high relative abundance of thauera was found in geosmin and mib enrichment sludge from the same ras examined in the present study while geosmin and mib supplementation resulted in the enrichment of specific contigs with terpene degradation genes the total number of contigs with genes associated with terpene degradation was not influenced by geosmin and mib supplementation this finding suggested that additional terpene like compounds were present in the ras water limonene is an additive in fish feed formulas 64 65 as such its presence in the feed might explain why many contigs including geosmin and mib enriched contigs contained genes affiliated with the limonene degradation pathway degradation of limonene a monocyclic monoterpene has been linked to geosmin and mib degradation eaton 31 showed that two limonene degrading bacteria were capable of metabolizing mib into odorless products after induction of enzymatic activity with limonene camphor degrading bacteria 29 and terpinene degrading bacteria 30 are additional terpene degraders found capable of geosmin and mib degradation these bacteria also require an enzymatic inducer for initiation of geosmin and mib degradation supply of the reactors with nitrate rich ras water resulted in nitrate removal in all reactors fig 4 of the ten most dominant species that developed during the operation of the reactors eight are known to be capable of denitrification namely alicycliphilus denitrificans 66 burkholderia pseudomallei 67 comamonas granuli 68 shinella sp dd12 69 and azospira oryzae 70 pseudomonas aeruginosa 71 and pseudomonas stutzeri 72 in summary it was demonstrated that by means of oil containing alginate carriers geosmin and mib could be effectively removed from organic rich water of a recirculating aquaculture system removal by the carriers took place through adsorption of the hydrophobic off flavor compounds and their subsequent biodegradation by bacterial communities on their surface long term operation of reactors containing the carriers for treatment of ras water with relatively low geosmin and mib concentrations revealed enrichment of the carriers with microorganisms associated with terpene degradation in addition denitrifiers were among the most abundant microorganisms developing on the carriers during such long term operation declaration of competing interest the authors
