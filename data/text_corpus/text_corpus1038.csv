5190,intertidal sediments host many biogeochemical processes which drastically affect coastal ecosystems dissolved oxygen do plays a major role in many of these biogeochemical reactions and is of primary importance for intertidal groundwater quality groundwater level of intertidal zone fluctuates regularly corresponding to the tidal cycle during the fluctuation of water table the oxygen rich air could be entrapped in the pore space of sediments and hence serve as an important oxygen source to replenish oxygen depleted groundwater although oxygenation enhanced by fluctuated water table has been studied in river banks no study has been conducted in ocean intertidal sediments under tide induced groundwater table fluctuations and quantification of interphase oxygen mass transfer is lacking in this study combined laboratory experimental and numerical modeling approach is developed to study the mechanism of oxygenation of aquifers with regularly fluctuated water table two column experiments are conducted with regular multiple drainage imbibition periods to mimic the oman sea tidal cycles controlled by 3 5 and 5 75 ml min of pumping rate respectively the numerical model is developed and calibrated by the column experiment data and used to simulate two additional columns by increasing the entrapped air saturation to 0 25 from 0 15 and using 30 ppt of saline water respectively the results suggest that the larger water table fluctuation leads to 35 more dissolved oxygen and higher entrapped air saturation enables 22 more oxygen transferred to the anoxic aqueous phase and significantly enhanced the oxygenation of the aquifer especially the deep zone below the water table dissolved oxygen is 4 81 less in the column with 30 ppt of saline water than with fresh

caused al rawas and valeo 2012 choudri et al 2015 geng et al 2016 natural biochemical degradation of contaminants in the coastal aquifers may consume a large amount of dissolved oxygen do and oxygen depleted water could do harm to subsurface ecosystems lin et al 2017 kang et al 2019 brown et al 2019 do may be replenished by interphase transfer from air in the vadose zone or infiltration of oxygen saturated rainwater the oxygen transferred from air will be transported deeper into the aquifer which will affect the groundwater quality and aquatic organisms moore et al 2008 the shallow coastal groundwater system can be considered as an unconfined aquifer with a fluctuating water table induced by the tide cycle and the overlying capillary fringe zone kacimov and abdalla 2010 it is reported that the air bubbles trapped in capillary fringe and saturated zone during the water table fluctuation could be an important source for oxygen recharge fry et al 1995 the thickness of capillary fringe zone is dependent on sediment hydraulic properties as well as the amplitude and frequency of water table fluctuation cycle berkowitz et al 2004 the entrapment of air caused by water table movement not only influences oxygen mass transfer but also changes effective hydraulic properties of the porous sediment fry et al 1997 oxygen transfer in porous sediments includes air water interphase equilibrium kinetic partition and hydrodynamic dispersion in aqueous phase engel and reid 2010 haberer et al 2011 nelson et al 2017 currently there are very limited studies on enhancement of oxygen transfer from pore air to water due to groundwater table fluctuation laboratory cell experiment and numerical modeling simulation by williams and oostrom 2000 indicate that entrapped air bubbles occupying about 15 of the pore space developed and served as oxygen source to replenish anoxic water during the imbibition periods haberer et al 2012 evaluated overall oxygen transfer between air and water phase in the capillary fringe during laboratory bench scale flow through experiments using various dynamic flow boundaries and conditions jia et al 2017 employed sand column experiments to study oxygen transfer from pore air to water phase by mimicking natural fluctuation of water table at the tested rate of 0 16 0 34 cm min there were steady formation of do for all cycles due to oxygen entrapment by pore water during imbibition however during the drainage very limited oxygen into the water phase was observed as discussed above several studies have reported of enhancement of do intake as a result of water table fluctuation using laboratory and numerical modeling however the effects of fluctuating saline water table on air water transfer in unsaturated zone remains unclear knowledge about the effect of salinity on the mechanism of oxygenation under fluctuating water table is very limited peterson et al 2016 young et al 2018 in a study on the diffusion and dissolution of oxygen with a maximum salinity levels of 39 ppt it is found that the oxygen levels at the unsaturated pore interface were equilibrated by both its gaseous and dissolved phases including chemical oxygen demand of the pore water schutte et al 2018 levanon et al 2016 found that the levels of salinity in coastal aquifers were affected by capillary effects in addition to water table fluctuation these analysis of interphase oxygen mass transfer are mostly qualitative and high resolution spatiotemporal quantifications are lacking in this study we used laboratory experiments and numerical model to study this phenomenon that tidal fluctuation enhances oxygen transfer from air to water through entrapped air and to investigate how the amplitude of the water table fluctuation and salinity affects this oxygenation of the shallow intertidal zone two column experiments using different water table fluctuations are conducted with regular drainage imbibition periods to mimic the ocean tidal cycles water table level capillary rise and do concentration in aqueous phase along the sand column are recorded regularly during the experiments the key hydrogeological model parameters controlling the water flow and oxygen transfer are estimated from literatures and experiment measurements besides simulation of the two column experiments the calibrated and validated model is used to re simulate the 1st column experiment with an elevated entrapped air saturation and 30 ppt of saline water respectively in addition to saturation and do concentration the oxygen mass transferred from air to water in each model grid cell is calculated by the four model simulations for quantitative analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory column experiments as shown in fig 1 a vertical acrylic column 144 mm inner diameter 1 m length termed sand column is used to observe water table fluctuations a perforated plate 3 5 mm thick 5 mm hole is placed at a distance of 10 cm from the bottom for smooth water distribution a screen is laid on the plate to prevent sand leakage both the bottom and top of the sand column are attached with removable acrylic plates which are fixed to the flanges with screws and sealed with rubber o rings between the plates and flanges one hole is drilled in the bottom plate to allow for the gas and water flow and another hole is drilled in the top plate to balance the pressure to open atmosphere forty two 42 do sensor patches presens german are pasted to inner wall of sand column between 10 cm and 92 cm from the bottom at an interval of 2 cm approximately for in situ monitoring do concentration along the sand column about 25 kg of artificial sand 30 40 mesh is packed into the sand column manual compaction is applied every 10 cm depth during the packing a manometer is connected to the bottom of the sand column to measure water table fluctuations the top of the capillary fringe is observed visually during the experiment another similar vertical acrylic column 144 mm inner diameter or 150 mm outer diameter 1 m length termed feeding column filled with deoxygenated solutions is used to control the fluctuation events two holes are drilled in the top with one for injecting solution and the other for injecting pure nitrogen to purge oxygen out of the water during imbibition phase the deoxygenated solutions from the feed column are pumped upward into the sand column by a peristaltic pump nanbei model bt100l china during drainage phase the oxygenated water is pumped from the sand column to a disposing container at the beginning of each column experiment high purity nitrogen 99 99 is introduced into the sand column from the top hole to purge oxygen out of the column until do values are below 0 1 mg l then the hole in the bottom plate is switched to the feeding column from which the aqueous solution is pumped into the sand column about 16 l of tap water is filled in the feeding column which is purged by nitrogen for around 30 min until do concentration falls below 0 1 mg l measured by a sensor patch the port is then connected to a collapsing gas bag 10 l devex gas sampling bag with polypropylene valve filled with nitrogen to balance the pressure inside of the sealed feeding column groundwater levels recorded in a well about 100 m away from the beach in al hail coast near muscat in oman show a 4 6 hour pattern of fluctuation but the two highest and two lowest levels are different in one 24 hour ocean tide cycle in column experiments we simplified the fluctuation pattern by assuming the highest or the lowest tidal water levels the same so that one drainage imbibition cycle is 12 h and realized by using the same pumping rate for each 6 hour imbibition and 6 hour drainage phases in order to study the impact of amplitude of water table fluctuations on oxygen interphase transfer in unsaturated zone and capillary fringe and transport in saturated zone two sets of 48 hour experiments simulating 4 drainage imbibition cycles are carried out with a low and high groundwater fluctuations which are controlled by 3 5 and 5 75 ml min of pumping rates respectively water table level capillary rise and do at 42 sensor locations were recorded every one hour during each set of experiments 2 2 numerical model simulations numerical modeling of the two phase flow air and water and oxygen transport in the unsaturated saturated porous sand media is conducted using nuft nonisothermal unsaturated saturated flow and transport code developed and maintained by lawrence livermore national laboratory nitao 1998 nitao 2000 nuft is capable of simulating multi phase multi component non isothermal flow and transport in porous media and verified in many applications of subsurface contaminant transport

gas phase h denotes henry s law constant which is converted to a dimensionless constant in our study table 1 to simulate the fluid flow and oxygen transport in the sand column a one dimensional liquid gas phase flow and transport model is built using nuft the sand porous media is assumed homogeneous and isothermal condition is specified at 20 c of laboratory temperature the 82 cm long sand filled zone 10 92 cm of 1 m sand column is discretized into 82 uniform 1 cm long cells dirichlet type boundary is prescribed at the domain top constant pressure and liquid saturation are specified as one atmospheric pressure and 0 05 respectively time variable do concentrations at the top boundary 48 hourly data are obtained from the experimental measurements fig 6 neumann type boundary is applied at the bottom with the anoxic inflow and drained outflow according to the pumping rates used in the experiments the initial state is the start of the drainage period with water table at 76 cm of sand column the initial liquid saturation is assumed 0 995 under water table and decrease upward linearly to 0 05 at 92 cm model domain top the initial do concentrations are specified as the laboratory measurements from the 42 sensors patched every 2 cm at 10 92 cm of sand column and linear interpolation at those model cells between the sensor patches the values of major model parameters on sand properties fluid flow oxygen interphase transfer and transport are given in table 1 the do measurements from the 1st column experiment termed as c1 with 3 5 ml min pumping rate are used as the targets to calibrate the numerical model the relevant parameter values determined during the calibration are listed in table 1 the calibrated model is used to simulate the 2nd column experiment termed as c2 with higher pumping rate of 5 75 ml min for model verification to investigate the effect of entrapped air and salinity on re oxygenation of aquifers the validated model is then used to re simulate the 1st column experiment with an elevated entrapped air saturation of 0 25 termed as c1a and saline water with 30 ppt of salinity termed as c1b respectively thermo dynamical properties of saline water are calculated based on the correlation developed by phillips et al 1981 in nuft code 3 results and discussion the experiments start with the 6 hour drainage cycle from 76 cm of water table level and is reversed to the imbibition cycle for another 6 h and this drainage imbibition cycle is repeated for total 4 times i e 48 h before illustrating do fluctuation we would like to explain the effect of water table fluctuation on the liquid and entrapped gas saturations using the simulated data as saturations weren t measured in the experiments 3 1 simulated saturations simulated hourly water saturations along the column in 48 h for both experiments are visualized with measured water table and top of capillary fringe during laboratory experiments as shown in fig 2 the average fluctuation heights in the sand column are about 23 and 37 cm respectively during the two column experiments it is seen that the top of the simulated saturated zone follows the fluctuations of the measured water table and observed capillary fringe pretty well in c1 fig 2a indicating the van genuchten capillary pressure saturation model and the associated parameters α m in table 1 are appropriately applied and estimated as a model verification the same water retention parameters are used to simulate c2 with a higher water table fluctuation while the resulted water saturation follows the general trend of the water table fluctuation it seems a little bit over estimated near the end of imbibition periods at the time of 12 24 36 48 h as shown in fig 2b the top of saturated zone is about 5 cm above the top of capillary fringe in 12th hour and continuously increase to about 10 cm in 48th hour one reason is that the water table and the associated capillary fringe keep falling during c2 while the simulated saturated zone topline remains nearly constant throughout the 48 h another reason is that the capillary rise is estimated very roughly because it is hard to tell the exact location of the line on the column wall by human eyes it should be noted that the entrapped air saturation reached 0 15 in fluctuated zone during the 1st imbibition period and on as specified in the model input files accordingly the maximum liquid saturation is 0 85 in fluctuated zone which is considered saturated as shown in both fig 2a and b the history water saturation at selected locations for c1 c2 and c1a are plotted in fig 3 the capillary fringe never reached 90 cm in c1 as shown in fig 3a and the saturation at this height decreased to 0 05 during drainage which is the irreducible liquid saturation specified in the model the maximum decreased continuously in the imbibition periods as a result of the gradually decline of maximal water table over the time at 80 cm where water table never arrived the top of capillary fringe moves above this location by 5 cm at the end of first two imbibition periods and lowered to 2 cm during the next two imbibition periods fig 2a correspondingly the water saturation at 80 cm reached the maximal value of 0 85 for 2 h at 12th hour and duration time reduced to less than 1 h in the next 3 imbibition periods at time of 24 34 and 48 h since capillary fringe is below 80 cm most of the time the curve shows wide plateaus of minimum saturation at this location on the contrary location of 60 cm is full saturated at most of the time and above the water table only for a short time at the end of drainage periods the history curve is characterized by wide plateaus of maximum saturation and sharp spikes at the end of each drainage period minimal water table drops below 54 cm and 52 cm from the 2nd and 3rd drainage periods as a result the water saturation at 54 and 52 cm begin to decrease from initial value of 1 0 at 18th and 30th hour respectively water table never dropped below 50 cm hence the saturation at 50 cm remains at initial values all the time similar patterns can be found for c2 at heights of 90 30 50 40 34 and 32 cm fig 3b the entrapped air saturation in c1 is increased from 0 15 to 0 25 and re simulated as c1a as shown in fig 3c water saturation remains the same as that in c1 until the 1st imbibition period when the area with entrapped air bubble is formed the maximum liquid saturation reduced from 0 85 to 0 75 in the fluctuated zone corresponding to the increase of entrapped air saturation from 0 15 to 0 25 water saturations along the column at the end of each drainage and imbibition periods i e 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 and 48 h are plotted in fig 4 for both experiments in c1 it is seen that entrapped air saturation reached 0 15 water saturation 0 85 in 55 80 cm of fluctuated zone of the column at time of 12 24 36 and 48 h that is the end of imbibition periods similarly entrapped air formed during the imbibition periods of c2 in a larger fluctuation zone between 35 and 80 cm 3 2 do concentrations 3 2 1 comparison of c1 and c2 the key parameters controlling oxygen interphase transfer and transport in sand column are henry s law coefficient and longitudinal dispersivity which are estimated initially from literature and further determined using measured do data in experiment c1 during model calibration the calibrated model is then used to simulate experiment c2 as a verification process the hourly do concentration contour maps in 48 h from numerical models are shown in fig 5 water table and capillary rise are also plotted on the maps to better explain do changes induced by water table fluctuations the history do concentrations at different column heights from both experiments and models are presented in fig 6 and the comparisons between the simulated and measured data along the column at every end of drainage and imbibition periods for c1 and c2 are shown in fig 7 the comparisons between the simulated and measured do data spatiotemporally in both calibration and verification suggest the model can simulate oxygen interphase transfer and transport during water table fluctuations with a relative accuracy as indicated in fig 5 the area with primary changes of do fluctuated with water table and capillary fringes but except during the first drainage cycle the magnitude of this fluctuation is less than that of water table fluctuations during the successive drainage imbibition cycles the do in the area above the top of capillary fringe is continuously increasing as the oxygen continues to transfer from pore air to pore water the equilibrium concentration of dissolved oxygen should be around 9 mg l at one barometric pressure and 20 c in the laboratory but the maximum do concentration measured in 48th hour of the experiments on top location is less than 7 5 mg l it is probably due to the valve of the top cover of the sand column limiting the oxygen saturated air into the column a general decline occurred in the lowest and highest water table elevations throughout both experiments during each successive drainage and imbibition cycle this decline is more remarkable for c2 with larger magnitude of water table fluctuation and correspondingly oxygen is transferred to deeper aquifer with the lower water level both simulated and measured do concentration with the time at locations of every 10 cm between 40 and 80 cm of the column fig 6a shows a good agreement generally larger errors occur at the times when do values change abruptly overall at these locations do concentrations increase during drainage periods when they are exposed to oxygen rich air and decrease during imbibition periods when deoxygenized water is pumped in from the column bottom the maximum do concentration at the end of each drainage periods 6 18 30 42 h increase gradually with the time at all these locations so do the minimum do at the end of imbibition 12 24 36 48 h it makes sense since oxygen is continuously transferred downward from free air at the column top open to atmosphere corresponding to the water table fluctuation the plateau of maximum do during drainage periods shrinks from high to lower locations while that of minimum do during imbibition periods expands at locations downwards similar trends are shown in fig 6b where the simulated and measured do data every 20 cm from 20 to 80 cm for c2 are plotted fig 7 give the simulated and measured do profiles at the end of each drainage and imbibition periods for the two column experiments the comparison of the do profiles shows good match in general trend along the column with larger discrepancies in areas with larger value changes for example in c1 after 1st drainage period at 6th hour the do is nearly zero from the 10 50 cm and increased dramatically to 5 mg l from 50 to 65 cm and followed by a slight increase of 0 5 mg l at next 25 cm to 5 5 mg l at 90 cm largest error between simulated and measured do data are found in the area of 50 65 cm this area is continuously lowered at the 2nd 3rd and 4th drainage periods with the water table decline and continues oxygenation at times of 18 30 and 42 h fig 7a same patterns are observed for the imbibition curves at 12 24 36 and 48 h except that they have a longer anoxic zone at the bottom and shorter oxygenated zone on the top compared to the drainage curves it is worthy noted that despite the do concentrations are controlled by water table fluctuations in major part of the sand column the values keep increasing at the top portion of the column above the capillary fringe where the oxygen continuously enter the liquid phase from the open atmosphere the simulated and measured do at 0 h is the same since the initial values of do input to the model are from the measurements the simulated do at the top boundary i e 92 cm is overlapped with the measured ones which are used as time dependent do boundary values in the model simulations the do curves for c2 show the similar patterns fig 7b but the area confined by drainage and imbibition curves are larger than that of the 1st experiment as a results of larger water table fluctuated zone the discrepancies between the simulated and measured do values are also larger which is expected as a validation against the fitting process in c1 3 2 2 errors between measured and simulated do the model performance is qualitatively analyzed in the last sub section here different statistical error indices between measured and simulated do are calculated in both temporal and spatial scale to further assess model accuracy quantitatively nikoo et al 2018 the average temporal and spatial performance of the both experimental tests with respect to the seven statistical error indices is presented in table 2 the calculated statistical error indices confirm that the c1 model s results outperforms those of c2 model in both temporal and spatial scales it is expected since c1 is for calibration and c2 is for validation as an example the detailed spatiotemporal distribution of root mean square error rmse for both tests are illustrated in radar charts fig 8 as expected rmse values of c1 are smaller than those of c2 in both temporal and spatial profiles fig 8a shows large discrepancy occur in the range of 50 74 cm and 30 72 cm in column c1 and c2 respectively roughly consistent with the fluctuated zones of the two columns the maximum rmse value of c2 is 1 2 more than double of that of c1 which is less than 0 6 the location of highest rmse is around the middle of fluctuated zone for both columns that is 64 and 52 cm in c1 and c2 columns respectively with larger spatial range and higher values of rmse in c2 its radar area is about 3 4 times of that of c1 temporal distributions of rmse however present a distinct pattern fig 8b while rmse values in c1 boost rapidly at turning points of drainage imbibition that is every 6 h in 0 48 h the highest rmse in c2 are found in the middle of drainage or imbibition periods this is probably because c2 column is drained and imbibed faster than c1 causing more abrupt change of hydrogeological conditions in addition the rmse of c1 at times with highest water table hour 12 24 36 48 is larger than those at times with lowest water table hour 6 18 30 42 and this discrepancy is more apparent in c2 it can be explained by the fact that the column experiences more drastic changes of do at the end of imbibition periods when on one hand do at top portion increase as this zone is continuously exposed to atmosphere on other hand do at lower portion decrease as anoxic water rise from the bottom in contrast do in the entire column increase during drainage periods until water table declines to the lowest level in general rmse values in c1 are smaller than those in c2 which is consistent with the findings in analysis of spatial distribution and qualitative analysis of do errors in the last subsection 3 2 3 comparison of c1 c1a and c1b the percentage do changes corresponding to the increase of entrapped air saturation from 0 15 c1 to 0 25 c1a and using 30 ppt saline water c1b are visualized in fig 9 a and b the enhancement of oxygenation is significant responding to the increase of entrapped air saturation especially in the saturated zone under water table the do concentration is increased by as high as 70 at 18th hour around water table elevation do can also transport deeper down the aquifer with elevated entrapped air saturation as shown in fig 9a at 42nd hour do penetrates anoxic aquifer below elevation of 20 cm more than 10 cm deeper than that in c1 fig 5a it is surprising to see that around the water table elevations the do concentration increase during the 1st drainage period 0 6 h when the entrapped air hasn t been developed and do decrease during the 1st imbibition period 6 12 h when the entrapped air is in the process of development this phenomenon might be caused by other mechanisms such as the decrease of relative permeability of the liquid phase due to the increase of irreducible air saturation tortuosity which influence the dynamic dispersion of oxygen transport could also be changed corresponding to the increase of the entrapped air saturation the enhancement of oxygenation induced by entrapped air saturation starts to work when the air bubble is developed after the first imbibition period i e after 12th hour it is indicated by the increase of do in the subsequent imbibition periods fig 9a on the contrary oxygen solubility decrease with the increase of water salinity the spatiotemporal percentage reduction of do concentration in 30 ppt of saline water versus fresh water is shown in fig 9b as expected do concentration decreased throughout the simulation period in capillary and saturated zone the maximal decrease in percentage however happens in low do concentration area in deeper aquifer the comparison results suggest that high salinity will damp the oxygenation enhancement by fluctuation of groundwater level especially in deeper zone below water table 3 3 interphase transfer of oxygen mass the cumulative interphase oxygen mass transfer in each hour in each grid cell 1 cm of the column for four model simulations are calculated for quantitative analysis it is found that oxygen is transferred from air to water in some cells positive values and backward from water to air negative values in other cells fig 10 presents the net interphase transferred oxygen mass totalized in the entire column with the time while fig 11 shows in logarithm scale the dissolved oxygen mass in each of those cells with positive values only in 6th 12th 30th and 36th hour for all the 4 cases the net oxygen transferred into water decrease during drainage and increase during imbibition generally indicating significantly more oxygen is dissolved into the water during imbibition than during drainage fig 10 it is because during imbibition oxygen in the entrapped air bubble is dissolved into the oxygen depleted water demonstrating the critical role of entrapped air in oxygenation of aquifers it is also seen that the oxygenation processes slow down with the time as do concentrations continuously increase comparison between the c1 base case c2 larger fluctuated zone c1a larger entrapped air saturation and c1b 30 ppt saline water reveals that transferred oxygen in c2 is always more than that in c1 except the 3rd 24 30 h and 4th drainage periods 36 42 h and that of c1a is the same as c1 in the 1st drainage 0 6 h but more similar to that of c2 afterwards it makes senses since the fluctuated zone in c2 is about 20 cm larger than c1 meaning more entrapped air bubbles supply oxygen to anoxic water during imbibition however it is backfired since more oxygen in c2 will transfer backward into air bubble during drainage causing smaller net dissolved oxygen and even negative values in the 3rd and 4th drainage periods respectively c1a on the other hand has the same fluctuated zone but a larger entrapped air saturation compared to c1 which explains that the net dissolved oxygen is the same in the 1st drainage 0 6 h when the entrapped air bubble hasn t been developed from the 1st imbibition and on entrapped air bubble steps in and starts to affect the interphase oxygen transfer leading to the similar behavior of c1a to c2 i e more oxygen transferred to water during imbibition and backward to air during drainage than c1 totally in 48 h 35 and 22 more net oxygen dissolved in water in c2 and c1a than in c1 respectively c1b shows a similar curve as c1 with slightly smaller net oxygen mass transfer in saline water while the saturated oxygen solubility reduced from 9 08 mg l in freshwater to 7 6 mg l in 30 ppt saline water in 20 c and 1 atmospheric pressure the total mass reduction of oxygen dissolved in c1b from c1 is 4 81 in 48 h of simulation time the column vertical profiles of oxygen dissolved into water in every 1 cm cells with positive values larger than 10 7 g are further examined at 6th 12th and 30th 36th hour the last hour of 1st and 3rd drainage and imbibition fig 11 note those negative values oxygen transferred back to air cannot be shown in the logarithm scale it is seen that major oxygen transfer happens in those cells experiencing drastic saturation changes for example in c1 the high values of transferred oxygen in the 6th and 30th hour are ranged in 57 65 and 53 61 cm fig 11a consistent with the drained cells in the corresponding hour between time point 5 6 and 29 30 h fig 2a these ranges are 40 55 and 35 50 cm in the 6th and 30th hour respectively in c2 which are wider than those in c1 due to the faster water table movement fig 11b the mass transfer in these drained cells changes abruptly from cell to cell while the cell wise change is very smooth in other cells away from the water level similar behavior can be seen during imbibition in the 12th and 36th hour in all the three column simulations take c1 as an example fig 11a the highest values are clustered between 80 and 90 and 76 to 86 cm in 12th and 36th hour and cell wise changes are drastic in these imbibed cells in the past one hour below these cells the cell wise values present a very smooth curve whereas unlike drainage oxygen mass dissolved in water are still very large in saturated zone in 70 80 and 60 75 cm in 12th and 36th hour it is because the entrapped air bubbles supply oxygen to bypassing anoxic water the ranges of high values in saturated zone are longer in c2 due to larger fluctuated zone fig 11b while the values are higher in c1a due to higher entrapped air saturation fig 11c in both 12th and 36th hour these findings confirm the vital role of entrapped air bubble in enhancing oxygenation of aquifer under fluctuated water table 4 conclusions in this study high resolution spatiotemporal data of saturation do concentration and interphase transferred oxygen mass are obtained from laboratory experiments and numerical model simulations using these data oxygenation dynamics in aquifers with ocean tide induced groundwater level fluctuations are investigated quantitatively particularly the important roles of entrapped air and water salinity in oxygen interphase transfer are assessed and demonstrated in column experiments a fully saturated zone is developed where about 15 of the pore space is occupied by air bubble during imbibition periods elevated entrapped air saturation 0 25 versus 0 15 results in 22 more dissolved oxygen lengthened fluctuated zone 37 cm versus 23 cm in other words larger zone with entrapped air bubbles leads to 35 more oxygen transferred to water in the column these findings indicate that do concentrations might be much lower at low elevations without this air entrapment mechanism and hence the oxygen recharging process would be much slower and shallower saline water 30 ppt on the contrary reduces dissolved oxygen by 4 81 than in freshwater and the maximal decrease percentage occur in low do concentration area i e deeper aquifer from the water table quantifications of air water oxygen transfer mass also reveal that net backward transfer of oxygen from water to air could happen during drainage periods compared to few previous studies in oxygenation mechanism our study gives a more comprehensive quantification analysis and hence can confirm some hypothesis or assumptions our experiments and model simulations are particularly designed for ocean tidal frequency and hence provide significant knowledge to oxygenation of intertidal coastal aquifers which is completely missing in literature however the water table fluctuation pattern is significantly simplified from field conditions in the laboratory experiments and numerical simulations and case with fixed salinity 30 ppt only is simulated in this study it is well recognized that both salinity and amplitude of fluctuation in groundwater decline dynamically with the distance from the coastline in situ experiments on a transect perpendicular to coastline would be very useful to investigate oxygenation dynamics along the transect with varying groundwater salinity

5190,intertidal sediments host many biogeochemical processes which drastically affect coastal ecosystems dissolved oxygen do plays a major role in many of these biogeochemical reactions and is of primary importance for intertidal groundwater quality groundwater level of intertidal zone fluctuates regularly corresponding to the tidal cycle during the fluctuation of water table the oxygen rich air could be entrapped in the pore space of sediments and hence serve as an important oxygen source to replenish oxygen depleted groundwater although oxygenation enhanced by fluctuated water table has been studied in river banks no study has been conducted in ocean intertidal sediments under tide induced groundwater table fluctuations and quantification of interphase oxygen mass transfer is lacking in this study combined laboratory experimental and numerical modeling approach is developed to study the mechanism of oxygenation of aquifers with regularly fluctuated water table two column experiments are conducted with regular multiple drainage imbibition periods to mimic the oman sea tidal cycles controlled by 3 5 and 5 75 ml min of pumping rate respectively the numerical model is developed and calibrated by the column experiment data and used to simulate two additional columns by increasing the entrapped air saturation to 0 25 from 0 15 and using 30 ppt of saline water respectively the results suggest that the larger water table fluctuation leads to 35 more dissolved oxygen and higher entrapped air saturation enables 22 more oxygen transferred to the anoxic aqueous phase and significantly enhanced the oxygenation of the aquifer especially the deep zone below the water table dissolved oxygen is 4 81 less in the column with 30 ppt of saline water than with fresh

caused al rawas and valeo 2012 choudri et al 2015 geng et al 2016 natural biochemical degradation of contaminants in the coastal aquifers may consume a large amount of dissolved oxygen do and oxygen depleted water could do harm to subsurface ecosystems lin et al 2017 kang et al 2019 brown et al 2019 do may be replenished by interphase transfer from air in the vadose zone or infiltration of oxygen saturated rainwater the oxygen transferred from air will be transported deeper into the aquifer which will affect the groundwater quality and aquatic organisms moore et al 2008 the shallow coastal groundwater system can be considered as an unconfined aquifer with a fluctuating water table induced by the tide cycle and the overlying capillary fringe zone kacimov and abdalla 2010 it is reported that the air bubbles trapped in capillary fringe and saturated zone during the water table fluctuation could be an important source for oxygen recharge fry et al 1995 the thickness of capillary fringe zone is dependent on sediment hydraulic properties as well as the amplitude and frequency of water table fluctuation cycle berkowitz et al 2004 the entrapment of air caused by water table movement not only influences oxygen mass transfer but also changes effective hydraulic properties of the porous sediment fry et al 1997 oxygen transfer in porous sediments includes air water interphase equilibrium kinetic partition and hydrodynamic dispersion in aqueous phase engel and reid 2010 haberer et al 2011 nelson et al 2017 currently there are very limited studies on enhancement of oxygen transfer from pore air to water due to groundwater table fluctuation laboratory cell experiment and numerical modeling simulation by williams and oostrom 2000 indicate that entrapped air bubbles occupying about 15 of the pore space developed and served as oxygen source to replenish anoxic water during the imbibition periods haberer et al 2012 evaluated overall oxygen transfer between air and water phase in the capillary fringe during laboratory bench scale flow through experiments using various dynamic flow boundaries and conditions jia et al 2017 employed sand column experiments to study oxygen transfer from pore air to water phase by mimicking natural fluctuation of water table at the tested rate of 0 16 0 34 cm min there were steady formation of do for all cycles due to oxygen entrapment by pore water during imbibition however during the drainage very limited oxygen into the water phase was observed as discussed above several studies have reported of enhancement of do intake as a result of water table fluctuation using laboratory and numerical modeling however the effects of fluctuating saline water table on air water transfer in unsaturated zone remains unclear knowledge about the effect of salinity on the mechanism of oxygenation under fluctuating water table is very limited peterson et al 2016 young et al 2018 in a study on the diffusion and dissolution of oxygen with a maximum salinity levels of 39 ppt it is found that the oxygen levels at the unsaturated pore interface were equilibrated by both its gaseous and dissolved phases including chemical oxygen demand of the pore water schutte et al 2018 levanon et al 2016 found that the levels of salinity in coastal aquifers were affected by capillary effects in addition to water table fluctuation these analysis of interphase oxygen mass transfer are mostly qualitative and high resolution spatiotemporal quantifications are lacking in this study we used laboratory experiments and numerical model to study this phenomenon that tidal fluctuation enhances oxygen transfer from air to water through entrapped air and to investigate how the amplitude of the water table fluctuation and salinity affects this oxygenation of the shallow intertidal zone two column experiments using different water table fluctuations are conducted with regular drainage imbibition periods to mimic the ocean tidal cycles water table level capillary rise and do concentration in aqueous phase along the sand column are recorded regularly during the experiments the key hydrogeological model parameters controlling the water flow and oxygen transfer are estimated from literatures and experiment measurements besides simulation of the two column experiments the calibrated and validated model is used to re simulate the 1st column experiment with an elevated entrapped air saturation and 30 ppt of saline water respectively in addition to saturation and do concentration the oxygen mass transferred from air to water in each model grid cell is calculated by the four model simulations for quantitative analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory column experiments as shown in fig 1 a vertical acrylic column 144 mm inner diameter 1 m length termed sand column is used to observe water table fluctuations a perforated plate 3 5 mm thick 5 mm hole is placed at a distance of 10 cm from the bottom for smooth water distribution a screen is laid on the plate to prevent sand leakage both the bottom and top of the sand column are attached with removable acrylic plates which are fixed to the flanges with screws and sealed with rubber o rings between the plates and flanges one hole is drilled in the bottom plate to allow for the gas and water flow and another hole is drilled in the top plate to balance the pressure to open atmosphere forty two 42 do sensor patches presens german are pasted to inner wall of sand column between 10 cm and 92 cm from the bottom at an interval of 2 cm approximately for in situ monitoring do concentration along the sand column about 25 kg of artificial sand 30 40 mesh is packed into the sand column manual compaction is applied every 10 cm depth during the packing a manometer is connected to the bottom of the sand column to measure water table fluctuations the top of the capillary fringe is observed visually during the experiment another similar vertical acrylic column 144 mm inner diameter or 150 mm outer diameter 1 m length termed feeding column filled with deoxygenated solutions is used to control the fluctuation events two holes are drilled in the top with one for injecting solution and the other for injecting pure nitrogen to purge oxygen out of the water during imbibition phase the deoxygenated solutions from the feed column are pumped upward into the sand column by a peristaltic pump nanbei model bt100l china during drainage phase the oxygenated water is pumped from the sand column to a disposing container at the beginning of each column experiment high purity nitrogen 99 99 is introduced into the sand column from the top hole to purge oxygen out of the column until do values are below 0 1 mg l then the hole in the bottom plate is switched to the feeding column from which the aqueous solution is pumped into the sand column about 16 l of tap water is filled in the feeding column which is purged by nitrogen for around 30 min until do concentration falls below 0 1 mg l measured by a sensor patch the port is then connected to a collapsing gas bag 10 l devex gas sampling bag with polypropylene valve filled with nitrogen to balance the pressure inside of the sealed feeding column groundwater levels recorded in a well about 100 m away from the beach in al hail coast near muscat in oman show a 4 6 hour pattern of fluctuation but the two highest and two lowest levels are different in one 24 hour ocean tide cycle in column experiments we simplified the fluctuation pattern by assuming the highest or the lowest tidal water levels the same so that one drainage imbibition cycle is 12 h and realized by using the same pumping rate for each 6 hour imbibition and 6 hour drainage phases in order to study the impact of amplitude of water table fluctuations on oxygen interphase transfer in unsaturated zone and capillary fringe and transport in saturated zone two sets of 48 hour experiments simulating 4 drainage imbibition cycles are carried out with a low and high groundwater fluctuations which are controlled by 3 5 and 5 75 ml min of pumping rates respectively water table level capillary rise and do at 42 sensor locations were recorded every one hour during each set of experiments 2 2 numerical model simulations numerical modeling of the two phase flow air and water and oxygen transport in the unsaturated saturated porous sand media is conducted using nuft nonisothermal unsaturated saturated flow and transport code developed and maintained by lawrence livermore national laboratory nitao

gas phase h denotes henry s law constant which is converted to a dimensionless constant in our study table 1 to simulate the fluid flow and oxygen transport in the sand column a one dimensional liquid gas phase flow and transport model is built using nuft the sand porous media is assumed homogeneous and isothermal condition is specified at 20 c of laboratory temperature the 82 cm long sand filled zone 10 92 cm of 1 m sand column is discretized into 82 uniform 1 cm long cells dirichlet type boundary is prescribed at the domain top constant pressure and liquid saturation are specified as one atmospheric pressure and 0 05 respectively time variable do concentrations at the top boundary 48 hourly data are obtained from the experimental measurements fig 6 neumann type boundary is applied at the bottom with the anoxic inflow and drained outflow according to the pumping rates used in the experiments the initial state is the start of the drainage period with water table at 76 cm of sand column the initial liquid saturation is assumed 0 995 under water table and decrease upward linearly to 0 05 at 92 cm model domain top the initial do concentrations are specified as the laboratory measurements from the 42 sensors patched every 2 cm at 10 92 cm of sand column and linear interpolation at those model cells between the sensor patches the values of major model parameters on sand properties fluid flow oxygen interphase transfer and transport are given in table 1 the do measurements from the 1st column experiment termed as c1 with 3 5 ml min pumping rate are used as the targets to calibrate the numerical model the relevant parameter values determined during the calibration are listed in table 1 the calibrated model is used to simulate the 2nd column experiment termed as c2 with higher pumping rate of 5 75 ml min for model verification to investigate the effect of entrapped air and salinity on re oxygenation of aquifers the validated model is then used to re simulate the 1st column experiment with an elevated entrapped air saturation of 0 25 termed as c1a and saline water with 30 ppt of salinity termed as c1b respectively thermo dynamical properties of saline water are calculated based on the correlation developed by phillips et al 1981 in nuft code 3 results and discussion the experiments start with the 6 hour drainage cycle from 76 cm of water table level and is reversed to the imbibition cycle for another 6 h and this drainage imbibition cycle is repeated for total 4 times i e 48 h before illustrating do fluctuation we would like to explain the effect of water table fluctuation on the liquid and entrapped gas saturations using the simulated data as saturations weren t measured in the experiments 3 1 simulated saturations simulated hourly water saturations along the column in 48 h for both experiments are visualized with measured water table and top of capillary fringe during laboratory experiments as shown in fig 2 the average fluctuation heights in the sand column are about 23 and 37 cm respectively during the two column experiments it is seen that the top of the simulated saturated zone follows the fluctuations of the measured water table and observed capillary fringe pretty well in c1 fig 2a indicating the van genuchten capillary pressure saturation model and the associated parameters α m in table 1 are appropriately applied and estimated as a model verification the same water retention parameters are used to simulate c2 with a higher water table fluctuation while the resulted water saturation follows the general trend of the water table fluctuation it seems a little bit over estimated near the end of imbibition periods at the time of 12 24 36 48 h as shown in fig 2b the top of saturated zone is about 5 cm above the top of capillary fringe in 12th hour and continuously increase to about 10 cm in 48th hour one reason is that the water table and the associated capillary fringe keep falling during c2 while the simulated saturated zone topline remains nearly constant throughout the 48 h another reason is that the capillary rise is estimated very roughly because it is hard to tell the exact location of the line on the column wall by human eyes it should be noted that the entrapped air saturation reached 0 15 in fluctuated zone during the 1st imbibition period and on as specified in the model input files accordingly the maximum liquid saturation is 0 85 in fluctuated zone which is considered saturated as shown in both fig 2a and b the history water saturation at selected locations for c1 c2 and c1a are plotted in fig 3 the capillary fringe never reached 90 cm in c1 as shown in fig 3a and the saturation at this height decreased to 0 05 during drainage which is the irreducible liquid saturation specified in the model the maximum decreased continuously in the imbibition periods as a result of the gradually decline of maximal water table over the time at 80 cm where water table never arrived the top of capillary fringe moves above this location by 5 cm at the end of first two imbibition periods and lowered to 2 cm during the next two imbibition periods fig 2a correspondingly the water saturation at 80 cm reached the maximal value of 0 85 for 2 h at 12th hour and duration time reduced to less than 1 h in the next 3 imbibition periods at time of 24 34 and 48 h since capillary fringe is below 80 cm most of the time the curve shows wide plateaus of minimum saturation at this location on the contrary location of 60 cm is full saturated at most of the time and above the water table only for a short time at the end of drainage periods the history curve is characterized by wide plateaus of maximum saturation and sharp spikes at the end of each drainage period minimal water table drops below 54 cm and 52 cm from the 2nd and 3rd drainage periods as a result the water saturation at 54 and 52 cm begin to decrease from initial value of 1 0 at 18th and 30th hour respectively water table never dropped below 50 cm hence the saturation at 50 cm remains at initial values all the time similar patterns can be found for c2 at heights of 90 30 50 40 34 and 32 cm fig 3b the entrapped air saturation in c1 is increased from 0 15 to 0 25 and re simulated as c1a as shown in fig 3c water saturation remains the same as that in c1 until the 1st imbibition period when the area with entrapped air bubble is formed the maximum liquid saturation reduced from 0 85 to 0 75 in the fluctuated zone corresponding to the increase of entrapped air saturation from 0 15 to 0 25 water saturations along the column at the end of each drainage and imbibition periods i e 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 and 48 h are plotted in fig 4 for both experiments in c1 it is seen that entrapped air saturation reached 0 15 water saturation 0 85 in 55 80 cm of fluctuated zone of the column at time of 12 24 36 and 48 h that is the end of imbibition periods similarly entrapped air formed during the imbibition periods of c2 in a larger fluctuation zone between 35 and 80 cm 3 2 do concentrations 3 2 1 comparison of c1 and c2 the key parameters controlling oxygen interphase transfer and transport in sand column are henry s law coefficient and longitudinal dispersivity which are estimated initially from literature and further determined using measured do data in experiment c1 during model calibration the calibrated model is then used to simulate experiment c2 as a verification process the hourly do concentration contour maps in 48 h from numerical models are shown in fig 5 water table and capillary rise are also plotted on the maps to better explain do changes induced by water table fluctuations the history do concentrations at different column heights from both experiments and models are presented in fig 6 and the comparisons between the simulated and measured data along the column at every end of drainage and imbibition periods for c1 and c2 are shown in fig 7 the comparisons between the simulated and measured do data spatiotemporally in both calibration and verification suggest the model can simulate oxygen interphase transfer and transport during water table fluctuations with a relative accuracy as indicated in fig 5 the area with primary changes of do fluctuated with water table and capillary fringes but except during the first drainage cycle the magnitude of this fluctuation is less than that of water table fluctuations during the successive drainage imbibition cycles the do in the area above the top of capillary fringe is continuously increasing as the oxygen continues to transfer from pore air to pore water the equilibrium concentration of dissolved oxygen should be around 9 mg l at one barometric pressure and 20 c in the laboratory but the maximum do concentration measured in 48th hour of the experiments on top location is less than 7 5 mg l it is probably due to the valve of the top cover of the sand column limiting the oxygen saturated air into the column a general decline occurred in the lowest and highest water table elevations throughout both experiments during each successive drainage and imbibition cycle this decline is more remarkable for c2 with larger magnitude of water table fluctuation and correspondingly oxygen is transferred to deeper aquifer with the lower water level both simulated and measured do concentration with the time at locations of every 10 cm between 40 and 80 cm of the column fig 6a shows a good agreement generally larger errors occur at the times when do values change abruptly overall at these locations do concentrations increase during drainage periods when they are exposed to oxygen rich air and decrease during imbibition periods when deoxygenized water is pumped in from the column bottom the maximum do concentration at the end of each drainage periods 6 18 30 42 h increase gradually with the time at all these locations so do the minimum do at the end of imbibition 12 24 36 48 h it makes sense since oxygen is continuously transferred downward from free air at the column top open to atmosphere corresponding to the water table fluctuation the plateau of maximum do during drainage periods shrinks from high to lower locations while that of minimum do during imbibition periods expands at locations downwards similar trends are shown in fig 6b where the simulated and measured do data every 20 cm from 20 to 80 cm for c2 are plotted fig 7 give the simulated and measured do profiles at the end of each drainage and imbibition periods for the two column experiments the comparison of the do profiles shows good match in general trend along the column with larger discrepancies in areas with larger value changes for example in c1 after 1st drainage period at 6th hour the do is nearly zero from the 10 50 cm and increased dramatically to 5 mg l from 50 to 65 cm and followed by a slight increase of 0 5 mg l at next 25 cm to 5 5 mg l at 90 cm largest error between simulated and measured do data are found in the area of 50 65 cm this area is continuously lowered at the 2nd 3rd and 4th drainage periods with the water table decline and continues oxygenation at times of 18 30 and 42 h fig 7a same patterns are observed for the imbibition curves at 12 24 36 and 48 h except that they have a longer anoxic zone at the bottom and shorter oxygenated zone on the top compared to the drainage curves it is worthy noted that despite the do concentrations are controlled by water table fluctuations in major part of the sand column the values keep increasing at the top portion of the column above the capillary fringe where the oxygen continuously enter the liquid phase from the open atmosphere the simulated and measured do at 0 h is the same since the initial values of do input to the model are from the measurements the simulated do at the top boundary i e 92 cm is overlapped with the measured ones which are used as time dependent do boundary values in the model simulations the do curves for c2 show the similar patterns fig 7b but the area confined by drainage and imbibition curves are larger than that of the 1st experiment as a results of larger water table fluctuated zone the discrepancies between the simulated and measured do values are also larger which is expected as a validation against the fitting process in c1 3 2 2 errors between measured and simulated do the model performance is qualitatively analyzed in the last sub section here different statistical error indices between measured and simulated do are calculated in both temporal and spatial scale to further assess model accuracy quantitatively nikoo et al 2018 the average temporal and spatial performance of the both experimental tests with respect to the seven statistical error indices is presented in table 2 the calculated statistical error indices confirm that the c1 model s results outperforms those of c2 model in both temporal and spatial scales it is expected since c1 is for calibration and c2 is for validation as an example the detailed spatiotemporal distribution of root mean square error rmse for both tests are illustrated in radar charts fig 8 as expected rmse values of c1 are smaller than those of c2 in both temporal and spatial profiles fig 8a shows large discrepancy occur in the range of 50 74 cm and 30 72 cm in column c1 and c2 respectively roughly consistent with the fluctuated zones of the two columns the maximum rmse value of c2 is 1 2 more than double of that of c1 which is less than 0 6 the location of highest rmse is around the middle of fluctuated zone for both columns that is 64 and 52 cm in c1 and c2 columns respectively with larger spatial range and higher values of rmse in c2 its radar area is about 3 4 times of that of c1 temporal distributions of rmse however present a distinct pattern fig 8b while rmse values in c1 boost rapidly at turning points of drainage imbibition that is every 6 h in 0 48 h the highest rmse in c2 are found in the middle of drainage or imbibition periods this is probably because c2 column is drained and imbibed faster than c1 causing more abrupt change of hydrogeological conditions in addition the rmse of c1 at times with highest water table hour 12 24 36 48 is larger than those at times with lowest water table hour 6 18 30 42 and this discrepancy is more apparent in c2 it can be explained by the fact that the column experiences more drastic changes of do at the end of imbibition periods when on one hand do at top portion increase as this zone is continuously exposed to atmosphere on other hand do at lower portion decrease as anoxic water rise from the bottom in contrast do in the entire column increase during drainage periods until water table declines to the lowest level in general rmse values in c1 are smaller than those in c2 which is consistent with the findings in analysis of spatial distribution and qualitative analysis of do errors in the last subsection 3 2 3 comparison of c1 c1a and c1b the percentage do changes corresponding to the increase of entrapped air saturation from 0 15 c1 to 0 25 c1a and using 30 ppt saline water c1b are visualized in fig 9 a and b the enhancement of oxygenation is significant responding to the increase of entrapped air saturation especially in the saturated zone under water table the do concentration is increased by as high as 70 at 18th hour around water table elevation do can also transport deeper down the aquifer with elevated entrapped air saturation as shown in fig 9a at 42nd hour do penetrates anoxic aquifer below elevation of 20 cm more than 10 cm deeper than that in c1 fig 5a it is surprising to see that around the water table elevations the do concentration increase during the 1st drainage period 0 6 h when the entrapped air hasn t been developed and do decrease during the 1st imbibition period 6 12 h when the entrapped air is in the process of development this phenomenon might be caused by other mechanisms such as the decrease of relative permeability of the liquid phase due to the increase of irreducible air saturation tortuosity which influence the dynamic dispersion of oxygen transport could also be changed corresponding to the increase of the entrapped air saturation the enhancement of oxygenation induced by entrapped air saturation starts to work when the air bubble is developed after the first imbibition period i e after 12th hour it is indicated by the increase of do in the subsequent imbibition periods fig 9a on the contrary oxygen solubility decrease with the increase of water salinity the spatiotemporal percentage reduction of do concentration in 30 ppt of saline water versus fresh water is shown in fig 9b as expected do concentration decreased throughout the simulation period in capillary and saturated zone the maximal decrease in percentage however happens in low do concentration area in deeper aquifer the comparison results suggest that high salinity will damp the oxygenation enhancement by fluctuation of groundwater level especially in deeper zone below water table 3 3 interphase transfer of oxygen mass the cumulative interphase oxygen mass transfer in each hour in each grid cell 1 cm of the column for four model simulations are calculated for quantitative analysis it is found that oxygen is transferred from air to water in some cells positive values and backward from water to air negative values in other cells fig 10 presents the net interphase transferred oxygen mass totalized in the entire column with the time while fig 11 shows in logarithm scale the dissolved oxygen mass in each of those cells with positive values only in 6th 12th 30th and 36th hour for all the 4 cases the net oxygen transferred into water decrease during drainage and increase during imbibition generally indicating significantly more oxygen is dissolved into the water during imbibition than during drainage fig 10 it is because during imbibition oxygen in the entrapped air bubble is dissolved into the oxygen depleted water demonstrating the critical role of entrapped air in oxygenation of aquifers it is also seen that the oxygenation processes slow down with the time as do concentrations continuously increase comparison between the c1 base case c2 larger fluctuated zone c1a larger entrapped air saturation and c1b 30 ppt saline water reveals that transferred oxygen in c2 is always more than that in c1 except the 3rd 24 30 h and 4th drainage periods 36 42 h and that of c1a is the same as c1 in the 1st drainage 0 6 h but more similar to that of c2 afterwards it makes senses since the fluctuated zone in c2 is about 20 cm larger than c1 meaning more entrapped air bubbles supply oxygen to anoxic water during imbibition however it is backfired since more oxygen in c2 will transfer backward into air bubble during drainage causing smaller net dissolved oxygen and even negative values in the 3rd and 4th drainage periods respectively c1a on the other hand has the same fluctuated zone but a larger entrapped air saturation compared to c1 which explains that the net dissolved oxygen is the same in the 1st drainage 0 6 h when the entrapped air bubble hasn t been developed from the 1st imbibition and on entrapped air bubble steps in and starts to affect the interphase oxygen transfer leading to the similar behavior of c1a to c2 i e more oxygen transferred to water during imbibition and backward to air during drainage than c1 totally in 48 h 35 and 22 more net oxygen dissolved in water in c2 and c1a than in c1 respectively c1b shows a similar curve as c1 with slightly smaller net oxygen mass transfer in saline water while the saturated oxygen solubility reduced from 9 08 mg l in freshwater to 7 6 mg l in 30 ppt saline water in 20 c and 1 atmospheric pressure the total mass reduction of oxygen dissolved in c1b from c1 is 4 81 in 48 h of simulation time the column vertical profiles of oxygen dissolved into water in every 1 cm cells with positive values larger than 10 7 g are further examined at 6th 12th and 30th 36th hour the last hour of 1st and 3rd drainage and imbibition fig 11 note those negative values oxygen transferred back to air cannot be shown in the logarithm scale it is seen that major oxygen transfer happens in those cells experiencing drastic saturation changes for example in c1 the high values of transferred oxygen in the 6th and 30th hour are ranged in 57 65 and 53 61 cm fig 11a consistent with the drained cells in the corresponding hour between time point 5 6 and 29 30 h fig 2a these ranges are 40 55 and 35 50 cm in the 6th and 30th hour respectively in c2 which are wider than those in c1 due to the faster water table movement fig 11b the mass transfer in these drained cells changes abruptly from cell to cell while the cell wise change is very smooth in other cells away from the water level similar behavior can be seen during imbibition in the 12th and 36th hour in all the three column simulations take c1 as an example fig 11a the highest values are clustered between 80 and 90 and 76 to 86 cm in 12th and 36th hour and cell wise changes are drastic in these imbibed cells in the past one hour below these cells the cell wise values present a very smooth curve whereas unlike drainage oxygen mass dissolved in water are still very large in saturated zone in 70 80 and 60 75 cm in 12th and 36th hour it is because the entrapped air bubbles supply oxygen to bypassing anoxic water the ranges of high values in saturated zone are longer in c2 due to larger fluctuated zone fig 11b while the values are higher in c1a due to higher entrapped air saturation fig 11c in both 12th and 36th hour these findings confirm the vital role of entrapped air bubble in enhancing oxygenation of aquifer under fluctuated water table 4 conclusions in this study high resolution spatiotemporal data of saturation do concentration and interphase transferred oxygen mass are obtained from laboratory experiments and numerical model simulations using these data oxygenation dynamics in aquifers with ocean tide induced groundwater level fluctuations are investigated quantitatively particularly the important roles of entrapped air and water salinity in oxygen interphase transfer are assessed and demonstrated in column experiments a fully saturated zone is developed where about 15 of the pore space is occupied by air bubble during imbibition periods elevated entrapped air saturation 0 25 versus 0 15 results in 22 more dissolved oxygen lengthened fluctuated zone 37 cm versus 23 cm in other words larger zone with entrapped air bubbles leads to 35 more oxygen transferred to water in the column these findings indicate that do concentrations might be much lower at low elevations without this air entrapment mechanism and hence the oxygen recharging process would be much slower and shallower saline water 30 ppt on the contrary reduces dissolved oxygen by 4 81 than in freshwater and the maximal decrease percentage occur in low do concentration area i e deeper aquifer from the water table quantifications of air water oxygen transfer mass also reveal that net backward transfer of oxygen from water to air could happen during drainage periods compared to few previous studies in oxygenation mechanism our study gives a more comprehensive quantification analysis and hence can confirm some hypothesis or assumptions our experiments and model simulations are particularly designed for ocean tidal frequency and hence provide significant knowledge to oxygenation of intertidal coastal aquifers which is completely missing in literature however the water table fluctuation pattern is significantly simplified from field conditions in the laboratory experiments and numerical simulations and case with fixed salinity 30 ppt only is simulated in this study it is well recognized that both salinity and amplitude of fluctuation in groundwater decline dynamically with the distance from the coastline in situ experiments on a transect perpendicular to coastline would be very useful to investigate oxygenation dynamics along the transect with varying groundwater salinity and amplitude of groundwater level fluctuation under a realistic condition credit authorship contribution statement mingjie chen conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft

5191,understanding the formation of thioarsenate an important arsenic species is of great significance with respect to explaining the mobilization of arsenic in fresh groundwater systems monothioarsenate mta dithioarsenate dta and trithioarsenate trita are three main forms of thioarsenate in fresh groundwater a total of 30 groundwater samples were collected from the datong basin to conduct hydrochemistry and arsenic speciation analysis geochemical simulations were established to verify the occurrence of thioarsenate the results show thioarsenate was detected in 40 of the groundwater samples at concentrations ranging from 2 36 to 209 9 μg l the highest concentration accounted for 68 of total arsenic thioarsenate mainly occurs in the discharge area of the datong basin where the groundwater was characterized by strongly reducing conditions eh up to 175 3 mv and higher concentrations of arsenic up to 3450 μg l and sulfide up to 8480 μg l a strong positive correlation r 0 81 p 0 05 was observed between thioarsenate and sulfide strong reducibility and high sulfide concentration are beneficial for the formation of dta vs mta geochemical modelling results confirm that suitable s as mass ratio 2 2 favors the formation of thioarsenate and that compared with mta dta is easier to form under strong reduction environment and dta is directly affected by the concentrate of sulfides while mta may be related to elemental sulfur this understanding of the different formation conditions of thioarsenate species helps to explain the migration and enrichment of as in sulfide rich groundwater keywords groundwater arsenic species thioarsenate datong basin hplc icpms 1 introduction arsenic is a widely distributed metalloid element which is highly toxic and can cause a variety of human diseases matschullat 2000 terlecka 2005 guo et al 2011 mladenov et al 2014 wang et al 2019 long term drinking of high arsenic groundwater has poisoned a large number of residents in many countries such as bangladesh india and china nickson 1998 tareq 2002 wang 2005 bhartariya 2010 in order to regulate the quality of drinking water the world health organization who stipulates that the concentration of arsenic in drinking water should be lower than 10 μg l who 2011 arsenic exists in many different forms such as arsenite as iii arsenate as v monomethylated arsenic demethylated arsenic etc as iii is considered to be the most toxic species followed by as v while organic arsenic is relatively small at the same time as iii is also the most mobility species in the reduced groundwater environment ardini et al 2020 only by mastering the form and distribution of arsenic in groundwater can we accurately evaluate water quality and exploring the occurrence and source of various arsenic forms is more helpful to clarify the fate of high arsenic groundwater thioarsenic aso4 xsx with x 1 to 4 aso3 ysy with x 1 to 3 is a class of arsenic species that has been paid more attention in recent years it is formed by sh substitution for oh in sulfide rich water herath et al 2018 thermodynamic modelling has been used to predict the existence of up to 32 kinds of thioarsenite and thioarsenate in sulfidic waters helz and tossell 2008 tossell and zimmermann 2008 gradually increasing the degree of substitution results with arsenate in several species monothioarsenate mta dithioarsenate dta trithioarsenate trita and tetrathioarsenate tetrata planer friedrich et al 2007 thioarsenic is widely distributed in hot spring systems rich in sulfur and arsenic with the highest concentration of more than 80 of the total arsenic planer friedrich et al 2007 mta dta and trita were detected at rehai hot springs in southwest china with thioarsenate being the most abundant species in these neutral alkaline waters that feature high sulfide concentrations guo et al 2017 sulfur sulfate or sulfide is indispensable in the formation of thioarsenic and it is a common component in high arsenic aquifer systems nickson et al 2000 guo et al 2014 xie et al 2015 sulfur redox products can form thio arsenic compounds through reaction with arsenic or arsenic iron minerals wilkin et al 2003 suess and planer friedrich 2012 and this directly affects the occurrence form migration and transformation characteristics of arsenic arsenic species can transform to another in sulfide rich groundwater which increases the uncertainty of remediation solutions for areas with high arsenic pollution planer friedrich et al 2007 therefore the transformation process and arsenic migration caused by sulfate reduction in strongly reducing groundwater conditions is very complicated saalfield and bostick 2009 as an important arsenic form in sulfur rich environments the distribution and formation mechanism of thioarsenate is of great significance for the study of arsenic migration and transformation in groundwater system these thio arsenic compounds can be the dominant forms of arsenic in reducing environments and some thermodynamically stable species can even exist in partially oxidized environments planer friedrich et al 2007 2018 laboratory tests and the study of thioarsenate in hot springs make us know that there are great differences in the properties of different kinds of thioarsenate planer friedrich et al 2007 hartig and planer friedrich 2012 keller et al 2014a guo et al 2017 planer friedrich et al 2018 mta can exist in acidic conditions kerl et al 2018 other species need a neutral or weakly alkaline environment and tetrata needs strong alkaline conditions and has only been found in geothermal water with ph 13 planer friedrich and wallschlager 2009 mta is the most stable species can adapt to oxidizing conditions other thioarsenates are unstable and can easily convert to as iii in an oxidizing environment and further oxidize to as v stauder et al 2005 compared with as iii and as v they have lower toxicity and weaker adsorption capacity couture et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 and some of these species can adapt to more complex water environment which makes as v exist as thioarsenate under strong reducing conditions thus explaining the coexistence of as iii and as v in reductive aquifers pi et al 2017b as we know there is no relevant study on the regional distribution and genesis of thioarsenate in fresh groundwater most of the studies focused on the storage and detection methods of thioarsenate keller et al 2014b suess et al 2015 ullrich et al 2016 adsorption properties couture et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 biotoxicity rader et al 2004 kerl et al 2018 and seasonal variation in groundwater planer friedrich et al 2018 however fresh groundwater plays an important role in human production and life as an important species of arsenic in sulfur rich groundwater the distribution and formation mechanism of thioarsenate is important the geochemical cycle of arsenic can be better understood with greater understanding of the distribution and origin of thioarsenate the aims of this study were to i analyze arsenic species in groundwater from the datong basin ii explore for the first time the spatial distribution characteristics of thioarsenate in fresh groundwater iii discuss the formation mechanism of different thioarsenates by combining hydrogeochemical analysis and geochemical models and iv explain the main factors affecting the formation and mobilization of thioarsenates 2 study area the datong basin is a cenozoic basin of the shanxi rift system the basin is about 60 000 km2 in size li et al 2009 xie et al 2009 and consists of loose pliocene to pleistocene sediments at depths from 1500 to 3500 m cheng 1983 gu et al 2015 the grain size of sediments usually decreases from the edge to the center of the basin the sediments in front of the mountains are mainly alluvial river gravel and rough sand while the central basin is lacustrine and alluvial fan lacustrine sandy loam silty sand silty clay and clay with high organic matter content guo and wang 2005 datong basin has a typical arid and semi arid climate with average annual precipitation of 300 to 400 mm precipitation in july and august can account for more than 80 of the annual total annual potential evaporation is more than 2000 mm the river residence time is short e g sanggan river and huangshui river and soil salinization is a serious problem xie et al 2009 li et al 2016 the basin area is divided into three main aquifers fig 1 b a shallow aquifer located at depths from 5 to 60 m and composed of coarse sand and gravel han 2008 a middle aquifer located at depths from 60 to 160 m and composed of sand and gravel and a deep aquifer below depths of 160 m and composed of sand and silt guo and wang 2004 groundwater flow follows two main paths in the basin area from the front of the mountains to the center of the basin and along the center of the basin from the southwest to the northeast the flow rate of groundwater in the area is slow at about 0 20 0 58 m d groundwater flows laterally from bedrock along hillsides and through vertical infiltration of irrigation and meteoric water losses are mainly due to evaporation and manual extraction the groundwater with high arsenic concentration in this area mainly exists in aquifers shallower than 60 m and distributed along the huangshui river according to a previous investigation the maximum as concentration can reach 1 820 μg l xie et al 2013 3 sampling and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling a total of 30 groundwater samples were collected in the datong basin in march and april of 2019 and subjected to arsenic species and hydrochemical analyses samples were collected from west to east along the banks of the huangshui river and were uniformly distributed from the front of the mountains to the center of the basin fig 1 physical and chemical parameters including temperature t ph redox potential eh electrical conductivity ec nitrous nitrogen no2 ammonia nitrogen nh4 hydrogen sulfide hs and ferrous iron fe2 were measured directly in the field groundwater samples were collected by self priming pump after filtering 0 45 μm membrane by vacuum pump anion and cation acidified to ph 2 with ultra pure hno3 samples were collected into 50 ml hdpe bottles alkalinity was measured by the gran titration method immediately after returning to the temporary experimental site in the field samples for arsenic species as v as iii and thioarsenate were collected using a syringe with a plastic tube in the outlet pipe of a self priming pump before water samples came into contact with the air after the 30 ml hdpe sample bottles were rinsed water samples were slowly injected into them from the bottom the headspace volume was reduced as much as possible which is beneficial to the maintenance of arsenic species sample bottles were then quickly frozen 78 5 c in a dry ice bucket until analysis suess et al 2011 3 2 groundwater analysis major cations in groundwater samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical omission spectrometry icp oes thermo scientific icap7600 trace metal composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7900 anion concentrations were measured by ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact ic total as was analyzed by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs afs 820 titan replicates and standards were inserted every 10 samples for quality assurance quality control detection limits were 0 01 mg l for major cations and anions 1 μg l for most trace metals and 0 5 μg l for arsenic the relative standard deviations for the cation anion and arsenic analyses were within 5 field and laboratory blanks were used for calibration or were below detection limits 3 3 arsenic species analysis as v as iii and thioarsenate were separated and detected by high performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icpms using analytical procedures described elsewhere planer friedrich et al 2007 frozen samples were taken out of the dry ice bucket and melted slowly in the glove box during which the bottle cap was opened to allow the release of any dissolved oxygen in the water and avoid a change of arsenic species at the solid liquid interface samples were then transferred into injection bottles and immediately analyzed arsenic species were separated using an anionic column dionex ag as16 ionpac column 20 100 mm naoh flow rate 1 2 ml min icpms was run in monitoring mode to detect m z 75 as v and as iii were quantified via their respective calibration standards due to the lack of commercially available standards for thioarsenates their retention times were determined using standard substances synthesized in the laboratory fig s1 these species were quantified using a calibration based on arsenate according to a previously validated method planer friedrich et al 2007 3 4 geochemical modeling to better understand the formation mechanism of thioarsenate geochemical modeling was conducted using phreeqc interactive 3 4 0 with the wateq4f database updated for aqueous thioarsenate species based on prior works table 1 wilkin et al 2003 helz and tossell 2008 elemental s and as species were redefined in this modeling to avoid excessive side reactions the total amount of each kind of thioarsenate was equal to the sum of the various protonated forms the oxidation reduction potential orp value used in the model is taken from the range of the collected samples and the concentration range of arsenic and sulfur is taken from the overall average level of the sample the range of ph was set between 1 and 14 the orp was set from 3 38 to 3 38 in the form of electronic activity pe and the ratio of sulfide to arsenic was 0 01 to 20 the code of this modeling was enclosed at the supplemental files 4 results and discussion 4 1 general groundwater chemistry the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater samples are listed in table 2 arsenic speciation data for the groundwater samples are shown in table 3 groundwater hydrochemical components are plotted on the piper diagram shown in fig 2 which shows that groundwater evolved from ca hco3 type at the mountain front recharge area to na hco3 cl type at the basin center discharge area the hco3 concentration varied from 157 3 to 654 4 mg l this was the major anion except for a few samples that had cl as the dominant anion na was the major cation in the discharge area with concentrations up to 721 7 mg l and ca2 was the dominant cation in the recharge area with concentrations up to 179 1 mg l this is likely a result of water rock interactions in the source waters the groundwater samples were near neutral to weakly alkaline with ph values varying from 7 50 to 8 63 the total arsenic concentration in the groundwater samples ranged from 0 12 to 3 450 μg l average 224 7 4 44 μg l median 38 0 μg l with 63 3 of the samples exceeding the who recommended value of 10 μg l for drinking water the relationship between arsenic concentration and horizontal distance from the mountain front to the basin center is shown in figs 2 and 4a groundwater samples from the discharge area where the topography is generally flat typically have high arsenic concentrations in contrast groundwater samples from the recharge area usually have low arsenic concentrations several redox sensitive elements were detected in the groundwater samples the concentration of nh4 in several samples was relatively high reaching up to 2 55 mg l with no detectable no3 which implies the occurrence of denitrification in the aquifers in addition multiple samples were noted during sampling to have irritating h2s odors test results showed the concentration of sulfide in the samples was up to 8 480 μg l with no detectable so4 2 indicating the occurrence of sulfate reduction xie et al 2013 although there is no obvious linear correlation between arsenic concentration with so4 2 fig 3 a and no3 fig 3b it is clear that high arsenic groundwater is often accompanied by low concentrations of so4 2 and no3 indicating denitrification and sulfate reduction promote arsenic release the above conditions are evidence of the reducing characteristics of the high arsenic groundwater in this area total fe fet concentration ranged between 0 01 and 0 23 mg l under reducing conditions fet concentrations were usually high with fe ii as the dominant fe species i e fe ii fet ratio of up to 1 00 iron oxides hydroxides are generally accepted to be major carriers of arsenic in aquifer systems xie et al 2008 redox reactions in different stages of the groundwater system can lead to arsenic migration or fixation in a reducing environment the reduction and dissolution of amorphous iron oxide hydroxide leads to increased dissolved fe ii and arsenic pedersen et al 2006 thereby resulting in a moderate positive correlation between groundwater fe ii and total arsenic r 0 63 p 0 05 fig 3c 4 2 spatial distribution of thioarsenate in groundwater thioarsenate was detected in 12 samples in a range from 2 36 to 209 9 μg l average 39 43 0 23 μg l median 14 37 μg l thioarsenate can account for up to 68 of the total arsenic concentration sample sy 28 table 3 this can explain why pentavalent arsenic still acts as the main species in strong reducing environments as reported in previous studies planer friedrich et al 2007 2018 the spatial variation in thioarsenate is similar to that of total arsenic and sulfide thioarsenate containing samples are mainly distributed in the center of the basin and the eastern part of the study area fig 4 in addition thioarsenate is mainly distributed in the discharge area with low sulfate concentration suggesting high arsenic and sulfide concentrations are beneficial for the formation of thioarsenate during the reduction of groundwater sulfate fig 2 a stronger reducing environment is beneficial for the formation of thioarsenate in groundwater fig 5 b thioarsenate is mostly distributed in neutral and weakly alkaline groundwater with a ph from 7 50 to 8 63 fig 5a redox state and ph are crucial for the formation of thioarsenate the relevant literature shows the formation of thioarsenate is directly related to as iii and is more likely to form in neutral and weakly alkaline reducing environments stauder et al 2005 burton et al 2013 sulfide plays an important role in the generation of thioarsenate stauder et al 2005 fisher et al 2008 fig 4b shows an obvious upward trend in sulfide from the recharge area to the center of the basin this is related to the accumulation of organic matter in the center of the basin and the reduction of sulfate pi et al 2018 as a reactant in thioarsenate formation high sulfide concentrations can promote the formation of thioarsenate and enhance the uncertainty of arsenic migration and transformation in groundwater environments therefore most groundwater samples with high sulfur and high arsenic concentration also contain more thioarsenate overall thioarsenate concentration increases with sulfides within a certain range with these parameters demonstrating a strong positive correlation r 0 81 p 0 05 fig 5c this indicates sulfide is indeed an important reaction substrate during the generation of thioarsenate however thioarsenate is not detected when too much sulfide is present fig 5c sample sy 24 arsenic and iron concentrations are also very low in this sample this may due to adsorption by minerals that form from sulfur and iron or the direct formation of as bearing sulfide minerals nickson et al 1998 fendorf et al 2012 s as is also an important indicator for the formation of thioarsenic wood et al 2002 in our study the s as mass ratio of most samples is below 2 4 fig 5e this is also confirmed in geochemical models fig 5f that show the formation of mta and dta is facilitated when the s as ratio is within a certain range e g mass ratio 2 2 therefore excessive sulfide is not conducive to the formation of thioarsenate as iii and as v are the main forms of arsenic in groundwater and they are mainly used as reactants for the formation of thioarsenate as v can be reacted into thioarsenate under the action of microorganisms wu et al 2017 reaction 1 in most cases however as iii is actively involved in the formation of thioarsenate herath et al 2018 in the samples from the datong basin the proportion of thioarsenate increases as as iii decreases with a strong negative correlation r 0 92 p 0 05 fig 5d this indicates that the generation of thioarsenate in this area is mainly due to the consumption of as iii it shows that the form of arsenic as iii in fresh groundwater environment supports the transformation to thioarsenate 4 3 controls on the formation of mta and dta in groundwater mta and dta are the two main forms of thioarsenate detected in fresh groundwater from the study area mta was detected in 12 samples ranging from 2 31 to 82 33 μg l average 18 25 0 13 μg l median 9 83 μg l dta was detected in 10 samples ranging from 0 64 to 125 79 μg l average 22 82 0 11 μg l median 2 83 μg l and trita was only detected in two samples ranging from 1 44 to 1 78 μg l table 3 redox environment and sulfur concentration are the main factors affecting the speciation of thioarsenate stauder et al 2005 from fig 6 a it can be seen that the reduction environment is beneficial to the occurrence of mta and it is likely to be the main species of arsenic however the proportion of mta decreases in stronger reducing environments this indicates that some chemical processes consume mta or that it is converted into other species indeed in stronger reducing environments dta becomes the main form of arsenic present the generation of dta may be carried out through the consumption of mta which would explain the diametrically opposing trends in these two species fig 6b it is also confirmed in the geochemical simulation that with the increase of reducibility the proportion of dta in total arsenic gradually increases fig 6c while mta has strong stability in the reduction environment therefore it is possible that the transformation of mta to dta occurred in this process sulfur and arsenic often coexist in the environment and share similar microbial redox transformations fisher et al 2008 in addition sulfide also greatly influences the concentration and species of thioarsenate present within a suitable sulfide concentration range as sulfide increases the amount of mta and dta present different trends although mta exists in the presence of sulfides the lack of obvious correlation suggests the formation of mta is not directly controlled by sulfides fig 7 a these results also support the view that mta is formed by as iii and soluble elemental sulfur couture and van cappellen 2011 planer friedrich et al 2018 reaction 2 in contrast is the obvious positive correlation r 0 88 p 0 05 between dta and sulfide fig 7b sulfides may be directly involved in the formation of dta as reactants in one of two processes as iii reacting directly with the sulfide to form dta reaction 3 or conversion of mta to dta under the action of the sulfide herath et al 2018 reaction 4 a geochemical modeling was compared to the above result the results show a similar trend that in the range of suitable sulfide concentration for the formation of thioarsenate compounds there is no linear correlation between mta and sulfides but there is a good positive correlation between dta and sulfides fig 7c 7d indicating that it is more favorable for the formation of dta in conventional sulfur rich groundwater the modeling results can be divided into three stages with the increase of sulfides 1 in the first stage of the existence of low sulfides the concentration of both mta and dta increase with the increase of sulfides concentration when the growth rate of mta is faster 2 with the increase of sulfides the formation rate of mta gradually slows down and dta accelerates 3 sulfides continues to increase but the mta begins to decrease while dta continues to form from this process it can be seen that low concentration of sulfides is conducive to the formation of mta but with the increase of sulfides mta may be transformed into dta and other forms of thioarsenate compounds mta is dominant in some samples with high sulfide which validates the previous hypothesis that mta may be related to elemental sulfur in fresh groundwater the formation mechanism of thioarsenate is as follows 1 has o 4 2 h s h a s s 2 x o 4 x 2 o h x 1 4 2 h 3 a s o 3 a q s s h 2 a s o 3 s a q h a q 3 h 3 a s o 3 a q 2 h s a q h 3 a s o 2 s 2 a q h 2 o l 4 h 2 a s o 3 s a q h 2 s a q h 2 a s o 2 s 2 a q h 2 o l 4 4 environmental implications thioarsenate is an important form of arsenic in groundwater environments and of great significance with respect to the migration and transformation of arsenic therein in reducing environments a large number of reduced sulfur species are produced and a large amount of arsenic is released from reduced iron mineral phases thus creating suitable conditions for the formation of thioarsenate previous studies have detected and separated arsenic species in groundwater using anion exchange resins where the uncharged arsenite passes through but the negatively charged arsenate adsorbs on the stationary phase le et al 2000 however this method often ignores the effect of thioarsenate compounds meaning the measured pentavalent arsenic is actually the sum of arsenate and thioarsenate this explains why pentavalent arsenic is the main form of arsenic noted in strong reducing environments planer friedrich et al 2007 2018 in situ remediation technologies such as solid phase extraction or permeable reactive barriers prbs have been applied to remediate high arsenic groundwater in the study region ludwig et al 2009 xie et al 2016b 2016a sulfate reducing bacteria srb technologies to remove arsenic from groundwater also have excellent potential rittle et al 1995 keimowitz et al 2007 de matos et al 2018 under sulfate reducing conditions arsenic can precipitate from water in the form of as2s3 ass or feass nickson et al 1998 fendorf et al 2012 in the presence of iron it can be adsorbed by fes fe3s4 and fes2 alam and mcphedran 2019 however such methods also increase the concentration of sulfides in groundwater promoting the formation of thioarsenate the difference in stability and adsorption performance between thioarsenate and as iii v increases uncertainty with respect to what approach to take in terms of arsenic pollution treatment couture et al 2013 pi et al 2017a the present research aimed to provide information relevant to the migration of arsenic in groundwater systems and provide new knowledge to inform strategies for the treatment of high arsenic groundwater 5 conclusion this study used field investigations and geochemical simulations to determine for the first time the distribution and formation mechanism of thioarsenate in a normal groundwater system vs a hot spring system thioarsenates mta dta and trita are widely distributed in the high arsenic and sulfur groundwater of the datong basin at concentrations of 2 36 209 9 μg l that represent up to 68 of the total arsenic the spatial distribution of thioarsenate matches that of s and as which both increase from the edge to the center of the basin and is mainly present in reducing and neutral to weakly alkaline ph 7 50 to 8 63 groundwater sulfide concentration is the main factor controlling the production of thioarsenate and is positively correlated with thioarsenate for s as mass ratios 2 4 as iii is the main reactant for the formation of thioarsenate the formation mechanisms of mta and dta are different mta may be directly formed by as iii and elemental sulfur in addition to a substitution reaction involving as iii and sulfide dta can also be produced by replacing an sh group of mta in stronger reducing environments combined with the hydrochemical characteristics of this area we discussed the generation and distribution of thioarsenate in normal groundwater which improved our understanding of the migration and transformation of arsenic in sulfur rich groundwater credit authorship contribution statement shutang sun writing original draft

arsenic with the highest concentration of more than 80 of the total arsenic planer friedrich et al 2007 mta dta and trita were detected at rehai hot springs in southwest china with thioarsenate being the most abundant species in these neutral alkaline waters that feature high sulfide concentrations guo et al 2017 sulfur sulfate or sulfide is indispensable in the formation of thioarsenic and it is a common component in high arsenic aquifer systems nickson et al 2000 guo et al 2014 xie et al 2015 sulfur redox products can form thio arsenic compounds through reaction with arsenic or arsenic iron minerals wilkin et al 2003 suess and planer friedrich 2012 and this directly affects the occurrence form migration and transformation characteristics of arsenic arsenic species can transform to another in sulfide rich groundwater which increases the uncertainty of remediation solutions for areas with high arsenic pollution planer friedrich et al 2007 therefore the transformation process and arsenic migration caused by sulfate reduction in strongly reducing groundwater conditions is very complicated saalfield and bostick 2009 as an important arsenic form in sulfur rich environments the distribution and formation mechanism of thioarsenate is of great significance for the study of arsenic migration and transformation in groundwater system these thio arsenic compounds can be the dominant forms of arsenic in reducing environments and some thermodynamically stable species can even exist in partially oxidized environments planer friedrich et al 2007 2018 laboratory tests and the study of thioarsenate in hot springs make us know that there are great differences in the properties of different kinds of thioarsenate planer friedrich et al 2007 hartig and planer friedrich 2012 keller et al 2014a guo et al 2017 planer friedrich et al 2018 mta can exist in acidic conditions kerl et al 2018 other species need a neutral or weakly alkaline environment and tetrata needs strong alkaline conditions and has only been found in geothermal water with ph 13 planer friedrich and wallschlager 2009 mta is the most stable species can adapt to oxidizing conditions other thioarsenates are unstable and can easily convert to as iii in an oxidizing environment and further oxidize to as v stauder et al 2005 compared with as iii and as v they have lower toxicity and weaker adsorption capacity couture et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 and some of these species can adapt to more complex water environment which makes as v exist as thioarsenate under strong reducing conditions thus explaining the coexistence of as iii and as v in reductive aquifers pi et al 2017b as we know there is no relevant study on the regional distribution and genesis of thioarsenate in fresh groundwater most of the studies focused on the storage and detection methods of thioarsenate keller et al 2014b suess et al 2015 ullrich et al 2016 adsorption properties couture et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 biotoxicity rader et al 2004 kerl et al 2018 and seasonal variation in groundwater planer friedrich et al 2018 however fresh groundwater plays an important role in human production and life as an important species of arsenic in sulfur rich groundwater the distribution and formation mechanism of thioarsenate is important the geochemical cycle of arsenic can be better understood with greater understanding of the distribution and origin of thioarsenate the aims of this study were to i analyze arsenic species in groundwater from the datong basin ii explore for the first time the spatial distribution characteristics of thioarsenate in fresh groundwater iii discuss the formation mechanism of different thioarsenates by combining hydrogeochemical analysis and geochemical models and iv explain the main factors affecting the formation and mobilization of thioarsenates 2 study area the datong basin is a cenozoic basin of the shanxi rift system the basin is about 60 000 km2 in size li et al 2009 xie et al 2009 and consists of loose pliocene to pleistocene sediments at depths from 1500 to 3500 m cheng 1983 gu et al 2015 the grain size of sediments usually decreases from the edge to the center of the basin the sediments in front of the mountains are mainly alluvial river gravel and rough sand while the central basin is lacustrine and alluvial fan lacustrine sandy loam silty sand silty clay and clay with high organic matter content guo and wang 2005 datong basin has a typical arid and semi arid climate with average annual precipitation of 300 to 400 mm precipitation in july and august can account for more than 80 of the annual total annual potential evaporation is more than 2000 mm the river residence time is short e g sanggan river and huangshui river and soil salinization is a serious problem xie et al 2009 li et al 2016 the basin area is divided into three main aquifers fig 1 b a shallow aquifer located at depths from 5 to 60 m and composed of coarse sand and gravel han 2008 a middle aquifer located at depths from 60 to 160 m and composed of sand and gravel and a deep aquifer below depths of 160 m and composed of sand and silt guo and wang 2004 groundwater flow follows two main paths in the basin area from the front of the mountains to the center of the basin and along the center of the basin from the southwest to the northeast the flow rate of groundwater in the area is slow at about 0 20 0 58 m d groundwater flows laterally from bedrock along hillsides and through vertical infiltration of irrigation and meteoric water losses are mainly due to evaporation and manual extraction the groundwater with high arsenic concentration in this area mainly exists in aquifers shallower than 60 m and distributed along the huangshui river according to a previous investigation the maximum as concentration can reach 1 820 μg l xie et al 2013 3 sampling and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling a total of 30 groundwater samples were collected in the datong basin in march and april of 2019 and subjected to arsenic species and hydrochemical analyses samples were collected from west to east along the banks of the huangshui river and were uniformly distributed from the front of the mountains to the center of the basin fig 1 physical and chemical parameters including temperature t ph redox potential eh electrical conductivity ec nitrous nitrogen no2 ammonia nitrogen nh4 hydrogen sulfide hs and ferrous iron fe2 were measured directly in the field groundwater samples were collected by self priming pump after filtering 0 45 μm membrane by vacuum pump anion and cation acidified to ph 2 with ultra pure hno3 samples were collected into 50 ml hdpe bottles alkalinity was measured by the gran titration method immediately after returning to the temporary experimental site in the field samples for arsenic species as v as iii and thioarsenate were collected using a syringe with a plastic tube in the outlet pipe of a self priming pump before water samples came into contact with the air after the 30 ml hdpe sample bottles were rinsed water samples were slowly injected into them from the bottom the headspace volume was reduced as much as possible which is beneficial to the maintenance of arsenic species sample bottles were then quickly frozen 78 5 c in a dry ice bucket until analysis suess et al 2011 3 2 groundwater analysis major cations in groundwater samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical omission spectrometry icp oes thermo scientific icap7600 trace metal composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7900 anion concentrations were measured by ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact ic total as was analyzed by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs afs 820 titan replicates and standards were inserted every 10 samples for quality assurance quality control detection limits were 0 01 mg l for major cations and anions 1 μg l for most trace metals and 0 5 μg l for arsenic the relative standard deviations for the cation anion and arsenic analyses were within 5 field and laboratory blanks were used for calibration or were below detection limits 3 3 arsenic species analysis as v as iii and thioarsenate were separated and detected by high performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icpms using analytical procedures described elsewhere planer friedrich et al 2007 frozen samples were taken out of the dry ice bucket and melted slowly in the glove box during which the bottle cap was opened to allow the release of any dissolved oxygen in the water and avoid a change of arsenic species at the solid liquid interface samples were then transferred into injection bottles and immediately analyzed arsenic species were separated using an anionic column dionex ag as16 ionpac column 20 100 mm naoh flow rate 1 2 ml min icpms was run in monitoring mode to detect m z 75 as v and as iii were quantified via their respective calibration standards due to the lack of commercially available standards for thioarsenates their retention times were determined using standard substances synthesized in the laboratory fig s1 these species were quantified using a calibration based on arsenate according to a previously validated method planer friedrich et al 2007 3 4 geochemical modeling to better understand the formation mechanism of thioarsenate geochemical modeling was conducted using phreeqc interactive 3 4 0 with the wateq4f database updated for aqueous thioarsenate species based on prior works table 1 wilkin et al 2003 helz and tossell 2008 elemental s and as species were redefined in this modeling to avoid excessive side reactions the total amount of each kind of thioarsenate was equal to the sum of the various protonated forms the oxidation reduction potential orp value used in the model is taken from the range of the collected samples and the concentration range of arsenic and sulfur is taken from the overall average level of the sample the range of ph was set between 1 and 14 the orp was set from 3 38 to 3 38 in the form of electronic activity pe and the ratio of sulfide to arsenic was 0 01 to 20 the code of this modeling was enclosed at the supplemental files 4 results and discussion 4 1 general groundwater chemistry the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater samples are listed in table 2 arsenic speciation data for the groundwater samples are shown in table 3 groundwater hydrochemical components are plotted on the piper diagram shown in fig 2 which shows that groundwater evolved from ca hco3 type at the mountain front recharge area to na hco3 cl type at the basin center discharge area the hco3 concentration varied from 157 3 to 654 4 mg l this was the major anion except for a few samples that had cl as the dominant anion na was the major cation in the discharge area with concentrations up to 721 7 mg l and ca2 was the dominant cation in the recharge area with concentrations up to 179 1 mg l this is likely a result of water rock interactions in the source waters the groundwater samples were near neutral to weakly alkaline with ph values varying from 7 50 to 8 63 the total arsenic concentration in the groundwater samples ranged from 0 12 to 3 450 μg l average 224 7 4 44 μg l median 38 0 μg l with 63 3 of the samples exceeding the who recommended value of 10 μg l for drinking water the relationship between arsenic concentration and horizontal distance from the mountain front to the basin center is shown in figs 2 and 4a groundwater samples from the discharge area where the topography is generally flat typically have high arsenic concentrations in contrast groundwater samples from the recharge area usually have low arsenic concentrations several redox sensitive elements were detected in the groundwater samples the concentration of nh4 in several samples was relatively high reaching up to 2 55 mg l with no detectable no3 which implies the occurrence of denitrification in the aquifers in addition multiple samples were noted during sampling to have irritating h2s odors test results showed the concentration of sulfide in the samples was up to 8 480 μg l with no detectable so4 2 indicating the occurrence of sulfate reduction xie et al 2013 although there is no obvious linear correlation between arsenic concentration with so4 2 fig 3 a and no3 fig 3b it is clear that high arsenic groundwater is often accompanied by low concentrations of so4 2 and no3 indicating denitrification and sulfate reduction promote arsenic release the above conditions are evidence of the reducing characteristics of the high arsenic groundwater in this area total fe fet concentration ranged between 0 01 and 0 23 mg l under reducing conditions fet concentrations were usually high with fe ii as the dominant fe species i e fe ii fet ratio of up to 1 00 iron oxides hydroxides are generally accepted to be major carriers of arsenic in aquifer systems xie et al 2008 redox reactions in different stages of the groundwater system can lead to arsenic migration or fixation in a reducing environment the reduction and dissolution of amorphous iron oxide hydroxide leads to increased dissolved fe ii and arsenic pedersen et al 2006 thereby resulting in a moderate positive correlation between groundwater fe ii and total arsenic r 0 63 p 0 05 fig 3c 4 2 spatial distribution of thioarsenate in groundwater thioarsenate was detected in 12 samples in a range from 2 36 to 209 9 μg l average 39 43 0 23 μg l median 14 37 μg l thioarsenate can account for up to 68 of the total arsenic concentration sample sy 28 table 3 this can explain why pentavalent arsenic still acts as the main species in strong reducing environments as reported in previous studies planer friedrich et al 2007 2018 the spatial variation in thioarsenate is similar to that of total arsenic and sulfide thioarsenate containing samples are mainly distributed in the center of the basin and the eastern part of the study area fig 4 in addition thioarsenate is mainly distributed in the discharge area with low sulfate concentration suggesting high arsenic and sulfide concentrations are beneficial for the formation of thioarsenate during the reduction of groundwater sulfate fig 2 a stronger reducing environment is beneficial for the formation of thioarsenate in groundwater fig 5 b thioarsenate is mostly distributed in neutral and weakly alkaline groundwater with a ph from 7 50 to 8 63 fig 5a redox state and ph are crucial for the formation of thioarsenate the relevant literature shows the formation of thioarsenate is directly related to as iii and is more likely to form in neutral and weakly alkaline reducing environments stauder et al 2005 burton et al 2013 sulfide plays an important role in the generation of thioarsenate stauder et al 2005 fisher et al 2008 fig 4b shows an obvious upward trend in sulfide from the recharge area to the center of the basin this is related to the accumulation of organic matter in the center of the basin and the reduction of sulfate pi et al 2018 as a reactant in thioarsenate formation high sulfide concentrations can promote the formation of thioarsenate and enhance the uncertainty of arsenic migration and transformation in groundwater environments therefore most groundwater samples with high sulfur and high arsenic concentration also contain more thioarsenate overall thioarsenate concentration increases with sulfides within a certain range with these parameters demonstrating a strong positive correlation r 0 81 p 0 05 fig 5c this indicates sulfide is indeed an important reaction substrate during the generation of thioarsenate however thioarsenate is not detected when too much sulfide is present fig 5c sample sy 24 arsenic and iron concentrations are also very low in this sample this may due to adsorption by minerals that form from sulfur and iron or the direct formation of as bearing sulfide minerals nickson et al 1998 fendorf et al 2012 s as is also an important indicator for the formation of thioarsenic wood et al 2002 in our study the s as mass ratio of most samples is below 2 4 fig 5e this is also confirmed in geochemical models fig 5f that show the formation of mta and dta is facilitated when the s as ratio is within a certain range e g mass ratio 2 2 therefore excessive sulfide is not conducive to the formation of thioarsenate as iii and as v are the main forms of arsenic in groundwater and they are mainly used as reactants for the formation of thioarsenate as v can be reacted into thioarsenate under the action of microorganisms wu et al 2017 reaction 1 in most cases however as iii is actively involved in the formation of thioarsenate herath et al 2018 in the samples from the datong basin the proportion of thioarsenate increases as as iii decreases with a strong negative correlation r 0 92 p 0 05 fig 5d this indicates that the generation of thioarsenate in this area is mainly due to the consumption of as iii it shows that the form of arsenic as iii in fresh groundwater environment supports the transformation to thioarsenate 4 3 controls on the formation of mta and dta in groundwater mta and dta are the two main forms of thioarsenate detected in fresh groundwater from the study area mta was detected in 12 samples ranging from 2 31 to 82 33 μg l average 18 25 0 13 μg l median 9 83 μg l dta was detected in 10 samples ranging from 0 64 to 125 79 μg l average 22 82 0 11 μg l median 2 83 μg l and trita was only detected in two samples ranging from 1 44 to 1 78 μg l table 3 redox environment and sulfur concentration are the main factors affecting the speciation of thioarsenate stauder et al 2005 from fig 6 a it can be seen that the reduction environment is beneficial to the occurrence of mta and it is likely to be the main species of arsenic however the proportion of mta decreases in stronger reducing environments this indicates that some chemical processes consume mta or that it is converted into other species indeed in stronger reducing environments dta becomes the main form of arsenic present the generation of dta may be carried out through the consumption of mta which would explain the diametrically opposing trends in these two species fig 6b it is also confirmed in the geochemical simulation that with the increase of reducibility the proportion of dta in total arsenic gradually increases fig 6c while mta has strong stability in the reduction environment therefore it is possible that the transformation of mta to dta occurred in this process sulfur and arsenic often coexist in the environment and share similar microbial redox transformations fisher et al 2008 in addition sulfide also greatly influences the concentration and species of thioarsenate present within a suitable sulfide concentration range as sulfide increases the amount of mta and dta present different trends although mta exists in the presence of sulfides the lack of obvious correlation suggests the formation of mta is not directly controlled by sulfides fig 7 a these results also support the view that mta is formed by as iii and soluble elemental sulfur couture and van cappellen 2011 planer friedrich et al 2018 reaction 2 in contrast is the obvious positive correlation r 0 88 p 0 05 between dta and sulfide fig 7b sulfides may be directly involved in the formation of dta as reactants in one of two processes as iii reacting directly with the sulfide to form dta reaction 3 or conversion of mta to dta under the action of the sulfide herath et al 2018 reaction 4 a geochemical modeling was compared to the above result the results show a similar trend that in the range of suitable sulfide concentration for the formation of thioarsenate compounds there is no linear correlation between mta and sulfides but there is a good positive correlation between dta and sulfides fig 7c 7d indicating that it is more favorable for the formation of dta in conventional sulfur rich groundwater the modeling results can be divided into three stages with the increase of sulfides 1 in the first stage of the existence of low sulfides the concentration of both mta and dta increase with the increase of sulfides concentration when the growth rate of mta is faster 2 with the increase of sulfides the formation rate of mta gradually slows down and dta accelerates 3 sulfides continues to increase but the mta begins to decrease while dta continues to form from this process it can be seen that low concentration of sulfides is conducive to the formation of mta but with the increase of sulfides mta may be transformed into dta and other forms of thioarsenate compounds mta is dominant in some samples with high sulfide which validates the previous hypothesis that mta may be related to elemental sulfur in fresh groundwater the formation mechanism of thioarsenate is as follows 1 has o 4 2 h s h a s s 2 x o 4 x 2 o h x 1 4 2 h 3 a s o 3 a q s s h 2 a s o 3 s a q h a q 3 h 3 a s o 3 a q 2 h s a q h 3 a s o 2 s 2 a q h 2 o l 4 h 2 a s o 3 s a q h 2 s a q h 2 a s o 2 s 2 a q h 2 o l 4 4 environmental implications thioarsenate is an important form of arsenic in groundwater environments and of great significance with respect to the migration and transformation of arsenic therein in reducing environments a large number of reduced sulfur species are produced and a large amount of arsenic is released from reduced iron mineral phases thus creating suitable conditions for the formation of thioarsenate previous studies have detected and separated arsenic species in groundwater using anion exchange resins where the uncharged arsenite passes through but the negatively charged arsenate adsorbs on the stationary phase le et al 2000 however this method often ignores the effect of thioarsenate compounds meaning the measured pentavalent arsenic is actually the sum of arsenate and thioarsenate this explains why pentavalent arsenic is the main form of arsenic noted in strong reducing environments planer friedrich et al 2007 2018 in situ remediation technologies such as solid phase extraction or permeable reactive barriers prbs have been applied to remediate high arsenic groundwater in the study region ludwig et al 2009 xie et al 2016b 2016a sulfate reducing bacteria srb technologies to remove arsenic from groundwater also have excellent potential rittle et al 1995 keimowitz et al 2007 de matos et al 2018 under sulfate reducing conditions arsenic can precipitate from water in the form of as2s3 ass or feass nickson et al 1998 fendorf et al 2012 in the presence of iron it can be adsorbed by fes fe3s4 and fes2 alam and mcphedran 2019 however such methods also increase the concentration of sulfides in groundwater promoting the formation of thioarsenate the difference in stability and adsorption performance between thioarsenate and as iii v increases uncertainty with respect to what approach to take in terms of arsenic pollution treatment couture et al 2013 pi et al 2017a the present research aimed to provide information relevant to the migration of arsenic in groundwater systems and provide new knowledge to inform strategies for the treatment of high arsenic groundwater 5 conclusion this study used field investigations and geochemical simulations to determine for the first time the distribution and formation mechanism of thioarsenate in a normal groundwater system vs a hot spring system thioarsenates mta dta and trita are widely distributed in the high arsenic and sulfur groundwater of the datong basin at concentrations of 2 36 209 9 μg l that represent up to 68 of the total arsenic the spatial distribution of thioarsenate matches that of s and as which both increase from the edge to the center of the basin and is mainly present in reducing and neutral to weakly alkaline ph 7 50 to 8 63 groundwater sulfide concentration is the main factor controlling the production of thioarsenate and is positively correlated with thioarsenate for s as mass ratios 2 4 as iii is the main reactant for the formation of thioarsenate the formation mechanisms of mta and dta are different mta may be directly formed by as iii and elemental sulfur in addition to a substitution reaction involving as iii and sulfide dta can also be produced by replacing an sh group of mta in stronger reducing environments combined with the hydrochemical characteristics of this area we discussed the generation and distribution of thioarsenate in normal groundwater which improved our understanding of the migration and transformation of arsenic in sulfur rich groundwater credit authorship contribution statement shutang sun writing original draft

5192,floating leaved vegetation alters the flow structure through the combined action of floating leaves stems and the channel bed this study investigated the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity and the turbulence structure of an open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation through theoretical analysis and laboratory experiments bionic lotus leaves fixed on circular wooden cylinders were used to imitate floating leaved vegetation and the 3d velocity field was measured by using an acoustic doppler velocimeter the measured data showed that with the presence of the channel bed and vegetation cover strong velocity gradients appear at the bottom and top layers whereas the velocity is almost uniformly distributed in the internal layer on the basis of the modified mixing length hypothesis the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity was numerically predicted and the prediction results agreed well with the experimental data the model parameters were then determined and the effect of mixing length was analyzed spectral analysis showed that the peak frequency in the streamwise velocity spectra is within the range of 0 1 hz to 0 2 hz and that the vortices are mainly affected by stem scale turbulence quadrant analysis showed that the ejections and sweeps are the major contributors to reynolds stress in the bottom layer inward and outward interactions are prominent in the top layer and the contribution of sweeps and ejections are approximately equivalent to those of outward and inward interactions in the internal layer different to open channel flow featured with emergent rigid vegetation the velocity and wake production decrease while the reynolds stress and shear production increase towards the floating leaf the effect of stem diameter vegetation density stem flexibility and boundary roughness on flow structure of open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation need to be examined in future research keywords floating leaved vegetation velocity distribution turbulence structure spectral analysis quadrant analysis 1 introduction aquatic vegetation which is widely found in rivers lakes wetlands and artificial floating islands can affect physical chemical and biological processes and provide a wide range of ecosystem functions nepf 2012 in general aquatic vegetation can be categorized into submerged emergent free floating and floating leaved vegetation aberle and järvelä 2015 floating leaved vegetation in freshwater systems such as nymphaea tetragona nymphoides cristatum nymphoides peltatum and euryale ferox are aquatic plants rooted in the channel bed with floating leaves and flowers that stand above or are floating on the water surface floating leaved vegetation can mediate trophic interactions affect the phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass absorb nutrients and heavy metals to purify wastewater and play a structuring role in ecosystems accordingly the ecological impact of floating leaved vegetation has been examined in numerous studies cazzanelli et al 2008 assessed and compared the temporal pattern of zooplankton distribution in emergent and floating leaved vegetation results indicated that floating leaved macrophytes might play an important ecological role by providing a predator free space and thereby result in enhanced water transparency through algal control by migrating zooplankton yamaki and yamamuro 2013 evaluated emergent and floating leaved vegetation as refuge areas against predators and as foraging habitats for small fishes seto et al 2013 used a simple dynamic model to investigate the effect of floating leaved vegetation on algal bloom found that floating leaved plants can avoid algae from blooming in different circumstances and mixed vegetation of both submerged and floating leaved vegetation is more resistant to algal invasion than a single type of macrophyte other studies focused on the distribution and biomass change of floating leaved vegetation vonbank et al 2017 conducted a rapid aerial surveillance technique to describe the distribution and abundance of floating leaved vegetation in river system sender 2011 researched the percentage share and biomass of floating leaved vegetation in lakes with varying trophy and way of use analyzed the morphometric features of dominant species saito et al 2018 investigated the seasonal changes in the biomass of trapa spp which is a typical floating leaved vegetation dominating many shallow eutrophic lakes in japan however the hydrodynamic properties of open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation have received little research attention and conclusive results are rare in fact the existence of vegetation covers alters the flow structure and velocity distribution and influences the transportation of sediments and contaminants huai et al 2012 han et al 2018 therefore the flow structure of an open channel with floating leaved vegetation should be investigated unlike suspended or emergent vegetation floating leaved vegetation alters the flow structure due to the combined action of the floating leaves stems and the channel bed the leaves covering the water surface constitutes the floating body and acts as a fixed boundary similar to the channel bed meanwhile the stems act as the drag elements of the flow therefore the upper flow region near the vegetation cover is somehow structurally similar to an inverted emergent vegetation however the former has a solid top boundary whereas the emergent vegetation has a solid bottom boundary given the influence of the channel bed the flow with floating leaved vegetation can be simplified as two groups of emergent vegetation the flow structure induced by the floating leaved vegetation on the upper or lower region shares some similar characteristics with the structure induced by emergent vegetation covering the whole water depth many studies have examined the flow characteristics of open channels with emergent vegetation james et al 2004 lightbody and nepf 2006 wang et al 2015 yamasaki et al 2019 including flow resistance velocity distribution turbulence structure diffusion and dispersion character all of which can be used as reference in studying open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation the impact of floating leaved vegetation on flow characteristics was investigated in this study theoretical models for the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity were established section 2 1 and the determination of model parameters was discussed section 2 2 laboratory experiments were conducted in a flume covered with artificial vegetation section 3 the theoretical predictions were compared with the experimental data sections 4 1 and 4 2 the turbulence structure was examined via spectral analysis and quadrant analysis sections 4 3 and 4 4 and comparison with the emergent rigid vegetation section 4 5 and future research were discussed section 4 6 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 mathematical model for an open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation the upper flow region near the vegetation leaf boundary and the lower flow region near the channel bed are separately affected by vegetation leaf and channel bed roughness the flow region located far from the fixed boundaries are predominantly influenced by stems which act as drag elements that extend over the full water depth therefore the flow characteristics may be affected by boundary roughness and stem density to facilitate the analysis the flow region is divided into the leaf dominated region and bed dominated region with the vegetation leaf and channel bed mainly affecting the former and the latter respectively by assuming that the interface of these two regions is located at the middle depth each region can be considered a combination of fixed boundary and stems and then the flow structure of each region can be analyzed based on the results for the flow with emergent vegetation given the steady uniform flow along the streamwise direction in an open channel with floating leaved vegetation a cartesian coordinate system with the x and z axes in the streamwise and vertical directions is adopted in this study in each region by considering the gravity component the shear stress and the drag force caused by vegetation acting on a volumetric element the momentum equation can be formulated as 1 τ z ρ g s 1 2 ρ c d m d u 2 0 where τ is the shear stress ρ is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity s is the energy slope cd is the drag coefficient m is the density of the vegetation stem d is the cylinder diameter and u is the streamwise velocity the shear stress can be expressed based on mixing length theory as rowinski and kubrak 2002 2 τ ρ l 2 u z u z where l is the mixing length rowinski and kubrak 2002 supposed that the mixing length in the region near the channel bed is proportional to the water depth whereas that of the region away from the channel bed is constant however the linear region is very thin with a depth of less than 5 of the water depth the mixing length l can be expressed as 3 l κ z 0 z l m κ l m z l m where κ is the karman constant κ 0 41 and lm is the critical distance from the boundary in which the mixing length is linearly distributed along the z axis previous studies righetti and armanini 2002 ghisalberti and nepf 2004 huai et al 2009a have shown that the mixing length in the vegetation layer is almost constant along the vertical direction or that the vertical variation is slight and can be ignored therefore assuming that the mixing length is constant across the water depth the mixing length can be modified as 4 l κ l m combining equations 1 2 and 4 yields 5 z u z u z gs κ l m 2 c d m d u 2 2 κ l m 2 0 as a general nonlinear boundary value problem the differential equation can be solved by using the finite difference method which is set up with an equidistant mesh the relevant derivatives in this equation are replaced by the following finite difference representations 6 u z u i 1 u i 1 2 δ z 2 u z 2 u i 1 2 u i u i 1 δ z 2 i 1 2 n where δz is the pre defined step size ui is the velocity on the i th grid node and n is the number of grid nodes the nonlinear systems of the obtained equations are solved by using newton s method one boundary condition of the difference equation is 7 u z k s u λ 8 u where ks is the roughness height u is the shear velocity which is assumed to be equal to flow velocity at the roughness height λ is the resistance coefficient and u is the bulk mean velocity the resistance coefficient can be evaluated by using the following colebrook white formula 8 1 λ 2 lg 2 51 r e λ k s 4 r 3 71 9 re u 4 r υ where re is the reynolds number r is the hydraulic radius and ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient an additional boundary condition is set at the surface level 10 u z z h 0 the shear velocity and resistance coefficient depend on the bulk mean velocity which can be calculated from the vertical profile of the velocity that in turn can be obtained from equation 5 an iterative procedure must be performed for the relevant calculations a bulk mean velocity is assumed as the input in the first iteration and the calculated value of bulk mean velocity is taken as the new boundary value in the subsequent iterations this iterative procedure is repeated until the difference of the shear velocities from two consecutive computations is less than the assumed tolerance level ε here ε 0 00001 m s the velocity profile of the leaf dominated region and bed dominated region can be calculated by using the aforementioned method and the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity across the water depth can be obtained afterward although the calculation is performed separately for each region and the model parameters in each region have different values the continuity of velocity at the region interface should be satisfied that is the velocity in the interface obtained from the leaf dominated region must be equal to that obtained from the bed dominated region 11 u 1 u 2 where u 1 is the velocity in the interface obtained from the leaf dominated region and u 2 is the velocity in the interface obtained from the bed dominated region 2 2 model parameters three parameters namely roughness height ks critical distance lm and drag coefficient cd must be determined before applying the mathematical model 2 2 1 roughness height ks for a fully developed turbulent open channel flow the vertical profiles of streamwise velocity satisfies the log law bonakdari et al 2008 argued that the turbulent boundary layer has a composite layer with inner and outer regions in the inner region which is located close to the boundary and comprises 10 to 20 of the entire boundary layer the velocity distribution can be described as logarithmic the thickness of the inner region is estimated to be 20 of the water depth and the log law distribution ghareh et al 2016 is adopted in this region to estimate the boundary roughness coefficients as follows 12 u u 1 κ ln 30 z k s by fitting the measured velocity data in the form of u a ln z b the values of shear velocity and roughness height can be calculated as 13 u a κ 14 k s 30 e b a the velocity profile of the open channel flow without vegetation can be determined from laboratory measurements and the roughness height of the channel bed can be obtained afterward the roughness height of the vegetation cover can be determined by using the same method which will be described in detail in section 3 2 2 2 critical distance lm the value of lm can be influenced by the roughness height of the top and bottom boundaries vegetation shape and vegetation density a trial and error method is performed to obtain lm with the best fit to the measured velocity data 2 2 3 drag coefficient cd several empirical formulae have been proposed to determine the value of cd according to previous studies the drag coefficient can be determined based on the empirical relationship between cd and the stem reynolds number rd cheng 2012 tang et al 2014 liu and zeng 2017 the froude number fr ishikawa et al 2000 kothyari et al 2009 or in consideration of vegetation density wang et al 2014 schlichting and gersten 1982 proposed the following relationship between cd and the stem reynolds number rd which has been widely used rowinski and kubrak 2002 huai et al 2009a huai et al 2009b 15 c d 3 07 r d 0 618 r d 800 c d 1 800 r d 8000 c d 1 2 8000 r d 10 5 where r d u d ν as the experiments in this paper were conducted in fully turbulent flow we adopted cd 1 3 experimental study experiments were conducted in a 9 m long 0 3 m wide and 0 5 m deep rectangular flume in the state key laboratory of water resources and hydropower engineering science in wuhan university the water depth was kept constant by adjusting the tailgate at the end of the flume and the discharge was recorded by using an electromagnetic flowmeter the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 the artificial floating leaved vegetation consists of a floating bionic lotus leaf made of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer materials and a rigid wooden cylinder stem with diameters of 10 cm and 0 8 cm respectively as shown in fig 2 the leaf can be moved along the wooded stem fixed on the channel bed and is always floating on the water surface in various depths the length of the vegetation region was 5 0 m and the vegetated domain started at 2 5 m downstream of the flume inlet the simulated vegetation was arranged in a parallel pattern with longitudinal interval sx and transverse interval sy of 0 1 m and 0 1 m respectively the cylinder diameter is d 0 8 cm the solid frontal area per unit volume in the plane perpendicular to the flow is a d sx sy and the solid volume fraction occupied by the stems is φ πad 4 with x 0 set at the flume inlet only a slight difference was observed between the mean streamwise velocity profiles in x 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 m therefore the flow can be assumed to be fully developed after x 5 5 m and the measurement section was set at 5 5 m downstream of the flume inlet fig 1 the velocity data u v w corresponding to the longitudinal transversal and vertical directions were recorded by using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a sampling frequency of 50 hz and sampling time of 120 s for each sample two sampling locations were chosen for the velocity measurements fig 3 the first location was on the centerline between two rods location 1 and the other location was behind the vegetation location 2 these two locations covered both the wake and non wake regions the velocity statistics from these locations were averaged to obtain the spatial averaging velocity and reynolds stress the vertical interval of the measuring points in each measuring line ranged from 0 5 cm to 1 0 cm experiments were carried out for three water depths and the parameters used are listed in table 1 to obtain the roughness height of the channel bed and vegetation cover complementary experiments were carried out in the same flume firstly the velocity profile in the open channel flow without vegetation was measured afterward the channel bed was covered by bionic lotus leaves and the new velocity profiles were measured the roughness height of the channel bed and vegetation cover can be determined by using the aforementioned method in section 2 2 experiments were performed under three flow rates q 9 0 5 0 and 2 0 l s with details in table 1 and all runs were performed under uniform flow conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 velocity distribution the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity has three distinct zones namely the bottom layer the internal layer and the top layer fig 4 in the region close to the channel bed the velocity increases along the z axis reaches its maximum value at some distance about 0 2 h according to the experiment results in this paper from the channel bed and remains approximately constant in the internal region an inflection point is observed near the vegetation cover and the velocity gradually decreases and eventually reaches zero at the water surface as shown in fig 4 large velocity gradients appeared at the bottom and top layers and the internal layer is contained within the depth of two inflection points zb and zt here ui is the velocity of the internal layer whereas hb hi and ht are the thicknesses of the bottom internal and top layers respectively fig 5 presents the measured and predicted vertical distributions of streamwise velocity the calculated data agree well with the measurements while the velocity calculated for run 1 is slightly larger than the measured data in the region near the inflection points the correlation coefficient r and average relative error of velocity δv are listed in table 2 to clearly determine the difference between the calculated and measured data the average relative error of velocity δv is defined as 16 δ v 1 n i 1 n v c i v m i v m i where vc is the calculated velocity vm is the measured velocity and n is the number of measured points for each case for all three experiment conditions summarized in table 1 the correlation coefficients between the measured and calculated velocity data ranged from 0 888 to 0 949 and the average relative error of velocity varies from 2 45 to 0 91 the error statistics confirm the reliability and authenticity of the proposed theoretical model 4 2 roughness height and critical distance the roughness height of the channel bed and vegetation cover can be obtained by using the aforementioned method in section 2 2 the values of ks in the bed dominated region under different flow rates are 0 0019 0 0021 and 0 0022 whereas those of ks in the leaf dominated region are 0 0009 0 0010 and 0 0011 given that the value of roughness height is approximately constant under different flow rates during the experiment 0 0021 and 0 0010 are used for ks in the bed dominated and leaf dominated regions respectively table 2 the parameter lm is determined by applying the trial and error method the calculated roughness height and critical distance for each run are shown in table 2 sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effect of lm on the calculation of vertical distribution of streamwise velocity for run 2 the values of lm are set to 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 lm fig 6 presents the velocity profiles with different lm the results indicate that the critical distance significantly affects the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity for the bed dominated region increasing lm results in lower velocities and smaller velocity gradients at the bottom layer lm can significantly affect the thickness of the bottom layer and hb increases from 2 5 cm to 5 0 cm when lm increases from 0 125 cm to 0 375 cm similarly for the leaf dominated region increasing lm leads to larger thickness lower velocities and smaller velocity gradients in the top layer although the thickness of the internal layer hi decreases along with an increasing lm the velocity of the internal layer ui does not change that is lm has no effect on the vertical distribution of the streamwise velocity of the internal layer 4 3 power spectral density analysis to characterize the vortical structures the power spectral density psd of streamwise velocity is analyzed via spectral analysis the time domain signal is translated into the frequency domain signal by using the fast fourier transform fft method and the information from the spectral analysis can effectively represent signal power energy and strength the energy spectrum of streamwise velocity at three locations for run 2 is shown in fig 7 and these locations represent the bottom internal and top layers respectively the frequency corresponding to the peak psd is assumed to be the dominant frequency of the vortices for the whole water depth the peak frequency in the streamwise velocity spectra is within the range of 0 1 hz to 0 2 hz which is consistent with the typical values reported in previous studies on vegetated channel flows ghisalberti and nepf 2002 yang and choi 2009 zhao and huai 2016 huai et al 2019b in addition the energy spectrum at high frequencies exceeding 1 0 hz in this study satisfies the kolmogorov turbulence spectrum with a 5 3 power law scaling the dimensionless strouhal number st fl u has been widely used to describe the relationship between the dominant frequency f and the characteristic length of the vortex l in which u is the characteristic velocity approach velocity in this paper in a wide range of reynolds number values 250 200000 st is nearly constant at 0 21 xiao et al 2019 in canonical canopy flow the dominant vortices can be categorized into shear scale large scale and stem scale small scale vortices on the basis of the dominant frequency obtained from the spectral analysis the characteristic length can be calculated within the range of 8 7 cm to 14 2 cm which is approximately equal to the interval distance between the cylinders s 10 cm tanino and nepf 2008 it proved that the vortices are mainly affected by the stem scale turbulence the two generation mechanisms in the turbulent kinetic energy budget are then explored to check whether the shear or stem wake production dominate the flow the shear production ps and wake production pw are defined as nepf and vivoni 2000 17 p s uw u z 18 p w 1 2 c d a u 3 fig 8 presents the vertical distributions of ps and pw for run 2 mainly affected by the velocity gradient the shear production is near zero in the internal layer and increases toward the channel bed and water surface similar with the velocity distribution the wake production is uniformly distributed in the internal layer and decreases toward the fixed boundaries at the bottom and top layers the wake production is significantly larger than the shear production in the whole water depth even in the bottom and top layers thereby supporting the conclusions that the turbulence production is dominated by wake and that the vortices are mainly affected by the stem scale turbulence 4 4 quadrant analysis quadrant analysis is performed to analyze the turbulent structures of flow with vegetation all contributions to reynolds stress are classified based on the signs of the instantaneous velocity deviations as shown below ghisalberti and nepf 2006 quadrant 1 u 0 w 0 outward interaction quadrant 2 u 0 w 0 ejection quadrant 3 u 0 w 0 inward interaction quadrant 4 u 0 w 0 sweep the four reynolds stress contributions can be separated by a hole region comprising four hyperbolas 19 u w h 0 u w where h 0 is the threshold value the contribution to the reynolds stress in the qi quadrant can be expressed as 20 s i h 0 1 t 0 t c i h 0 t u t w t d t where t is the measurement duration and c i h 0 is the averaging condition which can be expressed as 21 c i h 0 1 u t w t h 0 u w a n d u t w t i s i n t h e q i q u a d r a n t 0 o t h e r w i s e fig 9 shows the vertical distribution of si 0 on measuring line 1 in each case the contributions of inward and outward interactions monotonically increase from the channel bed in the vertical direction whereas those of ejections and sweeps show no significant changes along the vertical direction across the water depth inward interactions are approximately equal to outward interactions and ejections are slightly larger than sweeps in all experimental cases the contributions of sweeps and ejections are smaller than those of outward and inward interactions below z h 0 5 but the opposite is observed when z h 0 5 the signs of s 1 0 and s 3 0 are positive whereas those of s 2 0 and s 4 0 are negative therefore the reynolds stresses are positive near the channel bed z h 0 2 negative near the vegetation cover z h 0 8 and near zero in the internal layer the local maximum values of reynolds stress are observed within the vicinity of the channel bed and vegetation cover the ratio of outward interactions to inward interactions and that of outward and inward interactions to ejections and sweeps in run 2 with h 0 0 are shown in fig 10 based on the vertical distribution of s 1 s 3 the contribution of outward interactions is approximately equivalent to that of inward interactions over the whole water depth the contributions of s 1 s 3 s 2 s 4 show an increasing trend along the vertical direction here s 1 s 3 s 2 s 4 1 when z h 0 2 and s 1 s 3 s 2 s 4 1 when z h 0 8 thereby suggesting that ejections and sweeps are the dominant contributions to reynolds stress near the bottom boundary whereas the inward and outward interactions are prominently close to the top boundary in the region far away from the bottom and top boundaries the contribution of sweeps and ejections are approximately equivalent to those of outward and inward interactions fig 11 presents the ratio of outward and inward interactions to ejections and sweeps for run 2 for various threshold values h 0 with an increasing threshold value the hole region eliminates more small events of the reynolds stress and extracts larger ones in each quadrant huai et al 2019a the values of s 1 s 3 s 2 s 4 obviously vary along with different h 0 near the bottom and top boundaries in the region near the channel bed the ratios decrease along with an increasing h 0 and the ratio at z h 0 095 decreases from 0 28 to 0 10 when h 0 increases from 0 to 6 within the vicinity of the vegetation cover the ratios increase along with h 0 and the ratio at z h 0 975 with h 0 6 is over five times larger than that with h 0 0 the obvious changes in these ratios suggest that the importance of dominant events in each region increases along with an increasing threshold value that is the contributions of ejections and sweeps increase near the channel bed while the inward and outward interactions become much more significant near the vegetation cover the contributions of ejections and sweeps are equivalent to those of inward and outward interactions in the internal layer where the reynolds stress is almost zero and no remarkable changes are observed in the ratio as h 0 increases in this region 4 5 comparison with emergent rigid vegetation the floating leaved vegetation alters the flow structure due to the combined action of the floating leaves stems and the channel bed the floating leaf is the main morphological difference compared with the emergent vegetation and key affecting factor for the different flow characteristic in order to investigate the open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation comprehensively a comparison between flow with floating leaved vegetation and rigid emergent vegetation was conducted nepf 1999 investigated the drag turbulence and diffusion in flow with emergent vegetation experimentally rowinski and kubrak 2002 theoretically investigated the vertical distribution of velocity in flow with emergent vegetation and these studies will be compared with the current work run 2 selected as a representative case the comparison of vertical distribution of streamwise velocity for flow with rigid emergent vegetation and floating leaved vegetation is shown in fig 12 a and that of the shear stress is shown in fig 12 b for flow with emergent vegetation in the region close to the bed the velocity quickly reaches a constant value then the velocity profile turns out to be nearly uniform over the depth the reynolds stress has its maximum value near the channel bed then decreases to zero rapidly along the z axis while for flow with floating leaved vegetation the floating leaves act as a fixed boundary the velocity decreases while the reynolds stress increases towards the boundary and the thickness of the large gradient region is mainly affected by the boundary roughness fig 12 c presents the comparison of vertical distributions of dimensionless shear production ps and wake production pw for the flow with rigid emergent vegetation and floating leaved vegetation here shear production and wake production are normalized by an equivalent shear velocity u m ghi and the flow depth h the shear production ps decreases from the channel bed and nearly reaches zero in the region far from the channel bed the wake production pw increases from the channel bed and is then uniformly distributed while for the flow with floating leaved vegetation due to the existence of the floating leaf the shear production increases and the wake production decreases in the region near the floating leaf for the flow with emergent vegetation the wake production is significantly larger than the shear production across the water depth indicates that the wake production dominates the turbulence production which is similar with that of the flow with floating leaved vegetation 4 6 future research this paper is a preliminary study on the hydrodynamic properties of open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation and it is necessary to further investigate the following fundamental topics 1 effect of the leaf and stem size on flow structure to simulate the natural vegetation accurately effects of different leaf and stem diameters on flow structure need to be considered 2 effect of the vegetation stem density the stem density directly affects the solid volume fraction and the stem drag force then affect the magnitude of velocity and turbulence production therefore it is necessary to investigate flow conditions with different vegetation density 3 effect of the flexible stem the effect of stem flexibility was not considered here and should be examined in future research 4 effect of the floating leaf roughness and bed roughness the boundary roughness mainly influences the velocity and reynolds stress profiles which needs to be further investigated 5 conclusions floating leaved vegetation alters the flow structure via the combined action of floating leaves stems and the channel bed the velocity distribution and turbulence structure of an open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation was investigated in this work by dividing the flow region vertically into the leaf dominated region and bed dominated region a mathematical model was built based on the modified mixing length hypothesis to solve the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity and the results show that the mixing length obviously affects the predicted velocity profile with the presence of the channel bed and vegetation cover strong velocity gradients appear adjacent to the leaf and bed boundary whereas the velocity is uniformly distributed in the internal layer the peak frequency in the streamwise velocity spectra is within the range of 0 1 hz to 0 2 hz which is the typical value in vegetated channel flows the wake production is significantly larger than the shear production and the vortex characteristic length is approximately equal to the interval distance between the cylinders thereby suggesting that the turbulence production is dominated by wake and that the vortices are mainly affected by the stem scale turbulence the ejections and sweeps are the dominant contributions to reynolds stress in the bottom layer inward and outward interactions are prominent in the top layer and the contributions of sweeps and ejections are approximately equal to those of outward and inward interactions in the internal layer the importance of dominating events in each region increases along with threshold value different to open channel flow with emergent rigid vegetation the velocity and wake production decrease while the reynolds stress and shear production increase towards the floating leaf this study contributes to the present understanding of the effects of floating leaved vegetation on hydraulic characteristics in open channels the effect of stem diameter vegetation density stem flexibility and boundary roughness were not considered in this study and should be examined

5192,floating leaved vegetation alters the flow structure through the combined action of floating leaves stems and the channel bed this study investigated the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity and the turbulence structure of an open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation through theoretical analysis and laboratory experiments bionic lotus leaves fixed on circular wooden cylinders were used to imitate floating leaved vegetation and the 3d velocity field was measured by using an acoustic doppler velocimeter the measured data showed that with the presence of the channel bed and vegetation cover strong velocity gradients appear at the bottom and top layers whereas the velocity is almost uniformly distributed in the internal layer on the basis of the modified mixing length hypothesis the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity was numerically predicted and the prediction results agreed well with the experimental data the model parameters were then determined and the effect of mixing length was analyzed spectral analysis showed that the peak frequency in the streamwise velocity spectra is within the range of 0 1 hz to 0 2 hz and that the vortices are mainly affected by stem scale turbulence quadrant analysis showed that the ejections and sweeps are the major contributors to reynolds stress in the bottom layer inward and outward interactions are prominent in the top layer and the contribution of sweeps and ejections are approximately equivalent to those of outward and inward interactions in the internal layer different to open channel flow featured with emergent rigid vegetation the velocity and wake production decrease while the reynolds stress and shear production increase towards the floating leaf the effect of stem diameter vegetation density stem flexibility and boundary roughness on flow structure of open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation need to be examined in future research keywords floating leaved vegetation velocity distribution turbulence structure spectral analysis quadrant analysis 1 introduction aquatic vegetation which is widely found in rivers lakes wetlands and artificial floating islands can affect physical chemical and biological processes and provide a wide range of ecosystem functions nepf 2012 in general aquatic vegetation can be categorized into submerged emergent free floating and floating leaved vegetation aberle and järvelä 2015 floating leaved vegetation in freshwater systems such as nymphaea tetragona nymphoides cristatum nymphoides peltatum and euryale ferox are aquatic plants rooted in the channel bed with floating leaves and flowers that stand above or are floating on the water surface floating leaved vegetation can mediate trophic interactions affect the phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass absorb nutrients and heavy metals to purify wastewater and play a structuring role in ecosystems accordingly the ecological impact of floating leaved vegetation has been examined in numerous studies cazzanelli et al 2008 assessed and compared the temporal pattern of zooplankton distribution in emergent and floating leaved vegetation results indicated that floating leaved macrophytes might play an important ecological role by providing a predator free space and thereby result in enhanced water transparency through algal control by migrating zooplankton yamaki and yamamuro 2013 evaluated emergent and floating leaved vegetation as refuge areas against predators and as foraging habitats for small fishes seto et al 2013 used a simple dynamic model to investigate the effect of floating leaved vegetation on algal bloom found that floating leaved plants can avoid algae from blooming in different circumstances and mixed vegetation of both submerged and floating leaved vegetation is more resistant to algal invasion than a single type of macrophyte other studies focused on the distribution and biomass change of floating leaved vegetation vonbank et al 2017 conducted a rapid aerial surveillance technique to describe the distribution and abundance of floating leaved vegetation in river system sender 2011 researched the percentage share and biomass of floating leaved vegetation in lakes with varying trophy and way of use analyzed the morphometric features of dominant species saito et al 2018 investigated the seasonal changes in the biomass of trapa spp which is a typical floating leaved vegetation dominating many shallow eutrophic lakes in japan however the hydrodynamic properties of open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation have received little research attention and conclusive results are rare in fact the existence of vegetation covers alters the flow structure and velocity distribution and influences the transportation of sediments and contaminants huai et al 2012 han et al 2018 therefore the flow structure of an open channel with floating leaved vegetation should be investigated unlike suspended or emergent vegetation floating leaved vegetation alters the flow structure due to the combined action of the floating leaves stems and the channel bed the leaves covering the water surface constitutes the floating body and acts as a fixed boundary similar to the channel bed meanwhile the stems act as the drag elements of the flow therefore the upper flow region near the vegetation cover is somehow structurally similar to an inverted emergent vegetation however the former has a solid top boundary whereas the emergent vegetation has a solid bottom boundary given the influence of the channel bed the flow with floating leaved vegetation can be simplified as two groups of emergent vegetation the flow structure induced by the floating leaved vegetation on the upper or lower region shares some similar characteristics with the structure induced by emergent vegetation covering the whole water depth many studies have examined the flow characteristics of open channels with emergent vegetation james et al 2004 lightbody and nepf 2006 wang et al 2015 yamasaki et al 2019 including flow resistance velocity distribution turbulence structure diffusion and dispersion character all of which can be used as reference in studying open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation the impact of floating leaved vegetation on flow characteristics was investigated in this study theoretical models for the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity were established section 2 1 and the determination of model parameters was discussed section 2 2 laboratory experiments were conducted in a flume covered with artificial vegetation section 3 the theoretical predictions were compared with the experimental data sections 4 1 and 4 2 the turbulence structure was examined via spectral analysis and quadrant analysis sections 4 3 and 4 4 and comparison with the emergent rigid vegetation section 4 5 and future research were discussed section 4 6 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 mathematical model for an open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation the upper flow region near the vegetation leaf boundary and the lower flow region near the channel bed are separately affected by vegetation leaf and channel bed roughness the flow region located far from the fixed boundaries are predominantly influenced by stems which act as drag elements that extend over the full water depth therefore the flow characteristics may be affected by boundary roughness and stem density to facilitate the analysis the flow region is divided into the leaf dominated region and bed dominated region with the vegetation leaf and channel bed mainly affecting the former and the latter respectively by assuming that the interface of these two regions is located at the middle depth each region can be considered a combination of fixed boundary and stems and then the flow structure of each region can be analyzed based on the results for the flow with emergent vegetation given the steady uniform flow along the streamwise direction in an open channel with floating leaved vegetation a cartesian coordinate system with the x and z axes in the streamwise and vertical directions is adopted in this study in each region by considering the gravity component the shear stress and the drag force caused by vegetation acting on a volumetric element the momentum equation can be formulated as 1 τ z ρ g s 1 2 ρ c d m d u 2 0 where τ is the shear stress ρ is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity s is the energy slope cd is the drag coefficient m is the density of the vegetation stem d is the cylinder diameter and u is the streamwise velocity the shear stress can be expressed based on mixing length theory as rowinski and kubrak 2002 2 τ ρ l 2 u z u z where l is the mixing length rowinski and kubrak 2002 supposed that the mixing length in the region near the channel bed is proportional to the water depth whereas that of the region away from the channel bed is constant however the linear region is very thin with a depth of less than 5 of the water depth the mixing length l can be expressed as 3 l κ z 0 z l m κ l m z l m where κ is the karman constant κ 0 41 and lm is the critical distance from the boundary in which the mixing length is linearly distributed along the z axis previous studies righetti and armanini 2002 ghisalberti and nepf 2004 huai et al 2009a have shown that the mixing length in the vegetation layer is almost constant along the vertical direction or that the vertical variation is slight and can be ignored therefore assuming that the mixing length is constant across the water depth the mixing length can be modified as 4 l κ l m combining equations 1 2 and 4 yields 5 z u z u z gs κ l m 2 c d m d u 2 2 κ l m 2 0 as a general nonlinear boundary value problem the differential equation can be solved by using the finite difference method which is set up with an equidistant mesh the relevant derivatives in this equation are replaced by the following finite difference representations 6 u z u i 1 u i 1 2 δ z 2 u z 2 u i 1 2 u i u i 1 δ z 2 i 1 2 n where δz is the pre defined step size ui is the velocity on the i th grid node and n is the number of grid nodes the nonlinear systems of the obtained equations are solved by using newton s method one boundary condition of the difference equation is 7 u z k s u λ 8 u where ks is the roughness height u is the shear velocity which is assumed to be equal to flow velocity at the roughness height λ is the resistance coefficient and u is the bulk mean velocity the resistance coefficient can be evaluated by using the following colebrook white formula 8 1 λ 2 lg 2 51 r e λ k s 4 r 3 71 9 re u 4 r υ where re is the reynolds number r is the hydraulic radius and ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient an additional boundary condition is set at the surface level 10 u z z h 0 the shear velocity and resistance coefficient depend on the bulk mean velocity which can be calculated from the vertical profile of the velocity that in turn can be obtained from equation 5 an iterative procedure must be performed for the relevant calculations a bulk mean velocity is assumed as the input in the first iteration and the calculated value of bulk mean velocity is taken as the new boundary value in the subsequent iterations this iterative procedure is repeated until the difference of the shear velocities from two consecutive computations is less than the assumed tolerance level ε here ε 0 00001 m s the velocity profile of the leaf dominated region and bed dominated region can be calculated by using the aforementioned method and the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity across the water depth can be obtained afterward although the calculation is performed separately for each region and the model parameters in each region have different values the continuity of velocity at the region interface should be satisfied that is the velocity in the interface obtained from the leaf dominated region must be equal to that obtained from the bed dominated region 11 u 1 u 2 where u 1 is the velocity in the interface obtained from the leaf dominated region and u 2 is the velocity in the interface obtained from the bed dominated region 2 2 model parameters three parameters namely roughness height ks critical distance lm and drag coefficient cd must be determined before applying the mathematical model 2 2 1 roughness height ks for a fully developed turbulent open channel flow the vertical profiles of streamwise velocity satisfies the log law bonakdari et al 2008 argued that the turbulent boundary layer has a composite layer with inner and outer regions in the inner region which is located close to the boundary and comprises 10 to 20 of the entire boundary layer the velocity distribution can be described as logarithmic the thickness of the inner region is estimated to be 20 of the water depth and the log law distribution ghareh et al 2016 is adopted in this region to estimate the boundary roughness coefficients as follows 12 u u 1 κ ln 30 z k s by fitting the measured velocity data in the form of u a ln z b the values of shear velocity and roughness height can be calculated as 13 u a κ 14 k s 30 e b a the velocity profile of the open channel flow without vegetation can be determined from laboratory measurements and the roughness height of the channel bed can be obtained afterward the roughness height of the vegetation cover can be determined by using the same method which will be described in detail in section 3 2 2 2 critical distance lm the value of lm can be influenced by the roughness height of the top and bottom boundaries vegetation shape and vegetation density a trial and error method is performed to obtain lm with the best fit to the measured velocity data 2 2 3 drag coefficient cd several empirical formulae have been proposed to determine the value of cd according to previous studies the drag coefficient can be determined based on the empirical relationship between cd and the stem reynolds number rd cheng 2012 tang et al 2014 liu and zeng 2017 the froude number fr ishikawa et al 2000 kothyari et al 2009 or in consideration of vegetation density wang et al 2014 schlichting and gersten 1982 proposed the following relationship between cd and the stem reynolds number rd which has been widely used rowinski and kubrak 2002 huai et al 2009a huai et al 2009b 15 c d 3 07 r d 0 618 r d 800 c d 1 800 r d 8000 c d 1 2 8000 r d 10 5 where r d u d ν as

state key laboratory of water resources and hydropower engineering science in wuhan university the water depth was kept constant by adjusting the tailgate at the end of the flume and the discharge was recorded by using an electromagnetic flowmeter the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 the artificial floating leaved vegetation consists of a floating bionic lotus leaf made of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer materials and a rigid wooden cylinder stem with diameters of 10 cm and 0 8 cm respectively as shown in fig 2 the leaf can be moved along the wooded stem fixed on the channel bed and is always floating on the water surface in various depths the length of the vegetation region was 5 0 m and the vegetated domain started at 2 5 m downstream of the flume inlet the simulated vegetation was arranged in a parallel pattern with longitudinal interval sx and transverse interval sy of 0 1 m and 0 1 m respectively the cylinder diameter is d 0 8 cm the solid frontal area per unit volume in the plane perpendicular to the flow is a d sx sy and the solid volume fraction occupied by the stems is φ πad 4 with x 0 set at the flume inlet only a slight difference was observed between the mean streamwise velocity profiles in x 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 m therefore the flow can be assumed to be fully developed after x 5 5 m and the measurement section was set at 5 5 m downstream of the flume inlet fig 1 the velocity data u v w corresponding to the longitudinal transversal and vertical directions were recorded by using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a sampling frequency of 50 hz and sampling time of 120 s for each sample two sampling locations were chosen for the velocity measurements fig 3 the first location was on the centerline between two rods location 1 and the other location was behind the vegetation location 2 these two locations covered both the wake and non wake regions the velocity statistics from these locations were averaged to obtain the spatial averaging velocity and reynolds stress the vertical interval of the measuring points in each measuring line ranged from 0 5 cm to 1 0 cm experiments were carried out for three water depths and the parameters used are listed in table 1 to obtain the roughness height of the channel bed and vegetation cover complementary experiments were carried out in the same flume firstly the velocity profile in the open channel flow without vegetation was measured afterward the channel bed was covered by bionic lotus leaves and the new velocity profiles were measured the roughness height of the channel bed and vegetation cover can be determined by using the aforementioned method in section 2 2 experiments were performed under three flow rates q 9 0 5 0 and 2 0 l s with details in table 1 and all runs were performed under uniform flow conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 velocity distribution the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity has three distinct zones namely the bottom layer the internal layer and the top layer fig 4 in the region close to the channel bed the velocity increases along the z axis reaches its maximum value at some distance about 0 2 h according to the experiment results in this paper from the channel bed and remains approximately constant in the internal region an inflection point is observed near the vegetation cover and the velocity gradually decreases and eventually reaches zero at the water surface as shown in fig 4 large velocity gradients appeared at the bottom and top layers and the internal layer is contained within the depth of two inflection points zb and zt here ui is the velocity of the internal layer whereas hb hi and ht are the thicknesses of the bottom internal and top layers respectively fig 5 presents the measured and predicted vertical distributions of streamwise velocity the calculated data agree well with the measurements while the velocity calculated for run 1 is slightly larger than the measured data in the region near the inflection points the correlation coefficient r and average relative error of velocity δv are listed in table 2 to clearly determine the difference between the calculated and measured data the average relative error of velocity δv is defined as 16 δ v 1 n i 1 n v c i v m i v m i where vc is the calculated velocity vm is the measured velocity and n is the number of measured points for each case for all three experiment conditions summarized in table 1 the correlation coefficients between the measured and calculated velocity data ranged from 0 888 to 0 949 and the average relative error of velocity varies from 2 45 to 0 91 the error statistics confirm the reliability and authenticity of the proposed theoretical model 4 2 roughness height and critical distance the roughness height of the channel bed and vegetation cover can be obtained by using the aforementioned method in section 2 2 the values of ks in the bed dominated region under different flow rates are 0 0019 0 0021 and 0 0022 whereas those of ks in the leaf dominated region are 0 0009 0 0010 and 0 0011 given that the value of roughness height is approximately constant under different flow rates during the experiment 0 0021 and 0 0010 are used for ks in the bed dominated and leaf dominated regions respectively table 2 the parameter lm is determined by applying the trial and error method the calculated roughness height and critical distance for each run are shown in table 2 sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effect of lm on the calculation of vertical distribution of streamwise velocity for run 2 the values of lm are set to 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 lm fig 6 presents the velocity profiles with different lm the results indicate that the critical distance significantly affects the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity for the bed dominated region increasing lm results in lower velocities and smaller velocity gradients at the bottom layer lm can significantly affect the thickness of the bottom layer and hb increases from 2 5 cm to 5 0 cm when lm increases from 0 125 cm to 0 375 cm similarly for the leaf dominated region increasing lm leads to larger thickness lower velocities and smaller velocity gradients in the top layer although the thickness of the internal layer hi decreases along with an increasing lm the velocity of the internal layer ui does not change that is lm has no effect on the vertical distribution of the streamwise velocity of the internal layer 4 3 power spectral density analysis to characterize the vortical structures the power spectral density psd of streamwise velocity is analyzed via spectral analysis the time domain signal is translated into the frequency domain signal by using the fast fourier transform fft method and the information from the spectral analysis can effectively represent signal power energy and strength the energy spectrum of streamwise velocity at three locations for run 2 is shown in fig 7 and these locations represent the bottom internal and top layers respectively the frequency corresponding to the peak psd is assumed to be the dominant frequency of the vortices for the whole water depth the peak frequency in the streamwise velocity spectra is within the range of 0 1 hz to 0 2 hz which is consistent with the typical values reported in previous studies on vegetated channel flows ghisalberti and nepf 2002 yang and choi 2009 zhao and huai 2016 huai et al 2019b in addition the energy spectrum at high frequencies exceeding 1 0 hz in this study satisfies the kolmogorov turbulence spectrum with a 5 3 power law scaling the dimensionless strouhal number st fl u has been widely used to describe the relationship between the dominant frequency f and the characteristic length of the vortex l in which u is the characteristic velocity approach velocity in this paper in a wide range of reynolds number values 250 200000 st is nearly constant at 0 21 xiao et al 2019 in canonical canopy flow the dominant vortices can be categorized into shear scale large scale and stem scale small scale vortices on the basis of the dominant frequency obtained from the spectral analysis the characteristic length can be calculated within the range of 8 7 cm to 14 2 cm which is approximately equal to the interval distance between the cylinders s 10 cm tanino and nepf 2008 it proved that the vortices are mainly affected by the stem scale turbulence the two generation mechanisms in the turbulent kinetic energy budget are then explored to check whether the shear or stem wake production dominate the flow the shear production ps and wake production pw are defined as nepf and vivoni 2000 17 p s uw u z 18 p w 1 2 c d a u 3 fig 8 presents the vertical distributions of ps and pw for run 2 mainly affected by the velocity gradient the shear production is near zero in the internal layer and increases toward the channel bed and water surface similar with the velocity distribution the wake production is uniformly distributed in the internal layer and decreases toward the fixed boundaries at the bottom and top layers the wake production is significantly larger than the shear production in the whole water depth even in the bottom and top layers thereby supporting the conclusions that the turbulence production is dominated by wake and that the vortices are mainly affected by the stem scale turbulence 4 4 quadrant analysis quadrant analysis is performed to analyze the turbulent structures of flow with vegetation all contributions to reynolds stress are classified based on the signs of the instantaneous velocity deviations as shown below ghisalberti and nepf 2006 quadrant 1 u 0 w 0 outward interaction quadrant 2 u 0 w 0 ejection quadrant 3 u 0 w 0 inward interaction quadrant 4 u 0 w 0 sweep the four reynolds stress contributions can be separated by a hole region comprising four hyperbolas 19 u w h 0 u w where h 0 is the threshold value the contribution to the reynolds stress in the qi quadrant can be expressed as 20 s i h 0 1 t 0 t c i h 0 t u t w t d t where t is the measurement duration and c i h 0 is the averaging condition which can be expressed as 21 c i h 0 1 u t w t h 0 u w a n d u t w t i s i n t h e q i q u a d r a n t 0 o t h e r w i s e fig 9 shows the vertical distribution of si 0 on measuring line 1 in each case the contributions of inward and outward interactions monotonically increase from the channel bed in the vertical direction whereas those of ejections and sweeps show no significant changes along the vertical direction across the water depth inward interactions are approximately equal to outward interactions and ejections are slightly larger than sweeps in all experimental cases the contributions of sweeps and ejections are smaller than those of outward and inward interactions below z h 0 5 but the opposite is observed when z h 0 5 the signs of s 1 0 and s 3 0 are positive whereas those of s 2 0 and s 4 0 are negative therefore the reynolds stresses are positive near the channel bed z h 0 2 negative near the vegetation cover z h 0 8 and near zero in the internal layer the local maximum values of reynolds stress are observed within the vicinity of the channel bed and vegetation cover the ratio of outward interactions to inward interactions and that of outward and inward interactions to ejections and sweeps in run 2 with h 0 0 are shown in fig 10 based on the vertical distribution of s 1 s 3 the contribution of outward interactions is approximately equivalent to that of inward interactions over the whole water depth the contributions of s 1 s 3 s 2 s 4 show an increasing trend along the vertical direction here s 1 s 3 s 2 s 4 1 when z h 0 2 and s 1 s 3 s 2 s 4 1 when z h 0 8 thereby suggesting that ejections and sweeps are the dominant contributions to reynolds stress near the bottom boundary whereas the inward and outward interactions are prominently close to the top boundary in the region far away from the bottom and top boundaries the contribution of sweeps and ejections are approximately equivalent to those of outward and inward interactions fig 11 presents the ratio of outward and inward interactions to ejections and sweeps for run 2 for various threshold values h 0 with an increasing threshold value the hole region eliminates more small events of the reynolds stress and extracts larger ones in each quadrant huai et al 2019a the values of s 1 s 3 s 2 s 4 obviously vary along with different h 0 near the bottom and top boundaries in the region near the channel bed the ratios decrease along with an increasing h 0 and the ratio at z h 0 095 decreases from 0 28 to 0 10 when h 0 increases from 0 to 6 within the vicinity of the vegetation cover the ratios increase along with h 0 and the ratio at z h 0 975 with h 0 6 is over five times larger than that with h 0 0 the obvious changes in these ratios suggest that the importance of dominant events in each region increases along with an increasing threshold value that is the contributions of ejections and sweeps increase near the channel bed while the inward and outward interactions become much more significant near the vegetation cover the contributions of ejections and sweeps are equivalent to those of inward and outward interactions in the internal layer where the reynolds stress is almost zero and no remarkable changes are observed in the ratio as h 0 increases in this region 4 5 comparison with emergent rigid vegetation the floating leaved vegetation alters the flow structure due to the combined action of the floating leaves stems and the channel bed the floating leaf is the main morphological difference compared with the emergent vegetation and key affecting factor for the different flow characteristic in order to investigate the open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation comprehensively a comparison between flow with floating leaved vegetation and rigid emergent vegetation was conducted nepf 1999 investigated the drag turbulence and diffusion in flow with emergent vegetation experimentally rowinski and kubrak 2002 theoretically investigated the vertical distribution of velocity in flow with emergent vegetation and these studies will be compared with the current work run 2 selected as a representative case the comparison of vertical distribution of streamwise velocity for flow with rigid emergent vegetation and floating leaved vegetation is shown in fig 12 a and that of the shear stress is shown in fig 12 b for flow with emergent vegetation in the region close to the bed the velocity quickly reaches a constant value then the velocity profile turns out to be nearly uniform over the depth the reynolds stress has its maximum value near the channel bed then decreases to zero rapidly along the z axis while for flow with floating leaved vegetation the floating leaves act as a fixed boundary the velocity decreases while the reynolds stress increases towards the boundary and the thickness of the large gradient region is mainly affected by the boundary roughness fig 12 c presents the comparison of vertical distributions of dimensionless shear production ps and wake production pw for the flow with rigid emergent vegetation and floating leaved vegetation here shear production and wake production are normalized by an equivalent shear velocity u m ghi and the flow depth h the shear production ps decreases from the channel bed and nearly reaches zero in the region far from the channel bed the wake production pw increases from the channel bed and is then uniformly distributed while for the flow with floating leaved vegetation due to the existence of the floating leaf the shear production increases and the wake production decreases in the region near the floating leaf for the flow with emergent vegetation the wake production is significantly larger than the shear production across the water depth indicates that the wake production dominates the turbulence production which is similar with that of the flow with floating leaved vegetation 4 6 future research this paper is a preliminary study on the hydrodynamic properties of open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation and it is necessary to further investigate the following fundamental topics 1 effect of the leaf and stem size on flow structure to simulate the natural vegetation accurately effects of different leaf and stem diameters on flow structure need to be considered 2 effect of the vegetation stem density the stem density directly affects the solid volume fraction and the stem drag force then affect the magnitude of velocity and turbulence production therefore it is necessary to investigate flow conditions with different vegetation density 3 effect of the flexible stem the effect of stem flexibility was not considered here and should be examined in future research 4 effect of the floating leaf roughness and bed roughness the boundary roughness mainly influences the velocity and reynolds stress profiles which needs to be further investigated 5 conclusions floating leaved vegetation alters the flow structure via the combined action of floating leaves stems and the channel bed the velocity distribution and turbulence structure of an open channel flow with floating leaved vegetation was investigated in this work by dividing the flow region vertically into the leaf dominated region and bed dominated region a mathematical model was built based on the modified mixing length hypothesis to solve the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity and the results show that the mixing length obviously affects the predicted velocity profile with the presence of the channel bed and vegetation cover strong velocity gradients appear adjacent to the leaf and bed boundary whereas the velocity is uniformly distributed in the internal layer the peak frequency in the streamwise velocity spectra is within the range of 0 1 hz to 0 2 hz which is the typical value in vegetated channel flows the wake production is significantly larger than the shear production and the vortex characteristic length is approximately equal to the interval distance between the cylinders thereby suggesting that the turbulence production is dominated by wake and that the vortices are mainly affected by the stem scale turbulence the ejections and sweeps are the dominant contributions to reynolds stress in the bottom layer inward and outward interactions are prominent in the top layer and the contributions of sweeps and ejections are approximately equal to those of outward and inward interactions in the internal layer the importance of dominating events in each region increases along with threshold value different to open channel flow with emergent rigid vegetation the velocity and wake production decrease while the reynolds stress and shear production increase towards the floating leaf this study contributes to the present understanding of the effects of floating leaved vegetation on hydraulic characteristics in open channels the effect of stem diameter vegetation density stem flexibility and boundary roughness were not considered in this study and should be examined

5193,the quantification of point source ps pollution and non point source nps pollution in different regions is needed so that targeted management strategies for water environment managers can be prepared the aim of this study was to establish a method for quantifying ps and nps pollution by measuring ion concentrations the danjiangkou reservoir and its main tributaries were selected as the study area the spatiotemporal variation in the concentration of nutrients and ions was analyzed the results showed that the main ions did not display any distinct spatiotemporal variations on the reservoir but spatiotemporal variations were evident in the tributaries mg2 na so4 2 and cl were lowest in the wet season k was highest in the dry to wet transition season and si was highest in the wet season we selected cl tn so4 2 tn and na tn as ps pollution tracking indicators and k tn ca2 tn and si tn as nps pollution tracking indicators the mean contribution rate of nps pollution calculated using cl tn na tn and si tn and by the isotope approach had a significant linear relationship p 0 01 therefore cl tn na tn and si tn were used to quantitatively assess the pollution sources the calculated results indicated the tn load was dominated by the nps pollution and the average contribution rates of nps of tn in the tributaries from the dry season to the wet season were 79 83 and 93 respectively the tn load of nps was highest during the wet season with a maximum value over 400 10 3 t a 1 km 2 while the tn load of ps was highest during the dry season with a maximum value of 39 3 t a 1 this study provides a new approach to the quantitative analysis of pollution sources by using hydrochemical characteristic ion indicators keywords pollution point source ps non point source nps hydrochemical characteristics ion indicators nutrients 1 introduction eutrophication caused by excessive nitrogen and phosphorus inputs has caused many ecological and environmental problems such as the frequent occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and a decline in biodiversity eutrophication has not been adequately addressed globally and remains a major global water environment problem smith and schindler 2009 reducing nutrient emissions is fundamental to improving water quality and restoring the health of aquatic ecosystems both point source ps pollution e g domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater and non point source nps pollution need to be controlled to reduce eutrophication kronvang et al 1995 wu and chen 2013 the quantification of ps pollution and nps pollution in different regions is required so that targeted management strategies for water environment managers can be created several methods have been proposed for quantifying ps and nps pollution these methods include the use of multivariate statistical analysis dual stable isotopes a combination of 15n and 18o in nitrate hydrological and water quality watershed models geographical information systems gis technology and hydrochemical characteristics shrestha and kazama 2007 rogers et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2007 nas and berktay 2006 singh et al 2008 the multivariate statistical method is generally used to analyze the spatiotemporal variation in water quality however this method could just infer the co relationships and the source of contaminants preliminarily and its successful application is dependent on abundant data being available bu et al 2010 the dual stable isotope a combination of 15n and 18o nitrate approach is frequently applied to trace sources of nitrate this approach is based on the distinct isotopic characteristics of nitrate from different sources that are caused by the fractionation of isotopes in natural circulation johannsen et al 2008 gautam and iqbal 2010 although this method is accurate and reliable isotopic measurements are expensive and require the use of sophisticated technology rogers et al 2012 hydrological and water quality watershed models can also be applied to identify sources of pollutants dimitriou et al 2017 tim and jolly 1994 in addition gis can be employed to address the issue of spatial heterogeneity praharaj et al 2002 ahn and chon 1999 however it is difficult to effectively apply models and gis in many areas with a paucity of data because large amounts of data are required to calibrate parameters hydrochemical characteristics method uses the main ion composition to track contaminants generated by natural and anthropogenic processes the method has the advantages of being based on sound principles easy to implement and low cost previous investigations have shown that the main ions produced by ps pollution are na cl and so4 2 kaushal et al 2005 meybeck 2003 tao et al 2013 lang et al 2006 favara et al 2000 singh et al 2004 in water that is more heavily affected by nps pollution than ps pollution the main ions produced are ca2 mg2 k and si meybeck 1987 millot et al 2003 singh et al 2008 all the major ions associated with ps and nps pollution are found together with nutrients and are positively correlated with nutrients at present hydrochemical characteristics method is only used to qualitatively analyze pollution sources our hypothesis is that the quantitative evaluation of ps and nps pollution can be realized by using measurements of ion concentrations the aim of this study was therefore to establish a method for quantifying ps and nps pollution by measuring ion concentrations the danjiangkou reservoir and its main tributaries were selected as the study area the spatiotemporal variation in the concentration of nutrients and ions was analyzed the contribution rate of ps and nps pollution at various sites was calculated based on the characteristic ions of these two sources the results obtained using ion concentrations were verified by results obtained using the dual stable isotope approach moreover the spatiotemporal distribution of nps and ps pollution load for the upstream tributary watershed of the danjiangkou reservoir was assessed quantitatively 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the sampling sites and water sampling the danjiangkou reservoir 32 20 33 45 n 110 40 111 50 e is located at the border of hubei and henan province china and has a water surface area of 745 km2 it is the main drinking water source for the middle route of china s south to north water transfer project snwtp li and zhang 2010 the average annual precipitation is about 873 mm and the interannual variability is large about 80 of the precipitation falls during may to october fig 1 a total of 20 sampling sites were selected for the danjiangkou reservoir and its main tributaries samples d1 to d12 were taken from the danjiang river djr qihe river qr dinghe river dr laoguanhe river lgr and sheweihe river swr and samples d13 to d20 were taken from the danjiangkou reservoir reservoir the terms in brackets e g djr reservoir refer to sampling groups in addition 11 wastewater samples and 11 soil samples were collected evenly in the study area fig 2 sampling was carried out from september 2017 to august 2018 over a one year period samples were collected at the beginning of each month all the samples were collected on the same day for each sampling the sampling period was divided into three seasons according to precipitation the dry season november december january and february the dry to wet transition season march april may and june and the wet season july august september and october water samples were collected along cross sections of the river 0 1 m below the surface sampling was done using 1 l high density polyethylene hdpe sample bottles the bottles had previously been soaked in 15 concentrated nitric acid for 48 h and then rinsed with milli q water several times li et al 2009 acid washed bottles were rinsed three times with sampled water before sampling concentrations of hco3 were measured on site by acid titration using hydrochloric acid each sample was titrated 2 to 3 times the average error was 5 wastewater samples domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater were collected using 1 l hdpe bottles at the beginning of march 2018 a five point sampling method was used to collect soil samples from 0 to 20 cm soil profiles using a 5 cm soil auger all soil samples were placed in zip lock bag immediately to avoid contamination three parallel samples were collected from each sampling site samples were kept cool in the field by being placed in ice and transported to the laboratory as quickly as possible 2 2 chemical analysis in the laboratory the water samples and wastewater samples for measuring major ions were immediately filtered using pre rinsed 0 45 µm cellulose membranes millipore the soil samples were air dried and passed through a 1 0 mm stainless steel sieve the soil was extracted with milli q water soil solution 1 5 w v after shaking for 3 min the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 6 min and then filtered through pre rinsed 0

analysis were filtered with pre rinsed 0 2 µm cellulose membranes and frozen below 20 c until analysis major cations mg2 k na and ca2 and si were determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass emission spectrometer icap qc thermofisher ma usa major anions cl so4 2 and no3 were measured using an ion chromatograph ic ics 1100 dionex sunnyvale usa the analytical precision was within 5 total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were measured according to the methods for the examination of water and wastewater protocols apha 2005 the concentration of nitrate nitrogen no3 n was calculated based on the measured no3 concentration isotopic analysis of nitrate was performed using a denitrifier method in which nitrate was converted to n2o the δ15n and δ18o values were determined using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime100 elementar hanau germany at the institute of applied ecology at the chinese academy of sciences shenyang the stable isotope facility was normalized to multiple laboratory working standards that were previously calibrated to international standards usgs32 usgs34 and usgs35 the precision for the δ15n and δ18o values were 0 4 and 1 0 respectively based on replicate analysis of the working standards and calibrations high purity reagents and milli q water were used for all analyses all laboratory equipment was pre washed with 15 concentrated nitric acid and then rinsed with milli q water all processing was done using three parallels 2 3 quantitative assessment of pollutant sources in the current study two methods were used to quantify the source of nitrogen the first method was based on hydrochemical characteristic ion indicators the calculation was according to the following formulas 1 c i o n water c t n water c i o n soil ε 1 c t n water f nps c i o n sew ε 2 c t n water f ps 2 f ps f nps 1 3 c t n soil c t n ave w a t e r ε 1 4 c t n sew c t n ave w a t e r ε 2 5 f tn n p s f nps c t n soil c t n water 6 f tn p s f ps c t n sew c t n water 7 f tn p s f tn n p s 1 where c ion soil c ion sew and c ion water are the ion concentrations of the soil extract wastewater and water sample mg l 1 respectively c tn soil c tn sew and c tn water are the total nitrogen concentrations mg l 1 of the soil extract wastewater and water samples respectively c tn ave water is the average total nitrogen concentration for the 20 water samples over 12 months ie 240 samples mg l 1 ε 1 and ε 2 are ratios of the total nitrogen of soil extract to the total nitrogen of water sample and the total nitrogen of wastewater to the total nitrogen of water sample respectively f ps f tn ps and f nps f tn n ps are the contribution rates of ps and nps of water quantity total nitrogen respectively because of the lack of surface runoff data the average concentration of total nitrogen in all watersheds except for the reservoir area during the wet season was used as the concentration of total nitrogen in the soil extract ie c tn soil the second method was based on the dual stable isotope approach this approach involves the following formulas liu et al 2013 8 δ 15 n f ps δ 15 n ps f nps δ 15 n nps 9 δ 18 o f ps δ 18 o ps f nps δ 18 o nps 10 f ps f nps 1 where δ 15 n nps δ 18 o nps δ 15 n ps δ 18 o ps and δ 15 n δ 18 o are the δ 15 n δ 18 o values of nitrate from the soil extract wastewater and water sample respectively f ps and f nps are the contribution rates of ps and nps of nitrate nitrogen respectively specifically the contribution rates of ps and nps of the water quantity were obtained by calculating the contribution of a certain ion indicator of pollution source samples to the corresponding ion indicator of water samples firstly then the contribution rates of ps and nps of tn were obtained by calculating the contribution of the tn concentration of pollution source samples to the tn concentration of water samples next the contribution rates of ps and nps of no3 n were calculated by the dual stable isotope approach since nitrogen in river water is mainly in the form of no3 n deutsch et al 2006 the nps contribution rates of tn and no3 n should be linear finally the nps contribution rates of tn obtained by the hydrochemical characteristic ion indicators method were compared with the nps contribution rates of no3 n obtained by the dual stable isotope method 2 4 analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of pollution load in this study the spatiotemporal distribution of pollution load of nps and ps was assessed for the upstream tributary watershed of danjiangkou reservoir the watershed area was determined by high resolution 30 m digital elevation data from digital elevation model of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem frey and paul 2012 specifically the spatiotemporal distribution of nps pollution load was analyzed using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method idw interpolation method estimates the value of an unknown point according to a function of the reciprocal of the distance from adjacent sample points shahbeik et al 2014 the spatiotemporal distribution of ps pollution load was represented by different circular areas 2 5 data processing and statistics statistical analyses were performed using the statistical program for social sciences spss 11 0 software regression and correlation analyses were used to examine the relationships between variables using a p value of 0 05 to determine significance all data were graphed and descriptively analyzed using origin 10 5 software maps of the sampling sites and spatiotemporal distribution of pollution load of ps and nps were created using arcgis 11 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal variation in nutrient concentration the nutrient concentrations in tributary rivers and the reservoir were shown in fig 3 the concentrations of tn and no3 n varied from 0 72 mg l 1 to 8 88 mg l 1 and from 0 21 mg l 1 to 8 31 mg l 1 respectively and the mean values were 2 90 mg l 1 and 2 03 mg l 1 respectively the concentration trends of tn and no3 n were basically the same most watersheds had higher concentrations in the dry season the concentrations of tp and nh4 n ranged from 0 01 mg l 1 to 0 17 mg l 1 and 0 04 mg l 1 to 0 51 mg l 1 respectively with averages of 0 04 mg l 1 and 0 16 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of tp and nh4 n in the tributary rivers increased gradually from the dry season to the wet season the nutrient concentrations were lower in the reservoir than in the tributary rivers with no obvious spatiotemporal variation in general nitrogen and phosphorus in rivers are derived from ps pollution during the dry season however a large amount of nps pollution containing nitrogen and phosphorus is discharged into the rivers as a result of erosion by rainfall runoff during the wet season duan et al 2016 therefore high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the dry season are used to indicate ps pollution while high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the wet season are used to indicate nps pollution in this study the tp concentrations of most watersheds in the wet season were significantly higher than that in the dry season which reflected the existence of large amounts of nps pollution however seasonal changes in phosphorus did not demonstrate any information about ps pollution nh4 n was generally used as the main pollution indicator of ps pollution such as domestic wastewater guo et al 2014 in the areas with heavy ps pollution the concentrations of nh4 n in the wet season should be obviously lower than that in the dry season due to the dilution of abundant rainfall during the wet season however the results of our study did not conform to this pattern there may be two causes for this 1 the high temperature during the wet season accelerated ammoniation and thus the release of nh4 n in the sediment cloete and kritzinger 1984 and 2 the increase in anthropogenic domestic wastewater discharge in summer led to the rising of the nh4 n concentrations smith et al 2012 it was therefore difficult to use the seasonal changes of nh4 n for evaluating the quantitative contribution of ps and nps pollution in addition the seasonal variation in no3 n was almost the same as the variation in tn in summary it seems reasonable to conclude that the higher concentration of tn in the dry season indicated the existence of ps pollution while the higher concentration of tp in the wet season can reflect the existence of nps pollution in this context there was obviously ps pollution in djr and dr and clear nps pollution in djr qr and swr nevertheless it was still unclear how the contributions of ps and nps pollution can be quantified based on the seasonal variation in nutrient concentration 3 2 spatiotemporal variation in major ions concentration the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 both displayed large ranges from 16 6 mg l 1 to 87 9 mg l 1 and from 3 6 mg l 1 to 34 2 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of na and k varied from 1 2 mg l 1 to 22 2 mg l 1 and from 3 4 mg l 1 to 12 8 mg l 1 respectively and the mean values were 8 1 mg l 1 and 6 3 mg l 1 respectively the mean concentration of si was 5 2 mg l 1 and the maximum value reached 13 9 mg l 1 which occurred in qr during the dry to wet transition season the concentration of so4 2 varied from 6 8 mg l 1 to 81 4 mg l 1 with an average of 35 9 mg l 1 the mean concentration of cl was 9 6 mg l 1 and the maximum value was 29 6 mg l 1 in dr during the dry to wet transition season the concentration of hco3 displayed a comparatively large value with an average of 143 2 mg l 1 ranging from 82 8 mg l 1 to 226 1 mg l 1 fig 4 in the tributary rivers the concentrations of mg2 and so4 2 decreased gradually from the dry season to the wet season the concentrations of na and cl were lowest in the wet season while the concentrations of k and si were highest in the dry to wet transition season and the wet season respectively the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 remained relatively stable the ternary diagrams fig 5 showed that ca2 was the dominant cation contributing about 63 to the major cation budget anion chemistry was dominated by hco3 constituting 72 of the total anions while cl and so4 2 contributed about 5 and 4 respectively overall water in the danjiangkou reservoir and its main tributaries were of the ca2 and hco3 type which was consistent with the results of previous studies li and zhang 2008 li and zhang 2009 generally the hydrochemistry of water controlled by rock weathering especially carbonate rock weathering has higher concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 meybeck 2003 chen et al 2002 therefore the hco3 ca type ion characteristics indicated that the ions in the danjiangkou reservoir area were mainly derived from nps pollution despite these observations it was not possible to quantitatively assess the contribution rates of ps and nps pollution yet 3 3 main ions and water quality indices of wastewater and soil extract the study compared the ion composition of wastewater and soil extract results showed that the concentrations of ca2 k and si in soil extract were significantly higher than those in wastewater in contrast the concentrations of na so4 2 cl tn and nh4 n in wastewater were obviously higher than those in soil extract fig 6 fig 7 illustrated the concentrations of major ions of ps pollution e g wastewater and nps pollution e g runoff from previous investigations covering other areas the specific values were shown in table s1 and table s2 see the supplementary material similar to our investigation the concentrations of na cl and so4 2 in wastewater were generally higher than these ions in runoff kelly et al 2010 reynolds et al 1989 singh et al 2010 lang et al 2006 chetelat et al 2008 while the concentrations of ca2 k and si in runoff were substantially higher than these ions in wastewater reynolds et al 1989 duysings et al 1983 nightingale 1987 göbel et al 2007 vuai et al 2003 clay et al 2010 the natural differences in the composition of major ions in the wastewater and runoff provided an important basis for dividing nps pollution and ps pollution 3 4 qualitative analysis of pollution sources the discussion in the previous sections showed that both nps and ps pollution had characteristic ions that can be used to qualitatively distinguish the pollution sources however representative runoff ion concentration data cannot be obtained on account of variations in the volume intensity and time of rainfall besides since the soil water ratio was different from the actual rainfall process the absolute ion concentration of soil extract cannot be directly used to evaluate the contribution of nps pollution and ps pollution therefore a characteristic ion tn was selected as the traceability indicator fig 8 showed that cl tn so4 2 tn and na tn were higher in wastewater which can be used as indicators to trace ps pollution while k tn ca2 tn mg2 tn and si tn were higher in soil extract which can be used as indicators to trace nps pollution these ion indicators presented two regions on the radar map a ps region enclosed by wastewater sampling points and a nps region enclosed by soil extract sampling points on account of the homology of ca2 and mg2 in this study area li and zhang 2010 only ca2 tn was used the final ion indicators selected for use as tracers were cl tn so4 2 tn na tn k tn ca2 tn and si tn the above ion indicators were calculated for different watersheds which were then superimposed on the ps region and nps region the larger the area superimposed on the nps region the larger the contribution of nps pollution otherwise the contribution of ps pollution was larger thus the pollution sources could be qualitatively analyzed using this approach the results indicated that all watersheds had a large contribution of nps pollution in all seasons and that the contribution of nps pollution in djr and lgr gradually increased from the dry season to the wet season fig 9 3 5 quantification of pollution sources a quantitative analysis of pollution sources was obtained by using hydrochemical characteristic ion indicators under ideal conditions the contribution of pollution sources calculated using different ion indicators should be the same however errors arose in the calculated results because of the differences between the mean values of pollution samples used in this study and the actual values which were subject to spatiotemporal variations to be more accurate appropriate ion indicators were selected for quantitative assessment and averaging the nps and ps contribution rates of tn were calculated individually using the selected ion indicators in addition δ15n and δ18o in nitrate were also used to quantify the nps and ps contribution rates of no3 n the specific values of δ15n and δ18o in nitrate for the danjiangkou reservoir and its tributaries were shown in fig s1 see the supplementary material the nps contribution rates of tn obtained using the hydrochemical characteristic ion indicator method were compared with the nps contribution rates of no3 n obtained using the isotope method fig 10 it can be seen that there was a clear linear relationship between the contribution rate of nps pollution calculated using cl tn na tn and si tn indicators and the contribution rate of nps pollution calculated using isotopes p 0 01 moreover the mean contribution rate of nps pollution calculated by the three ion indicators and by the isotope method had a more significant linear relationship p 0 01 consequently the mean contribution rate calculated using cl tn na tn and si tn was selected to quantitatively and reliably assess the pollution sources in addition the contribution rates of nps of the characteristic ion indicators for the danjiangkou reservoir and its tributaries were shown in fig s2 see the supplementary material the contribution rate of nps of tn was quantified using the mean contribution rate calculated by cl tn na tn si tn the tn load was determined from the tn concentration and the river discharge as shown in fig 11 the highest tn load was in djr from the dry season to the wet season the contribution rates of nps of tn decreased first and then increased which were 91 79 and 91 respectively and the variation trend of tn load was the same which were 4407 6 t a 1 1605 6 t a 1 and 3453 8 t a 1 respectively the lowest tn load was in swr where the contribution rates of nps of tn for the dry dry to wet transition and wet seasons were 83 85 and 99 respectively and the tn load were 220 1 t a 1 303 1 t a 1 and 649 6 t a 1 respectively the contribution rates of nps of tn and the tn load gradually increased from the dry season to the wet season except for the reservoir area the average contribution rates of nps of tn were 79 83 and 93 respectively and the average tn loads were 1419 2 t a 1 696 6 t a 1 2007 8 t a 1 respectively from the dry season to the wet season the tn input was dominated by the nps pollution and the tn load was highest during the wet season the spatiotemporal distribution of tn load of nps and ps for the upstream tributary watershed of the danjiangkou reservoir was shown in fig 12 on the whole the tn load of nps was highest during the wet season among which the tn load of nps exceeded 400 10 3 t a 1 km 2 in the downstream watershed of djr qr and swr the tn load of nps was relatively low during the dry to wet transition season the highest tn load of nps exceeded 200 10 3 t a 1 km 2 during the dry season which occurred in djr and dr watershed the tn load of ps was highest during the dry season which ranged from 2 5 t a 1 to 39 3 t a 1 with an average of 14 7 t a 1 the average of tn load of ps was 10 1 t a 1 during the dry to wet transition season and the maximum value reached 33 1 t a 1 which occurred in djr watershed the tn load of ps ranged from 0 1 t a 1 to 32 0 t a 1 with an average of 11 7 t a 1 during the wet season the quantitative assessment of spatiotemporal distribution of nps and ps pollution load provided a significant reference for water pollution management of the danjiangkou reservoir area 4 conclusion 1 water in the danjiangkou reservoir and its tributaries was of a ca2 and hco3 type the concentrations of all major ions in the reservoir area were low and there was no distinct spatiotemporal variation temporal variations were however apparent in the tributaries the concentrations of mg2 na so4 2 and cl were lowest in the wet season k was highest in the dry to wet transition season and si was highest in the wet season 2 six indicators cl tn so4 2 tn na tn k tn ca2 tn and si tn were used to qualitatively analyze pollution sources of these cl tn so4 2 tn and na tn were selected as ps pollution tracers and k tn ca2 tn and si tn were selected as nps pollution tracers 3 cl tn na tn si tn were used to quantitatively assess the pollution sources the tn load was dominated by the nps pollution and the average contribution rates of nps of tn in the tributaries from the dry season to the wet season were 79 83 and 93 respectively the tn load of nps was highest during the wet season with a maximum value over 400 10 3 t a 1 km 2 while the tn load of ps was highest during the dry season with a maximum value of 39 3 t a 1 this study provides a new approach for quantitatively

5193,the quantification of point source ps pollution and non point source nps pollution in different regions is needed so that targeted management strategies for water environment managers can be prepared the aim of this study was to establish a method for quantifying ps and nps pollution by measuring ion concentrations the danjiangkou reservoir and its main tributaries were selected as the study area the spatiotemporal variation in the concentration of nutrients and ions was analyzed the results showed that the main ions did not display any distinct spatiotemporal variations on the reservoir but spatiotemporal variations were evident in the tributaries mg2 na so4 2 and cl were lowest in the wet season k was highest in the dry to wet transition season and si was highest in the wet season we selected cl tn so4 2 tn and na tn as ps pollution tracking indicators and k tn ca2 tn and si tn as nps pollution tracking indicators the mean contribution rate of nps pollution calculated using cl tn na tn and si tn and by the isotope approach had a significant linear relationship p 0 01 therefore cl tn na tn and si tn were used to quantitatively assess the pollution sources the calculated results indicated the tn load was dominated by the nps pollution and the average contribution rates of nps of tn in the tributaries from the dry season to the wet season were 79 83 and 93 respectively the tn load of nps was highest during the wet season with a maximum value over 400 10 3 t a 1 km 2 while the tn load of ps was highest during the dry season with a maximum value of 39

nps hydrochemical characteristics ion indicators nutrients 1 introduction eutrophication caused by excessive nitrogen and phosphorus inputs has caused many ecological and environmental problems such as the frequent occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and a decline in biodiversity eutrophication has not been adequately addressed globally and remains a major global water environment problem smith and schindler 2009 reducing nutrient emissions is fundamental to improving water quality and restoring the health of aquatic ecosystems both point source ps pollution e g domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater and non point source nps pollution need to be controlled to reduce eutrophication kronvang et al 1995 wu and chen 2013 the quantification of ps pollution and nps pollution in different regions is required so that targeted management strategies for water environment managers can be created several methods have been proposed for quantifying ps and nps pollution these methods include the use of multivariate statistical analysis dual stable isotopes a combination of 15n and 18o in nitrate hydrological and water quality watershed models geographical information systems gis technology and hydrochemical characteristics shrestha and kazama 2007 rogers et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2007 nas and berktay 2006 singh et al 2008 the multivariate statistical method is generally used to analyze the spatiotemporal variation in water quality however this method could just infer the co relationships and the source of contaminants preliminarily and its successful application is dependent on abundant data being available bu et al 2010 the dual stable isotope a combination of 15n and 18o nitrate approach is frequently applied to trace sources of nitrate this approach is based on the distinct isotopic characteristics of nitrate from different sources that are caused by the fractionation of isotopes in natural circulation johannsen et al 2008 gautam and iqbal 2010 although this method is accurate and reliable isotopic measurements are expensive and require the use of sophisticated technology rogers et al 2012 hydrological and water quality watershed models can also be applied to identify sources of pollutants dimitriou et al 2017 tim and jolly 1994 in addition gis can be employed to address the issue of spatial heterogeneity praharaj et al 2002 ahn and chon 1999 however it is difficult to effectively apply models and gis in many areas with a paucity of data because large amounts of data are required to calibrate parameters hydrochemical characteristics method uses the main ion composition to track contaminants generated by natural and anthropogenic processes the method has the advantages of being based on sound principles easy to implement and low cost previous investigations have shown that the main ions produced by ps pollution are na cl and so4 2 kaushal et al 2005 meybeck 2003 tao et al 2013 lang et al 2006 favara et al 2000 singh et al 2004 in water that is more heavily affected by nps pollution than ps pollution the main ions produced are ca2 mg2 k and si meybeck 1987 millot et al 2003 singh et al 2008 all the major ions associated with ps and nps pollution are found together with nutrients and are positively correlated with nutrients at present hydrochemical characteristics method is only used to qualitatively analyze pollution sources our hypothesis is that the quantitative evaluation of ps and nps pollution can be realized by using measurements of ion concentrations the aim of this study was therefore to establish a method for quantifying ps and nps pollution by measuring ion concentrations the danjiangkou reservoir and its main tributaries were selected as the study area the spatiotemporal variation in the concentration of nutrients and ions was analyzed the contribution rate of ps and nps pollution at various sites was calculated based on the characteristic ions of these two sources the results obtained using ion concentrations were verified by results obtained using the dual stable isotope approach moreover the spatiotemporal distribution of nps and ps pollution load for the upstream tributary watershed of the danjiangkou reservoir was assessed quantitatively 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the sampling sites and water sampling the danjiangkou reservoir 32 20 33 45 n 110 40 111 50 e is located at the border of hubei and henan province china and has a water surface area of 745 km2 it is the main drinking water source for the middle route of china s south to north water transfer project snwtp li and zhang 2010 the average annual precipitation is about 873 mm and the interannual variability is large about 80 of the precipitation falls during may to october fig 1 a total of 20 sampling sites were selected for the danjiangkou reservoir and its main tributaries samples d1 to d12 were taken from the danjiang river djr qihe river qr dinghe river dr laoguanhe river lgr and sheweihe river swr and samples d13 to d20 were taken from the danjiangkou reservoir reservoir the terms in brackets e g djr reservoir refer to sampling groups in addition 11 wastewater samples and 11 soil samples were collected evenly in the study area fig 2 sampling was carried out from september 2017 to august 2018 over a one year period samples were collected at the beginning of each month all the samples were collected on the same day for each sampling the sampling period was divided into three seasons according to precipitation the dry season november december january and february the dry to wet transition season march april may and june and the wet season july august september and october water samples were collected along cross sections of the river 0 1 m below the surface sampling was done using 1 l high density polyethylene hdpe sample bottles the bottles had previously been soaked in 15 concentrated nitric acid for 48 h and then rinsed with milli q water several times li et al 2009 acid washed bottles were rinsed three times with sampled water before sampling concentrations of hco3 were measured on site by acid titration using hydrochloric acid each sample was titrated 2 to 3 times the average error was 5 wastewater samples domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater were collected using 1 l hdpe bottles at the beginning of march 2018 a five point sampling method was used to collect soil samples from 0 to 20 cm soil profiles using a 5 cm soil auger all soil samples were placed in zip lock bag immediately to avoid contamination three parallel samples were collected from each sampling site samples were kept cool in the field by being placed in ice and transported to the laboratory as quickly as possible 2 2 chemical analysis in the laboratory the water samples and wastewater samples for measuring major ions were immediately filtered using pre rinsed 0 45 µm cellulose membranes millipore the soil samples were air dried and passed through a 1 0 mm stainless steel sieve the soil was extracted with milli q water soil solution 1 5 w v after shaking for 3 min the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 6 min and then filtered through pre rinsed 0 45 µm cellulose membranes the filtrate used for measuring mg2 k na ca2 and si was acidified to ph 2 with ultra pure concentrated nitric acid and then stored in the dark at 4 c the samples for isotopic analysis were filtered with pre rinsed 0 2 µm cellulose membranes and frozen below 20 c until analysis major cations mg2 k na and ca2 and si were determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass emission spectrometer icap qc thermofisher ma usa major anions cl so4 2 and no3 were measured using an ion chromatograph ic ics 1100 dionex sunnyvale usa the analytical precision was within 5 total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were measured according to the methods for the examination of water and wastewater protocols apha 2005 the concentration of nitrate nitrogen no3 n was calculated based on the measured no3 concentration isotopic analysis of nitrate was performed using a denitrifier method in which nitrate was converted to n2o the δ15n and δ18o values were determined using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime100 elementar hanau germany at the institute of applied ecology at the chinese academy of sciences shenyang the stable isotope facility was normalized to multiple laboratory working standards that were previously calibrated to international standards usgs32 usgs34 and usgs35 the precision for the δ15n and δ18o values were 0 4 and 1 0 respectively based on replicate analysis of the working standards and calibrations high purity reagents and milli q water were used for all analyses all laboratory equipment was pre washed with 15 concentrated nitric acid and then rinsed with milli q water all processing was done using three parallels 2 3 quantitative assessment of pollutant sources in the current study two methods were used to quantify the source of nitrogen the first method was based on hydrochemical characteristic ion indicators the calculation was according to the following formulas 1 c i o n water c t n water c i o n soil ε 1 c t n water f nps c i o n sew ε 2 c t n water f ps 2 f ps f nps 1 3 c t n soil c t n ave w a t e r ε 1 4 c t n sew c t n ave w a t e r ε 2 5 f tn n p s f nps c t n soil c t n water 6 f tn p s f ps c t n sew c t n water 7 f tn p s f tn n p s 1 where c ion soil c ion sew and c ion water are the ion concentrations of the soil extract wastewater and water sample mg l 1 respectively c tn soil c tn sew and c tn water are the total nitrogen concentrations mg l 1 of the soil extract wastewater and water samples respectively c tn ave water is the average total nitrogen concentration for the 20 water samples over 12 months ie 240 samples mg l 1 ε 1 and ε 2 are ratios of the total nitrogen of soil extract to the total nitrogen of water sample and the total nitrogen of wastewater to the total nitrogen of water sample respectively f ps f tn ps and f nps f tn n ps are the contribution rates of ps and nps of water quantity total nitrogen respectively because of the lack of surface runoff data the average concentration of total nitrogen in all watersheds except for the reservoir area during the wet season was used as the concentration of total nitrogen in the soil extract ie c tn soil the second method was based on the dual stable isotope approach this approach involves the following formulas liu et al 2013 8 δ 15 n f ps δ 15 n ps f nps δ 15 n nps 9 δ 18 o f ps δ 18 o ps f nps δ 18 o nps 10 f ps f nps 1 where δ 15 n nps δ 18 o nps δ 15 n ps δ 18 o ps and δ 15 n δ 18 o are the δ 15 n δ 18 o values of nitrate from the soil extract wastewater and water sample respectively f ps and f nps are the contribution rates of ps and nps of nitrate nitrogen respectively specifically the contribution rates of ps and nps of the water quantity were obtained by calculating the contribution of a certain ion indicator of pollution source samples to the corresponding ion indicator of water samples firstly then the contribution rates of ps and nps of tn were obtained by calculating the contribution of the tn concentration of pollution source samples to the tn concentration of water samples next the contribution rates of ps and nps of no3 n were calculated by the dual stable isotope approach since nitrogen in river water is mainly in the form of no3 n deutsch et al 2006 the nps contribution rates of tn and no3 n should be linear finally the nps contribution rates of tn obtained by the hydrochemical characteristic ion indicators method were compared with the nps contribution rates of no3 n obtained by the dual stable isotope method 2 4 analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of pollution load in this study the spatiotemporal distribution of pollution load of nps and ps was assessed for the upstream tributary watershed of danjiangkou reservoir the watershed area was determined by high resolution 30 m digital elevation data from digital elevation model of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem frey and paul 2012 specifically the spatiotemporal distribution of nps pollution load was analyzed using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method idw interpolation method estimates the value of an unknown point according to a function of the reciprocal of the distance from adjacent sample points shahbeik et al 2014 the spatiotemporal distribution of ps pollution load was represented by different circular areas 2 5 data processing and statistics statistical analyses were performed using the statistical program for social sciences spss 11 0 software regression and correlation analyses were used to examine the relationships between variables using a p value of 0 05 to determine significance all data were graphed and descriptively analyzed using origin 10 5 software maps of the sampling sites and spatiotemporal distribution of pollution load of ps and nps were created using arcgis 11 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal variation in nutrient concentration the nutrient concentrations in tributary rivers and the reservoir were shown in fig 3 the concentrations of tn and no3 n varied from 0 72 mg l 1 to 8 88 mg l 1 and from 0 21 mg l 1 to 8 31 mg l 1 respectively and the mean values were 2 90 mg l 1 and 2 03 mg l 1 respectively the concentration trends of tn and no3 n were basically the same most watersheds had higher concentrations in the dry season the concentrations of tp and nh4 n ranged from 0 01 mg l 1 to 0 17 mg l 1 and 0 04 mg l 1 to 0 51 mg l 1 respectively with averages of 0 04 mg l 1 and 0 16 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of tp and nh4 n in the tributary rivers increased gradually from the dry season to the wet season the nutrient concentrations were lower in the reservoir than in the tributary rivers with no obvious spatiotemporal variation in general nitrogen and phosphorus in rivers are derived from ps pollution during the dry season however a large amount of nps pollution containing nitrogen and phosphorus is discharged into the rivers as a result of erosion by rainfall runoff during the wet season duan et al 2016 therefore high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the dry season are used to indicate ps pollution while high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the wet season are used to indicate nps pollution in this study the tp concentrations of most watersheds in the wet season were significantly higher than that in the dry season which reflected the existence of large amounts of nps pollution however seasonal changes in phosphorus did not demonstrate any information about ps pollution nh4 n was generally used as the main pollution indicator of ps pollution such as domestic wastewater guo et al 2014 in the areas with heavy ps pollution the concentrations of nh4 n in the wet season should be obviously lower than that in the dry season due to the dilution of abundant rainfall during the wet season however the results of our study did not conform to this pattern there may be two causes for this 1 the high temperature during the wet season accelerated ammoniation and thus the release of nh4 n in the sediment cloete and kritzinger 1984 and 2 the increase in anthropogenic domestic wastewater discharge in summer led to the rising of the nh4 n concentrations smith et al 2012 it was therefore difficult to use the seasonal changes of nh4 n for evaluating the quantitative contribution of ps and nps pollution in addition the seasonal variation in no3 n was almost the same as the variation in tn in summary it seems reasonable to conclude that the higher concentration of tn in the dry season indicated the existence of ps pollution while the higher concentration of tp in the wet season can reflect the existence of nps pollution in this context there was obviously ps pollution in djr and dr and clear nps pollution in djr qr and swr nevertheless it was still unclear how the contributions of ps and nps pollution can be quantified based on the seasonal variation in nutrient concentration 3 2 spatiotemporal variation in major ions concentration the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 both displayed large ranges from 16 6 mg l 1 to 87 9 mg l 1 and from 3 6 mg l 1 to 34 2 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of na and k varied from 1 2 mg l 1 to 22 2 mg l 1 and from 3 4 mg l 1 to 12 8 mg l 1 respectively and the mean values were 8 1 mg l 1 and 6 3 mg l 1 respectively the mean concentration of si was 5 2 mg l 1 and the maximum value reached 13 9 mg l 1 which occurred in qr during the dry to wet transition season the concentration of so4 2 varied from 6 8 mg l 1 to 81 4 mg l 1 with an average of 35 9 mg l 1 the mean concentration of cl was 9 6 mg l 1 and the maximum value was 29 6 mg l 1 in dr during the dry to wet transition season the concentration of hco3 displayed a comparatively large value with an average of 143 2 mg l 1 ranging from 82 8 mg l 1 to 226 1 mg l 1 fig 4 in the tributary rivers the concentrations of mg2 and so4 2 decreased gradually from the dry season to the wet season the concentrations of na and cl were lowest in the wet season while the concentrations of k and si were highest in the dry to wet transition season and the wet season respectively the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 remained relatively stable the ternary diagrams fig 5 showed that ca2 was the dominant cation contributing about 63 to the major cation budget anion chemistry was dominated by hco3 constituting 72 of the total anions while cl and so4 2 contributed about 5 and 4 respectively overall water in the danjiangkou reservoir and its main tributaries were of the ca2 and hco3 type which was consistent with the results of previous studies li and zhang 2008 li and zhang 2009 generally the hydrochemistry of water controlled by rock weathering especially carbonate rock weathering has higher concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 meybeck 2003 chen et al 2002 therefore the hco3 ca type ion characteristics indicated that the ions in the danjiangkou reservoir area were mainly derived from nps pollution despite these observations it was not possible to quantitatively assess the contribution rates of ps and nps pollution yet 3 3 main ions and water quality indices of wastewater and soil extract the study compared the ion composition of wastewater and soil extract results showed that the concentrations of ca2 k and si in soil extract were significantly higher than those in wastewater in contrast the concentrations of na so4 2 cl tn and nh4 n in wastewater were obviously higher than those in soil extract fig 6 fig 7 illustrated the concentrations of major ions of ps pollution e g wastewater and nps pollution e g runoff from previous investigations covering other areas the specific values were shown in table s1 and table s2 see the supplementary material similar to our investigation the concentrations of na cl and so4 2 in wastewater were generally higher than these ions in runoff kelly et al 2010 reynolds et al 1989 singh et al 2010 lang et al 2006 chetelat et al 2008 while the concentrations of ca2 k and si in runoff were substantially higher than these ions in wastewater reynolds et al 1989 duysings et al 1983 nightingale 1987 göbel et al 2007 vuai et al 2003 clay et al 2010 the natural differences in the composition of major ions in the wastewater and runoff provided an important basis for dividing nps pollution and ps pollution 3 4 qualitative analysis of pollution sources the discussion in the previous sections showed that both nps and ps pollution had characteristic ions that can be used to qualitatively distinguish the pollution sources however representative runoff ion concentration data cannot be obtained on account of variations in the volume intensity and time of rainfall besides since the soil water ratio was different from the actual rainfall process the absolute ion concentration of soil extract cannot be directly used to evaluate the contribution of nps pollution and ps pollution therefore a characteristic ion tn was selected as the traceability indicator fig 8 showed that cl tn so4 2 tn and na tn were higher in wastewater which can be used as indicators to trace ps pollution while k tn ca2 tn mg2 tn and si tn were higher in soil extract which can be used as indicators to trace nps pollution these ion indicators presented two regions on the radar map a ps region enclosed by wastewater sampling points and a nps region enclosed by soil extract sampling points on account of the homology of ca2 and mg2 in this study area li and zhang 2010 only ca2 tn was used the final ion indicators selected for use as tracers were cl tn so4 2 tn na tn k tn ca2 tn and si tn the above ion indicators were calculated for different watersheds which were then superimposed on the ps region and nps region the larger the area superimposed on the nps region the larger the contribution of nps pollution otherwise the contribution of ps pollution was larger thus the pollution sources could be qualitatively analyzed using this approach the results indicated that all watersheds had a large contribution of nps pollution in all seasons and that the contribution of nps pollution in djr and lgr gradually increased from the dry season to the wet season fig 9 3 5 quantification of pollution sources a quantitative analysis of pollution sources was obtained by using hydrochemical characteristic ion indicators under ideal conditions the contribution of pollution sources calculated using different ion indicators should be the same however errors arose in the calculated results because of the differences between the mean values of pollution samples used in this study and the actual values which were subject to spatiotemporal variations to be more accurate appropriate ion indicators were selected for quantitative assessment and averaging the nps and ps contribution rates of tn were calculated individually using the selected ion indicators in addition δ15n and δ18o in nitrate were also used to quantify the nps and ps contribution rates of no3 n the specific values of δ15n and δ18o in nitrate for the danjiangkou reservoir and its tributaries were shown in fig s1 see the supplementary material the nps contribution rates of tn obtained using the hydrochemical characteristic ion indicator method were compared with the nps contribution rates of no3 n obtained using the isotope method fig 10 it can be seen that there was a clear linear relationship between the contribution rate of nps pollution calculated using cl tn na tn and si tn indicators and the contribution rate of nps pollution calculated using isotopes p 0 01 moreover the mean contribution rate of nps pollution calculated by the three ion indicators and by the isotope method had a more significant linear relationship p 0 01 consequently the mean contribution rate calculated using cl tn na tn and si tn was selected to quantitatively and reliably assess the pollution sources in addition the contribution rates of nps of the characteristic ion indicators for the danjiangkou reservoir and its tributaries were shown in fig s2 see the supplementary material the contribution rate of nps of tn was quantified using the mean contribution rate calculated by cl tn na tn si tn the tn load was determined from the tn concentration and the river discharge as shown in fig 11 the highest tn load was in djr from the dry season to the wet season the contribution rates of nps of tn decreased first and then increased which were 91 79 and 91 respectively and the variation trend of tn load was the same which were 4407 6 t a 1 1605 6 t a 1 and 3453 8 t a 1 respectively the lowest tn load was in swr where the contribution rates of nps of tn for the dry dry to wet transition and wet seasons were 83 85 and 99 respectively and the tn load were 220 1 t a 1 303 1 t a 1 and 649 6 t a 1 respectively the contribution rates of nps of tn and the tn load gradually increased from the dry season to the wet season except for the reservoir area the average contribution rates of nps of tn were 79 83 and 93 respectively and the average tn loads were 1419 2 t a 1 696 6 t a 1 2007 8 t a 1 respectively from the dry season to the wet season the tn input was dominated by the nps pollution and the tn load was highest during the wet season the spatiotemporal distribution of tn load of nps and ps for the upstream tributary watershed of the danjiangkou reservoir was shown in fig 12 on the whole the tn load of nps was highest during the wet season among which the tn load of nps exceeded 400 10 3 t a 1 km 2 in the downstream watershed of djr qr and swr the tn load of nps was relatively low during the dry to wet transition season the highest tn load of nps exceeded 200 10 3 t a 1 km 2 during the dry season which occurred in djr and dr watershed the tn load of ps was highest during the dry season which ranged from 2 5 t a 1 to 39 3 t a 1 with an average of 14 7 t a 1 the average of tn load of ps was 10 1 t a 1 during the dry to wet transition season and the maximum value reached 33 1 t a 1 which occurred in djr watershed the tn load of ps ranged from 0 1 t a 1 to 32 0 t a 1 with an average of 11 7 t a 1 during the wet season the quantitative assessment of spatiotemporal distribution of nps and ps pollution load provided a significant reference for water pollution management of the danjiangkou reservoir area 4 conclusion 1 water in the danjiangkou reservoir and its tributaries was of a ca2 and hco3 type the concentrations of all major ions in the reservoir area were low and there was no distinct spatiotemporal variation temporal variations were however apparent in the tributaries the concentrations of mg2 na so4 2 and cl were lowest in the wet season k was highest in the dry to wet transition season and si was highest in the wet season 2 six indicators cl tn so4 2 tn na tn k tn ca2 tn and si tn were used to qualitatively analyze pollution sources of these cl tn so4 2 tn and na tn were selected as ps pollution tracers and k tn ca2 tn and si tn were selected as nps pollution tracers 3 cl tn na tn si tn were used to quantitatively assess the pollution sources the tn load was dominated by the nps pollution and the average contribution rates of nps of tn in the tributaries from the dry season to the wet season were 79 83 and 93 respectively the tn load of nps was highest during the wet season with a maximum value over 400 10 3 t a 1 km 2 while the tn load of ps was highest during the dry season with a maximum value of 39 3 t a 1 this study provides a new approach for quantitatively

5194,understanding flow regime dynamics is important for the management and conservation of river systems and their related ecosystems under current and future pressures like climate and land use change for this reason the accuracy and detail with which hydrological models are able to replicate streamflow and other spatially distributed processes is critical for global and regional water management programs one of the most critical factors for model performance is the spatial and temporal representation of precipitation data a procedure known as regionalisation it is therefore imperative to evaluate the sensitivity of models to data from different stations in order to identify locations that exert the strongest control on simulated streamflow in this study a spatially distributed rainfall runoff model the j2000 calibrated under near natural river flow conditions was used to analyse the overall precipitation station impact on simulated streamflow and its flow components for this purpose different analysis methods including regional sensitivity analysis rsa were used the study was applied to the berg river catchment a water stressed region in the western cape south africa that was recently affected by serious drought conditions the results show that during peak flows precipitation stations in the headwater part of the basin had the largest systematic impact often controlling the data input for only a small proportion of the overall spatial extent of the model but still having the largest impact on the overall modelled streamflow in contrast precipitation stations in lowland areas showed to be more important during low flow periods although they often control the data input for a larger part of the modelled catchment the study highlights the importance of good overall data coverage for improved low flow simulations as well as identification of critical areas in regions responsible for peak runoff generation processes the inclusion of systematic station weights has the potential to improve the ecohydrological representation of rainfall runoff models in data scarce regions as well as precipitation regionalisation approaches the results are indicative of known microclimatic variability in semi arid southern africa highlighting the significance of catchment heterogeneity and areas of dominant sub basins for overall runoff generation keywords regionalisation rainfall runoff modelling distributed j2000 model berg river catchment 1 introduction precipitation is the most crucial input data for hydrological modelling the ability of hydrological models to simulate peak discharge amplitude and timing as well as stormflow volume is strongly dependent on the availability of precise spatial and temporal measurements of precipitation berne et al 2004 huang et al 2019 wilson et al 1979 for this reason there have been a large number of studies that have focused on understanding the impact of rain gauge density on model results with the aim to optimize and improve the selection of gauge location and density borga and vizzaccaro 1997 campling et al 2001 spadavecchia and williams 2009 yin et al 2018 at different timesteps it becomes critical to assess the precipitation representation within a hydrological model due to the importance of overall spatial data density the spatial density of precipitation measurements at different timesteps has the ability to negatively affect hydrological modelling results reducing their effectiveness to capture long term climatic trends khan and koch 2018 kim and ryu 2016 the interpolation of precipitation and other climate data is therefore a critical component in determining how climate data is represented within modelling systems and whether localised climate variability is incorporated interpolation and extrapolation also known as regionalisation is an approach used in hydrological modelling to spatially distribute precipitation and climate measurements from localised point sources willmott 1976 while no common consensus exists as to the best technique for climate regionalisation most studies focus on either geostatistical or deterministic approaches based on localised conditions song et al 2016 geostatistical methods the most complex of the regionalisation approaches use a variogram model to generate a correlation between data points resulting in unbiased climate estimates papamichail and metaxa 1996 as geostatistical methods generate unique correlations between active stations incorporating additional stations into the regionalisation requires constant model adjustment e g ly et al 2011 inverse distance weighting idw is one of the most widely applied deterministic regionalisation approaches due to its relative robustness and ease of implementation e g ly et al 2013 the idw approach estimates values at unsampled locations using the weighted average of observed data at surrounding points thereby generating a distance reverse function at each point using neighbouring points teegavarapu and chandramouli 2005 as the idw approach assumes that unknown point values are more influenced by proximal points than distal points idw performs well when networks are spatially dense dirks et al 1998 or in relatively homogenous catchments lynch 2004 although idw does not require adjustment when incorporating additional measurements as networks become sparse more bias is introduced the bias generated by limited points at various levels of relief not only impacts idw but also geostatistical and conventional regionalisation approaches feki et al 2012 therefore it is critical to assess the representation of recent climatic conditions within the hydrological model through multi criteria assessment using a range of objective orientated functions multi criteria assessment has long been recognized as the most comprehensive approach for assessing hydrological model performance beven 2001 duan et al 1992 gupta et al 1998 willems 2009 here multiple objective functions commonly separated into criteria which assess high flow and low flow components are used to assess the goodness of fit of the simulated hydrograph the aim of these objective functions is to determine a set of model parameters that ensure the model behaviour closely resembles the natural system the incorporation of a multi criteria assessment not only reduces model bias and uncertainty but has the potential to counteract the effects of equifinality and solution uniqueness in hydrological modelling efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 the use of a multi criteria assessment also has the potential to improve the ability of hydrological models to capture ecohydrological behaviour even when catchments exhibit spatial and temporal precipitation complexity the main concern for hydrological modelling in data scarce regions is the relative importance of specific precipitation stations in simulating streamflow considering the stations spatial location as well as the overall station density to better understand the sensitivity of hydrological models to precipitation inputs and to identify inconsistencies in model behaviour a fully distributed rainfall runoff model using j2000 eeckman et al 2019 krause 2002 2001 was setup for the berg river catchment south africa a precipitation station sensitivity analysis which made use of monte carlo sampling was used to identify the importance of precipitation stations as independent entities based on simulated high and low flow results these results highlight the impact of microclimate variability on ecohydrological dynamics and the need for appropriate climate station density and distribution to accurately simulate the different hydrological flow components surface runoff interflow and baseflow in the future identification of ecohydrological alteration will become increasingly important for the development of climate adaption strategies particularly in arid and semi arid regions however identification of ecohydrological alteration requires the ability to distinguish between real processes and alteration of the measurement setup over time consequently identification of appropriate spatial and temporal coverage of precipitation to conceptualise recent ecohydrological dynamics and processes is critical for the development of the underlying predictive methods and tools 2 environmental setting the berg river catchment which is located in the western cape province of south africa fig 1 has its headwaters in the high lying mountains outside the town of franschhoek the river drains northwest across a 7700 km2 catchment which grades into relatively low lying flat regions in the north before exiting into the atlantic ocean at veldrif fig 1 mean annual precipitation map in the north west part of the catchment is between 250 and 600 mm at elevations of 50 to 120 m a s l lynch 2004 fig 2 map increases towards the south east to between 700 and 800 mm around the town of paarl at roughly 300 m a s l reaching a maximum map of 3198 mm at a peak elevation of 1585 m a s l in the headwaters of the catchment lynch 2004 the catchment supports four major water bodies namely in downstream order the recently built berg river dam 2009 with a capacity of 130 mm3 the wemmershoek dam 1957 with a capacity of 58 mm3 the voëlvlei dam 1971 with a capacity of 164 mm3 and misverstand dam 1977 with a capacity of 8 mm3 these water bodies have significant impacts on natural river flow regimes with streamflow downstream of the misverstand and berg river dams largely controlled by reservoir releases bulk river flow monitoring site ms1 main river stem is located at the lower downstream sections of the berg river before misverstand dam fig 1 the catchment supports the berg river estuary which begins 70 km upstream of the mouth at velddrif regarded as a national conservation priority due to the endemic bird and wildlife species turpie 1995 natural vegetation makes up a considerable portion of the catchment which is mainly dominated by thicket dense bush and shrubland fynbos with coastal macchia coastal rhenosterbosveld and macchia being the dominant vegetation types acocks 1988 mucina and rutherford 2006 the berg river catchment makes up around 8 of the total irrigated area 22 500 ha of the western cape with dominant crops being grapes both wine and table citrus and potatoes typically irrigation water is mostly abstracted from the main berg river system with reservoir releases controlled by the downstream irrigation demand 3 materials and methods the following methodology outlines the modelling approach employed although measured precipitation and streamflow are presented as model inputs they are also discussed separately in sections 4 1 and 4 3 the process oriented ecohydrological model j2000 krause 2002 2001 krause and kralisch 2005 together with the modular objective oriented modelling system jams kralisch and krause 2006 was used to simulate hydrological processes at catchment scale fig 3 the j2000 model makes use of the concept of hydrological response units hrus flügel 1995 paired with a topological routing scheme pfennig et al 2009 to simulate small scale processes and flow dynamics at hillslope scale below a description of the input data used hru delineation idw regionalisation model calibration and validation procedures reach flow contribution calculations and station precipitation sensitivity analysis are outlined to assist in understanding the methodological approach commonly used abbreviations and acronyms are summarized in table 1 3 1 model inputs 3 1 1 climate and rainfall daily climate and rainfall data were collected for the period 1986 01 01 to 2009 12 31 rainfall

three additional solar radiation measurements were bought from a local weather monitoring organization saws fig 1 potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman monteith equation and climate measurements of 1 minimum mean and maximum air temperature c 2 mean relative humidity 3 total solar radiation mj m 2 and 4 average windspeed m s 1 measured 2 m above ground equation data attained from the above mentioned sources as dew point temperature and sunshine duration is more readily available over the entire modelling period calculations according to allen et al 1998 were used to calculate relative humidity and solar radiation the river basin information system rbis zander and kralisch 2016 data portal was used to prepare the data files required for jams j2000 modelling 3 1 2 streamflow twenty seven gauging structures are located within the catchment to monitor streamflow not all shown due to poor record length reliability or impacted by reservoir releases these structures are mainly located on the main berg river network although the density of gauges increases near reservoirs and main feeding streams gauge selection for model calibration and validation was based on measurements not impacted by upstream reservoirs as well as having sufficient data quality and length furthermore records which were not hindered by discharge table limitations and agricultural abstraction and which resemble natural conditions were selected gauging measurements from ms1 g1h013 drieheuwels between 1986 10 01 to 2009 09 03 were used during calibration and validation as they resemble bulk catchment river flow as it is the most reliable downstream gauge and is positioned upstream of major reservoirs for a time period before major reservoir construction 3 1 3 hydrogeology a 1 250000 geological map obtained from the council of geosciences gresse 1997 theron 1990 visser and theron 1973 along with literature aquifer properties was used to derive hydrogeological process parameters required for the j2000 model the upper aquifer of the catchment is mainly comprised of quaternary sediments and weathered material while the lower or secondary aquifer is comprised of malmesbury group shales and table mountain group sandstones the maximum storage capacity along with the storage coefficients of the upper and lower aquifer were needed for the groundwater component of the model in addition to these parameters maximum aquifer thickness and recession coefficients are required these parameters were taken from models developed nearby bugan 2014 treumer 2016 watson et al 2019 watson et al 2018 as well as regional literature conrad et al 2004 srk 2009 and bulk estimates domenico and schwartz 1990 tankard et al 2012 3 1 4 soils soil parameters

within the hydrus model šimůnek et al 2006 the j2000 requires estimates of water holding capacities for mps and lps using water holding capacity of the soil at three pressure ratings namely 0 mbar 60

vs depth using a constant upper and lower head boundary using the theta vs depth relationship the soil water holding capacity related to 0 mbar and 60 mbar was determined lps was determined through the subtraction of 0 mbar and 60 mbar the field capacity which equates to the water held in mps was determined through subtraction of holding capacities of 15 000 mbar and 60 mbar the total mps and lps volumes were determined by multiplying the water holding capacities by the respective soil horizon depth 3 1 5 land use the 2013 2014 south african national land cover dataset geoterraimage was used to determine vegetation classes with specific model parameters namely 1 albedo 2 monthly surface resistances assuming sufficient water supply 3 leaf area index lai for vegetational growth periods

hatfield 2004 crain 1998 johnson 1983 munitz et al 2017 van 1984 3 2 hydrological response unit delineation hydrological response units hrus after flügel 1996 and pfennig et al 2009 are spatial entities of homogenous topographical soil hydrogeological and land use properties used as modelling entities in distributed hydrological models the web based grass hru tool schwartze 2008 was used to produce the hrus for the berg river catchment incorporating the gauging structure locations 27 gauges a digital elevation model dem shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m as well as maps of land use geology and soils the hru delineation procedure included the following steps 1 an initial data preparation step used to create a sink less dem by applying a standard filling approach using different indices elevation classes slope and aspect input data were reclassified to generate hydrologically relevant data layers for a following overlay analysis step 3 2 flow accumulation and flow direction maps were generated from the dem and further used to delineate the stream network and related sub basins the level of detail for the stream network delineation was chosen such that all stream segments of hydrological importance were represented in the model resulting in a minimum sub basin size of 7 3 km2 for this application 3 reclassified dem derivates slope aspect elevation sub basins and maps of land use soil geology were combined in an overlay analysis to delineate hydrologically homogeneous modelling units which formulate hrus in order to eliminate small sliver hrus all polygons below a given size threshold were merged with neighbouring polygons in an iterative process until only hrus above the threshold remained for this application the threshold was set to 50 pixels approx 0 4 km2 which resulted in 12 266 hrus overall with a mean hru size of 0 6 km2 4 the flow accumulation map was used to generate a flow routing network that connected the generated hrus with one another or with specific reach segments allowing the hrus to drain either directly to the reach segments hrus adjacent to a reach segment or alternatively to neighbouring hrus all others 5 finally hru statistics and attribute values were computed and assigned for each hru including area elevation slope aspect watershed sub basin land use geology soil and topological neighbours hru reach 3 3 model regionalisation for the presented study the idw approach was used to regionalise climate input data for the hydrological model using this method each hru h was assigned a vector w h w h 1 w h m which contained weights for all m climate stations here the weight w h s of station s for hru h was calculated as 1 w h s 1 dist h s p where d i s t h s is the euclidian lateral distance between h and s value p is a freely chosen exponent that allows attenuation of station importance at decreasing distances and thus accounted for the degree at which dissimilarity of the climate variable was exacerbated with distance an exponent value of p 2 was used in this study to account for the availability of station data for the case d i s t h s 0 w h s was assigned a value of 1 while all other w h t t s were assigned values of 0 using this weight vector the local climate value v h at hru h was then calculated as a weighted average of values at all m stations according to 2 v h 1 s 1 m w h s s 1 m w h s v s where v s was the measured value at station s in this study measurements at each station covered different time periods and all exhibited gaps given these conditions a varying list of stations at each time step was required and thus the weight vector w h had to be recalculated for each time step in order to account for elevation differences between hrus and climate stations an elevation correction of the interpolated climate value was applied for this purpose each hru was assigned monthly lapse rate adjustment values based on the long term relationships between station elevations and their climatic observations to account for stations positioned at different elevations the adjustment values were based on elevation ranges and separated as 0 100 m 101 250 m 251 550 m and 800 m as rainfall exhibited a stronger dependence on elevation than temperature fig 4 a a monthly adjustment was applied to the rainfall regionalisation fig 4b while a single adjustment value was used to adjust the regionalised temperature for a given lapse rate r the adapted climate value v h for hru h was calculated as 3 v h r e h e h 100 v h where v h is the output of the idw method e h is the elevation of hru h and e h is the mean elevation of the stations used to calculate v h similar to v h e h was calculated as a weighted average of each station s elevation according to 4 e h 1 s 1 m w h s s 1 m w h s e s where e s is the elevation of station s 3 4 model calibration and validation for model calibration and validation the time series was split into two periods 1 calibration from 1983 11 01 until 1995 11 01 and 2 validation from 1995 to 11 01 until 2009 10 31 for this study a semi automatic model calibration approach was chosen using both automatic and manual procedures e g boyle et al 2000 these two procedures were performed consecutively manual calibration beginning upon completion of the automated procedure the rationale was to use the manual calibration to benefit from expert knowledge and understanding about quantifiable model parameters in the region such as infiltration capacity during different seasons furthermore a robust optimization procedure was used to find optimal parameters that cannot be measured directly e g bekele and nicklow 2007 the selected model parameters were calibrated using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 nsga ii is a multi objective evolutionary search algorithm used to identify the best parameter values from pareto optimal solutions deb et al 2002 to evaluate model performance visualizations and calculations of the ecohydrological properties were used these included measured and simulated flow soil water groundwater evapotranspiration and catchment water balances amongst others in addition various goodness of fit or efficiency criteria were used to evaluate model performance for different aspects of the simulated hydrograph and compare the results to literature kundzewicz et al 2018 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 the statistical efficiency criteria selected were the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash 1970 in standard squared form e2 the relative volume error pbias and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nse was chosen because it is widely applied in hydrological modelling and allows assessment of overall model performance however the disadvantage of nse is that it over represents peak flows due to the calculation of mean square differences between simulated and observed runoff krause and boyle 2005 therefore the logarithmic form of nse loge2 was used for better evaluation of low flow periods in addition pbias was used to quantify the overall estimation error finally kge was used to evaluate correlation bias and the variability between simulated and observed runoff 3 5 precipitation station impact assessment in order to analyse the impact of specific precipitation stations on model performance two distinct methods were applied the first approach aimed to link station location with its impact on simulated streamflow for this purpose the contribution of single sub basins to the overall runoff generation were calculated and the mean idw weights of each station over all hrus was determined combining both these results allowed identification of stations that had a high impact not only on the overall simulated runoff but also on specific runoff components the second approach used the calibrated model to perform a regional sensitivity analysis rsa on all stations idw weights for this purpose a scaling factor f s was introduced for each station s that allowed for the uniform increase decrease of weights w s w s 1 w n s across all n hrus these weights which were initially calculated using the idw method eq 1 were scaled using f s according to 5 w s f s w s f s w 1 s f s w n s after these adaptations were applied to all stations i 1 m their scaled weight vectors w i were used for the idw interpolation as described in section 3 3 the scaling factors were assigned by means of a monte carlo analysis mca that took random samples from the interval 0 9 1 1 resulting in an increase decrease of a station s overall weight of up to 10 for each sample the model s simulated runoff was analysed by means of nse and lognse efficiency criteria to assess model peak and low flow performance in order to apply the rsa and calculate sensitivity values for all stations a meta model approach was applied here the results of the mca were used as input to a simplified regression model that predicted the model s efficiency based on a set of scaling factors in order to create this regression model an artificial neural network ann was trained with the mca results as described in fischer et al 2012 for the application of mca and rsa existing functions of the jams modelling system were applied kralisch and fischer 2012 4 results an analysis was required of the model s ability to simulate the river flow dynamics of the catchment before an evaluation could be made of the precipitation station sensitivity the impact of station locations on simulated streamflow as well as the meaning of average station weights below an assessment is provided of the input and regionalised precipitation data as well as the observed streamflow data from station ms1 thereafter the results of the simulated streamflow and reach flow contributions are outlined the analysis was split into wet and dry seasons with wet being from may to october and dry november to april the model simulation was divided into two periods calibration 1983 11 01 to 1995 10 31 and validation 1995 11 01 to 2009 10 31 and hence the analysis of observed data was also split into these two time periods this also facilitated assessment of potential differences in measured precipitation which could result in changes in observed and simulated streamflow at ms1 furthermore it was important to assess the availability of precipitation data for model regionalisation the availability of data at different elevation ranges and average distance between hrus and precipitation stations impacts on simulated streamflow and is therefore also included in the presentation of results 4 1 observed precipitation the analysis of observed precipitation was aggregated into stations between 0 and 100 m a s l at low altitude inland between 101 and 250 m a s l and mid altitude between 251 and 550 m a s l fig 5 and table 2 for the calibration and validation periods no measurements were available above 550 m a s l for the calibration period there were 7 stations between 0 and 100 m a s l 22 stations between 101 and 250 m a s l and 3 stations between 251 and 550 m a s l fig 5 the map measured for stations at 0 100 m a s l was 431 mm stations between 101 and 250 m a s l 526 mm and stations between 251 and 550 m a s l 518 mm table 2 on average the maximum measured precipitation for stations between 0 and 100 m a s l was 25 mm d 1 stations between 101 and 250 m a s l 34 mm d 1 and stations between 251 and 550 m a s l 38 mm d 1 for the validation period precipitation was available from 7 stations at 0 100 m a s l 25 stations at 101 250 and 4 stations at 251 550 m a s l fig 5 the map measured for stations between 0 and 100 was 404 mm stations between 101 and 250 m a s l 511 mm and 251 550 m a s l 549 mm table 2 the average maximum precipitation was 22 mm d 1 for stations between 0 and 100 m a s l 29 mm d 1 for 100 250 m a s l and 33 mm d 1 for 251 550 m a s l although there were more stations available during the validation period than during the calibration period which may account for the increase of 6 in measured precipitation at 251 550 m a s l the measured precipitation was 7 and 3 less for 0 100 m a s l and 101 250 m a s l this is reflected in the average maximum precipitation for 0 100 m a s l 101 250 m a s l as well as 251 550 m a s l for these periods 4 2 regionalised precipitation the regionalised precipitation for the model was assessed by comparing the measured precipitation for the different elevation ranges with the regionalised precipitation using the lapse rate adjustment over the basin while the lapse rate adjustment acts to account for the elevation of the hru the regionalised precipitation is more influenced by the closest precipitation station fig 6 a and b overall the regionalised precipitation was in line with the measured precipitation although there are some noticeable differences that will be discussed for both the basin and the model domain upstream of ms1 for the calibration period the average distance between the hrus and the precipitation stations was 12 km for the model domain although between 1984 and 1986 fewer stations meant that the average distance was 15 km during this period fig 6ai the elevation difference between the hrus and the precipitation stations was 185 m during the calibration period although between 1994 and 1996 this increased to 190 m due to the addition of new low altitude stations fig 6bi therefore on average precipitation data was adjusted upward as the hrus were above at a higher elevation the measured precipitation stations as the density of low altitude stations was limited within the model domain the low altitude hrus often received data from stations between 100 and 250 m a s l while high altitude hrus received data from stations between 250 and 350 m a s l fig 6b the regionalised precipitation was on average 676 mm yr 1 for the model domain with the bulk of precipitation between 515 and 780 mm 1st to 3rd quartile regionalised precipitation for 0 100 m a s l and 101 250 m a s l within the basin was 491 mm yr 1 and 594 mm yr 1 in comparison to measured values of 431 mm and 526 mm yr 1 respectively table 2 regionalised precipitation for hrus between 251 and 550 m a s l within the basin was 660 mm yr 1 compared to measured precipitation values of 518 mm yr 1 for the validation period the average distance between the hrus and precipitation stations was 13 km for the model domain where between 2004 and 2008 there were fewer data gaps and the average distance was around 11 km during this period fig 6ai the average elevation difference during the validation period was 186 m with slightly more data gaps in higher elevation stations fig 6bi precipitation for the hrus was on average adjusted upwards with the limited low altitude 0 100 m a s l stations within the model domain as well as no high altitude stations above 550 m a s l similar to the calibration period low altitude hrus received data from stations between 100 and 250 m a s l while high altitude hrus received data from stations between 250 and 350 m a s l the regionalised precipitation was on average 655 mm yr 1 for the model domain with yearly precipitation predominately between 629 and 736 mm 1st to 3rd quartile regionalised precipitation within the basin for hrus between 0 and 100 m a s l and 101 250 m a s l was 480 mm yr 1 and 562 mm yr 1 compared with measured precipitation of 404 mm yr 1 and 511 mm yr 1 respectfully table 2 regionalised precipitation for hrus between 251 and 550 m a s l was 603 mm yr 1 in comparison to measured precipitation of 549 mm yr 1 overall regionalised precipitation during the validation was 3 less than during the calibration period with the addition of new stations accounting for the 1st to 3rd quartile increases across these periods the inclusion of new stations especially for 251 550 m a s l during the validation period improved the regionalisation up to 10 while in general the regionalised precipitation was within 16 of the measured values 4 3 observed daily streamflow a maximum streamflow of 644 m3s 1 was measured at ms1 during the calibration period with an average streamflow of 6 1 m3s 1 50th percentile and low flow of 2 0 m3s 1 70th percentile fig 7 on five occasions during the calibration period streamflow measured at ms1 exceeded 400 m3 s 1 with the most significant measure of 218 m3s 1 exceeded 1 of the time and the lowest significance of 0 4 m3s 1 exceeded 99 of the time during the validation the maximum streamflow of 672 m3s 1 was measured at ms1 with an average streamflow of 4 6 m3s 1 50th percentile and low flow of 2 8 m3s 1 70th percentile fig 7 on three occasions during the validation period streamflow exceeded 400 m3s 1 with the maximum measured significance of 167 7 m3s 1 exceeded 1 of the time and the lowest measured significance of 0 8 m3s 1 exceeded 99 of the time 4 4 simulated streamflow the performance of the j2000 model was evaluated by comparing the daily simulated and observed streamflow visually and with selected performance criteria goodness of fit fig 8 and table 3 the daily data was used to assess the overall capability of the model to simulate ecohydrological process dynamics below the long term aggregated monthly streamflow which assesses the ability of the model to simulate seasonal variability and simulated runoff components is presented in general the developed model was able to simulate the observed streamflow well during both calibration and validation periods fig 8a and b fig 8ai and bi however there were some noticeable differences across these periods within the calibration period the model performed well during low and high flow conditions resulting in a relative error pbias of 0 07 fig 8a overall the observed monthly average streamflow was 21 47 m3 s 1 while the simulated streamflow was 19 99 m3s 1 table 3 the prediction of hydrological dynamics during the dry periods was good as the observed monthly average streamflow was 3 33 m3s 1 compared to simulated streamflow of 3 25 m3s 1 table 3 this behaviour was underlined by the loge2 of 0 84 a slightly different scenario was presented during the wet season during that period the measured monthly average streamflow was 39 61 m3s 1 while the simulated streamflow was 36 73 m3s 1 table 3 the overall hydrograph was underestimated by the model especially during peak flow above 400 m3s 1 however the overall hydrograph fig 8a showed very good simulation of high flows during the wet season the reaction time to rainfall was captured well by the simulation of the rising runoff limb furthermore the runoff recession mainly governed by interflow was well represented fig 8a despite the inability of the model to simulate the highest peak flows the e2 of 0 82 indicated the overall good simulation of high flows finally the kge of 0 85 also supports the strong correlation between measured and simulated streamflow within the validation period the model performed equally well again with a relative error pbias of 0 07 fig 8b overall the observed monthly average streamflow was 17 56 m3 s 1 while the simulated streamflow was 17 24 m3s 1 table 2 although there was a small difference between overall simulated and observed streamflow the loge2 of 0 65 was lower than during the calibration period indicated by the overall change in the shape of the observed hydrograph fig 8bi during the dry period the model performed reasonably well with monthly average simulated streamflow of 2 81 m3s 1 in comparison to the average observed streamflow of 4 03 m3s 1 table 2 during the wet season the model performed well with a monthly average streamflow of 31 08 m3s 1 and a simulated streamflow of 31 67 m3s 1 table 2 a loge2 of 0 78 illustrates good model performance for peak flow although not as good during the model calibration period the overall hydrograph was overestimated by the model during peak flow and underestimated during low flows while the rising runoff limb was captured well by the model as the observed runoff recession was vastly different to the calibration period it was not as well simulated despite the reduction in performance for loge2 and e2 the model performance with a kge of 0 85 supports a good correlation between measured and simulated streamflow 4 5 simulated flow components hydrological flow components which have been separated into simulated surface runoff interflow upper and lower groundwater were calculated as an area weighted temporal aggregate for sub basins as a percentage of the overall total flow fig 9 in the section to follow the simulated flow components were grouped into regions based on proximity to ms1 defined as 25 km 40 km 65 km and 85 km upstream of ms1 in the vicinity of ms1 and 25 km upstream surface runoff contribution was between 0 0 and 0 93 fig 9a interflow 0 0 0 26 fig 9b upper groundwater 0 0 0 22 fig 9c and lower groundwater 0 0 0 19 of the overall total flow fig 9d the most noticeable contribution was from surface runoff with 0 92 and 0 75 from the eastern reaches and limited interflow and groundwater contributions similar to 25 km upstream the surface runoff contribution 40 km upstream was 0 1 0 interflow 0 0 0 18 upper groundwater 0 0 0 69 and lower groundwater 0 02 0 24 noticeable surface runoff contributions were received in the headwaters of the klein berg located east of ms1 with contributions of 0 17 1 0 while fast groundwater upper gw was significant in the reaches feeding vöelvlei reservoir fig 1 in contrast to 25 and 40 km upstream of ms1 the surface runoff contribution 65 km upstream of ms1 was 0 0 1 46 interflow 0 0 0 53 upper groundwater 0 0 0 69 and lower groundwater 0 0 0 13 noticeable surface runoff contributions were received from du toitskloof with 0 59 1 46 with significant fast groundwater flows towards the western boundary 85 km upstream from ms1 the surface runoff contribution was 0 3 7 interflow 0 0 0 30 upper groundwater 0 0 0 71 and lower groundwater 0 0 0 16 the franschhoek and banghoek mountain ranges in the south provided the bulk of surface runoff with reach contributions of 1 64 3 70 while upper groundwater was more significant towards the east of the catchment 5 discussion the aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of different precipitation stations on simulated streamflow data using a calibrated j2000 rainfall runoff model for the berg river catchment in south africa the model showed that there were distinct differences in performance across the calibration and validation periods which could be partly attributed to variations in measured precipitation thus it was important to evaluate the availability of precipitation data for regionalisation across the different periods calibration and validation as well as the effectiveness of the overall calibration procedure in light of this it was necessary to assess the importance of different precipitation stations for simulated streamflow as the precipitation station sensitivity is influenced by the availability of data it was necessary to also consider why the precipitation datasets could not be infilled which would eliminate the influence of data gaps on the regional sensitivity analysis 5 1 model representation of hydrological processes the model calibration was performed using a semi automated procedure to combine both the speed and ability of nsga ii to find pareto optimal solutions with expert knowledge regarding plausible j2000 parameter datasets while the pareto optimal solutions from nsga ii yielded good results in terms of e2 peak flow the initial results of the automated procedure still showed some miss alignment during the hydrograph recession manual post autocalibration through the modification of parameters to ensure that they were physically feasible improved the hydrograph recession although the final calibration performed well in terms of e2 the lack of measured high elevation 550 m a s l precipitation data limited the model s ability to simulate high peak flows evident from the regional sensitivity analysis see section 5 3 a distinct difference in the model performance between calibration and validation was seen and in particular a reduction in the model s ability to simulate low flows loge2 reduction by 0 19 with simulated peak flows also being impacted e2 reduction by 0 03 through flattening of the overall hydrograph fig 8b the overall reduction in rainfall between the calibration and validation period was a factor that contributed to a reduction in observed peak streamflow with discharge events 400 m3s 1 being reduced by 40 while the 1 exceedance probability was reduced by 23 fig 7 while this explains the differences in observed peak streamflow between the periods that the model considered a 29 increase in average baseflow during the validation period can only be explained by major river flow diversion the construction of the berg river dam commenced in july of 2004 the approximate time when simulated and observed streamflow differences began fig 10 and this is the likely reason for the difference in performance criteria between the calibration and validation periods while the model validation was hindered by diversion retention upstream the input precipitation station locations and density were sufficient for the rainfall runoff model to correctly capture the natural river flow regime highlighted by the performance criteria consequently the model had the ability to estimate the overall importance of the different precipitation stations identifying areas important for overall runoff generation processes 5 2 influence of climate regionalisation given that many catchments particularly in africa have incomplete records or sparse precipitation networks there has been a concerted effort in recent years to develop new methods which can address this problem using limited physical measurements of precipitation the advancement and development of satellite based precipitation radar and trend surface analysis offers the potential to patch and homogenize precipitation records global satellite data chirps climate hazard group infared precipitation with station data and persian precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks offer the potential to fill data gaps across a range of different environments while these datasets have been used as inputs or to patch data in other catchments e g liu et al 2017 sulugodu and deka 2019 yu et al 2020 they both proved ineffective in the berg river catchment as there was a disconnect in the satellite data and precipitation station event timing similarly trend surface analysis which has proven effective in other catchments using existing precipitation station data gajbhiye et al 2016 was ineffective in this catchment due to the weak temporal correlation resulting in unexplainable modelling results therefore idw in combination with elevation correction of the observed precipitation data was the best approach available for this study based on the input data limitations poor temporal coverage of input data which was the case in this study for simulations after 2009 resulted in a decline in measured precipitation variability the implication is that while spatial variability can be accounted for using various interpolation techniques or satellite approaches temporal variability is far more complex often complicated by microclimatic variations thus a new approach is necessary that can be used to identify sensitive stations or areas of importance in terms of their impact on simulated overall flow contribution specifically considerably more effort should be placed on fixing data gaps in existing data records 5 3 assessment of precipitation station sensitivity precipitation station sensitivity signifies the overall importance of the precipitation station location by considering the influence of data from nearby stations and to what extent alterations in station weight would impact simulated streamflow fig 11 in this study there were two situations where a station could have a significant impact on the interpolation process 1 where a large number of hrus have average weights stations 19 and 22 24 and 2 a small number of hrus have high weights stations 43 and 39 fig 11 an example for the first situation is station 24 where 1644 hrus have a weight of 0 1 or higher for the second case station 43 serves 862 hrus with a weight of 0 1 or higher the precipitation station sensitivity analysis linked to simulated streamflow considered stations critical for peak flow and low flow figs 9 12 a and b to further understand how seasonality impacts station sensitivity stations with high overall sensitivity for e2 stations 34 35 43 and 47 in the headwater often represented by high average weights are important for runoff generation figs 8 and 11a in contrast stations downstream which serve a large number of hrus are important for low flows loge2 stations 19 and 26 fig 12b the importance of different stations in terms of overall flow contribution reflects the known microclimatic variations in south africa specifically it is visually apparent that regions with denser vegetation receive more precipitation and are subject to subtle and not so subtle differences in climate across drier regions of south africa and specifically for the northern cape province borders with namibia this is even more apparent with sporadic differences in plant communities suggesting differences in precipitation similarly differences in soil weathering evident from satellites further supports the presence of pockets of high and low precipitation often these are areas of high species diversity and crucial for conservation but have limited in terms of south africa spatial precipitation coverage the extent of different microclimates is indicative of the modelling results for the berg river catchment highlighting locations more important than others for different runoff generation processes the importance of particular regions illustrates the need to tune station weights in order to account for areas of naturally higher rainfall as well as microclimate diversity this has the potential to improve the physical representation of climate within hydrological models improving modelling results without physical changes to input precipitation data and providing a solution to idw bias in data scarce regions furthermore the study highlights the need to improve climate station networks in critical areas as opposed to systematic increases in station density to capture microclimates which control the bulk of runoff generation processes 6 conclusion a precondition to understand and identify signs of hydrological alteration is a proper analysis of the impact of changes in the measurement network over time to distinguish between measurement effects and changes in hydrological flow components identifying hydrological alteration is important for adapting to changes in climate and ensuring sustainable water resource management well understood hydrological models offer the potential to simulate past and future river flow regimes provided that sufficient data exists for calibration and validation purposes the availability of high spatial and temporal measurements of precipitation impacts the ability of hydrological models to simulate natural river flows in this study a j2000 rainfall runoff model calibrated during relatively natural conditions was used to identify precipitation station sensitivity in order to understand the stations overall contribution and the stations systematic impact the approach was performed using a regional sensitivity analysis through adaptions of inverse distance weights and calculations of partial derivates from the idw weight vector the results showed that for peak flow the headwater stations had the largest systematic impact while during low flows stations in the downstream area were more important furthermore the impact of microclimatic variability in the headwater meant that greater reliance was placed on upstream stations while the density of precipitation stations has a significant impact on the performance of rainfall runoff models this study has shown that it is also important to ensure that climate stations are positioned in critical areas to capture the bulk of the precipitation that contributes to runoff generation this is particularly critical in data scarce regions where optimized station weights have the potential to account for microclimatic variability and improve the physical

5194,understanding flow regime dynamics is important for the management and conservation of river systems and their related ecosystems under current and future pressures like climate and land use change for this reason the accuracy and detail with which hydrological models are able to replicate streamflow and other spatially distributed processes is critical for global and regional water management programs one of the most critical factors for model performance is the spatial and temporal representation of precipitation data a procedure known as regionalisation it is therefore imperative to evaluate the sensitivity of models to data from different stations in order to identify locations that exert the strongest control on simulated streamflow in this study a spatially distributed rainfall runoff model the j2000 calibrated under near natural river flow conditions was used to analyse the overall precipitation station impact on simulated streamflow and its flow components for this purpose different analysis methods including regional sensitivity analysis rsa were used the study was applied to the berg river catchment a water stressed region in the western cape south africa that was recently affected by serious drought conditions the results show that during peak flows precipitation stations in the headwater part of the basin had the largest systematic impact often controlling the data input for only a small proportion of the overall spatial extent of the model but still having the largest impact on the overall modelled streamflow in contrast precipitation stations in lowland areas showed to be more important during low flow periods although they often control the data input for a larger part of the modelled catchment the study highlights the importance of good overall data coverage for improved low flow simulations as well as identification of critical areas in regions responsible for peak runoff generation processes the inclusion of systematic station weights has the potential to improve the ecohydrological representation of rainfall runoff models in data scarce regions as well as precipitation regionalisation approaches the results are indicative of known microclimatic variability in semi arid southern africa highlighting the significance of catchment heterogeneity and areas of dominant sub basins for overall runoff generation keywords regionalisation rainfall runoff modelling distributed j2000 model berg river catchment 1 introduction precipitation is the most crucial input data for hydrological modelling the ability of hydrological models to simulate peak discharge amplitude and timing as well as stormflow volume is strongly dependent on the availability of precise spatial and temporal measurements of precipitation berne et al 2004 huang et al 2019 wilson et al 1979 for this reason there have been a large number of studies that have focused on understanding the impact of rain gauge density on model results with the aim to optimize and improve the selection of gauge location and density borga and vizzaccaro 1997 campling et al 2001 spadavecchia and williams 2009 yin et al 2018 at different timesteps it becomes critical to assess the precipitation representation within a hydrological model due to the importance of overall spatial data density the spatial density of precipitation measurements at different timesteps has the ability to negatively affect hydrological modelling results reducing their effectiveness to capture long term climatic trends khan and koch 2018 kim and ryu 2016 the interpolation of precipitation and other climate data is therefore a critical component in determining how climate data is represented within modelling systems and whether localised climate variability is incorporated interpolation and extrapolation also known as regionalisation is an approach used in hydrological modelling to spatially distribute precipitation and climate measurements from localised point sources willmott 1976 while no common consensus exists as to the best technique for climate regionalisation most studies focus on either geostatistical or deterministic approaches based on localised conditions song et al 2016 geostatistical methods the most complex of the regionalisation approaches use a variogram model to generate a correlation between data points resulting in unbiased climate estimates papamichail and metaxa 1996 as geostatistical methods generate unique correlations between active stations incorporating additional stations into the regionalisation requires constant model adjustment e g ly et al 2011 inverse distance weighting idw is one of the most widely applied deterministic regionalisation approaches due to its relative robustness and ease of implementation e g ly et al 2013 the idw approach estimates values at unsampled locations using the weighted average of observed data at surrounding points thereby generating a distance reverse function at each point using neighbouring points teegavarapu and chandramouli 2005 as the idw approach assumes that unknown point values are more influenced by proximal points than distal points idw performs well when networks are spatially dense dirks et al 1998 or in relatively homogenous catchments lynch 2004 although idw does not require adjustment when incorporating additional measurements as networks become sparse more bias is introduced the bias generated by limited points at various levels of relief not only impacts idw but also geostatistical and conventional regionalisation approaches feki et al 2012 therefore it is critical to assess the representation of recent climatic conditions within the hydrological model through multi criteria assessment using a range of objective orientated functions multi criteria assessment has long been recognized as the most comprehensive approach for assessing hydrological model performance beven 2001 duan et al 1992 gupta et al 1998 willems 2009 here multiple objective functions commonly separated into criteria which assess high flow and low flow components are used to assess the goodness of fit of the simulated hydrograph the aim of these objective functions is to determine a set of model parameters that ensure the model behaviour closely resembles the natural system the incorporation of a multi criteria assessment not only reduces model bias and uncertainty but has the potential to counteract the effects of equifinality and solution uniqueness in hydrological modelling efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 the use of a multi criteria assessment also has the potential to improve the ability of hydrological models to capture ecohydrological behaviour even when catchments exhibit spatial and temporal precipitation complexity the main concern for hydrological modelling in data scarce regions is the relative importance of specific precipitation stations in simulating streamflow considering the stations spatial location as well as the overall station density to better understand the sensitivity of hydrological models to precipitation inputs and to identify inconsistencies in model behaviour a fully distributed rainfall runoff model using j2000 eeckman et al 2019 krause 2002 2001 was setup for the berg river catchment south africa a precipitation station sensitivity analysis which made use of monte carlo sampling was used to identify the importance of precipitation stations as independent entities based on simulated high and low flow results these results highlight the impact of microclimate variability on ecohydrological dynamics and the need for appropriate climate station density and distribution to accurately simulate the different hydrological flow components surface runoff interflow and baseflow in the future identification of ecohydrological alteration will become increasingly important for the development of climate adaption strategies particularly in arid and semi arid regions however identification of ecohydrological alteration requires the ability to distinguish between real processes and alteration of the measurement setup over time consequently identification of appropriate spatial and temporal coverage of precipitation to conceptualise recent ecohydrological dynamics and processes is critical for the development of the underlying predictive methods and tools 2 environmental setting the berg river catchment which is located in the western cape province of south africa fig 1 has its headwaters in the high lying mountains outside the town of franschhoek the river drains northwest across a 7700 km2 catchment which grades into relatively low lying flat regions in the north before exiting into the atlantic ocean at veldrif fig 1 mean annual precipitation map in the north west part of the catchment is between 250 and 600 mm at elevations of 50 to 120 m a s l lynch 2004 fig 2 map increases towards the south east to between 700 and 800 mm around the town of paarl at roughly 300 m a s l reaching a maximum map of 3198 mm at a peak elevation of 1585 m a s l in the headwaters of the catchment lynch 2004 the catchment supports four major water bodies namely in downstream order the recently built berg river dam 2009 with a capacity of 130 mm3 the wemmershoek dam 1957 with a capacity of 58 mm3 the voëlvlei dam 1971 with a capacity of 164 mm3 and misverstand dam 1977 with a capacity of 8 mm3 these water bodies have significant impacts on natural river flow regimes with streamflow downstream of the misverstand and berg river dams largely controlled by reservoir releases bulk river flow monitoring site ms1 main river stem is located at the lower downstream sections of the berg river before misverstand dam fig 1 the catchment supports the berg river estuary which begins 70 km upstream of the mouth at velddrif regarded as a national conservation priority due to the endemic bird and wildlife species turpie 1995 natural vegetation makes up a considerable portion of the catchment which is mainly dominated by thicket dense bush and shrubland fynbos with coastal macchia coastal rhenosterbosveld and macchia being the dominant vegetation types acocks 1988 mucina and rutherford 2006 the berg river catchment makes up around 8 of the total irrigated area 22 500 ha of the western cape with dominant crops being grapes both wine and table citrus and potatoes typically irrigation water is mostly abstracted from the main berg river system with reservoir releases controlled by the downstream irrigation demand 3

2 streamflow twenty seven gauging structures are located within the catchment to monitor streamflow not all shown due to poor record length reliability or impacted by reservoir releases these structures are mainly located on the main berg river network although the density of gauges increases near reservoirs and main feeding streams gauge selection for model calibration and validation was based on measurements not impacted by upstream reservoirs as well as having sufficient data quality and length furthermore records which were not hindered by discharge table limitations and agricultural abstraction and which resemble natural conditions were selected gauging measurements from ms1 g1h013 drieheuwels between 1986 10 01 to 2009 09 03 were used during calibration and validation as they resemble bulk catchment river flow as it is the most reliable downstream gauge and is positioned upstream of major reservoirs for a time period before major reservoir construction 3

hydrogeological process parameters required for the j2000 model the upper aquifer of the catchment is mainly comprised of quaternary sediments and weathered material while the lower or secondary aquifer is comprised of malmesbury group shales and table mountain group sandstones the maximum storage capacity along with the storage coefficients of the upper and lower aquifer were needed for the groundwater component of the model in addition to these parameters maximum aquifer thickness and recession coefficients are required these parameters were taken from models developed nearby bugan 2014

direction maps were generated from the dem and further used to delineate the stream network and related sub basins the level of detail for the stream network delineation was chosen such that all stream segments of hydrological importance were represented in the model resulting in a minimum sub basin size of 7 3 km2 for this application 3 reclassified dem derivates slope aspect elevation sub basins and maps of land use soil geology were combined in an overlay analysis to delineate hydrologically homogeneous modelling units which formulate hrus in order to eliminate small sliver hrus all polygons below a given size threshold were merged with neighbouring polygons in an iterative process until only hrus above the threshold remained for this application the threshold was set to 50 pixels approx 0 4 km2 which resulted in 12 266 hrus overall with a mean hru size of 0 6 km2 4 the flow accumulation map was used to generate a flow routing network that connected the generated hrus with one another or with specific reach segments allowing the hrus to drain either directly to the reach segments hrus adjacent to a reach segment or alternatively to neighbouring hrus all others 5 finally hru statistics and attribute values were computed and assigned for each hru including area elevation slope aspect watershed sub basin land use geology soil and topological neighbours hru reach 3 3 model regionalisation for the presented study the idw approach was used to regionalise climate input data for the hydrological model using this method each hru h was assigned a vector w h w h 1 w h m which contained weights for all m climate stations here the weight w h s of station s for hru h was calculated as 1 w h s 1 dist h s p where d i s t h s is the euclidian lateral distance between h and s value p is a freely chosen exponent that allows attenuation of station importance at decreasing distances and thus accounted for the degree at which dissimilarity of the climate variable was exacerbated with distance an exponent value of p 2 was used in this study to account for the availability of station data for the case d i s t h s 0 w h s was assigned a value of 1 while all other w h t t s were assigned values of 0 using this weight vector the local climate value v h at hru h was then calculated as a weighted average of values at all m stations according to 2 v h 1 s 1 m w h s s 1 m w h s v s where v s was the measured value at station s in this study measurements at each station covered different time periods and all exhibited gaps given these conditions a varying list of stations at each time step was required and thus the weight vector w h had to be recalculated for each time step in order to account for elevation differences between hrus and climate stations an elevation correction of the interpolated climate value was applied for this purpose each hru was assigned monthly lapse rate adjustment values based on the long term relationships between station elevations and their climatic observations to account for stations positioned at different elevations the adjustment values were based on elevation ranges and separated as 0 100 m 101 250 m 251 550 m and 800 m as rainfall exhibited a stronger dependence on elevation than temperature fig 4 a a monthly adjustment was applied to the rainfall regionalisation fig 4b while a single adjustment value was used to adjust the regionalised temperature for a given lapse rate r the adapted climate value v h for hru h was calculated as 3 v h r e h e h 100 v h where v h is the output of the idw method e h is the elevation of hru h and e h is the mean elevation of the stations used to calculate v h similar to v h e h was calculated as a weighted average of each station s elevation according to 4 e h 1 s 1 m w h s s 1 m w h s e s where e s is the elevation of station s 3 4 model calibration and validation for model calibration and validation the time series was split into two periods 1 calibration from 1983 11 01 until 1995 11 01 and 2 validation from 1995 to 11 01 until 2009 10 31 for this study a semi automatic model calibration approach was chosen using both automatic and manual procedures e g boyle et al 2000 these two procedures were performed consecutively manual calibration beginning upon completion of the automated procedure the rationale was to use the manual calibration to benefit from expert knowledge and understanding about quantifiable model parameters in the region such as infiltration capacity during different seasons furthermore a robust optimization procedure was used to find optimal parameters that cannot be measured directly e g bekele and nicklow 2007 the selected model parameters were calibrated using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 nsga ii is a multi objective evolutionary search algorithm used to identify the best parameter values from pareto optimal solutions deb et al 2002 to evaluate model performance visualizations and calculations of the ecohydrological properties were used these included measured and simulated flow soil water groundwater evapotranspiration and catchment water balances amongst others in addition various goodness of fit or efficiency criteria were used to evaluate model performance for different aspects of the simulated hydrograph and compare the results to literature kundzewicz et al 2018 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 the statistical efficiency criteria selected were the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash 1970 in standard squared form e2 the relative volume error pbias and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nse was chosen because it is widely applied in hydrological modelling and allows assessment of overall model performance however the disadvantage of nse is that it over represents peak flows due to the calculation of mean square differences between simulated and observed runoff krause and boyle 2005 therefore the logarithmic form of nse loge2 was used for better evaluation of low flow periods in addition pbias was used to quantify the overall estimation error finally kge was used to evaluate correlation bias and the variability between simulated and observed runoff 3 5 precipitation station impact assessment in order to analyse the impact of specific precipitation stations on model performance two distinct methods were applied the first approach aimed to link station location with its impact on simulated streamflow for this purpose the contribution of single sub basins to the overall runoff generation were calculated and the mean idw weights of each station over all hrus was determined combining both these results allowed identification of stations that had a high impact not only on the overall simulated runoff but also on specific runoff components the second approach used the calibrated model to perform a regional sensitivity analysis rsa on all stations idw weights for this purpose a scaling factor f s was introduced for each station s that allowed for the uniform increase decrease of weights w s w s 1 w n s across all n hrus these weights which were initially calculated using the idw method eq 1 were scaled using f s according to 5 w s f s w s f s w 1 s f s w n s after these adaptations were applied to all stations i 1 m their scaled weight vectors w i were used for the idw interpolation as described in section 3 3 the scaling factors were assigned by means of a monte carlo analysis mca that took random samples from the interval 0 9 1 1 resulting in an increase decrease of a station s overall weight of up to 10 for each sample the model s simulated runoff was analysed by means of nse and lognse efficiency criteria to assess model peak and low flow performance in order to apply the rsa and calculate sensitivity values for all stations a meta model approach was applied here the results of the mca were used as input to a simplified regression model that predicted the model s efficiency based on a set of scaling factors in order to create this regression model an artificial neural network ann was trained with the mca results as described in fischer et al 2012 for the application of mca and rsa existing functions of the jams modelling system were applied kralisch and fischer 2012 4 results an analysis was required of the model s ability to simulate the river flow dynamics of the catchment before an evaluation could be made of the precipitation station sensitivity the impact of station locations on simulated streamflow as well as the meaning of average station weights below an assessment is provided of the input and regionalised precipitation data as well as the observed streamflow data from station ms1 thereafter the results of the simulated streamflow and reach flow contributions are outlined the analysis was split into wet and dry seasons with wet being from may to october and dry november to april the model simulation was divided into two periods calibration 1983 11 01 to 1995 10 31 and validation 1995 11 01 to 2009 10 31 and hence the analysis of observed data was also split into these two time periods this also facilitated assessment of potential differences in measured precipitation which could result in changes in observed and simulated streamflow at ms1 furthermore it was important to assess the availability of precipitation data for model regionalisation the availability of data at different elevation ranges and average distance between hrus and precipitation stations impacts on simulated streamflow and is therefore also included in the presentation of results 4 1 observed precipitation the analysis of observed precipitation was aggregated into stations between 0 and 100 m a s l at low altitude inland between 101 and 250 m a s l and mid altitude between 251 and 550 m a s l fig 5 and table 2 for the calibration and validation periods no measurements were available above 550 m a s l for the calibration period there were 7 stations between 0 and 100 m a s l 22 stations between 101 and 250 m a s l and 3 stations between 251 and 550 m a s l fig 5 the map measured for stations at 0 100 m a s l was 431 mm stations between 101 and 250 m a s l 526 mm and stations between 251 and 550 m a s l 518 mm table 2 on average the maximum measured precipitation for stations between 0 and 100 m a s l was 25 mm d 1 stations between 101 and 250 m a s l 34 mm d 1 and stations between 251 and 550 m a s l 38 mm d 1 for the validation period precipitation was available from 7 stations at 0 100 m a s l 25 stations at 101 250 and 4 stations at 251 550 m a s l fig 5 the map measured for stations between 0 and 100 was 404 mm stations between 101 and 250 m a s l 511 mm and 251 550 m a s l 549 mm table 2 the average maximum precipitation was 22 mm d 1 for stations between 0 and 100 m a s l 29 mm d 1 for 100 250 m a s l and 33 mm d 1 for 251 550 m a s l although there were more stations available during the validation period than during the calibration period which may account for the increase of 6 in measured precipitation at 251 550 m a s l the measured precipitation was 7 and 3 less for 0 100 m a s l and 101 250 m a s l this is reflected in the average maximum precipitation for 0 100 m a s l 101 250 m a s l as well as 251 550 m a s l for these periods 4 2 regionalised precipitation the regionalised precipitation for the model was assessed by comparing the measured precipitation for the different elevation ranges with the regionalised precipitation using the lapse rate adjustment over the basin while the lapse rate adjustment acts to account for the elevation of the hru the regionalised precipitation is more influenced by the closest precipitation station fig 6 a and b overall the regionalised precipitation was in line with the measured precipitation although there are some noticeable differences that will be discussed for both the basin and the model domain upstream of ms1 for the calibration period the average distance between the hrus and the precipitation stations was 12 km for the model domain although between 1984 and 1986 fewer stations meant that the average distance was 15 km during this period fig 6ai the elevation difference between the hrus and the precipitation stations was 185 m during the calibration period although between 1994 and 1996 this increased to 190 m due to the addition of new low altitude stations fig 6bi therefore on average precipitation data was adjusted upward as the hrus were above at a higher elevation the measured precipitation stations as the density of low altitude stations was limited within the model domain the low altitude hrus often received data from stations between 100 and 250 m a s l while high altitude hrus received data from stations between 250 and 350 m a s l fig 6b the regionalised precipitation was on average 676 mm yr 1 for the model domain with the bulk of precipitation between 515 and 780 mm 1st to 3rd quartile regionalised precipitation for 0 100 m a s l and 101 250 m a s l within the basin was 491 mm yr 1 and 594 mm yr 1 in comparison to measured values of 431 mm and 526 mm yr 1 respectively table 2 regionalised precipitation for hrus between 251 and 550 m a s l within the basin was 660 mm yr 1 compared to measured precipitation values of 518 mm yr 1 for the validation period the average distance between the hrus and precipitation stations was 13 km for the model domain where between 2004 and 2008 there were fewer data gaps and the average distance was around 11 km during this period fig 6ai the average elevation difference during the validation period was 186 m with slightly more data gaps in higher elevation stations fig 6bi precipitation for the hrus was on average adjusted upwards with the limited low altitude 0 100 m a s l stations within the model domain as well as no high altitude stations above 550 m a s l similar to the calibration period low altitude hrus received data from stations between 100 and 250 m a s l while high altitude hrus received data from stations between 250 and 350 m a s l the regionalised precipitation was on average 655 mm yr 1 for the model domain with yearly precipitation predominately between 629 and 736 mm 1st to 3rd quartile regionalised precipitation within the basin for hrus between 0 and 100 m a s l and 101 250 m a s l was 480 mm yr 1 and 562 mm yr 1 compared with measured precipitation of 404 mm yr 1 and 511 mm yr 1 respectfully table 2 regionalised precipitation for hrus between 251 and 550 m a s l was 603 mm yr 1 in comparison to measured precipitation of 549 mm yr 1 overall regionalised precipitation during the validation was 3 less than during the calibration period with the addition of new stations accounting for the 1st to 3rd quartile increases across these periods the inclusion of new stations especially for 251 550 m a s l during the validation period improved the regionalisation up to 10 while in general the regionalised precipitation was within 16 of the measured values 4 3 observed daily streamflow a maximum streamflow of 644 m3s 1 was measured at ms1 during the calibration period with an average streamflow of 6 1 m3s 1 50th percentile and low flow of 2 0 m3s 1 70th percentile fig 7 on five occasions during the calibration period streamflow measured at ms1 exceeded 400 m3 s 1 with the most significant measure of 218 m3s 1 exceeded 1 of the time and the lowest significance of 0 4 m3s 1 exceeded 99 of the time during the validation the maximum streamflow of 672 m3s 1 was measured at ms1 with an average streamflow of 4 6 m3s 1 50th percentile and low flow of 2 8 m3s 1 70th percentile fig 7 on three occasions during the validation period streamflow exceeded 400 m3s 1 with the maximum measured significance of 167 7 m3s 1 exceeded 1 of the time and the lowest measured significance of 0 8 m3s 1 exceeded 99 of the time 4 4 simulated streamflow the performance of the j2000 model was evaluated by comparing the daily simulated and observed streamflow visually and with selected performance criteria goodness of fit fig 8 and table 3 the daily data was used to assess the overall capability of the model to simulate ecohydrological process dynamics below the long term aggregated monthly streamflow which assesses the ability of the model to simulate seasonal variability and simulated runoff components is presented in general the developed model was able to simulate the observed streamflow well during both calibration and validation periods fig 8a and b fig 8ai and bi however there were some noticeable differences across these periods within the calibration period the model performed well during low and high flow conditions resulting in a relative error pbias of 0 07 fig 8a overall the observed monthly average streamflow was 21 47 m3 s 1 while the simulated streamflow was 19 99 m3s 1 table 3 the prediction of hydrological dynamics during the dry periods was good as the observed monthly average streamflow was 3 33 m3s 1 compared to simulated streamflow of 3 25 m3s 1 table 3 this behaviour was underlined by the loge2 of 0 84 a slightly different scenario was presented during the wet season during that period the measured monthly average streamflow was 39 61 m3s 1 while the simulated streamflow was 36 73 m3s 1 table 3 the overall hydrograph was underestimated by the model especially during peak flow above 400 m3s 1 however the overall hydrograph fig 8a showed very good simulation of high flows during the wet season the reaction time to rainfall was captured well by the simulation of the rising runoff limb furthermore the runoff recession mainly governed by interflow was well represented fig 8a despite the inability of the model to simulate the highest peak flows the e2 of 0 82 indicated the overall good simulation of high flows finally the kge of 0 85 also supports the strong correlation between measured and simulated streamflow within the validation period the model performed equally well again with a relative error pbias of 0 07 fig 8b overall the observed monthly average streamflow was 17 56 m3 s 1 while the simulated streamflow was 17 24 m3s 1 table 2 although there was a small difference between overall simulated and observed streamflow the loge2 of 0 65 was lower than during the calibration period indicated by the overall change in the shape of the observed hydrograph fig 8bi during the dry period the model performed reasonably well with monthly average simulated streamflow of 2 81 m3s 1 in comparison to the average observed streamflow of 4 03 m3s 1 table 2 during the wet season the model performed well with a monthly average streamflow of 31 08 m3s 1 and a simulated streamflow of 31 67 m3s 1 table 2 a loge2 of 0 78 illustrates good model performance for peak flow although not as good during the model calibration period the overall hydrograph was overestimated by the model during peak flow and underestimated during low flows while the rising runoff limb was captured well by the model as the observed runoff recession was vastly different to the calibration period it was not as well simulated despite the reduction in performance for loge2 and e2 the model performance with a kge of 0 85 supports a good correlation between measured and simulated streamflow 4 5 simulated flow components hydrological flow components which have been separated into simulated surface runoff interflow upper and lower groundwater were calculated as an area weighted temporal aggregate for sub basins as a percentage of the overall total flow fig 9 in the section to follow the simulated flow components were grouped into regions based on proximity to ms1 defined as 25 km 40 km 65 km and 85 km upstream of ms1 in the vicinity of ms1 and 25 km upstream surface runoff contribution was between 0 0 and 0 93 fig 9a interflow 0 0 0 26 fig 9b upper groundwater 0 0 0 22 fig 9c and lower groundwater 0 0 0 19 of the overall total flow fig 9d the most noticeable contribution was from surface runoff with 0 92 and 0 75 from the eastern reaches and limited interflow and groundwater contributions similar to 25 km upstream the surface runoff contribution 40 km upstream was 0 1 0 interflow 0 0 0 18 upper groundwater 0 0 0 69 and lower groundwater 0 02 0 24 noticeable surface runoff contributions were received in the headwaters of the klein berg located east of ms1 with contributions of 0 17 1 0 while fast groundwater upper gw was significant in the reaches feeding vöelvlei reservoir fig 1 in contrast to 25 and 40 km upstream of ms1 the surface runoff contribution 65 km upstream of ms1 was 0 0 1 46 interflow 0 0 0 53 upper groundwater 0 0 0 69 and lower groundwater 0 0 0 13 noticeable surface runoff contributions were received from du toitskloof with 0 59 1 46 with significant fast groundwater flows towards the western boundary 85 km upstream from ms1 the surface runoff contribution was 0 3 7 interflow 0 0 0 30 upper groundwater 0 0 0 71 and lower groundwater 0 0 0 16 the franschhoek and banghoek mountain ranges in the south provided the bulk of surface runoff with reach contributions of 1 64 3 70 while upper groundwater was more significant towards the east of the catchment 5 discussion the aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of different precipitation stations on simulated streamflow data using a calibrated j2000 rainfall runoff model for the berg river catchment in south africa the model showed that there were distinct differences in performance across the calibration and validation periods which could be partly attributed to variations in measured precipitation thus it was important to evaluate the availability of precipitation data for regionalisation across the different periods calibration and validation as well as the effectiveness of the overall calibration procedure in light of this it was necessary to assess the importance of different precipitation stations for simulated streamflow as the precipitation station sensitivity is influenced by the availability of data it was necessary to also consider why the precipitation datasets could not be infilled which would eliminate the influence of data gaps on the regional sensitivity analysis 5 1 model representation of hydrological processes the model calibration was performed using a semi automated procedure to combine both the speed and ability of nsga ii to find pareto optimal solutions with expert knowledge regarding plausible j2000 parameter datasets while the pareto optimal solutions from nsga ii yielded good results in terms of e2 peak flow the initial results of the automated procedure still showed some miss alignment during the hydrograph recession manual post autocalibration through the modification of parameters to ensure that they were physically feasible improved the hydrograph recession although the final calibration performed well in terms of e2 the lack of measured high elevation 550 m a s l precipitation data limited the model s ability to simulate high peak flows evident from the regional sensitivity analysis see section 5 3 a distinct difference in the model performance between calibration and validation was seen and in particular a reduction in the model s ability to simulate low flows loge2 reduction by 0 19 with simulated peak flows also being impacted e2 reduction by 0 03 through flattening of the overall hydrograph fig 8b the overall reduction in rainfall between the calibration and validation period was a factor that contributed to a reduction in observed peak streamflow with discharge events 400 m3s 1 being reduced by 40 while the 1 exceedance probability was reduced by 23 fig 7 while this explains the differences in observed peak streamflow between the periods that the model considered a 29 increase in average baseflow during the validation period can only be explained by major river flow diversion the construction of the berg river dam commenced in july of 2004 the approximate time when simulated and observed streamflow differences began fig 10 and this is the likely reason for the difference in performance criteria between the calibration and validation periods while the model validation was hindered by diversion retention upstream the input precipitation station locations and density were sufficient for the rainfall runoff model to correctly capture the natural river flow regime highlighted by the performance criteria consequently the model had the ability to estimate the overall importance of the different precipitation stations identifying areas important for overall runoff generation processes 5 2 influence of climate regionalisation given that many catchments particularly in africa have incomplete records or sparse precipitation networks there has been a concerted effort in recent years to develop new methods which can address this problem using limited physical measurements of precipitation the advancement and development of satellite based precipitation radar and trend surface analysis offers the potential to patch and homogenize precipitation records global satellite data chirps climate hazard group infared precipitation with station data and persian precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks offer the potential to fill data gaps across a range of different environments while these datasets have been used as inputs or to patch data in other catchments e g liu et al 2017 sulugodu and deka 2019 yu et al 2020 they both proved ineffective in the berg river catchment as there was a disconnect in the satellite data and precipitation station event timing similarly trend surface analysis which has proven effective in other catchments using existing precipitation station data gajbhiye et al 2016 was ineffective in this catchment due to the weak temporal correlation resulting in unexplainable modelling results therefore idw in combination with elevation correction of the observed precipitation data was the best approach available for this study based on the input data limitations poor temporal coverage of input data which was the case in this study for simulations after 2009 resulted in a decline in measured precipitation variability the implication is that while spatial variability can be accounted for using various interpolation techniques or satellite approaches temporal variability is far more complex often complicated by microclimatic variations thus a new approach is necessary that can be used to identify sensitive stations or areas of importance in terms of their impact on simulated overall flow contribution specifically considerably more effort should be placed on fixing data gaps in existing data records 5 3 assessment of precipitation station sensitivity precipitation station sensitivity signifies the overall importance of the precipitation station location by considering the influence of data from nearby stations and to what extent alterations in station weight would impact simulated streamflow fig 11 in this study there were two situations where a station could have a significant impact on the interpolation process 1 where a large number of hrus have average weights stations 19 and 22 24 and 2 a small number of hrus have high weights stations 43 and 39 fig 11 an example for the first situation is station 24 where 1644 hrus have a weight of 0 1 or higher for the second case station 43 serves 862 hrus with a weight of 0 1 or higher the precipitation station sensitivity analysis linked to simulated streamflow considered stations critical for peak flow and low flow figs 9 12 a and b to further understand how seasonality impacts station sensitivity stations with high overall sensitivity for e2 stations 34 35 43 and 47 in the headwater often represented by high average weights are important for runoff generation figs 8 and 11a in contrast stations downstream which serve a large number of hrus are important for low flows loge2 stations 19 and 26 fig 12b the importance of different stations in terms of overall flow contribution reflects the known microclimatic variations in south africa specifically it is visually apparent that regions with denser vegetation receive more precipitation and are subject to subtle and not so subtle differences in climate across drier regions of south africa and specifically for the northern cape province borders with namibia this is even more apparent with sporadic differences in plant communities suggesting differences in precipitation similarly differences in soil weathering evident from satellites further supports the presence of pockets of high and low precipitation often these are areas of high species diversity and crucial for conservation but have limited in terms of south africa spatial precipitation coverage the extent of different microclimates is indicative of the modelling results for the berg river catchment highlighting locations more important than others for different runoff generation processes the importance of particular regions illustrates the need to tune station weights in order to account for areas of naturally higher rainfall as well as microclimate diversity this has the potential to improve the physical representation of climate within hydrological models improving modelling results without physical changes to input precipitation data and providing a solution to idw bias in data scarce regions furthermore the study highlights the need to improve climate station networks in critical areas as opposed to systematic increases in station density to capture microclimates which control the bulk of runoff generation processes 6 conclusion a precondition to understand and identify signs of hydrological alteration is a proper analysis of the impact of changes in the measurement network over time to distinguish between measurement effects and changes in hydrological flow components identifying hydrological alteration is important for adapting to changes in climate and ensuring sustainable water resource management well understood hydrological models offer the potential to simulate past and future river flow regimes provided that sufficient data exists for calibration and validation purposes the availability of high spatial and temporal measurements of precipitation impacts the ability of hydrological models to simulate natural river flows in this study a j2000 rainfall runoff model calibrated during relatively natural conditions was used to identify precipitation station sensitivity in order to understand the stations overall contribution and the stations systematic impact the approach was performed using a regional sensitivity analysis through adaptions of inverse distance weights and calculations of partial derivates from the idw weight vector the results showed that for peak flow the headwater stations had the largest systematic impact while during low flows stations in the downstream area were more important furthermore the impact of microclimatic variability in the headwater meant that greater reliance was placed on upstream stations while the density of precipitation stations has a significant impact on the performance of rainfall runoff models this study has shown that it is also important to ensure that climate stations are positioned in critical areas to capture the bulk of the precipitation that contributes to runoff generation this is particularly critical in data scarce regions where optimized station weights have the potential to account for microclimatic variability and improve the physical
