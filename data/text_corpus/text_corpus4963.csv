24815,animal movement study often relies on individual tracking the data scale in time and space varies according to the species the environment where individuals live or the exogenous processes that drive movement to explore freshwater fish movement in rivers fine scale data are needed also in rivers recorded telemetry frequently shows missing data and location errors the irregular time steps huge amount of data environmental complexity river section and how fish move in such anisotropic environments undermine the use of statistical frameworks such as state space models to deal with these specificities data pre treatment can be required we propose a generic method of telemetry data pre processing which can be transposed to other datasets this framework includes interpolation to handle trajectories at fine time scales and performs data analysis within a state space model we combined analyses on observed and simulated data at various interpolation time steps to choose the one that best preserves the general movement while reducing the total amount of data required first we directly compared raw and interpolated data and the results of parameter inference of a simple state space model using the interpolated data the state space model infers behavioural state based on speed and turning angle between successive locations in animal trajectories we also included two additional variables computed from raw data a quantitative indicator of the correspondence between the interpolated trajectory and the raw data and the variance of turning angles of raw data within the interpolation time step we were finally able to determine the most appropriate time step to obtain locations that were regularly spaced in time and to reduce the amount of data while maintaining the precision of the raw data computational time was reduced 12 fold by using a 30 second time step to interpolate data simulated at 3 second intervals the inclusion of the two variables derived from raw data compensated for the loss of information in interpolated trajectories and allowed more efficient discrimination between behaviours keywords animal location data movement model state space model

2005 and adaptability to climate change and extreme events boucek et al 2017 the study of animal movement often relies on individual tracking recent technical progress has revolutionized such studies the development of high frequency tags enables high frequency data collection at fine spatial resolution cagnacci et al 2010 hussey et al 2015 lennox et al 2017 tracking data at high temporal resolution are invaluable for species that are rarely static although staying in the same area location per hour half day or day provides information on individual movement within an animal s living range e g within a region or along a migration route over a long period of time rather than small quick displacements within or between local habitats capra et al 2018 donaldson et al 2014 in contrast tracking several locations per minute allow displacements to be described at fine scale enabling precise investigations of suitable migratory conditions habitat selection or behaviour choices at individual level e g capra et al 2017 cooke et al 2004 tétard et al 2019 telemetry data at a very fine time scale of a few seconds are being increasingly collected worldwide cooke et al 2013 hussey et al 2015 lennox et al 2017 positions are generally estimated by triangulation either by satellite or by multiple fixed receivers statistical modelling frameworks have been developed to analyse aquatic

thiebault et al 2018 vermard et al 2010 and investigating the influence of the environment on individual movements bestley et al 2013 drouineau et al 2017 patterson et al 2009 state space modelling is one of the useful existing statistical frameworks for animal movement analysis dorazio and price 2019 jonsen et al 2003 joo et al 2013 patterson et al 2008 most animal movement studies have focused on large terrestrial or marine species e g andersen et al 2007 bailey et al 2008 franke et al 2006 hedger et al 2008 mcclintock et al 2012 which move in a wide and open environment few have dealt with freshwater organisms telemetry data for anisotropic irregular environments such as large rivers show some specificities cooke et al 2013 firstly triangulation is made difficult by ground irregularities and the presence of vegetation causing frequent signal loss secondly the precision of triangulation varies in space bergé et al 2012 and thirdly the anisotropic closed conditions of hydrographic networks are specific limitations on animal movement quaglietta and porto 2019 sutherland et al 2015 and complicate the trajectory analysis fish navigation is known to be influenced by physical cues such as current fields and physical obstacles e g dams or river banks goodwin et al 2014 leading to highly orientated navigation which does not fulfil the isotropy assumption usually applied in open environments the second major issue is the temporal and spatial scales at which fish movement is characterised telemetry studies of freshwater fish generally focus on seasonal movement e g dorazio and price 2019 fraley et al 2016 koehn and nicol 2016 muhlfeld et al 2012 and modelling frameworks are rarely applied to analysing individual movements at fine scales however such fine scale data and corresponding analytical methods are critical to studying small scale foraging movements of fishes within their home range which dingle 1996 called station keeping movement in contrast to migration over large distances the combination of environmental limitations which entail irregularities in signal recording and fine spatial and temporal scale has three main consequences firstly irregular time steps have to be handled secondly analysing the huge amount of data generated requires great computer power which may lead to a trade off between reducing computing time and not degrading fine scale data quality and thirdly the consideration of entire individual trajectories from the beginning to the end of the recording period is not always necessary a certain number of trajectories spaced in time can also be used to explore individual behaviour to deal with irregular time steps an appropriately longer time step can be chosen coupled with interpolation if necessary to deal with any missing data increasing the time step generally reduces the rate of missing data while also reducing the amount of data to be analysed however it impairs overall precision compared to the raw dataset and may impact ecological interpretations based on these trajectories in this paper we propose a generic method of data processing to accurately infer individual behaviours from trajectories at fine temporal and spatial scales analysis was performed at different time steps and compared so as to select the most appropriate one i e the one that preserved the general movement while efficiently discriminating between behaviours here slow and fast movements to this end we directly compared the raw and interpolated data and compared the results of the parameters inference of a simple state space model with the interpolated data we did not deal with location error as our aim was to infer individual behaviour based on observed movement rather than reconstruct the exact individual trajectories moreover usual correction methods are based on an isotropy assumption i e that there is no favoured direction within the space and animal navigation consequently depends only on behaviour and not on environmental characteristics such as flow fields around physical obstacles which is not fulfilled here to illustrate this approach we used telemetry data for individual fish collected in the rhône river at 3 second intervals capra et al 2017 the initial objective of the study was to infer the relationships between fish behaviour and hydraulic conditions through analysis of fish movements in this context we used a state space model to discriminate fish behaviours for that raw fish location data hereafter referred to as raw data must be pre processed while maintaining the precision of the raw data gaps between locations must be dealt with so as to obtain regularly time spaced data 2 material and methods 2 1 case study bergé et al 2012 collected telemetry data on freshwater fish in the rhône river using the hti https www innovasea com fish tracking acoustic fixed telemetry system our system includes a set of pre positioned hydrophones used to detect ultrasounds emitted by acoustic tags frequency of 307 khz tags signals that allow the identification of the tag and precise positioning of the tag through a triangulation process provided that the signal is detected by at least 3 hydrophones hydrophones were all connected to a single controller and synchronized with utc time to improve the triangulation further details are provided in bergé et al 2012 locations of 94 individuals of various species were tracked for 3 months at a time interval of 3 s the dataset suffered from the usual defects affecting tracking data firstly individuals were not systematically located every 3 s during the 3 months of the experiment there were two types of gap in the data large gaps in which the individual signal was lost for several minutes to several days and small gaps where the individual signal was lost for a few 3 second periods i e 3 s to a few minutes a second defect was specific to the triangulation process of the hti system some successive locations form artefactual star shaped trajectories appendix a figure a1 though this type of star shaped pattern is specific to the triangulation process it is more generally one of the types of location error besetting most tracking studies the fine time scale data may also incur a specific problem when an individual is static or moving very slowly its successive locations can be tracked as being as distant as when it is moving faster due to triangulation error 2 2 proposed data pre processing three pre processing steps were performed on the raw data the first was the choice of a time step p the second dealt with the large gaps between certain successive locations for this we considered using a threshold s equal to twice the time step p in order to split the trajectory in two while avoiding interpolation in between points that were too far apart in time if the duration between two successive locations x y i and x y i 1 x and y denoting the spatial coordinates and i the index of the location is greater than s then these two locations are assumed to belong to two distinct independent trajectories the raw data for a given trajectory are denoted hereafter as the support of the trajectory the third step consisted in the linear interpolation of new locations within each trajectory according to the time step p to deal with missing data within each trajectory interpolations were carried out using the move r package kranstauber and smolla 2008 we tested 6 interpolation time steps with the associated s threshold 30 60 120 180 240 and 300 s denoted by pk k 1 6 in order to test the different means of pre processing the raw data 16 of the 731 trajectories of individual european catfish silurus glanis were selected european catfish were chosen because this species included well tracked individuals presenting numerous locations and thus longer trajectories than for other species the complete trajectories can comprise three general patterns i travelling t in which the individual moves over a long distance where start and end locations are distant from one another ii stationary s where locations are concentrated within a short perimeter potentially star shaped with start and end locations nearby and iii a mixed pattern b for bi type where a stationary move follows a long move or vice versa four trajectories of each for the stationary and travelling types and 8 trajectories for the mixed type were selected for the test dataset two examples of each trajectory type at each time step are shown in fig 1 2 3 validation criteria to compare the interpolated trajectories using the different time steps pk several criteria were considered 2 3 1 computed variables two variables were computed to quantify the consistency between the raw data and each interpolated trajectory they showed different patterns according to the type of trajectory and were computed to see how they varied according to time step the two additional variables denoted by u 1 and u 2 concerned speed and turning angles respectively for a trajectory j associated with time step pk let x y n j p k nj 0 nj with nj the total number of locations in the trajectory j be the nj th location in the trajectory considering the support of the trajectory j let i 0 i n j be an index for raw data locations denoted by x y i n j between time nj pk and n j 1 p k of the trajectory locations and θ i n j the angle between the locations x y i n j x y i 1 n j and x y i 2 n j for a time step pk and a total time nj pk of the trajectory j u 1 k n j and u 2 k n j are defined as follows 1 u 1 k n j d x y n j p k x y n j 1 p k i 0 i n j 1 d x y i n j x y i n j 1 where d x 1 x 2 represents the covered distance between locations x 1 and x 2 u 1 is thus the ratio between the covered distance according to the interpolated data and the covered distance according to the raw data within the interpolation time step u 1 represents a quantitative indicator of the correspondence between the interpolated trajectory and the raw data the higher u 1 the better the fit 2 u 2 k n j v a r θ i n j where i 0 in and var x denotes the variance of x u 2 is thus the variance of turning angles of raw data within the interpolation time step if the variance is small the trajectory is rectilinear within the interpolated time step and little information is lost however a large variance may indicate a star shaped pattern especially if associated with a low u 1 2 3 2 state space modelling we developed a state space model based on morales et al 2004 to discriminate between the different individual behaviours in the 16 selected trajectories model parameters were estimated independently for each time step so as to assess variations in parameter estimates according to the time step results for each time step where also compared with and without adding u 1 and u 2 to see whether behaviour discrimination was improved by including these two variables model definition model states correspond to the succession of fish behaviours at each time increment with two possible behaviours resting denoted by r which corresponds to slow or erratic movements and moving denoted by m which corresponds to fast oriented movements we assumed constant behaviour switching probabilities between successive time increments the observation model links the state at time t to corresponding movement variables i e speed between two locations and turning angles between two moves morales et al 2004 low mean speed and high turning angles variance are taken to characterise resting behaviour whereas high speed and mean turning angles around 0 are taken to characterise moving behaviour resting behaviour is expected to predominate in stationary trajectories moving behaviour in travelling trajectories the model is written as follows transition matrix 3 m q q r r 1 q r r 1 q m m q m m state equation 4 z t b m q z t 1 observation model 5 y v t g a z t λ z t y ϕ t wc b z t ρ z t with q r r and q m m being the probability of maintaining resting or moving behaviour following resting or moving behaviour and zt being the behaviour at time t r or m concerning the data y v t is the observed speed between t 1 and t and y ϕ t is the observed turning angle between t 2 and t 1 and t 1 and t concerning the parameters a zt and λ zt describe the speed for behaviour z at time t and b zt and ρ zt describes the turning angle for behaviour z at time t b g and wc represent the bernoulli distribution the gamma distribution and the wrapped cauchy distribution respectively given that u 1 and u 2 allow integration of information derived from the raw data independently of the interpolation two models were tested to determine whether taking into account of u 1 and u 2 improved the model s behaviour discrimination the first hereafter model1 included only variables from interpolated data observed speed and observed turning angles in the second hereafter model2 u 1 and u 2 were added to the variables the observation model becoming as follows 6 y v t g a z t λ z t y ϕ t wc b z t ρ z t u 1 t b e t a α z t β z t u 2 t n μ z t σ z t with α zt and β zt being the parameters describing u 1 for behaviour z at time t μ zt and σ zt being the parameters describing u 2 for behaviour z at time t b e t a and n represent for the beta distribution and the normal distribution respectively computation bayesian inference was used to fit the model to the data i e the trajectories obtained for each time step pk a single model was fitted for all selected trajectories at once prior distributions were defined summarising all available information on each parameter appendix b table b1 markov chain monte carlo mcmc computations were performed using jags software and the rjags r package plummer 2009 team 2018 a total of 10 000 iterations were performed as a burn in phase and inference was based on 20 000 additional iterations for each of the three independent chains with different initiations the gelman and rubin tests gelman and rubin 1992 were used to check the convergence of the estimation process the computation times for the different time steps pk were compared the estimated behaviour at each time step was recorded from the mcmc iterations for each location the credibility of resting and moving behaviours was calculated as the mean of the behaviours estimated for all the mcmc iterations we also calculated the mean duration of maintaining each behaviour i e the expected value of the geometric distribution with switching probability multiplied by the time step with the medians and 95 credibility intervals of the posterior distributions for both switching probabilities twelve fits of the models were performed for all 16 selected trajectories one with model 1 and one with model 2 for each of the 6 tested time steps we also performed 2 additional fits using all the individual trajectories one with model 1 and one with model 2 for the time step which appeared to be the most appropriate after checking the various criteria as convergence might not be reached for a simple model with two behaviours morales et al 2004 we also tested similar models without and with u 1 and u 2 including a third intermediate behaviour simulated data analysis a markov chain of 10 000 behaviours was simulated with fixed transition probabilities q r r 0 99 and q m m 0 97 using model 1 each point in the chain stands for a theoretical location of the individual and for each point a speed and a relative angle was derived from the distributions of speeds and relative angles of each behaviour with the following fixed parameter values for speed and turning angles distributions a 1 0 1 a 2 1 5 λ 1 10 5 λ 2 5 b 1 3 15 b 2 0 ρ 1 0 3 and ρ 2 0 9 then for each chain point a theoretical location was calculated thus we obtained a series of 10 000 locations associated with a behaviour the theoretical time step of this trajectory was 3 s the pre processing described in the section 2 2 was applied for the 6 tested time steps the simulated trajectory was interpolated speeds and turning angles were calculated as well as the two additional variables u 1 and u 2 then we estimated the parameters of model 1 with speeds and turning angles only and model 2 with speeds turning angles and the two additional variables u 1 and u 2 for each time step and for the raw trajectory computation time was recorded and when the model converged the goodness of fit between the simulated and inferred behaviours was computed for the 3 second trajectory raw simulated data inferred and simulated behaviours were compared directly for the interpolated trajectories first we computed the mean of the simulated behaviours between two locations within the time step then the root mean squared error for all the behaviours of the trajectory were calculated comparing for each location the mean simulated behaviour and the inferred one to compare results between time steps the root mean squared error was divided by the number of locations in the interpolated trajectory 3 results 3 1 influence of the time step between interpolated locations on behaviour inference 3 1 1 general correspondence of interpolated trajectories and raw data superimposition of raw data and interpolated trajectories is for convenience shown for 6 typical trajectories out of the 16 studied trajectories in fig 1 for bi type 1 and the two stationary trajectories the interpolated trajectories did not show any major differences in overall movement between time steps however the duration of the trajectories increased with the time step which was expected because of the increasing threshold separating two distinct trajectories whereas the number of locations decreased on the contrary for bi type 2 and the two travelling trajectories with the most changes in direction the interpolated trajectories did not show any major differences for time steps below 60 s but diverged from the raw data for the four longer time steps 120 180 240 and 300 s 3 1 2 additional variables the ratio between covered distance from interpolated and raw data namely u 1 showed a similar pattern for all types of trajectory and for all time steps fig 2 a as expected u 1 decreased with increasing time step due to shorter covered distance in interpolated data in the 5 time steps longer than 30 s the difference in u 1 between the three types of trajectories was greater than in the first time step 30 s likewise the variance of turning angles within the interpolation time step namely u 2 showed a pattern similar to u 1 fig 2b 3 1 3 modelling results parameter estimation the mcmc algorithm consistently converged according to gelman and rubin diagnostics for each simulation performed with the 16 selected trajectories for all parameters posterior distributions were narrower than prior distributions the narrowness of the posterior distributions suggests that sufficient information was available from the data to accurately estimate the model parameters overall there were progressive differences between parameter estimates with increasing time step fig 3 however the posterior distributions of the first two time steps 30 and 60 s differed strongly from those of the other four time steps all of which were quite similar the mean of speed distributions of resting behaviour ar decreased with increasing time step because of decreasing estimated travel distance in the interpolated trajectory mean turning angle distributions br and bm were constant for all time steps the modes of u 1 the ratio between the covered distance from the interpolated and raw data within the interpolation time step distributions αr and αm decreased with increasing time step because the longer the time step the lower the fit between interpolated trajectory and raw data mean u 2 for moving behaviour μm increased with increasing time step where the turning angles were more acute e g travelling trajectories in fig 1 mean u 2 for the resting behaviour μr was similar for all time steps concerning the transition probability of maintaining resting behaviour q r r posterior distributions were similar for the four longer time steps 120 to 300 s with a median value around 0 975 for the second tested time step 60 s the median of the posterior distribution was lower around 0 95 and much lower for the shortest time step of 30 s around 0 88 concerning the transition probability of maintaining moving behaviour q m m posterior distributions were similar for the two longest time steps of 240 and 300 s with a median value around 0 90 and for the 30 120 and 180 s time steps with a median value around 0 87 for the 60 s time step the median value of the posterior distribution was higher around 0 93 inferred behaviours behaviours were highly discriminated for all tested time steps although discrimination was a bit lower for the shortest time step of 30 s table 1 using model 2 inferred behaviours were similar for all time steps for the two travelling trajectories and the second stationary trajectory fig 4 stationary trajectory 1 showed a higher proportion of resting behaviour for the four longest time steps 120 to 300 s fig 4 for the two shortest time steps some movements were associated with moving behaviour or else were not discriminated fig 5 similarly the stationary phase at the end of the bi type 1 trajectory was more associated with moving behaviour or else not discriminated for the two shortest time steps fig 5 concerning the bi type 2 trajectory a higher proportion of resting behaviour was inferred for the four longest time steps fig 4 due to the increased number of locations in the stationary phase at the end of the trajectory fig 5 simulated data analysis for the three longest time steps 180 240 and 360 s the models model 1 and model 2 failed to converge and discriminate between behaviours for raw data 99 of the inferred behaviours matched the simulated ones rmse of 0 01 appendix d table d1 for the three shortest tested time steps 30 60 and 120 s rmse increased with time step for the two shortest time steps 30 and 60 s rmse was lower on model 2 than on model 1 part of the trajectory with true and inferred behaviours for the three shortest tested time steps 30 60 and 120 s is shown in appendix d figure d1 3 2 behaviour discrimination with the state space model 3 2 1 interest of the two additional variables for stationary trajectories s u 1 was lower than for travelling trajectories t and showed average values for bi type trajectories b fig 2a this was due to the higher rate of star shaped trajectories when the individual was stationary in star shaped trajectories distance covered was shorter on interpolated than raw data due to the triangulation artefact u 2 was lower for travelling than stationary trajectories and intermediate for bi type trajectories fig 2b the differences shown by u 1 and u 2 between the different types of trajectory provide information for discriminating resting versus moving behaviour related to stationary and travelling trajectory types respectively behaviours were slightly better discriminated i e were in most cases inferred as being either resting or moving with the addition of u 1 and u 2 table 1 finally we fitted the model on all the 731 available trajectories except for those comprising fewer than 5 locations at first neither of the two models model 1 and model 2 was able to converge we therefore added a third behaviour in the models this third behaviour was an intermediate between the resting and moving behaviours with mean turning angle close to that of the resting behaviour and mean speed between the mean speeds of the other two behaviours with the third behaviour model 2 converged whereas model 1 still failed to converge 3 2 2 fit between inferred behaviours and observed trajectories overall with model 2 inferred behaviours were consistent with observed trajectories moving behaviours were mostly inferred in travelling trajectories and resting behaviours in stationary trajectories fig 4 for the bi type 2 trajectory the travelling starting and stationary ending phases mostly corresponded to moving and resting behaviours respectively as expected some movements in stationary phases were however associated with moving behaviour or with resting behaviour with low certainty for the two shortest time steps increasing time step increased mean duration for each behaviour table 2 and also increased the difference in duration between the behaviours the longer the time step the longer the resting duration compared to the moving duration 4 discussion 4 1 influence of time step on behaviour discrimination and computation time a wide range of durations between two consecutive locations i e time steps are used in animal movement studies for example from 60 s eels bassett and montgomery 2011 to several minutes caribou 15 min andersen et al 2007 one hour sea lions breed et al 2012 or several hours turtles 6 h bailey et al 2008 wolves 12 h franke et al 2006 time steps should be adapted to the species its travel mode and the question being addressed for resident fish moving in small areas time steps shorter than several minutes are necessary to explore the different behaviours we observed progressive but not major differences between variables i e the movement variables mean speed and turning angles appendix a figure a2 a and b and the additional variables u 1 and u 2 used to evaluate the tested interpolation time steps as of the second tested time step 60 s behaviours were better discriminated however with time steps longer than 120 s interpolation generated trajectories that were very remote from the raw data considerably degrading location information this can cause problems for instance when the individual often switches behaviour or when spatial data such as environmental parameters are to be included in the analysis likewise the differences in mean duration per behaviour according to time step showed that switching phases may be overlooked if a long time step is used and consequently information on species ecology can be lost due to unreliable interpolation furthermore model fit to the data speed and turning angles data not shown was better for the two shortest time steps this is supported by the analysis of simulated data which gave satisfactory behaviour predictions for the two shortest time steps 30 and 60 s poorer prediction for 120 s and no discrimination between behaviours for the three longest time steps 180 240 and 360 s overall computation time appendix b table b2 was reasonable there were no large differences between the time steps from 60 to 240 s however computation time was almost twice as long for the shortest 30 s as for the longest 300 s time step for simulated data computation time was almost 12 fold longer for raw data 3 s than for the shortest time step 30 s and 2 5 fold longer for the 30 second than the 60 second time step appendix d table d2 such a difference can be critical when analysing all trajectories of all individuals together even though data generated by interpolation made the model inference feasible in terms of computation time for all tested time steps 4 2 model results and behaviour discrimination the results concerning the movement descriptors i e speed and turning angle distributions in resting behaviour should be regarded with caution most artefactual trajectories that are star shaped are stationary phases which mainly include resting behaviour nevertheless interpolation with all tested time steps reduced that artefact enabling discrimination between moving and resting behaviours the high estimated transition probabilities q r r and q m m above 0 80 imply that behaviours presented long duration and are clearly influenced by our choices of exemplary trajectories displaying contrasted movement phases in order to check whether behaviours were adequately discriminated according to the tested time steps the selected trajectories had to be composed of phases that clearly represent the two main behaviours as a consequence some other patterns of movement were firstly discarded when all trajectories were included even excluding those with fewer than 5 locations the simple model with two behaviours did not converge partly due to the presence of these other movement patterns in addition we assumed a constant transition matrix which is too simplistic since fish behaviour is influenced by environmental factors this might also prevent the model from converging further validation with all data is needed but a simple model tested on a set of sample trajectories is still useful to determine the pre processing to be performed on the data additional variables focusing on the 16 selected trajectories including the two variables u 1 and u 2 in the model improved discrimination of behaviours the simulated data analysis showed that including the additional variables reduced prediction error for the two shortest time steps 30 and 60 s thus it appears highly profitable to combine these kinds of variable calculated from raw data with a short time step to compensate the deficit in behaviour discrimination furthermore using all trajectories except for those with fewer than 5 locations confirmed the benefit of including the additional variables u 1 and u 2 for a given interpolation time step here 60 s other additional variables could have been considered such as specific indicators related to the known behaviours of the studied species 4 3 implications of the interpolation and trajectory cutting processes for behaviour discrimination tools from earlier studies of state space models e g johnson et al 2008 jonsen et al 2003 vermard et al 2010 attempted to deal with irregular time steps location errors or the reconstruction of entire trajectories such tools could have been appropriate to process the present data but the prime issue was computing time and increasing the time step solved this while also dealing with most of the numerous small gaps in location combined with the use of the two additional variables u 1 and u 2 the proposed processing reduced computing time dealt with irregularly time spaced locations and preserved the information provided by the initial 3 second time step of the raw data for the present study several smaller unconnected trajectories provided enough information and we did not seek to determine individual locations and behaviours when the signal had been lost for a long period of time several hours to achieve convergence with the 3 behaviour model the shortest trajectories fewers than 5 points were deleted from the dataset this necessity might be due to a bias in estimating transition probabilities for these very short trajectories an initial behaviour namely zinit see appendix c model code was mandatory to initiate the markov chain of behaviours across time zinit was derived from a categorical distribution with the 3 equal probabilities when short trajectories are numerous the estimated transition probability from the initial behaviour to the first behaviour of the trajectory has a major weight although it is only an artefact of the modelling procedure as short trajectories may bias the estimation of transition probabilities a more suitable dataset would favour long trajectories i e with the maximum number of points for this two possibilities emerged firstly long time steps could be used so that the raw dataset is less divided trajectories are longer in time and also likely made up of numerous points however trajectories shorter in time than twice the chosen time step were deleted due to interpolation because at least two movements are needed to calculate speed and turning angle these trajectories would be preserved with a smaller time step secondly a short time step could be preferred in which case trajectories are denser in points but the cutting process of the raw data to obtain trajectories excludes more points than with a long time step because the s threshold is lower the cutting process and the chosen s threshold are thus appear key points in data pre processing the present cutting method has two main disadvantages firstly the different time steps were difficult to compare as the number of locations differed between the tested time steps secondly with a small threshold trajectories are liable to be small which could lead to overlooking some switches in behaviour one solution could be to use a higher threshold chosen on the basis of the histogram of trajectory durations combined with a small time step but this solution would lead to interpolating data on time ranges for which no observed locations are available which is not desirable an auto correlogram of covered distances in the raw data could also give indications on where to cut the raw data to obtain trajectories missing locations could also be considered as missing data instead of interpolating them in the present case this was not possible because using a wrapped cauchy distribution for turning angles within jags required using observed turning angles as input rather than observed variable see annex c model code and bugs trick in morales et al 2004 supplementary information 4 4 outline the present study developed a generic method of data pre processing to handle trajectories at fine time scales and infer behaviours based on telemetry data which could be transposed to other datasets data pre processing is an essential step in trajectory analysis although rarely highlighted increasing time steps allowed efficient discrimination between behaviours with locations regularly spaced in time and a smaller amount of data to process at the same time the additional variables computed from the raw data compensated for the loss of information in interpolated trajectories resulting from the increased time step the time step should be adapted according to the ecology and habitat preference of the studied species the raw data cutting process should be explored to optimise trajectory length while preserving small time steps and correspondence between trajectories and raw data we demonstrated the possibility of discriminating behaviours for the whole dataset of a given individual using a state space model this opens up interesting perspectives individual variation in movement or behavioural parameters could be quantified using the trajectories of several individuals by hierarchical modelling jonsen 2016 using a 3 behaviour state space model including additional variables computed from the raw data the reduction in computation time is then particularly valuable when all trajectories of several individuals are included datasets for several individuals of various species have more sources of variability hierarchical modelling is then necessary to deal with individual and species variability environmental variability requires explicit modelling of the link between environmental variables such as hydraulic or thermal parameters and the transition matrix considering that i behavioural state and habitat selection are linked and ii movement and trajectory changes are behavioural state proxy movement analysis is a way of investigating dynamical selection of habitat short term below several minutes in a highly contrasted and variable below the hour environment therefore dynamically favourable habitats according to dynamic hydraulic conditions should be mapped providing quantitative information to evaluate the impact of events such as thermal discharge or dam functioning credit authorship contribution statement dominique lamonica conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing

24815,animal movement study often relies on individual tracking the data scale in time and space varies according to the species the environment where individuals live or the exogenous processes that drive movement to explore freshwater fish movement in rivers fine scale data are needed also in rivers recorded telemetry frequently shows missing data and location errors the irregular time steps huge amount of data environmental complexity river section and how fish move in such anisotropic environments undermine the use of statistical frameworks such as state space models to deal with these specificities data pre treatment can be required we propose a generic method of telemetry data pre processing which can be transposed to other datasets this framework includes interpolation to handle trajectories at fine time scales and performs data analysis within a state space model we combined analyses on observed and simulated data at various interpolation time steps to choose the one that best preserves the general movement while reducing the total amount of data required first we directly compared raw and interpolated data and the results of parameter inference of a simple state space model using the interpolated data the state space model infers behavioural state based on speed and turning angle between successive locations in animal trajectories we also included two additional variables computed from raw data a quantitative indicator of the correspondence between the interpolated trajectory and the raw data and the variance of turning angles of raw data within the interpolation time step we were finally able to determine the most appropriate time step to obtain locations that were regularly spaced in time and to reduce the amount of data while maintaining the precision of the raw data computational time was reduced 12 fold by using a 30 second time step to interpolate data simulated at 3 second intervals the inclusion of the two variables derived from raw data compensated for the loss of information in interpolated trajectories and allowed more efficient discrimination between behaviours keywords animal location data movement model state space model

2005 and adaptability to climate change and extreme events boucek et al 2017 the study of animal movement often relies on individual tracking recent technical progress has revolutionized such studies the development of high frequency tags enables high frequency data collection at fine spatial resolution cagnacci et al 2010 hussey et al 2015 lennox et al 2017 tracking data at high temporal resolution are invaluable for species that are rarely static although staying in the same area location per hour half day or day provides information on individual movement within an animal s living range e g within a region or along a migration route over a long period of time rather than small quick displacements within or between local habitats capra et al 2018 donaldson et al 2014 in contrast tracking several locations per minute allow displacements to be described at fine scale enabling precise investigations of suitable migratory conditions habitat selection or behaviour choices at individual level e g capra et al 2017 cooke et al 2004 tétard et al 2019 telemetry data at a very fine time scale of a few seconds are being increasingly collected worldwide cooke et al 2013 hussey et

thiebault et al 2018 vermard et al 2010 and investigating the influence of the environment on individual movements bestley et al 2013 drouineau et al 2017 patterson et al 2009 state space modelling is one of the useful existing statistical frameworks for animal movement analysis dorazio and price 2019 jonsen et al 2003 joo et al 2013 patterson et al 2008 most animal movement studies have focused on large terrestrial or marine species e g andersen et al 2007 bailey et al 2008 franke et al 2006 hedger et al 2008 mcclintock et al 2012 which move in a wide and open environment few have dealt with freshwater organisms telemetry data for anisotropic irregular environments such as large rivers show some specificities cooke et al 2013 firstly triangulation is made difficult by ground irregularities and the presence of vegetation causing frequent signal loss secondly the precision of triangulation varies in space bergé et al 2012 and thirdly the anisotropic closed conditions of hydrographic networks are specific limitations on animal movement quaglietta and porto 2019 sutherland et al 2015 and complicate the trajectory analysis fish navigation is known to be influenced by physical cues such as current fields and physical obstacles e g dams or river banks goodwin et al 2014 leading to highly orientated navigation which does not fulfil the isotropy assumption usually applied in open environments the second major issue is the temporal and spatial scales at which fish movement is characterised telemetry studies of freshwater fish generally focus on seasonal movement e g dorazio and price 2019 fraley et al 2016 koehn and nicol 2016 muhlfeld et al 2012 and modelling frameworks are rarely applied to analysing individual movements at fine scales however such fine scale data and corresponding analytical methods are critical to studying small scale foraging movements of fishes within their home range which dingle 1996 called station keeping movement in contrast to migration over large distances the combination of environmental limitations which entail irregularities in signal recording and fine spatial and temporal scale has three main consequences firstly irregular time steps have to be handled secondly analysing the huge amount of data generated requires great computer power which may lead to a trade off between reducing computing time and not degrading fine scale data quality and thirdly the consideration of entire individual trajectories from the beginning to the end of the recording period is not always necessary a certain number of trajectories spaced in time can also be used to explore individual behaviour to deal with irregular time steps an appropriately longer time step can be chosen coupled with interpolation if necessary to deal with any missing data increasing the time step generally reduces the rate of missing data while also reducing the amount of data to be analysed however it impairs overall precision compared to the raw dataset and may impact ecological interpretations based on these trajectories in this paper we propose a generic method of data processing to accurately infer individual behaviours from trajectories at fine temporal and spatial scales analysis was performed at different time steps and compared so as to select the most appropriate one i e the one that preserved the general movement while efficiently discriminating between behaviours here slow and fast movements to this end we directly compared the raw and interpolated data and compared the results of the parameters inference of a simple state space model with the interpolated data we did not deal with location error as our aim was to infer individual behaviour based on observed movement rather than reconstruct the exact individual trajectories moreover usual correction methods are based on an isotropy assumption i e that there is no favoured direction within the space and animal navigation consequently depends only on behaviour and not on environmental characteristics such as flow fields around physical obstacles which is not fulfilled here to illustrate this approach we used telemetry data for individual fish collected in the rhône river at 3 second intervals capra et al 2017 the initial objective of the study was to infer the relationships between fish behaviour and hydraulic conditions through analysis of fish movements in this context we used a state space model to discriminate fish behaviours for that raw fish location data hereafter referred to as raw data must be pre processed while maintaining the precision of the raw data gaps between locations must be dealt with so as to obtain regularly time spaced data 2 material and methods 2 1 case study bergé et al 2012 collected telemetry data on freshwater fish in the rhône river using the hti https www innovasea com fish tracking acoustic fixed telemetry system our system includes a set of pre positioned hydrophones used to detect ultrasounds emitted by acoustic tags frequency of 307 khz tags signals that allow the identification of the tag and precise positioning of the tag through a triangulation process provided that the signal is detected by at least 3 hydrophones hydrophones were all connected to a single controller and synchronized with utc time to improve the triangulation further details are provided in bergé et al 2012 locations of 94 individuals of various species were tracked for 3 months at a time interval of 3 s the dataset suffered from the usual defects affecting tracking data firstly individuals were not systematically located every 3 s during the 3 months of the experiment there were two types of gap in the data large gaps in which the individual signal was lost for several minutes to several days and small gaps where the individual signal was lost for a few 3 second periods i e 3 s to a few minutes a second defect was specific to the triangulation process of the hti system some successive locations form artefactual star shaped trajectories appendix a figure a1 though this type of star shaped pattern is specific to the triangulation process it is more generally one of the types of location error besetting most tracking studies the fine time scale data may also incur a specific problem when an individual is static or moving very slowly its successive locations can be tracked as being as distant as when it is moving faster due to triangulation error 2 2 proposed data pre processing three pre processing steps were performed on the raw data the first was the choice of a time step p the second dealt with the large gaps between certain successive locations for this we considered using a threshold s equal to twice the time step p in order to split the trajectory in two while avoiding interpolation in between points that were too far apart in time if the duration between two successive locations x y i and x y i 1 x and y denoting the spatial coordinates and i the index of the location is greater than s then these two locations are assumed to belong to two distinct independent trajectories the raw data for a given trajectory are denoted hereafter as the support of the trajectory the third step consisted in the linear interpolation of new locations within each trajectory according to the time step p to deal with missing data within each trajectory interpolations were carried out using the move r package kranstauber and smolla 2008 we tested 6 interpolation time steps with the associated s threshold 30 60 120 180 240 and 300 s denoted by pk k 1 6 in order to test the different means of pre processing the raw data 16 of the 731 trajectories of individual european catfish silurus glanis were selected european catfish were chosen because this species included well tracked individuals presenting numerous locations and thus longer trajectories than for other species the complete trajectories can comprise three general patterns i travelling t in which the individual moves over a long distance where start and end locations are distant from one another ii stationary s where locations are concentrated within a short perimeter potentially star shaped with start and end locations nearby and iii a mixed pattern b for bi type where a stationary move follows a long move or vice versa four trajectories of each for the stationary and travelling types and 8 trajectories for the mixed type were selected for the test dataset two examples of each trajectory type at each time step are shown in fig 1 2 3 validation criteria to compare the interpolated trajectories using the different time steps pk several criteria were considered 2 3 1 computed variables two variables were computed to quantify the consistency between the raw data and each interpolated trajectory they showed different patterns according to the type of trajectory and were computed to see how they varied according to time step the two additional variables denoted by u 1 and u 2 concerned speed and turning angles respectively for a trajectory j associated with time step pk let x y n j p k nj 0 nj with nj the total number of locations in the trajectory j be the nj th location in the trajectory considering the support of the trajectory j let i 0 i n j be an index for raw data locations denoted by x y i n j between time nj pk and n j 1 p k of the trajectory locations and θ i n j the angle between the locations x y i n j x y i 1 n j and x y i 2 n j for a time step pk and a total time nj pk of the trajectory j u 1 k n j and u 2 k n j are defined as follows 1 u 1 k n j d x y n j p k x y n j 1 p k i 0 i n j 1 d x y i n j x y i n j 1 where d x 1 x 2 represents the covered distance between locations x 1 and x 2 u 1 is thus the ratio between the covered distance according to the interpolated data and the covered distance according to the raw data within the interpolation time step u 1 represents a quantitative indicator of the correspondence between the interpolated trajectory and the raw data the higher u 1 the better the fit 2 u 2 k n j v a r θ i n j where i 0 in and var x denotes the variance of x u 2 is thus the variance of turning angles of raw data within the interpolation time step if the variance is small the trajectory is rectilinear within the interpolated time step and little information is lost however a large variance may indicate a star shaped pattern especially if associated with a low u 1 2 3 2 state space modelling we developed a state space model based on morales et al 2004 to discriminate between the different individual behaviours in the 16 selected trajectories model parameters were estimated independently for each time step so as to assess variations in parameter estimates according to the time step results for each time step where also compared with and without adding u 1 and u 2 to see whether behaviour discrimination was improved by including these two variables model definition model states correspond to the succession of fish behaviours at each time increment with two possible behaviours resting denoted by r which corresponds to slow or erratic movements and moving denoted by m which corresponds to fast oriented movements we assumed constant behaviour switching probabilities between successive time increments the observation model links the state at time t to corresponding movement variables i e speed between two locations and turning angles between two moves morales et al 2004 low mean speed and high turning angles variance are taken to characterise resting behaviour whereas high speed and mean turning angles around 0 are taken to characterise moving behaviour resting behaviour is expected to predominate in stationary trajectories moving behaviour in travelling trajectories the model is written as follows transition matrix 3 m q q r r 1 q r r 1 q m m q m m state equation 4 z t b m q z t 1 observation model 5 y v t g a z t λ z t y ϕ t wc b z t ρ z t with q r r and q m m being the probability of maintaining resting or moving behaviour following resting or moving behaviour and zt being the behaviour at time t r or m concerning the data y v t is the observed speed between t 1 and t and y ϕ t is the observed turning angle between t 2 and t 1 and t 1 and t concerning the parameters a zt and λ zt describe the speed for behaviour z at time t and b zt and ρ zt describes the turning angle for behaviour z at time t b g and wc represent the bernoulli distribution the gamma distribution and the wrapped cauchy distribution respectively given that u 1 and u 2 allow integration of information derived from the raw data independently of the interpolation two models were tested to determine whether taking into account of u 1 and u 2 improved the model s behaviour discrimination the first hereafter model1 included only variables from interpolated data observed speed and observed turning angles in the second hereafter model2 u 1 and u 2 were added to the variables the observation model becoming as follows 6 y v t g a z t λ z t y ϕ t wc b z t ρ z t u 1 t b e t a α z t β z t u 2 t n μ z t σ z t with α zt and β zt being the parameters describing u 1 for behaviour z at time t μ zt and σ zt being the parameters describing u 2 for behaviour z at time t b e t a and n represent for the beta distribution and the normal distribution respectively computation bayesian inference was used to fit the model to the data i e the trajectories obtained for each time step pk a single model was fitted for all selected trajectories at once prior distributions were defined summarising all available information on each parameter appendix b table b1 markov chain monte carlo mcmc computations were performed using jags software and the rjags r package plummer 2009 team 2018 a total of 10 000 iterations were performed as a burn in phase and inference was based on 20 000 additional iterations for each of the three independent chains with different initiations the gelman and rubin tests gelman and rubin 1992 were used to check the convergence of the estimation process the computation times for the different time steps pk were compared the estimated behaviour at each time step was recorded from the mcmc iterations for each location the credibility of resting and moving behaviours was calculated as the mean of the behaviours estimated for all the mcmc iterations we also calculated the mean duration of maintaining each behaviour i e the expected value of the geometric distribution with switching probability multiplied by the time step with the medians and 95 credibility intervals of the posterior distributions for both switching probabilities twelve fits of the models were performed for all 16 selected trajectories one with model 1 and one with model 2 for each of the 6 tested time steps we also performed 2 additional fits using all the individual trajectories one with model 1 and one with model 2 for the time step which appeared to be the most appropriate after checking the various criteria as convergence might not be reached for a simple model with two behaviours morales et al 2004 we also tested similar models without and with u 1 and u 2 including a third intermediate behaviour simulated data analysis a markov chain of 10 000 behaviours was simulated with fixed transition probabilities q r r 0 99 and q m m 0 97 using model 1 each point in the chain stands for a theoretical location of the individual and for each point a speed and a relative angle was derived from the distributions of speeds and relative angles of each behaviour with the following fixed parameter values for speed and turning angles distributions a 1 0 1 a 2 1 5 λ 1 10 5 λ 2 5 b 1 3 15 b 2 0 ρ 1 0 3 and ρ 2 0 9 then for each chain point a theoretical location was calculated thus we obtained a series of 10 000 locations associated with a behaviour the theoretical time step of this trajectory was 3 s the pre processing described in the section 2 2 was applied for the 6 tested time steps the simulated trajectory was interpolated speeds and turning angles were calculated as well as the two additional variables u 1 and u 2 then we estimated the parameters of model 1 with speeds and turning angles only and model 2 with speeds turning angles and the two additional variables u 1 and u 2 for each time step and for the raw trajectory computation time was recorded and when the model converged the goodness of fit between the simulated and inferred behaviours was computed for the 3 second trajectory raw simulated data inferred and simulated behaviours were compared directly for the interpolated trajectories first we computed the mean of the simulated behaviours between two locations within the time step then the root mean squared error for all the behaviours of the trajectory were calculated comparing for each location the mean simulated behaviour and the inferred one to compare results between time steps the root mean squared error was divided by the number of locations in the interpolated trajectory 3 results 3 1 influence of the time step between interpolated locations on behaviour inference 3 1 1 general correspondence of interpolated trajectories and raw data superimposition of raw data and interpolated trajectories is for convenience shown for 6 typical trajectories out of the 16 studied trajectories in fig 1 for bi type 1 and the two stationary trajectories the interpolated trajectories did not show any major differences in overall movement between time steps however the duration of the trajectories increased with the time step which was expected because of the increasing threshold separating two distinct trajectories whereas the number of locations decreased on the contrary for bi type 2 and the two travelling trajectories with the most changes in direction the interpolated trajectories did not show any major differences for time steps below 60 s but diverged from the raw data for the four longer time steps 120 180 240 and 300 s 3 1 2 additional variables the ratio between covered distance from interpolated and raw data namely u 1 showed a similar pattern for all types of trajectory and for all time steps fig 2 a as expected u 1 decreased with increasing time step due to shorter covered distance in interpolated data in the 5 time steps longer than 30 s the difference in u 1 between the three types of trajectories was greater than in the first time step 30 s likewise the variance of turning angles within the interpolation time step namely u 2 showed a pattern similar to u 1 fig 2b 3 1 3 modelling results parameter estimation the mcmc algorithm consistently converged according to gelman and rubin diagnostics for each simulation performed with the 16 selected trajectories for all parameters posterior distributions were narrower than prior distributions the narrowness of the posterior distributions suggests that sufficient information was available from the data to accurately estimate the model parameters overall there were progressive differences between parameter estimates with increasing time step fig 3 however the posterior distributions of the first two time steps 30 and 60 s differed strongly from those of the other four time steps all of which were quite similar the mean of speed distributions of resting behaviour ar decreased with increasing time step because of decreasing estimated travel distance in the interpolated trajectory mean turning angle distributions br and bm were constant for all time steps the modes of u 1 the ratio between the covered distance from the interpolated and raw data within the interpolation time step distributions αr and αm decreased with increasing time step because the longer the time step the lower the fit between interpolated trajectory and raw data mean u 2 for moving behaviour μm increased with increasing time step where the turning angles were more acute e g travelling trajectories in fig 1 mean u 2 for the resting behaviour μr was similar for all time steps concerning the transition probability of maintaining resting behaviour q r r posterior distributions were similar for the four longer time steps 120 to 300 s with a median value around 0 975 for the second tested time step 60 s the median of the posterior distribution was lower around 0 95 and much lower for the shortest time step of 30 s around 0 88 concerning the transition probability of maintaining moving behaviour q m m posterior distributions were similar for the two longest time steps of 240 and 300 s with a median value around 0 90 and for the 30 120 and 180 s time steps with a median value around 0 87 for the 60 s time step the median value of the posterior distribution was higher around 0 93 inferred behaviours behaviours were highly discriminated for all tested time steps although discrimination was a bit lower for the shortest time step of 30 s table 1 using model 2 inferred behaviours were similar for all time steps for the two travelling trajectories and the second stationary trajectory fig 4 stationary trajectory 1 showed a higher proportion of resting behaviour for the four longest time steps 120 to 300 s fig 4 for the two shortest time steps some movements were associated with moving behaviour or else were not discriminated fig 5 similarly the stationary phase at the end of the bi type 1 trajectory was more associated with moving behaviour or else not discriminated for the two shortest time steps fig 5 concerning the bi type 2 trajectory a higher proportion of resting behaviour was inferred for the four longest time steps fig 4 due to the increased number of locations in the stationary phase at the end of the trajectory fig 5 simulated data analysis for the three longest time steps 180 240 and 360 s the models model 1 and model 2 failed to converge and discriminate between behaviours for raw data 99 of the inferred behaviours matched the simulated ones rmse of 0 01 appendix d table d1 for the three shortest tested time steps 30 60 and 120 s rmse increased with time step for the two shortest time steps 30 and 60 s rmse was lower on model 2 than on model 1 part of the trajectory with true and inferred behaviours for the three shortest tested time steps 30 60 and 120 s is shown in appendix d figure d1 3 2 behaviour discrimination with the state space model 3 2 1 interest of the two additional variables for stationary trajectories s u 1 was lower than for travelling trajectories t and showed average values for bi type trajectories b fig 2a this was due to the higher rate of star shaped trajectories when the individual was stationary in star shaped trajectories distance covered was shorter on interpolated than raw data due to the triangulation artefact u 2 was lower for travelling than stationary trajectories and intermediate for bi type trajectories fig 2b the differences shown by u 1 and u 2 between the different types of trajectory provide information for discriminating resting versus moving behaviour related to stationary and travelling trajectory types respectively behaviours were slightly better discriminated i e were in most cases inferred as being either resting or moving with the addition of u 1 and u 2 table 1 finally we fitted the model on all the 731 available trajectories except for those comprising fewer than 5 locations at first neither of the two models model 1 and model 2 was able to converge we therefore added a third behaviour in the models this third behaviour was an intermediate between the resting and moving behaviours with mean turning angle close to that of the resting behaviour and mean speed between the mean speeds of the other two behaviours with the third behaviour model 2 converged whereas model 1 still failed to converge 3 2 2 fit between inferred behaviours and observed trajectories overall with model 2 inferred behaviours were consistent with observed trajectories moving behaviours were mostly inferred in travelling trajectories and resting behaviours in stationary trajectories fig 4 for the bi type 2 trajectory the travelling starting and stationary ending phases mostly corresponded to moving and resting behaviours respectively as expected some movements in stationary phases were however associated with moving behaviour or with resting behaviour with low certainty for the two shortest time steps increasing time step increased mean duration for each behaviour table 2 and also increased the difference in duration between the behaviours the longer the time step the longer the resting duration compared to the moving duration 4 discussion 4 1 influence of time step on behaviour discrimination and computation time a wide range of durations between two consecutive locations i e time steps are used in animal movement studies for example from 60 s eels bassett and montgomery 2011 to several minutes caribou 15 min andersen et al 2007 one hour sea lions breed et al 2012 or several hours turtles 6 h bailey et al 2008 wolves 12 h franke et al 2006 time steps should be adapted to the species its travel mode and the question being addressed for resident fish moving in small areas time steps shorter than several minutes are necessary to explore the different behaviours we observed progressive but not major differences between variables i e the movement variables mean speed and turning angles appendix a figure a2 a and b and the additional variables u 1 and u 2 used to evaluate the tested interpolation time steps as of the second tested time step 60 s behaviours were better discriminated however with time steps longer than 120 s interpolation generated trajectories that were very remote from the raw data considerably degrading location information this can cause problems for instance when the individual often switches behaviour or when spatial data such as environmental parameters are to be included in the analysis likewise the differences in mean duration per behaviour according to time step showed that switching phases may be overlooked if a long time step is used and consequently information on species ecology can be lost due to unreliable interpolation furthermore model fit to the data speed and turning angles data not shown was better for the two shortest time steps this is supported by the analysis of simulated data which gave satisfactory behaviour predictions for the two shortest time steps 30 and 60 s poorer prediction for 120 s and no discrimination between behaviours for the three longest time steps 180 240 and 360 s overall computation time appendix b table b2 was reasonable there were no large differences between the time steps from 60 to 240 s however computation time was almost twice as long for the shortest 30 s as for the longest 300 s time step for simulated data computation time was almost 12 fold longer for raw data 3 s than for the shortest time step 30 s and 2 5 fold longer for the 30 second than the 60 second time step appendix d table d2 such a difference can be critical when analysing all trajectories of all individuals together even though data generated by interpolation made the model inference feasible in terms of computation time for all tested time steps 4 2 model results and behaviour discrimination the results concerning the movement descriptors i e speed and turning angle distributions in resting behaviour should be regarded with caution most artefactual trajectories that are star shaped are stationary phases which mainly include resting behaviour nevertheless interpolation with all tested time steps reduced that artefact enabling discrimination between moving and resting behaviours the high estimated transition probabilities q r r and q m m above 0 80 imply that behaviours presented long duration and are clearly influenced by our choices of exemplary trajectories displaying contrasted movement phases in order to check whether behaviours were adequately discriminated according to the tested time steps the selected trajectories had to be composed of phases that clearly represent the two main behaviours as a consequence some other patterns of movement were firstly discarded when all trajectories were included even excluding those with fewer than 5 locations the simple model with two behaviours did not converge partly due to the presence of these other movement patterns in addition we assumed a constant transition matrix which is too simplistic since fish behaviour is influenced by environmental factors this might also prevent the model from converging further validation with all data is needed but a simple model tested on a set of sample trajectories is still useful to determine the pre processing to be performed on the data additional variables focusing on the 16 selected trajectories including the two variables u 1 and u 2 in the model improved discrimination of behaviours the simulated data analysis showed that including the additional variables reduced prediction error for the two shortest time steps 30 and 60 s thus it appears highly profitable to combine these kinds of variable calculated from raw data with a short time step to compensate the deficit in behaviour discrimination furthermore using all trajectories except for those with fewer than 5 locations confirmed the benefit of including the additional variables u 1 and u 2 for a given interpolation time step here 60 s other additional variables could have been considered such as specific indicators related to the known behaviours of the studied species 4 3 implications of the interpolation and trajectory cutting processes for behaviour discrimination tools from earlier studies of state space models e g johnson et al 2008 jonsen et al 2003 vermard et al 2010 attempted to deal with irregular time steps location errors or the reconstruction of entire trajectories such tools could have been appropriate to process the present data but the prime issue was computing time and increasing the time step solved this while also dealing with most of the numerous small gaps in location combined with the use of the two additional variables u 1 and u 2 the proposed processing reduced computing time dealt with irregularly time spaced locations and preserved the information provided by the initial 3 second time step of the raw data for the present study several smaller unconnected trajectories provided enough information and we did not seek to determine individual locations and behaviours when the signal had been lost for a long period of time several hours to achieve convergence with the 3 behaviour model the shortest trajectories fewers than 5 points were deleted from the dataset this necessity might be due to a bias in estimating transition probabilities for these very short trajectories an initial behaviour namely zinit see appendix c model code was mandatory to initiate the markov chain of behaviours across time zinit was derived from a categorical distribution with the 3 equal probabilities when short trajectories are numerous the estimated transition probability from the initial behaviour to the first behaviour of the trajectory has a major weight although it is only an artefact of the modelling procedure as short trajectories may bias the estimation of transition probabilities a more suitable dataset would favour long trajectories i e with the maximum number of points for this two possibilities emerged firstly long time steps could be used so that the raw dataset is less divided trajectories are longer in time and also likely made up of numerous points however trajectories shorter in time than twice the chosen time step were deleted due to interpolation because at least two movements are needed to calculate speed and turning angle these trajectories would be preserved with a smaller time step secondly a short time step could be preferred in which case trajectories are denser in points but the cutting process of the raw data to obtain trajectories excludes more points than with a long time step because the s threshold is lower the cutting process and the chosen s threshold are thus appear key points in data pre processing the present cutting method has two main disadvantages firstly the different time steps were difficult to compare as the number of locations differed between the tested time steps secondly with a small threshold trajectories are liable to be small which could lead to overlooking some switches in behaviour one solution could be to use a higher threshold chosen on the basis of the histogram of trajectory durations combined with a small time step but this solution would lead to interpolating data on time ranges for which no observed locations are available which is not desirable an auto correlogram of covered distances in the raw data could also give indications on where to cut the raw data to obtain trajectories missing locations could also be considered as missing data instead of interpolating them in the present case this was not possible because using a wrapped cauchy distribution for turning angles within jags required using observed turning angles as input rather than observed variable see annex c model code and bugs trick in morales et al 2004 supplementary information 4 4 outline the present study developed a generic method of data pre processing to handle trajectories at fine time scales and infer behaviours based on telemetry data which could be transposed to other datasets data pre processing is an essential step in trajectory analysis although rarely highlighted increasing time steps allowed efficient discrimination between behaviours with locations regularly spaced in time and a smaller amount of data to process at the same time the additional variables computed from the raw data compensated for the loss of information in interpolated trajectories resulting from the increased time step the time step should be adapted according to the ecology and habitat preference of the studied species the raw data cutting process should be explored to optimise trajectory length while preserving small time steps and correspondence between trajectories and raw data we demonstrated the possibility of discriminating behaviours for the whole dataset of a given individual using a state space model this opens up interesting perspectives individual variation in movement or behavioural parameters could be quantified using the trajectories of several individuals by hierarchical modelling jonsen 2016 using a 3 behaviour state space model including additional variables computed from the raw data the reduction in computation time is then particularly valuable when all trajectories of several individuals are included datasets for several individuals of various species have more sources of variability hierarchical modelling is then necessary to deal with individual and species variability environmental variability requires explicit modelling of the link between environmental variables such as hydraulic or thermal parameters and the transition matrix considering that i behavioural state and habitat selection are linked and ii movement and trajectory changes are behavioural state proxy movement analysis is a way of investigating dynamical selection of habitat short term below several minutes in a highly contrasted and variable below the hour environment therefore dynamically favourable habitats according to dynamic hydraulic conditions should be mapped providing quantitative information to evaluate the impact of events such as thermal discharge or dam functioning credit authorship contribution statement dominique lamonica conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing

introduction as a society we demand forest management practices to promote a sustainable provision of services management should rely on both models and indices that provide quantitative information about ecological social and economic conditions of forest systems understanding the relationships between environmental factors and tree growth had been a significant endeavour of forest scientists a key feature of forest ecosystems is the potential of sites to produce a given amount of plant biomass this property is known as forest site productivity bontemps and bouriaud 2013 skovsgaard and

based on height age therefore its use is limited for natural forests or mixed species stands where there are not a single meaningful age although dominant height growth is a good proxy of site productivity and is accurate enough for management purposes i stress that the tsi concept could be refined likewise the use of height growth rate at a reference height as a site index henceforth termed grsi seems to be suitable on quantitative grounds providing more insights to our ecological understanding of forest dynamics i focus here on a quantitative approach for deriving a growth rate index and only cover the essential mathematical aspects some other related details are cover in the pioneer studies of forest modelling by leary and skog 1972 garcía 1983 and the most recent ones by pommerening and muszta 2015 2016 i examine and show the theoretical model based foundations for the use of grsi as an alternative to tsi in the present article i aim at showing the use of height growth rate at a given height as a potential site index from a mathematical perspective first i provide the mathematical grounds on which is based and derived the grsi meanwhile the second part applies the concept of grsi to real data from the andean nothofagus temperate forests in southern chile by fitting a non linear mixed effects height growth model to three species 2 methods 2 1 mathematical basis i illustrate the concept starting from a simple individual growth model known as the monomolecular model 1 d y d t β α y where α is the upper asymptote or maximum level of the state variable y and β is a parameter that governs the rate of change schabenberger and pierce 2002 the state variable y can be any measure of individual sizes such as mass length volume or height among others however a more flexible form of the monomolecular model is achieved by a power transformation garcía 1983 so having 2 d y γ d t β α γ y γ with γ acting as a shape parameter in addition solving d y γ d t d y γ d y d y d t and after some algebraic manipulation eq 2 renders 3 d y d t β α γ γ y 1 γ β γ y eq 3 is equivalent to the well known von bertalanffy s growth rate model von bertalanffy 1957 garcía 1983 4 d y d t η y m κ y v b with β α γ γ η 1 γ m and β γ κ i use eq 2 as a baseline individual growth rate model it is worth noting that although other models and parametrizations can be used bontemps and duplat 2012 garcía 2008 grosenbaugh 1965 this model form had shown good behaviour in several tree growth studies birch 1999 salas et al 2008 zeide 1993 in the sequel i shall use eq 2 as a baseline or skeleton growth rate model i aim to develop a new type of site index therefore i use this baseline model as such but the procedure can be expanded to other growth rate models indeed furthermore i am not pursuing here to find the best prediction model but only in using a growth rate model that behaves reasonably well by solving eq 2 under some assumptions see appendix a i obtain 5 y t α 1 1 y 0 α γ exp β t t 0 1 γ which if t 0 h 0 0 can be reduced to see appendix b 6 y t α 1 e β t 1 γ hereafter i change the general state variable y for a specific one height h of dominant i e belonging to the main canopy trees the rationale for this choice is based upon the fact that the height growth of dominant trees is relatively unaffected by forest density as pointed out by walters et al 1989 it provides a practical and efficient means to index site quality on occupied sites even in stands that have undergone prescribed thinnings or changes in density i e disturbances therefore differences in dominant height at a reference age can be attributed to differences in site productivity daniel et al 1979 skovsgaard and vanclay 2008 in this context eq 6 becomes a useful solution of eq 2 because it is especially suitable for modelling height growth of even aged forest populations e g forestry plantations because stand age t is easily measured garcía 1983 meanwhile eq 5 is suitable for native forest populations where we can use the period of length t t 0 and the state variables at both the beginning and the end are needed salas et al 2008 given that the traditional site index is the dominant height at a reference age skovsgaard and vanclay 2008 by substituting this reference age tr in the model 6 the represented height corresponds to the site index s from here i can re arrange the equation in such a way that i obtain a new height growth function that depends on not only the parameters and time but also on the reference age and site index mathematically the curve equations for different sites differ only in the value of one scalar parameter garcía 1983 for example if in 6 the parameter β change with site index i can reparametrize it and obtain 7 h t α 1 exp ln 1 s α γ t t r 1 γ eq 7 depicts height growth depending on the parameters the reference time and the site index we obtain a height growth curve for each s in eq 7 and the series of curves are called a family of site index curves clutter et al 1983 2 2 deriving a growth rate based site productivity index i start by taking the derivative of the growth function 6 for height which gives 8 d h d t α β γ 1 e β t 1 γ 1 e β t this differential equation de is a function of time t however i would prefer to have it as a function of the state variable h the resulting model can be applied wherever that is no information about stand age or when information on stand age is not meaningful such happens in uneven aged stands raising both sides of 6 by γ and with little algebra see detailed steps of this derivation in appendix b i obtain 9 d h d t β γ h α h γ 1 a de as a function of h and free of t therefore being an autonomous differential equation boyce and diprima 2003 based on this i propose a new type of site index based on the use of height growth rate at a reference height instead of tree height growth at a reference age as in tsi to build a system of site index curves as i showed with eq 7 i start from 9 and define a new site index s as the time derivative of h evaluated at a reference height hr 10 s β γ h r α h r γ 1 then solving 10 for β and replacing it into 9 yields an expression of the growth rates as a function of height and site index as follows 11 d h d t s h r h α h γ 1 α h r γ 1 1 the height growth rate model eq 11 not only depends on the height h and the parameters but also the site index s and the reference height hr in the following i illustrate the use of this new site index concept by fitting a height growth model to real data 2 3 application example 2 3 1 data i used stem analysis data of sample trees of the native species nothofagus dombeyi coigüe n alpina raulí and n obliqua roble selected from sample plots established in secondary forest of roble raulí coigue in south central chile between the 36 and 41 30 south latitude the number of plots by species is 30 53 and 62 for coigue raulí and roble respectively and having between three and four sample trees per plot these stands are mature forests mixed species and naturally regenerated after some disturbances further ecological aspects of these forests can be found in veblen et al 1981 1980 data were collected in different research projects but compiled and summarized by salas 2011 in studies involving one or two species of the roble raulí coigue forest type donoso 1995 dominant trees were selected for stem analysis provided they were healthy and of good form of seed origin and belonging to the upper canopy after measuring diameter at breast height d and total height h the selected trees were felled and cross sectional discs were obtained at stump height 10 40 cm breast height 1 3 m plus other discs evenly spaced between breast height and total height rings were counted in the laboratory heights and ring counts from cross section discs were used to reconstruct height growth as in salas and garcía 2006 2 3 2 statistical model for my purposes i re write 5 as follows 12 h α 1 1 h 0 α γ e β t t 0 1 γ where h represents tree height at time t as pointed out by salas et al 2008 this height increment model 12 has the following properties it does not depend on age it can be used with data having different period lengths and can predict height increment for different period lengths to account for temporal correlation and the hierarchical structure of the data i fit eq 12 in a non linear mixed effects framework by adding random effects to the β parameter as follows 13 h i j k α 1 1 h i j k 1 α γ exp β b i b i j t i j k t i j k 1 1 γ ϵ i j k b i n 0 σ 1 2 b i j n 0 σ 2 2 ϵ i j k n 0 var ϵ i j k var ϵ i j k ϵ i j k σ 2 δ g i j k 2 where hijk is the height for the ith tree within the jth plot at the kth temporal measurement and h i j k 1 is the height of the same tree at time k 1 or simply at the beginning of the period δ t t i j k t i j k 1 the stochastic element ϵ i j k of eq 13 is added to represent that growth is not deterministic except on its expected value i fitted the non linear mixed effects models eq 13 by maximum likelihood followed by the best linear unbiased predictors of the random effects robinson 1991 i used variance functions to model the variance structure of the within stratum g errors where the coefficient δ changes for each g stratum pinheiro and bates 2000 since the data come from different studies i used this information as the stratum for the residual variance modelling as recommended by salas et al 2008 therefore the model was fitted allowing a different variance for the error term notice that i prefer to use this model instead of other variants e g adding random effects to α because it has been shown a better performance in previous studies stage 1963 garcía 2005 salas and garcía 2006 3 results the collected data span trees from young ages to adultness having between 19 and 103 years as well as from small trees to taller ones between 7 to 37 m table 1 furthermore the observed height growth series grey lines in fig 2a c depict a large growing conditions variability by showing different growth rates and asymptotes among species upon the above the sample offered an array of height growth patterns of dominant trees suitable to represent different forest productivities both the estimated parameters of the model 13 and their respective variance estimates shown biologically consistent values e g for the asymptote table 2 the variance in height growth between trees of the same plots σ 2 is low because they having growing under similar conditions i plot the resulting behaviour of the model 11 by using the parameter estimates of their respective mixed effect model per species the parameter estimates of their respective mixed effect model per species table 2 a reference height of 10 m and by setting four site index values 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 m yr i show this for the n dombeyi model in fig 1 only the other species behave similarly with a focus on building a simple continuous time dynamical system where the de of height is a function of both the estimated parameters and the site index i assumed an initial height of 1 3 m and an initial time of 0 5 yr salas 2011 using height growth rates versus the state variable i e height rather than versus time i e breast height age allows us to differentiate among sites easily fig 1 the site index curves derived from the proposed model eq 13 and parameters in table 2 demonstrated being able to capture the observed height growth series fig 2 a c for n dombeyi n alpina and n obliqua respectively i computed the time of maximum annual growth rate t based on the proposed models as a biological application of the current approach because this time should depend on the autoecological features of the species as expected t is smaller for trees on good sites than those on poor sites table 3 the better the sites the shorter the period elapsed to reach the maximum growth rate i argue that the value of t could also be used as an indicator of the shade tolerance level of the species in the sense that the more shade intolerant a species is the smaller t would be for instance n dombeyi is the most shade intolerant species among the nothofagus being studied here donoso et al 2006 with lower t for all site indices than the other species in the same context n alpina is more shade tolerant than n obliqua donoso 1995 therefore having a higher t 4 discussion i presented the development of a forest site index based on the dominant trees height growth rate at a reference height termed grsi this index is an alternative to the traditional site index tsi based on tree height at a reference age i explored the behaviour of the grsi by using an autonomous de as a baseline model which is a growth rate equation only depending on the state variable h and not on time being the site index model built in this way has the potential for being applied to forests where there is not a single meaningful age such as uneven aged forests and not only for even aged stands a drawback of the tsi the non use of age in a growth model has been advocated earlier by spurr 1952 who stated that the ideal method of predicting forest growth should not have age as the primary variable other authors encouraged related ideas monserud 1984 1987 1988 stage 1959 1963 because of the proposed approach does not require age to be measured i e free of time could be suitable for natural stands with all types of structure there is a biological basis for thinking that growth is not determined by age for instance bond et al 2007 studied height growth development from a physiological perspective and demonstrated that size not age drives developmental changes in height growth in the conifer pseudotsuga menziesii the proposed height growth model eq 13 is both height reference hr and site index s invariant neither parameter estimates depend on hr nor on s to use hr different from 10 m as used here a user will only need to replace hr and s of choice in 11 and to depict height growth curves according to these values although other approaches can be used to derived site index curves e g lappi and bailey 1988 the proposed site index remains as a useful and alternative tool further details need attention to use the proposed site index in practice i presented here a height growth model based on dominant trees which is assumed to represent well the dominant height growth of a forest garcía 2005 however in practice careful assessment of dominant trees must be taken into account before being used for site productivity estimation raulier et al 2003 salas and garcía 2006 besides it is not an easy task to measure height increment with sufficient accuracy sterba 1982 in the sense that we must measure the height at two times although for some coniferous species that form whorls at each growing season their height increments could be easily obtained oliver and larson 1996 stage 1963 regardless i suggest measuring the periodic annual increment in height paih as an approximation to the growth rate for a random sample of suitable trees within sample plots besides special care has to be taken for using the grs for shade tolerant species which usually experiment erratic height growth patterns on this regard we could choose a representative species and sampling them carefully nyland 1996 the reference height is other detail as pointed out above this height is user defined therefore it is arbitrary not only hr should be too low to bypass the establishment period of juvenile trees husch 1956 but also too high to avoid measuring sample trees regardless the use of 10 m for the studied species it is a compromise between a size after which i expect dominant trees were overcoming the first intense competition period after establishment and an achievable height to be easily measured further details could arise indeed for instance how the grsi could be applied in mixed species stands i suggest sampling the same trees used to estimate the dominant height i e the average height of the 100 largest trees in 1 ha van laar and akça 2007 later the estimation of a stand level grsi has to consider the sample plot sizes like the one proposed by garcía 1998 future research is required to oversee other practical issues time of maximum height growth rate could be used as a quantitative proxy for the shade tolerance level of species n dombeyi is the most shade intolerant species among the nothofagus being studied here donoso et al 2006 which is in agreement with the t values derived from the proposed models according to the photosynthesis measured features in a controlled experiment by read and hill 1985 n alpina is the most shade tolerant species among the ones here indeed the results support this when comparing n dombeyi versus n obliqua furthermore these findings could also support that n dombeyi is a more pioneer species than n obliqua as reported by bögelein et al 2018 similar trends had been observed by puente et al 1979 and veblen et al 1980 when analyzing tree population structure of n alpina n obliqua and tree seedlings of n alpina and n dombeyi respectively moreover the results point out that the maximum height growth rate occurs five and two years earlier for n dombeyi than n alpina in the poorest and best site indices respectively this sort of information is important for silvicultural research soto et al 2017 soto and puettmann 2018 and restoration efforts bannister et al 2018 5 concluding remarks a new type of forest site index is introduced height growth rate at a reference height grsi with a stronger emphasis in the mathematical details than into the practical ones the concept is exemplified by fitting a growth rate model to data of dominant trees and by depicting the corresponding site index curves i presume that many researchers will decide to model site index in the traditional way tsi or use different quantitative approaches for nonstatistical nonmathematical reasons at least until the theoretical and practical consequences of these courses of action become better determined for those who seek to use a different approach i suggest the grsi as a suitable alternative to model site productivity the proposed approach goes beyond the current traditional site index concept providing a growth rate basis for comparing site productivity indeed assessing forest site productivity is a complicated matter and a single index cannot summarize all but i aimed at providing a novel quantitative oriented approach credit author

to say i can generate an infinite family of solutions from a de boyce and diprima 2003 furthermore from different des i can arrive at the same solution or integrated form depending on their parameter values both situations were not specified clearly by some of the studies working with des in ecological applications mcdill and amateis 1993 tomé et al 2006 if i allow ψ 1 the general solution a 16

growth rate at a given height as a potential site index from a mathematical perspective first i provide the mathematical grounds on which is based and derived the grsi meanwhile the second part applies the concept of grsi to real data from the andean nothofagus temperate forests in southern chile by fitting a non linear mixed effects height growth model to three species 2 methods 2 1 mathematical basis i illustrate the concept starting from a simple individual growth model known as the monomolecular model 1 d y d t β α y where α is the upper asymptote or maximum level of the state variable y and β is a parameter that governs the rate of change schabenberger and pierce 2002 the state variable y can be any measure of individual sizes such as mass length volume or height among others however a more flexible form of the monomolecular model is achieved by a power transformation garcía 1983 so having 2 d y γ d t β α γ y γ with γ acting as a shape parameter in addition solving d y γ d t d y γ d y d y d t and after some algebraic manipulation eq 2 renders 3 d y d t β α γ γ y 1 γ β γ y eq 3 is equivalent to the well known von bertalanffy s growth rate model von bertalanffy 1957 garcía 1983 4 d y d t η y m κ y v b with β α γ γ η 1 γ m and β γ κ i use eq 2 as a baseline individual growth rate model it is worth noting that although other models and parametrizations can be used bontemps and duplat 2012 garcía 2008 grosenbaugh 1965 this model form had shown good behaviour in several tree growth studies birch 1999 salas et al 2008 zeide 1993 in the sequel i shall use eq 2 as a baseline or skeleton growth rate model i aim to develop a new type of site index therefore i use this baseline model as such but the procedure can be expanded to other growth rate models indeed furthermore i am not pursuing here to find the best prediction model but only in using a growth rate model that behaves reasonably well by solving eq 2 under some assumptions see appendix a i obtain 5 y t α 1 1 y 0 α γ exp β t t 0 1 γ which if t 0 h 0 0 can be reduced to see appendix b 6 y t α 1 e β t 1 γ hereafter i change the general state variable y for a specific one height h of dominant i e belonging to the main canopy trees the rationale for this choice is based upon the fact that the height growth of dominant trees is relatively unaffected by forest density as pointed out by walters et al 1989 it provides a practical and efficient means to index site quality on occupied sites even in stands that have undergone prescribed thinnings or changes in density i e disturbances therefore differences in dominant height at a reference age can be attributed to differences in site productivity daniel et al 1979 skovsgaard and vanclay 2008 in this context eq 6 becomes a useful solution of eq 2 because it is especially suitable for modelling height growth of even aged forest populations e g forestry plantations because stand age t is easily measured garcía 1983 meanwhile eq 5 is suitable for native forest populations where we can use the period of length t t 0 and the state variables at both the beginning and the end are needed salas et al 2008 given that the traditional site index is the dominant height at a reference age skovsgaard and vanclay 2008 by substituting this reference age tr in the model 6 the represented height corresponds to the site index s from here i can re arrange the equation in such a way that i obtain a new height growth function that depends on not only the parameters and time but also on the reference age and site index mathematically the curve equations for different sites differ only in the value of one scalar parameter garcía 1983 for example if in 6 the parameter β change with site index i can reparametrize it and obtain 7 h t α 1 exp ln 1 s α γ t t r 1 γ eq 7 depicts height growth depending on the parameters the reference time and the site index we obtain a height growth curve for each s in eq 7 and the series of curves are called a family of site index curves clutter et al 1983 2 2 deriving a growth rate based site productivity index i start by taking the derivative of the growth function 6 for height which gives 8 d h d t α β γ 1 e β t 1 γ 1 e β t this differential equation de is a function of time t however i would prefer to have it as a function of the state variable h the resulting model can be applied wherever that is no information about stand age or when information on stand age is not meaningful such happens in uneven aged stands raising both sides of 6 by γ and with little algebra see detailed steps of this derivation in appendix b i obtain 9 d h d t β γ h α h γ 1 a de as a function of h and free of t therefore being an autonomous differential equation boyce and diprima 2003 based on this i propose a new type of site index based on the use of height growth rate at a reference height instead of tree height growth at a reference age as in tsi to build a system of site index curves as i showed with eq 7 i start from 9 and define a new site index s as the time derivative of h evaluated at a reference height hr 10 s β γ h r α h r γ 1 then solving 10 for β and replacing it into 9 yields an expression of the growth rates as a function of height and site index as follows 11 d h d t s h r h α h γ 1 α h r γ 1 1 the height growth rate model eq 11 not only depends on the height h and the parameters but also the site index s and the reference height hr in the following i illustrate the use of this new site index concept by fitting a height growth model to real data 2 3 application example 2 3 1 data i used stem analysis data of sample trees of the native species nothofagus dombeyi coigüe n alpina raulí and n obliqua roble selected from sample plots established in secondary forest of roble raulí coigue in south central chile between the 36 and 41 30 south latitude the number of plots by species is 30 53 and 62 for coigue raulí and roble respectively and having between three and four sample trees per plot these stands are mature forests mixed species and naturally regenerated after some disturbances further ecological aspects of these forests can be found in veblen et al 1981 1980 data were collected in different research projects but compiled and summarized by salas 2011 in studies involving one or two species of the roble raulí coigue forest type donoso 1995 dominant trees were selected for stem analysis provided they were healthy and of good form of seed origin and belonging to the upper canopy after measuring diameter at breast height d and total height h the selected trees were felled and cross sectional discs were obtained at stump height 10 40 cm breast height 1 3 m plus other discs evenly spaced between breast height and total height rings were counted in the laboratory heights and ring counts from cross section discs were used to reconstruct height growth as in salas and garcía 2006 2 3 2 statistical model for my purposes i re write 5 as follows 12 h α 1 1 h 0 α γ e β t t 0 1 γ where h represents tree height at time t as pointed out by salas et al 2008 this height increment model 12 has the following properties it does not depend on age it can be used with data having different period lengths and can predict height increment for different period lengths to account for temporal correlation and the hierarchical structure of the data i fit eq 12 in a non linear mixed effects framework by adding random effects to the β parameter as follows 13 h i j k α 1 1 h i j k 1 α γ exp β b i b i j t i j k t i j k 1 1 γ ϵ i j k b i n 0 σ 1 2 b i j n 0 σ 2 2 ϵ i j k n 0 var ϵ i j k var ϵ i j k ϵ i j k σ 2 δ g i j k 2 where hijk is the height for the ith tree within the jth plot at the kth temporal measurement and h i j k 1 is the height of the same tree at time k 1 or simply at the beginning of the period δ t t i j k t i j k 1 the stochastic element ϵ i j k of eq 13 is added to represent that growth is not deterministic except on its expected value i fitted the non linear mixed effects models eq 13 by maximum likelihood followed by the best linear unbiased predictors of the random effects robinson 1991 i used variance functions to model the variance structure of the within stratum g errors where the coefficient δ changes for each g stratum pinheiro and bates 2000 since the data come from different studies i used this information as the stratum for the residual variance modelling as recommended by salas et al 2008 therefore the model was fitted allowing a different variance for the error term notice that i prefer to use this model instead of other variants e g adding random effects to α because it has been shown a better performance in previous studies stage 1963 garcía 2005 salas and garcía 2006 3 results the collected data span trees from young ages to adultness having between 19 and 103 years as well as from small trees to taller ones between 7 to 37 m table 1 furthermore the observed height growth series grey lines in fig 2a c depict a large growing conditions variability by showing different growth rates and asymptotes among species upon the above the sample offered an array of height growth patterns of dominant trees suitable to represent different forest productivities both the estimated parameters of the model 13 and their respective variance estimates shown biologically consistent values e g for the asymptote table 2 the variance in height growth between trees of the same plots σ 2 is low because they having growing under similar conditions i plot the resulting behaviour of the model 11 by using the parameter estimates of their respective mixed effect model per species the parameter estimates of their respective mixed effect model per species table 2 a reference height of 10 m and by setting four site index values 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 m yr i show this for the n dombeyi model in fig 1 only the other species behave similarly with a focus on building a simple continuous time dynamical system where the de of height is a function of both the estimated parameters and the site index i assumed an initial height of 1 3 m and an initial time of 0 5 yr salas 2011 using height growth rates versus the state variable i e height rather than versus time i e breast height age allows us to differentiate among sites easily fig 1 the site index curves derived from the proposed model eq 13 and parameters in table 2 demonstrated being able to capture the observed height growth series fig 2 a c for n dombeyi n alpina and n obliqua respectively i computed the time of maximum annual growth rate t based on the proposed models as a biological application of the current approach because this time should depend on the autoecological features of the species as expected t is smaller for trees on good sites than those on poor sites table 3 the better the sites the shorter the period elapsed to reach the maximum growth rate i argue that the value of t could also be used as an indicator of the shade tolerance level of the species in the sense that the more shade intolerant a species is the smaller t would be for instance n dombeyi is the most shade intolerant species among the nothofagus being studied here donoso et al 2006 with lower t for all site indices than the other species in the same context n alpina is more shade tolerant than n obliqua donoso 1995 therefore having a higher t 4 discussion i presented the development of a forest site index based on the dominant trees height growth rate at a reference height termed grsi this index is an alternative to the traditional site index tsi based on tree height at a reference age i explored the behaviour of the grsi by using an autonomous de as a baseline model which is a growth rate equation only depending on the state variable h and not on time being the site index model built in this way has the potential for being applied to forests where there is not a single meaningful age such as uneven aged forests and not only for even aged stands a drawback of the tsi the non use of age in a growth model has been advocated earlier by spurr 1952 who stated that the ideal method of predicting forest growth should not have age as the primary variable other authors encouraged related ideas monserud 1984 1987 1988 stage 1959 1963 because of the proposed approach does not require age to be measured i e free of time could be suitable for natural stands with all types of structure there is a biological basis for thinking that growth is not determined by age for instance bond et al 2007 studied height growth development from a physiological perspective and demonstrated that size not age drives developmental changes in height growth in the conifer pseudotsuga menziesii the proposed height growth model eq 13 is both height reference hr and site index s invariant neither parameter estimates depend on hr nor on s to use hr different from 10 m as used here a user will only need to replace hr and s of choice in 11 and to depict height growth curves according to these values although other approaches can be used to derived site index curves e g lappi and bailey 1988 the proposed site index remains as a useful and alternative tool further details need attention to use the proposed site index in practice i presented here a height growth model based on dominant trees which is assumed to represent well the dominant height growth of a forest garcía 2005 however in practice careful assessment of dominant trees must be taken into account before being used for site productivity estimation raulier et al 2003 salas and garcía 2006 besides it is not an easy task to measure height increment with sufficient accuracy sterba 1982 in the sense that we must measure the height at two times although for some coniferous species that form whorls at each growing season their height increments could be easily obtained oliver and larson 1996 stage 1963 regardless i suggest measuring the periodic annual increment in height paih as an approximation to the growth rate for a random sample of suitable trees within sample plots besides special care has to be taken for using the grs for shade tolerant species which usually experiment erratic height growth patterns on this regard we could choose a representative species and sampling them carefully nyland 1996 the reference height is other detail as pointed out above this height is user defined therefore it is arbitrary not only hr should be too low to bypass the establishment period of juvenile trees husch 1956 but also too high to avoid measuring sample trees regardless the use of 10 m for the studied species it is a compromise between a size after which i expect dominant trees were overcoming the first intense competition period after establishment and an achievable height to be easily measured further details could arise indeed for instance how the grsi could be applied in mixed species stands i suggest sampling the same trees used to estimate the dominant height i e the average height of the 100 largest trees in 1 ha van laar and akça 2007 later the estimation of a stand level grsi has to consider the sample plot sizes like the one proposed by garcía 1998 future research is required to oversee other practical issues time of maximum height growth rate could be used as a quantitative proxy for the shade tolerance level of species n dombeyi is the most shade intolerant species among the nothofagus being studied here donoso et al 2006 which is in agreement with the t values derived from the proposed models according to the photosynthesis measured features in a controlled experiment by read and hill 1985 n alpina is the most shade tolerant species among the ones here indeed the results support this when comparing n dombeyi versus n obliqua furthermore these findings could also support that n dombeyi is a more pioneer species than n obliqua as reported by bögelein et al 2018 similar trends had been observed by puente et al 1979 and veblen et al 1980 when analyzing tree population structure of n alpina n obliqua and tree seedlings of n alpina and n dombeyi respectively moreover the results point out that the maximum height growth rate occurs five and two years earlier for n dombeyi than n alpina in the poorest and best site indices respectively this sort of information is important for silvicultural research soto et al 2017 soto and puettmann 2018 and restoration efforts bannister et al 2018 5 concluding remarks a new type of forest site index is introduced height growth rate at a reference height grsi with a stronger emphasis in the mathematical details than into the practical ones the concept is exemplified by fitting a growth rate model to data of dominant trees and by depicting the corresponding site index curves i presume that many researchers will decide to model site index in the traditional way tsi or use different quantitative approaches for nonstatistical nonmathematical reasons at least until the theoretical and practical consequences of these courses of action become better determined for those who seek to use a different approach i suggest the grsi as a suitable alternative to model site productivity the proposed approach goes beyond the current traditional site index concept providing a growth rate basis for comparing site productivity indeed assessing forest site productivity is a complicated matter and a single index cannot summarize all but i aimed at providing a novel quantitative oriented approach credit author

to say i can generate an infinite family of solutions from a de boyce and diprima 2003 furthermore from different des i can arrive at the same solution or integrated form depending on their parameter values both situations were not specified clearly by some of the studies working with des in ecological applications mcdill and amateis 1993 tomé et al 2006 if i allow ψ 1 the general solution a 16

24817,ecological invasion is a common phenomenon and a critical driver of species coexistence in nature we establish a pair approximation model to explore the possible invasive results of an exploitative competition food web formed by ecological invasion global and local hunting strategies of predators are considered the influence of initial densities and the initial spatial structure of both native and invasive species for invasive results are analyzed generally better local predation capacity and higher initial density of the invasive species favor successful invasion interestingly the initial spatial structures of both native and invasive species can alter the invasive results whether higher aggregation of invasive species promotes invasion depends on the species predation strategies then two kinds of disturbance defined as destructive disturbance and targeted introductory disturbance are introduced three characteristics of disturbances are considered the extent spatial connectivity and periodicity all the three characteristic have profound influence on the invasive results especially for the targeted introductory disturbance furthermore the former kind of disturbance cannot eliminate the invasive species thoroughly while the latter not only can eliminate the invasive species but also can promote the coexistence of the native and invasive species depending on its three characteristics finally several invasive events and hypotheses being reported are explained by our model this study provides new insights into biodiversity conservation and invasion and the results about disturbance can give us some inspirations on the control of invasion keywords biological invasion food web disturbance predation strategy pair approximation mean field approximation 1 introduction biological invasion has become one of the most important factors harmful to the stability of the ecosystems hobbs and huenneke 1992 kolar and lodge 2001 hulme 2006 faillace et al 2017 enders et al 2018 meanwhile economic loss due to biological invasion is huge every year it has become a worldwide issue many theoretical and empirical works have focused on exploring how invasive species affect native species significant results are obtained and have been used as guidance for biological control or maintenance of biodiversity zhang et al 2004 hulme 2006 berkvens et al 2007 however research on food web of biological invasion are still missing and spatial structure of food web is often ignored in fact not all biological invasions can be successful hurst et al 1992 elliott et al 1996 nelson et al 2008 some invasive species will compete to exclude the native species while some invasive species will be out competed by the native species two typical examples may illustrate this to control aphids two kinds of beetles called coccinella septempunctata l and harmonia axyridis pallas were introduced into north america the two kinds of beetles invaded north america successfully and they controlled aphids while when another kind of ladybird called adalia bipunctata was introduced into osaka in japan to control aphids the invasive species failed colonizing hurst et al 1992 elliott et al 1996 such invasive events are not uncommon facts indicate that the direct or indirect trophic relationships constitute the key to the success of invasion however few studies have explored the relationship between biological invasion coexistence mechanism and predator prey structure of natural communities for a simple predator prey structure of natural communities the invasive species will restructure the natural communities as is shown in fig 1 a a simple food chain is composed of species 1 prey and species 2 predator the invasive species 3 predator may lead to three typical invasive results pillai et al 2009 liao et al 2017 the invasive results of this prey predator system will be b a simple food chain c exploitative competition food web and d omnivorous food web we will analyze the result of c in this study the biological invasive results will be affected by many factors one of the most important factors is dispersal abilities kareiva 1987 bohonak 1999 cressman and křivan 2012 zhang et al 2018 dispersal is a key element for an individual s life because it can determine the rest of life zhang et al 2018 it can change the physical environment in which the individual may relate to the surrounding individuals earlier studies have shown that dispersal abilities have profound influence on the competitive results between the invasive and native species hiebeler 2000 2004 dispersal can also be reflected in predatory strategies kareiva 1987 kuang and takeuchi 1994 and it is mainly embodied in the distance of hunting some previous studies also investigated the speed of invasive species on different dispersal abilities by varying the dispersal distance cressman and křivan 2012 another important factor is the initial densities of both the native and invasive species we noted that the classical competitive models have shown that the competitive results would depend on the initial density of species macarthur 1970 gerry and wilson 1995 zhang et al 2018 however few studies have investigated whether the initial spatial distribution will change the competitive outcomes spatial distribution mainly refers to the spatial structure of the native and invasive species when biological invasions occur some scholars have shown that spatial distribution has profound effect on the coexistence of species johst et al 2002 liao et al 2017 before an invasion the native species will have relatively stable dynamics in spatial distribution the native species are aggregated like wild horses zebras and some other herbivorous animals while some native species are decentralized in nature like leopard tiger and some felines the invasive species maybe relatively scattered by artificial introduction like some marine organism invasion caused by ship movement and some invasive species can be relatively aggregated by natural diffusion no study has shown how the predation strategies and the initial spatial structure of both native and invasive species will change the invasive results sometimes people expect to control biological invasion to protect the native species earlier studies have pointed out that the disturbance has become a critical driver of species coexistence and diversity in community ecology johst and drechsler 2003 yang et al 2006 zhang and shea 2011 miller et al 2012 disturbance can be viewed as uncommon irregular events that cause abrupt structural changes in natural communities and move them away from static near equilibrium conditions sousa 1984 two different disturbances will be analyzed the destructive disturbance and the targeted introductory disturbance the former means the individual will be killed no matter whether it is invasive or native but the disturbed habitats can be occupied by the individuals again next time hiebeler 2005 the latter means the native species will be introduced into the competitive system artificially yang et al 2006 the introduced species will occupy the empty inhabits earlier studies have emphasized the critical role of spatial correlation in disturbance miller et al 2012 liao et al 2016 and in this study the degree the spatial distribution and the periodicity of disturbance will be considered the degree of disturbance is the proportion of the disturbed habitats the spatial disturbance is mainly the connectivity of the disturbed areas for example both lightning and forest fires can be seen as the first kind of disturbance while lightning stricken areas are isolated compared with the fire stricken areas it means that many natural and anthropogenic disturbances do not occur uniformly across the landscape liao et al 2016 the periodicity of disturbance represents the fixed interval between invasion and disturbance the former disturbance is not common but no studies have analyzed the influence of targeted introductory disturbance especially on such an invasive food web when the predators hunt globally the traditional mean field approximation mfa is an excellent method to analyze the dynamics of biological system levit 1980 hiebeler and millett 2011 however mfa cannot get considerable results when the predators hunt locally matsuda et al 1992 therefore we use pair approximation in this study pair approximation pa is proposed for the first time by matsuda et al in 1992 in their research pa was used for a population biological problem and the results are considerable matsuda et al 1992 pa is a moment closure method to produce a set of autonomous and closed ordinary differential equations compared with the traditional ordinary differential or discrete equations based on mass action law pa considers the relations between two individuals in space now pa is a widely used technique in many ecological phenomena such as infectious disease food chain habitat loss and so on ellner 2001 su and hui 2011 liao et al 2013 alwan 2017 pa has enormous potential for applications because the effect of spatial structure will be widely considered in future researches in this study we develop a biological invasive model considering the spatial structure of species and spatial connectivity of disturbance by using pa on an exploitative competition food web we suppose that the predators will adopt four predation dispersal strategies pure local pure global mixed strategy with mainly local and mainly global based on the different predation strategies the initial densities of the native and invasive species are considered firstly then the initial spatial distributions of the two competitive species are studied finally we explore the invasive results by implementing two kinds of disturbances simultaneously the extent spatial structure and periodicity of the two kinds of different disturbances are considered 2 material and methods 2 1 pair approximation model we suppose the species will occupy the infinite lattice structured landscape each habitat site can be empty denoted by 0 occupied by an individual belonging to species 1 species 2 or species 3 denoted by 1 2 or 3 each habitat site has z 4 nearest neighbors von neumann neighborhood in the competitive food web fig 1c detailed rules governing the dynamics of this competitive food web are as following 1 the predators can only propagate by hunting preys pillai et al 2009 species 1 can only send its offsprings to the nearest empty habitats 2 only interspecific competitive between species 2 and species 3 is considered the interspecific competition increases mortality of both competitors and species 3 is the better competitor i e c 32 c 23 3 species 2 and species 3 have same predation strategies let ρi and ρij denote the densities of single site i and pair sites i j where i 0 1 2 3

more symbols and their descriptions are shown in table 1 to construct the competitive food web by pair and mean field approximation taking ρ 10 as an example the dynamic of this pair sites is shown in

of ρ i ρ i 0 ρ i 1 ρ i 2 ρ i 3 and ρ i j ρ j i where i j 0 1 2 3 all other single and pair sites can be calculated from those ten equations based on pair approximation matsuda et al 1992 we always have 11 q i j k q i j ρ i j ρ j as a result 1 11 become a set of closured and autonomous equations the food web shown in fig 1c can be analyzed by those equations 2 2 disturbance disturbance refers to an abrupt change in species in an area either a sudden decrease the first kind of disturbance or increase the second kind of disturbance in species we assume that when the destructive disturbances occur all the individuals within the disturbed area will be killed and the disturbed area will become empty which will lead to a sudden decrease of all species the disturbed area can be still occupied by species 1 when the targeted introductory disturbances occur the disturbed area will be occupied by the native species 2 which will lead to a sudden increase of species 2 for example if the site is occupied by species 3 before disturbance then the site will be occupied by species 2 and 3 it can be seen that two competitive species can coexist momentarily fig 3 shows the species pattern formation just before and after two different spatial disturbances the extent the spatial structure and the periodicity of disturbance will be considered hiebeler gave the orthogonal neighboring correlation algorithm the extent ρd and the spatial connectivity of disturbance q d d should obey the following inequality hiebeler 2000 12 1 1 ρ d q d d 1 when the value of ρd and q d d do not satisfy the inequality the disturbance is considered as invalid the parameter ρd is the fraction of the disturbed area in the entire landscape the parameter q d d represents the conditional probability that a random chosen site is disturbed and its adjacent site is also disturbed the parameter can describe the spatial clumping degree of disturbance the orthogonal neighboring correlation algorithm can be used to reflect the extent and spatial structure of disturbance larger value ρd means a higher proportion of disturbed habitats greater value of q d d represents the spatially aggregated structure and the smaller value of q d d represents the relatively fragmented structure the parameter ρuu represents the probability when randomly choosing a pair of adjacent sites that both of them are undisturbed because of q α β q β β 1 and ρ α ρ β 1 where α β d u α β we have ρ u u 1 2 ρ d ρ d q d d more details can be seen in the studies of hiebeler 2000 2004 and liao et al 2016 the periodicity of disturbance is a constant it represents the fixed interval between the invasion and disturbance when the destructive disturbances occur the densities of the three species will increase with δ ρ i ρ i ρ d i 1 2 3 and the density of empty sites will increase with δ ρ 0 ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 3 ρ d when another kind of disturbance occur the density of species 2 will increase with δ ρ 2 ρ 2 ρ d and the densities of empty sites will increase with δ ρ 0 ρ 0 ρ d species 1 and species 3 will increase with δ ρ j 0 j 1 3 both in the two kinds of disturbance the densities of pair sites will not change with the probability ρuu when both kinds of disturbance occur based on the method proposed by liao et al 2016 let ρ i and ρ i j represent the single and pair densities just after disturbance after the disturbance the system will satisfy 13 ρ i t ρ i t δ ρ i ρ i j t ρ i j t ρ u u t t i j 0 1 2 3 the equation 13 and equation 1 11 become the pa model with disturbance note that the model after undergoing disturbance is non autonomous 2 3 simulations because of the complexity of our model matlab is adopted to solve the ordinary differential equations if the densities of single sites are lower than 0 00001 the species will be considered as extinct four different predation strategies are defined in this study a pure locally hunting with α 21 α 31 0 7 β 21 β 31 0 b mixed strategy but mainly local hunting with α 21 α 31 0 4 β 21 β 31 0 2 c mixed strategy but mainly global hunting with α 21 α 31 0 2 β 21 β 31 0 4 d pure globally hunting with α 21 α 31 0 β 21 β 31 0 5 based on the four different predation strategies we expect to explore the influence on invasive results when the initial densities of the native species 2 and invasive species 3 vary then we make the initial densities of the two competitive species fixed the influence of the initial structure of the two species is simulated finally the influence of the degree the spatial structure and the periodicity of two kinds of disturbances will be simulated 3 results our goal is to consider how the spatial food web structure alters the biological invasive results response to disturbance under four different predation strategies to explore this question we analyze the pair approximation models developed in the previous section from a variety of preliminary simulations without introducing disturbance we first determine the range of species competitive intensity and mortality while keeping species 1 s birth rate fixed in order to yield species coexistence through this paper we explore a broad range of biologically realistic parameter combinations some other parameter combinations can be seen in the appendix this range of parameter combinations meets biological realism and the existence of stable non trivial solutions ringing from b 0 75 to b 0 8 c 32 0 2 to c 32 0 25 c 23 c 32 0 06 to c 23 c 32 0 04 d 1 0 08 to d 1 0 11 and d 2 d 3 d 1 0 08 to d 2 d 3 d 1 0 1 however the range of these parameters listed here does not represent the range of all nontrivial solutions that can be obtained then we choose suitable parameters that can yield long term species coexistence these parameter combinations are used for all subsequent simulations with two kinds of spatially correlated disturbance the results given in this section have qualitative robustness and representativeness for all parameter combinations examined when we explore the influence of initial densities of species 2 and species 3 the initial spatial distributions i e the initial value of the equations 1 10 are random with q 2 2 ρ 2 and q 3 3 ρ 3 which means that ρ 2 ρ 22 1 q 2 2 ρ 2 ρ 02 ρ 12 ρ 32 and ρ 3 ρ 33 1 q 3 3 ρ 3 ρ 03 ρ 13 ρ 23 hiebeler 2000 in addition we suppose that ρ 02 ρ 12 ρ 32 and ρ 03 ρ 13 ρ 23 initially the other initial densities ρ 0 ρ 1 ρ 10 are fixed the invasive results are shown in fig 4 three results may occur the native species 2 will be out competed the invasive species 3 will be out competed and the coexistence of native and invasive species as we expected the higher initial density of native species 2 the smaller possibilities that the species 2 would be competed to be excluded the increase of the initial density of species 2 will prevent successful invasions what s more the better global predatory capacity of species 2 the smaller possibilities that species 2 would be competed to be excluded it also means that species 3 can invade successfully with better local hunting strategy and noted the possibility of species 2 and species 3 coexistence will become greater when their global hunting capacity is better fig 4d then the influence of the initial spatial structure of the both native and invasive species on the invasive results is shown in fig 5 here the initial densities are fixed with ρ 2 0 33 and ρ 3 0 21 respectively which means the initial value ρij i j 0 1 2 3 will vary with the changing of the parameter q 2 2 and q 3 3 larger q 2 2 and q 3 3 represent the initial aggregated spatial structure of the native and invasive species respectively we still suppose that ρ 02 ρ 12 ρ 32 and ρ 03 ρ 13 ρ 23 initially same to fig 4 the possibility that species 3 invade successfully will decrease when the global predation capacity becomes better when the two species do not hunt pure globally and when the initial spatial distribution of species 2 is fixed the more species 3 aggregated the smaller possibility that species 3 will invade successfully when the initially spatial distribution of species 3 is fixed the more species 2 aggregated the greater possibilities that species 3 will invade successfully only when the initial spatial distribution of species 3 is less aggregated than species 2 can species 3 invade successfully or coexist with species 2 fig 5 a c all the results mean that the discrete distribution of species 3 will promote successful invasion however the spatial distribution has no influence on the invasive results when the two species hunt pure globally fig 5d the influence on the invasive results of two kinds of disturbances is simulated in fig 6 the initial densities and spatial distributions of the native and invasive species are ρ 2 q 2 2 0 3 and ρ 3 q 3 3 0 25 other initial values of single and pair sites are same to fig 4 if no disturbance is implemented species 2 will be extinct fig 4 the first kind of disturbance destructive disturbance has little influence on the invasive results no matter which predation strategies will be adopted by the two species so by implementing the first kind of disturbance it is impossible to eliminate the invasive species thoroughly the left column in fig 6 but the first kind of disturbance will lead to coexistence fig 6 and fig s5 by the second kind of disturbance targeted introductory disturbance the invasive species can be eliminated thoroughly the right column in fig 6 when the extent of disturbance is not too great less than 0 6 in fig 6 only the moderate spatial connectivity of the disturbance can lead to the extinction of species 3 too aggregated and too scattered disturbance will promote the coexistence of species 2and species 3 but when the extent of the second disturbance is too great greater than 0 6 in fig 6 only the relatively dispersed disturbance can promote the coexistence for the predation strategy with large fraction of global hunting the second kind of disturbance favors the coexistence of native and invasive species fig 6 and fig s5 we also can conclude that the spatial structure of disturbance has more and more slight influence on the invasive outcomes as the global predation capacity increases lastly the influence of the disturbances periodicity is analyzed in fig 7 comparing with fig 6 all the initial values of single and pair sites are same with fig 6 only predation strategy a is shown here and other three kinds of predation strategies can be seen in the appendix when the first kind of disturbance occurs the shorter periodicities of disturbances can increase the coexistent probability of species 2 and species 3 fig 6 a1 and fig 7 for another kind of disturbance the shorter periodicities of disturbances can promote the extinction of species 3 fig 6 a2 and fig 7 for example the same second kind of disturbance ρ d 0 5 q d d 0 2 cannot eliminate species 3 when periodicity is t 100 while the disturbance can eliminate species 3 when the periodicity is t 50 or t 25 it means that species 2 and species 3 will coexist with a relatively small probability when the periodicities of the second kind of disturbances is shorter lots of combination of those parameters can meet the biological realism and the existence of stable non trivial solutions of the equation 1 11 our conclusions obtained in this study are not accidental some representative invasive results based on the other parameters combinations are shown in appendix 4 discussion traditional theories of food webs mostly consider spatially implicit patch models while ignore the details of local relationship e g the patch connectivity the spatial structure is studied here a factor which is often overlooked but ubiquitous in real world disturbance processes johst and drechsler 2003 zhang and shea 2011 to construct a spatiotemporal food web about biological invasive model by pa and mfa we have made some several simplifying assumptions firstly the invasive mechanism is built on the hypothesis that bottom trophic level e g species 1 can only send its propagators to the near empty habitats hiebeler 2005 hiebeler and millett 2011 secondly the higher trophic level can hunt locally finite range or globally mccann et al 2005 greenleaf et al 2007 thirdly the disturbances are demonstrated by the degree and distribution liao et al 2016 hiebeler gave the algorithm while other algorithms can also be used to demonstrate spatial disturbance milne 1992 keitt 2000 based on those assumptions the invasive results can be analyzed by the differential equations the elaborate model can also be used in other food webs shown in fig 1 clearly higher initial density of invasive species promotes successful invasion fig 4 meanwhile predation strategies can alter invasive results when the densities are fixed the larger fraction of global hunting will lead to the coexistence of the native and invasive species fig 4 for the invasive species the global predation strategy is at a disadvantage kuang and takeuchi 1994 however the local predation strategy promotes to establish groups for survival fraterrigo and rusak 2008 the conclusion contradicts with the previous studies about competitive species liao et al 2016 lu and peng 2017 the reason behind may be explained from two points firstly the predators will propagate only when they hunt preys and the preys can only send its offspring to its near empty habitats it means the local predation strategy are more effective ying et al 2014 another important reason is that the global predation strategy will lead to great extent dispersion of the invasive species as a result the native species will slow down extinction because of relatively weaker interspecific competition intensity miller et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 the conclusion we obtained here is consistent with johst et al 2002 who found that the long range dispersal can shorten the time to extinction by using an utterly different method in their study for a long time many people think that the spatial pattern formed by dispersal and local interaction can increase the probability of the coexistence of species ying et al 2014 detto and muller landau 2016 however we here find only the moderate spatial distribution of the species can promote the coexistence when the predators do not hunt purely globally fig 5 only when the spatial distribution of the invasive species is more aggregated than the native species can the invasive species out compete the native species fig 5 a c it is mainly because the aggregated distribution of invasive will reduce the interspecific competitive intensity then the invasive species will have relatively enough time to reproduce wiener and tuljapurkar 1994 the spatial distribution has no influence on the invasive results when the predators hunt purely globally fig 5d the conclusion is consistent with the previous studies ying et al 2014 some invasive events in real world can be explained by this model for example two kinds of species called hyphantria cunea drury and hemiberlesia pitysophila takagi invaded china successfully in the 1970s one common feature of the two specie is that they can reproduce locally by crawling or flight ruiting et al 2013 the feature will lead to the aggregated distribution of invasive species so that the probability of invading successfully will increase fig 5 a c previous studies found evidence that species traits such as growth rate and competitive rank could predict the effects of disturbance on species persistence and hence diversity haddad et al 2008 moreover miller et al 2012 found that the dispersal distance will change the coexistence under the same disturbance dramatically the first kind of disturbance cannot eliminate the invasive species on one hand this kind of disturbance can promote the coexistence of the native and invasive species fig 6 a1 a4 for this kind of disturbance the moderate aggregated distribution may lead to the coexistence of the two species liao et al 2016 johst and drechsler 2003 pointed that the correlation of patch destruction would increase the mean time to extinct the reason mainly is that the destructive disturbances can kill the native and invasive species simultaneously consequently the interspecific competition intensity is impaired and both the native and invasive species will have more opportunities to survive a good case in point is that the type q bemisia tabaci invaded into china in 2003 but type b bemisia tabaci has become the dominant species gradually the two kinds of bemisia tabaci still coexist even though type b bemisia tabaci has competitive edge teng et al 2010 luo et al 2010 pointed out that the using of pesticides accelerated this transmission on the other hand this kind of disturbance may also accelerate the extinction of the native species luo et al 2010 ruiting et al 2013 for example crofton weed rapidly spread in china s guizhou province in 2010 because of the unprecedented drought the drought can kill the both native and invasive species while drought and the using of pesticides can be seen as the first kind of disturbance the moderate spatial distributions of the targeted introductory disturbance can eliminate the invasive species fig 6b1 b4 the reason can be analyzed like this the introduced species can accelerate the extinction of invasive species by interspecific competition meanwhile too aggregated distribution can only accelerate the extinction locally and too scattered distribution has little influence on the death of the invasive species the native species chouioia cunea in china was introduced into some cities to control the invasion of hyphantria cunea drury the invasive species have been eliminated in several cities such as qingdao shanghai and so on yang et al 2006 and they found that once large numbers of the parasitoid population were achieved through the release of the parasitoid the pest will be efficiently under control recently another experiment discloses that aggressive invader aedes albopictus can be nearly eliminated by introducing the native mosquitos infected by a kind of bacteria named wolbachia zheng et al 2019 our models also support the enemy release hypothesis erh which considers that the species which kill the invasive species is an important regulatory factor for the stability of biological systems keane 2002 colautti et al 2004 petraitis et al 1989 pointed out that with the increase of the disturbance s extent a curve with multiple peaks which reflect the relation of species diversity and disturbance is possible for the targeted introductory disturbance with fixed spatial structure fig 6 and fig 7 obtain the same result our results also show that increasing the extent of disturbance is not always the optimal strategy for the control of invasion spatial connectivity of disturbance also has profound influence on the invasive results fig 6 we find that intermediate disturbance will maximize species diversity fig 6 the intermediate disturbance hypothesis idh states that species diversity reaches its maximum at the intermediate extent of disturbance banitz et al 2008 dos santos et al 2011 liao et al 2016 thomson et al 2017 our results obtained here favor this hypothesis it can give us some inspiration on the control of biological invasions the second kind of disturbance is a better method to maintain species diversity and the disturbance favored the coexistence of two competitive species with global hunting strategies banitz et al 2008 liao et al 2016 thomson et al 2017 see fig 6d1 d2 previous studies have discovered that apart from correlated patch destruction dispersal can amplify spatial correlation of local population dynamics due to immigrants arriving from other populations ripa 2000 johst and drechsler 2003 in this study the predation strategies can change the invasion results even though the invasive species have the same invasive conditions fig 4 6 the invasive species with global hunting has less probability to invade successfully and also has greater probability to be eliminated we conclude that the invasive species with a relatively well predation capacity of local hunting may be a stronger competing species so for the invasive species we can prevent the invasion by controlling their global reproduction in a system with a clumped patch distribution short range dispersal allowed a sufficient colonization of regenerated patches in the clusters and a higher survival during dispersal than long range dispersal doak et al 1992 adler and nuernberger 1994 johst et al 2002 thomson et al 2017 periodicity of disturbance can also influence invasive results sousa 1984 zhang and shea 2011 shorter periodicity benefits the control of invasion fig 7 it is mainly because the urgent disturbances will not give the invasive species enough time to establish groups for survival fraterrigo and rusak 2008 liao et al 2016 form fig 6 and fig 7 we can see that the longer periodicity not only reduces the coexistent probability of native and invasive species but also reduces the probability to eliminate the native species thoroughly so the early detection and early prevention is important brontispa longissima gestro invaded china s hainan province in the 1890s but no strategies are adopted initially as a result it is hard to control the pest now lu and peng 2017 the interval is also considered in the experiment on controlling aedes albopictus by introducing the native mosquitos infected by wolbachia zheng et al 2019 5 conclusion in this study a mechanistic framework is elaborated to demonstrate that the initial density initial spatial structure of species and the two kinds of disturbance have potential to alter invasive outcomes in an exploitative competition food web some invasive events are explained by our model however our model still has some limitations we just considered native and invasive species having same predation capacities further studies could consider different predation capacities of them and we do not consider the intraspecific competition in fact the intraspecific competition is a critical factor for the dynamics of biosystem furthermore we only studied this in theory the role of spatial disturbance will require experimental studies to estimate the relative contributions on the control of invasion despite these limitations our theoretical model mainly raises two specific predictions from the influence of disturbance 1 to eliminate the invasive species introducing native species is a better method the management of the introduced species is also important 2 early detection and early prevention are critical on the invasive control other food webs shown in fig 1 also can be analyzed by this method credit author statement shipeng nie investigation writing original draft preparation software weide

a broad range of biologically realistic parameter combinations to explore the influence of spatial structure of species and disturbance on the invasive results of an exploitative food web some other representative parameter combinations are used in this appendix here fig a 1 and a 2 show the influence of initial densities of native and invasive species on the food web the meaning is same to fig 4 as is shown in fig a 1 and a 2 three results may same to fig 4 the native species 2 will be out competed the invasive species 3 will be out competed and the coexistence of native and invasive species higher initial density of native species 2 will prevent the invasion species 3 can invade successfully with better local hunting strategy species 2 and species 3 have greater probability to coexist when their global hunting capacity is better fig a 3 a 4 show the influence of initially spatial stricture of native and invasive species on the food web same to fig 5 the spatial structure has no influence on the invasive results when the two species hunt globally only when the initially spatial distribution of species 3 is less aggregated than species 2 can species 3 will invade successfully or coexist with species 2 the influence on the invasive results of two kinks of disturbances is simulated in fig a 5 the initial densities and spatial distributions of the native and invasive species are ρ 2 q 2 2 0 31 and ρ 3 q 3 3 0 26 the first kind of disturbance has little influence on the invasive results no matter which predation strategies will be adopted by the two species the second kind of disturbance can change the invasive results dramatically the spatial structure of disturbance has lighter and lighter influence on the invasive outcomes as the global predation capacity increases fig a 6 a 8 show the influence of the periodicity of disturbance for the first kind of disturbance the shorter periodicities of disturbances can increase the coexistent probability of species 2 and species 3 for another kind of disturbance the shorter periodicities of disturbances can promote the extinction of species 3 same to fig 6 and a 5 the spatial structure of disturbance has lighter and lighter influence on the invasive outcomes as the global predation capacity increases lots of combination of those parameters can meet the biological realism and the existence of stable non trivial

accidental 
24817,ecological invasion is a common phenomenon and a critical driver of species coexistence in nature we establish a pair approximation model to explore the possible invasive results of an exploitative competition food web formed by ecological invasion global and local hunting strategies of predators are considered the influence of initial densities and the initial spatial structure of both native and invasive species for invasive results are analyzed generally better local predation capacity and higher initial density of the invasive species favor successful invasion interestingly the initial spatial structures of both native and invasive species can alter the invasive results whether higher aggregation of invasive species promotes invasion depends on the species predation strategies then two kinds of disturbance defined as destructive disturbance and targeted introductory disturbance are introduced three characteristics of disturbances are considered the extent spatial connectivity and periodicity all the three characteristic have profound influence on the invasive results especially for the targeted introductory disturbance furthermore the former kind of disturbance cannot eliminate the invasive species thoroughly while the latter not only can eliminate the invasive species but also can promote the coexistence of the native and invasive species depending on its three characteristics finally several invasive events and hypotheses being reported are explained by our model this study provides new insights into biodiversity conservation and invasion and the results about disturbance can give us some inspirations on the control of invasion keywords biological invasion food web disturbance predation strategy pair approximation mean field approximation 1 introduction biological invasion has become one of the most important factors harmful to the stability of the ecosystems hobbs and huenneke 1992 kolar and lodge 2001 hulme 2006 faillace et al 2017 enders et al 2018 meanwhile economic loss due to biological invasion is huge every year it has become a worldwide issue many theoretical and empirical works have focused on exploring how invasive species affect native species significant results are obtained and have been used as guidance for biological control or maintenance of biodiversity zhang et al 2004 hulme 2006 berkvens et al 2007 however research on food web of biological invasion are still missing and spatial structure of food web is often ignored in fact not all biological invasions can be successful hurst et al 1992 elliott et al 1996 nelson et al 2008 some invasive species will compete to exclude the native species while some invasive species will be out competed by the native species two typical examples may illustrate this to control aphids two kinds of beetles called coccinella septempunctata l and harmonia axyridis pallas were introduced into north america the two kinds of beetles invaded north america successfully and they controlled aphids while when another kind of ladybird called adalia bipunctata was introduced into osaka in japan to control aphids the invasive species failed colonizing hurst et al 1992 elliott et al 1996 such invasive events are not uncommon facts indicate that the direct or indirect trophic relationships constitute the key to the success of invasion however few studies have explored the relationship between biological invasion coexistence mechanism and predator prey structure of natural communities for a simple predator prey structure of natural communities the invasive species will restructure the natural communities as is shown in fig 1 a a simple food chain is composed of species 1 prey and species 2 predator the invasive species 3 predator may lead to three typical invasive results pillai et al 2009 liao et al 2017 the invasive results of this prey predator system will be b a simple food chain c exploitative competition food web and d omnivorous food web we will analyze the result of c in this study the biological invasive results will be affected by many factors one of the most important factors is dispersal abilities kareiva 1987 bohonak 1999 cressman and křivan 2012 zhang et al 2018 dispersal is a key element for an individual s life because it can determine the rest of life zhang et al 2018 it can change the physical environment in which the individual may relate to the surrounding individuals earlier studies have shown that dispersal abilities have profound influence on the competitive results between the invasive and native species hiebeler 2000 2004 dispersal can also be reflected in predatory strategies kareiva 1987 kuang and takeuchi 1994 and it is mainly embodied in the distance of hunting some previous studies also investigated the speed of invasive species on different dispersal abilities by varying the dispersal distance cressman and křivan 2012 another important factor is the initial densities of both the native and invasive species we noted that the classical competitive models have shown that the competitive results would depend on the initial density of species macarthur 1970 gerry and wilson 1995 zhang et al 2018 however few studies have investigated whether the initial spatial distribution will change the competitive outcomes spatial distribution mainly refers to the spatial structure of the native and invasive species when biological invasions occur some scholars have shown that spatial distribution has profound effect on the coexistence of species johst et al 2002 liao et al 2017 before an invasion the native species will have relatively stable dynamics in spatial distribution the native species are aggregated like wild horses zebras and some other herbivorous animals while some native species are decentralized in nature like leopard tiger and some felines the invasive species maybe relatively scattered by artificial introduction like some marine organism invasion caused by ship movement and some invasive species can be relatively aggregated by natural diffusion no study has shown how the predation strategies and the initial spatial structure of both native and invasive species will change the invasive results sometimes people expect to control biological invasion to protect the native species earlier studies have pointed out that the disturbance has become a critical driver of species coexistence and diversity in community ecology johst and drechsler 2003 yang et al 2006 zhang and shea 2011 miller et al 2012 disturbance can be viewed as uncommon irregular events that cause abrupt structural changes in natural communities and move them away from static near equilibrium conditions sousa 1984 two different disturbances will be analyzed the destructive disturbance and the targeted introductory disturbance the former means the individual will be killed no matter whether it is invasive or native but the disturbed habitats can be occupied by the individuals again next time hiebeler 2005 the latter means the native species will be introduced into the competitive system artificially yang et al 2006 the introduced species will occupy the empty inhabits earlier studies have emphasized the critical role of spatial correlation in disturbance miller et al 2012 liao et al 2016 and in this study the degree the spatial distribution and the periodicity of disturbance will be considered the degree of disturbance is the proportion of the disturbed habitats the spatial disturbance is mainly the connectivity of the disturbed areas for example both lightning and forest fires can be seen as the first kind of disturbance while lightning stricken areas are isolated compared with the fire stricken areas it means that many natural and anthropogenic disturbances do not occur uniformly across the landscape liao et al 2016 the periodicity of disturbance represents the fixed interval between invasion and disturbance the former disturbance is not common but no studies have analyzed the influence of targeted introductory disturbance especially on such an invasive food web when the predators hunt globally the traditional mean field approximation mfa is an excellent method to analyze the dynamics of biological system levit 1980 hiebeler and millett 2011 however mfa cannot get considerable results when the predators hunt locally matsuda et al 1992 therefore we use pair approximation in this study pair approximation pa is proposed for the first time by matsuda et al in 1992 in their research pa was used for a population biological problem and the results are considerable matsuda et al 1992 pa is a moment closure method to produce a set of autonomous and closed ordinary differential equations compared with the traditional ordinary differential or discrete equations based on mass action law pa considers the relations between two individuals in space now pa is a widely used technique in many ecological phenomena such as infectious disease food chain habitat loss and so on ellner 2001 su and hui 2011 liao et al 2013 alwan 2017 pa has enormous potential for applications because the effect of spatial structure will be widely considered in future researches in this study we develop a biological invasive model considering the spatial structure of species and spatial connectivity of disturbance by using pa on an exploitative competition food web we suppose that the predators will adopt four predation dispersal strategies pure local pure global mixed strategy with mainly local and mainly global based on the different predation strategies the initial densities of the native and invasive species are considered firstly then the initial spatial distributions of the two competitive species are studied finally we explore the invasive results by implementing two kinds of disturbances simultaneously the extent spatial structure and periodicity of the two kinds of different disturbances are considered 2 material and methods 2 1 pair approximation model we suppose the species will occupy the infinite lattice structured landscape each habitat site can be empty denoted by 0 occupied by an individual belonging to species 1 species 2 or species 3 denoted by 1 2 or 3 each habitat site has z 4 nearest neighbors von neumann neighborhood in the competitive food web fig 1c detailed rules governing the dynamics of this competitive food web are as following 1 the predators can only propagate by hunting preys pillai et al 2009 species 1 can only send its offsprings to the nearest empty habitats 2 only interspecific competitive between species 2 and species 3 is considered the interspecific competition increases mortality of both competitors and species 3 is the better competitor i e c 32 c 23 3 species 2 and species 3 have same predation strategies let ρi and ρij denote the densities of single site i and pair sites i j where i 0 1 2 3 the pair sites i j are two adjacent patches being in state i and state j respectively q j i ρ i j ρ i represents the probability that a randomly chosen site is in state i and its adjacent site is in state j q j ik represents the probability that a randomly chosen site is in state i and its one neighborhood is in state j and another neighborhood is in state k matsuda et al 1992 su and hui 2011 more symbols and their descriptions are shown in table 1 to construct the competitive food web by pair and mean field approximation taking ρ 10 as an example the dynamic of this pair sites is shown in fig 2 as is shown in fig 2 four events will increase the density ρ 10 a1 one of the empty habitat site of pair sites 0 0 is occupied by the offspring from its neighbor sites occupied by species 1

by d 1 ρ 11 four events will reduce the density ρ 10 b1 the death of species 1 in the pair sites 1 0 denoted by d 1 ρ 1 b2 the empty habitat site of the pair sites1 0 will be occupied by the offspring from another site in the pair sites or other occupied neighbors of the empty site denoted by ψ b φ q 1 01 ρ 10 b3 species 1 in the pair site 1 0 is killed by species 2 and species 3 by local hunting denoted by φ α 21 q 2 10 α 31 q 3 10 ρ 10 b4 species 1 in the pair site 1 0 is killed by species 2 and species 3 by global hunting denoted by β 21 ρ 2 β 31 ρ 3 ρ 10 the dynamics of ρ 10 can be seen in equation 5 and the other pair sites have the similar transmissions based on the transmissions of single and pair sites the competitive food web model of the above described relationship yields the

of ρ i ρ i 0 ρ i 1 ρ i 2 ρ i 3 and ρ i j ρ j i where i j 0 1 2 3 all other single and pair sites can be calculated from those ten equations based on pair approximation matsuda et al 1992 we always have 11 q i j k q i j ρ i j ρ j as a result 1 11 become a set of closured and autonomous equations the food web shown in fig 1c can be analyzed by those equations 2 2 disturbance disturbance refers to an abrupt change in species in an area either a sudden decrease the first kind of disturbance or increase the second kind of disturbance in species we assume that when the destructive disturbances occur all the individuals within the disturbed area will be killed and the disturbed area will become empty which will lead to a sudden decrease of all species the disturbed area can be still occupied by species 1 when the targeted introductory disturbances occur the disturbed area will be occupied by the native species 2 which will lead to a sudden increase of species 2 for example if the site is occupied by species 3 before disturbance then the site will be occupied by species 2 and 3 it can be seen that two competitive species can coexist momentarily fig 3 shows the species pattern formation just before and after two different spatial disturbances the extent the spatial structure and the periodicity of disturbance will be considered hiebeler gave the orthogonal neighboring correlation algorithm the extent ρd and the spatial connectivity of disturbance q d d should obey the following inequality hiebeler 2000 12 1 1 ρ d q d d 1 when the value of ρd and q d d do not satisfy the inequality the disturbance is considered as invalid the parameter ρd is the fraction of the disturbed area in the entire landscape the parameter q d d represents the conditional probability that a random chosen site is disturbed and its adjacent site is also disturbed the parameter can describe the spatial clumping degree of disturbance the orthogonal neighboring correlation algorithm can be used to reflect the extent and spatial structure of disturbance larger value ρd means a higher proportion of disturbed habitats greater value of q d d represents the spatially aggregated structure and the smaller value of q d d represents the relatively fragmented structure the parameter ρuu represents the probability when randomly choosing a pair of adjacent sites that both of them are undisturbed because of q α β q β β 1 and ρ α ρ β 1 where α β d u α β we have ρ u u 1 2 ρ d ρ d q d d more details can be seen in the studies of hiebeler 2000 2004 and liao et al 2016 the periodicity of disturbance is a constant it represents the fixed interval between the invasion and disturbance when the destructive disturbances occur the densities of the three species will increase with δ ρ i ρ i ρ d i 1 2 3 and the density of empty sites will increase with δ ρ 0 ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 3 ρ d when another kind of disturbance occur the density of species 2 will increase with δ ρ 2 ρ 2 ρ d and the densities of empty sites will increase with δ ρ 0 ρ 0 ρ d species 1 and species 3 will increase with δ ρ j 0 j 1 3 both in the two kinds of disturbance the densities of pair sites will not change with the probability ρuu when both kinds of disturbance occur based on the method proposed by liao et al 2016 let ρ i and ρ i j represent the single and pair densities just after disturbance after the disturbance the system will satisfy 13 ρ i t ρ i t δ ρ i ρ i j t ρ i j t ρ u u t t i j 0 1 2 3 the equation 13 and equation 1 11 become the pa model with disturbance note that the model after undergoing disturbance is non autonomous 2 3 simulations because of the complexity of our model matlab is adopted to solve the ordinary differential equations if the densities of single sites are lower than 0 00001 the species will be considered as extinct four different predation strategies are defined in this study a pure locally hunting with α 21 α 31 0 7 β 21 β 31 0 b mixed strategy but mainly local hunting with α 21 α 31 0 4 β 21 β 31 0 2 c mixed strategy but mainly global hunting with α 21 α 31 0 2 β 21 β 31 0 4 d pure globally hunting with α 21 α 31 0 β 21 β 31 0 5 based on the four different predation strategies we expect to explore the influence on invasive results when the initial densities of the native species 2 and invasive species 3 vary then we make the initial densities of the two competitive species fixed the influence of the initial structure of the two species is simulated finally the influence of the degree the spatial structure and the periodicity of two kinds of disturbances will be simulated 3 results our goal is to consider how the spatial food web structure alters the biological invasive results response to disturbance under four different predation strategies to explore this question we analyze the pair approximation models developed in the previous section from a variety of preliminary simulations without introducing disturbance we first determine the range of species competitive intensity and mortality while keeping species 1 s birth rate fixed in order to yield species coexistence through this paper we explore a broad range of biologically realistic parameter combinations some other parameter combinations can be seen in the appendix this range of parameter combinations meets biological realism and the existence of stable non trivial solutions ringing from b 0 75 to b 0 8 c 32 0 2 to c 32 0 25 c 23 c 32 0 06 to c 23 c 32 0 04 d 1 0 08 to d 1 0 11 and d 2 d 3 d 1 0 08 to d 2 d 3 d 1 0 1 however the range of these parameters listed here does not represent the range of all nontrivial solutions that can be obtained then we choose suitable parameters that can yield long term species coexistence these parameter combinations are used for all subsequent simulations with two kinds of spatially correlated disturbance the results given in this section have qualitative robustness and representativeness for all parameter combinations examined when we explore the influence of initial densities of species 2 and species 3 the initial spatial distributions i e the initial value of the equations 1 10 are random with q 2 2 ρ 2 and q 3 3 ρ 3 which means that ρ 2 ρ 22 1 q 2 2 ρ 2 ρ 02 ρ 12 ρ 32 and ρ 3 ρ 33 1 q 3 3 ρ 3 ρ 03 ρ 13 ρ 23 hiebeler 2000 in addition we suppose that ρ 02 ρ 12 ρ 32 and ρ 03 ρ 13 ρ 23 initially the other initial densities ρ 0 ρ 1 ρ 10 are fixed the invasive results are shown in fig 4 three results may occur the native species 2 will be out competed the invasive species 3 will be out competed and the coexistence of native and invasive species as we expected the higher initial density of native species 2 the smaller possibilities that the species 2 would be competed to be excluded the increase of the initial density of species 2 will prevent successful invasions what s more the better global predatory capacity of species 2 the smaller possibilities that species 2 would be competed to be excluded it also means that species 3 can invade successfully with better local hunting strategy and noted the possibility of species 2 and species 3 coexistence will become greater when their global hunting capacity is better fig 4d then the influence of the initial spatial structure of the both native and invasive species on the invasive results is shown in fig 5 here the initial densities are fixed with ρ 2 0 33 and ρ 3 0 21 respectively which means the initial value ρij i j 0 1 2 3 will vary with the changing of the parameter q 2 2 and q 3 3 larger q 2 2 and q 3 3 represent the initial aggregated spatial structure of the native and invasive species respectively we still suppose that ρ 02 ρ 12 ρ 32 and ρ 03 ρ 13 ρ 23 initially same to fig 4 the possibility that species 3 invade successfully will decrease when the global predation capacity becomes better when the two species do not hunt pure globally and when the initial spatial distribution of species 2 is fixed the more species 3 aggregated the smaller possibility that species 3 will invade successfully when the initially spatial distribution of species 3 is fixed the more species 2 aggregated the greater possibilities that species 3 will invade successfully only when the initial spatial distribution of species 3 is less aggregated than species 2 can species 3 invade successfully or coexist with species 2 fig 5 a c all the results mean that the discrete distribution of species 3 will promote successful invasion however the spatial distribution has no influence on the invasive results when the two species hunt pure globally fig 5d the influence on the invasive results of two kinds of disturbances is simulated in fig 6 the initial densities and spatial distributions of the native and invasive species are ρ 2 q 2 2 0 3 and ρ 3 q 3 3 0 25 other initial values of single and pair sites are same to fig 4 if no disturbance is implemented species 2 will be extinct fig 4 the first kind of disturbance destructive disturbance has little influence on the invasive results no matter which predation strategies will be adopted by the two species so by implementing the first kind of disturbance it is impossible to eliminate the invasive species thoroughly the left column in fig 6 but the first kind of disturbance will lead to coexistence fig 6 and fig s5 by the second kind of disturbance targeted introductory disturbance the invasive species can be eliminated thoroughly the right column in fig 6 when the extent of disturbance is not too great less than 0 6 in fig 6 only the moderate spatial connectivity of the disturbance can lead to the extinction of species 3 too aggregated and too scattered disturbance will promote the coexistence of species 2and species 3 but when the extent of the second disturbance is too great greater than 0 6 in fig 6 only the relatively dispersed disturbance can promote the coexistence for the predation strategy with large fraction of global hunting the second kind of disturbance favors the coexistence of native and invasive species fig 6 and fig s5 we also can conclude that the spatial structure of disturbance has more and more slight influence on the invasive outcomes as the global predation capacity increases lastly the influence of the disturbances periodicity is analyzed in fig 7 comparing with fig 6 all the initial values of single and pair sites are same with fig 6 only predation strategy a is shown here and other three kinds of predation strategies can be seen in the appendix when the first kind of disturbance occurs the shorter periodicities of disturbances can increase the coexistent probability of species 2 and species 3 fig 6 a1 and fig 7 for another kind of disturbance the shorter periodicities of disturbances can promote the extinction of species 3 fig 6 a2 and fig 7 for example the same second kind of disturbance ρ d 0 5 q d d 0 2 cannot eliminate species 3 when periodicity is t 100 while the disturbance can eliminate species 3 when the periodicity is t 50 or t 25 it means that species 2 and species 3 will coexist with a relatively small probability when the periodicities of the second kind of disturbances is shorter lots of combination of those parameters can meet the biological realism and the existence of stable non trivial solutions of the equation 1 11 our conclusions obtained in this study are not accidental some representative invasive results based on the other parameters combinations are shown in appendix 4 discussion traditional theories of food webs mostly consider spatially implicit patch models while ignore the details of local relationship e g the patch connectivity the spatial structure is studied here a factor which is often overlooked but ubiquitous in real world disturbance processes johst and drechsler 2003 zhang and shea 2011 to construct a spatiotemporal food web about biological invasive model by pa and mfa we have made some several simplifying assumptions firstly the invasive mechanism is built on the hypothesis that bottom trophic level e g species 1 can only send its propagators to the near empty habitats hiebeler 2005 hiebeler and millett 2011 secondly the higher trophic level can hunt locally finite range or globally mccann et al 2005 greenleaf et al 2007 thirdly the disturbances are demonstrated by the degree and distribution liao et al 2016 hiebeler gave the algorithm while other algorithms can also be used to demonstrate spatial disturbance milne 1992 keitt 2000 based on those assumptions the invasive results can be analyzed by the differential equations the elaborate model can also be used in other food webs shown in fig 1 clearly higher initial density of invasive species promotes successful invasion fig 4 meanwhile predation strategies can alter invasive results when the densities are fixed the larger fraction of global hunting will lead to the coexistence of the native and invasive species fig 4 for the invasive species the global predation strategy is at a disadvantage kuang and takeuchi 1994 however the local predation strategy promotes to establish groups for survival fraterrigo and rusak 2008 the conclusion contradicts with the previous studies about competitive species liao et al 2016 lu and peng 2017 the reason behind may be explained from two points firstly the predators will propagate only when they hunt preys and the preys can only send its offspring to its near empty habitats it means the local predation strategy are more effective ying et al 2014 another important reason is that the global predation strategy will lead to great extent dispersion of the invasive species as a result the native species will slow down extinction because of relatively weaker interspecific competition intensity miller et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 the conclusion we obtained here is consistent with johst et al 2002 who found that the long range dispersal can shorten the time to extinction by using an utterly different method in their study for a long time many people think that the spatial pattern formed by dispersal and local interaction can increase the probability of the coexistence of species ying et al 2014 detto and muller landau 2016 however we here find only the moderate spatial distribution of the species can promote the coexistence when the predators do not hunt purely globally fig 5 only when the spatial distribution of the invasive species is more aggregated than the native species can the invasive species out compete the native species fig 5 a c it is mainly because the aggregated distribution of invasive will reduce the interspecific competitive intensity then the invasive species will have relatively enough time to reproduce wiener and tuljapurkar 1994 the spatial distribution has no influence on the invasive results when the predators hunt purely globally fig 5d the conclusion is consistent with the previous studies ying et al 2014 some invasive events in real world can be explained by this model for example two kinds of species called hyphantria cunea drury and hemiberlesia pitysophila takagi invaded china successfully in the 1970s one common feature of the two specie is that they can reproduce locally by crawling or flight ruiting et al 2013 the feature will lead to the aggregated distribution of invasive species so that the probability of invading successfully will increase fig 5 a c previous studies found evidence that species traits such as growth rate and competitive rank could predict the effects of disturbance on species persistence and hence diversity haddad et al 2008 moreover miller et al 2012 found that the dispersal distance will change the coexistence under the same disturbance dramatically the first kind of disturbance cannot eliminate the invasive species on one hand this kind of disturbance can promote the coexistence of the native and invasive species fig 6 a1 a4 for this kind of disturbance the moderate aggregated distribution may lead to the coexistence of the two species liao et al 2016 johst and drechsler 2003 pointed that the correlation of patch destruction would increase the mean time to extinct the reason mainly is that the destructive disturbances can kill the native and invasive species simultaneously consequently the interspecific competition intensity is impaired and both the native and invasive species will have more opportunities to survive a good case in point is that the type q bemisia tabaci invaded into china in 2003 but type b bemisia tabaci has become the dominant species gradually the two kinds of bemisia tabaci still coexist even though type b bemisia tabaci has competitive edge teng et al 2010 luo et al 2010 pointed out that the using of pesticides accelerated this transmission on the other hand this kind of disturbance may also accelerate the extinction of the native species luo et al 2010 ruiting et al 2013 for example crofton weed rapidly spread in china s guizhou province in 2010 because of the unprecedented drought the drought can kill the both native and invasive species while drought and the using of pesticides can be seen as the first kind of disturbance the moderate spatial distributions of the targeted introductory disturbance can eliminate the invasive species fig 6b1 b4 the reason can be analyzed like this the introduced species can accelerate the extinction of invasive species by interspecific competition meanwhile too aggregated distribution can only accelerate the extinction locally and too scattered distribution has little influence on the death of the invasive species the native species chouioia cunea in china was introduced into some cities to control the invasion of hyphantria cunea drury the invasive species have been eliminated in several cities such as qingdao shanghai and so on yang et al 2006 and they found that once large numbers of the parasitoid population were achieved through the release of the parasitoid the pest will be efficiently under control recently another experiment discloses that aggressive invader aedes albopictus can be nearly eliminated by introducing the native mosquitos infected by a kind of bacteria named wolbachia zheng et al 2019 our models also support the enemy release hypothesis erh which considers that the species which kill the invasive species is an important regulatory factor for the stability of biological systems keane 2002 colautti et al 2004 petraitis et al 1989 pointed out that with the increase of the disturbance s extent a curve with multiple peaks which reflect the relation of species diversity and disturbance is possible for the targeted introductory disturbance with fixed spatial structure fig 6 and fig 7 obtain the same result our results also show that increasing the extent of disturbance is not always the optimal strategy for the control of invasion spatial connectivity of disturbance also has profound influence on the invasive results fig 6 we find that intermediate disturbance will maximize species diversity fig 6 the intermediate disturbance hypothesis idh states that species diversity reaches its maximum at the intermediate extent of disturbance banitz et al 2008 dos santos et al 2011 liao et al 2016 thomson et al 2017 our results obtained here favor this hypothesis it can give us some inspiration on the control of biological invasions the second kind of disturbance is a better method to maintain species diversity and the disturbance favored the coexistence of two competitive species with global hunting strategies banitz et al 2008 liao et al 2016 thomson et al 2017 see fig 6d1 d2 previous studies have discovered that apart from correlated patch destruction dispersal can amplify spatial correlation of local population dynamics due to immigrants arriving from other populations ripa 2000 johst and drechsler 2003 in this study the predation strategies can change the invasion results even though the invasive species have the same invasive conditions fig 4 6 the invasive species with global hunting has less probability to invade successfully and also has greater probability to be eliminated we conclude that the invasive species with a relatively well predation capacity of local hunting may be a stronger competing species so for the invasive species we can prevent the invasion by controlling their global reproduction in a system with a clumped patch distribution short range dispersal allowed a sufficient colonization of regenerated patches in the clusters and a higher survival during dispersal than long range dispersal doak et al 1992 adler and nuernberger 1994 johst et al 2002 thomson et al 2017 periodicity of disturbance can also influence invasive results sousa 1984 zhang and shea 2011 shorter periodicity benefits the control of invasion fig 7 it is mainly because the urgent disturbances will not give the invasive species enough time to establish groups for survival fraterrigo and rusak 2008 liao et al 2016 form fig 6 and fig 7 we can see that the longer periodicity not only reduces the coexistent probability of native and invasive species but also reduces the probability to eliminate the native species thoroughly so the early detection and early prevention is important brontispa longissima gestro invaded china s hainan province in the 1890s but no strategies are adopted initially as a result it is hard to control the pest now lu and peng 2017 the interval is also considered in the experiment on controlling aedes albopictus by introducing the native mosquitos infected by wolbachia zheng et al 2019 5 conclusion in this study a mechanistic framework is elaborated to demonstrate that the initial density initial spatial structure of species and the two kinds of disturbance have potential to alter invasive outcomes in an exploitative competition food web some invasive events are explained by our model however our model still has some limitations we just considered native and invasive species having same predation capacities further studies could consider different predation capacities of them and we do not consider the intraspecific competition in fact the intraspecific competition is a critical factor for the dynamics of biosystem furthermore we only studied this in theory the role of spatial disturbance will require experimental studies to estimate the relative contributions on the control of invasion despite these limitations our theoretical model mainly raises two specific predictions from the influence of disturbance 1 to eliminate the invasive species introducing native species is a better method the management of the introduced species is also important 2 early detection and early prevention are critical on the invasive control other food webs shown in fig 1 also can be analyzed by this method credit author statement shipeng nie investigation writing original draft preparation software weide

a broad range of biologically realistic parameter combinations to explore the influence of spatial structure of species and disturbance on the invasive results of an exploitative food web some other representative parameter combinations are used in this appendix here fig a 1 and a 2 show the influence of initial densities of native and invasive species on the food web the meaning is same to fig 4 as is shown in fig a 1 and a 2 three results may same to fig 4 the native species 2 will be out competed the invasive species 3 will be out competed and the coexistence of native and invasive species higher initial density of native species 2 will prevent the invasion species 3 can invade successfully with better local hunting strategy species 2 and species 3 have greater probability to coexist when their global hunting capacity is better fig a 3 a 4 show the influence of initially spatial stricture of native and invasive species on the food web same to fig 5 the spatial structure has no influence on the invasive results when the two species hunt globally only when the initially spatial distribution of species 3 is less aggregated than species 2 can species 3 will invade successfully or coexist with species 2 the influence on the invasive results of two kinks of disturbances is simulated in fig a 5 the initial densities and spatial distributions of the native and invasive species are ρ 2 q 2 2 0 31 and ρ 3 q 3 3 0 26 the first kind of disturbance has little influence on the invasive results no matter which predation strategies will be adopted by the two species the second kind of disturbance can change the invasive results dramatically the spatial structure of disturbance has lighter and lighter influence on the invasive outcomes as the global predation capacity increases fig a 6 a 8 show the influence of the periodicity of disturbance for the first kind of disturbance the shorter periodicities of disturbances can increase the coexistent probability of species 2 and species 3 for another kind of disturbance the shorter periodicities of disturbances can promote the extinction of species 3 same to fig 6 and a 5 the spatial structure of disturbance has lighter and lighter influence on the invasive outcomes as the global predation capacity increases lots of combination of those parameters can meet the biological realism and the existence of stable non trivial solutions of the equation 1 11 all the results given here have qualitative robustness and representativeness for all parameter combinations examined our conclusions obtained in this study are not

heat and landslides which have been increasing due to global warming ipcc 2014 such action depends on effective adaptation and mitigation measures vegetated shallow regions have recently been revealed to absorb and capture carbon dioxide by submerged aquatic vegetation a potential sink of anthropogenic carbon termed blue carbon duarte et al 2013 nellmann 2009 showed the effectiveness of the net absorption of co2 by blue carbon ecosystems and it has been demonstrated that about 55 of the carbon fixed by photosynthetic activity on the earth is in the form of blue carbon seagrass beds or meadows capture and store autochthonous carbon from primary production and allochthonous carbon loaded from other areas during the renewal of their epigeal stem and rhizome biomass kennedy et al 2010 fourqurean et al 2012 therefore there is the possibility that co2 is captured and stored in large amounts in shallow water areas dominated by submerged aquatic vegetation macreadie et al 2019 for example beer et al 1997 demonstrated that eelgrass plays a great role in carbon fixation and palacios et al 2007 also demonstrated that seagrass meadows can be absorb co2 from the atmosphere however short 1999 indicated the difficulty in predicting the impact of global climate change effects on seagrass communities as it remains unclear how photosynthesis and the productivity of aquatic plants will react to changes in the physical conditions of aquatic ecosystems under a changing environment tada et al 2018 demonstrated the potential for application of a three dimensional hydrodynamic model to evaluate the release and absorption of co2 by eelgrass zostera marina in komuke lagoon of hokkaido island in japan shintani and nakayama 2010 nakayama et al 2012 2014 nakayama et al 2016 nakayama et al 2019 in this study an attempt was made to model dissolved inorganic carbon dic by simulating the effect of respiration and photosynthesis by eelgrass where the co2 concentrations were estimated from dic total alkalinity ta water temperature and salinity by assuming a chemical equilibrium state per zeebe et al 2001 as a result while dic in this lagoon varied in the range 300 μmol c kg 1 to 1300 μmol c kg 1 photosynthesis was found to exceed respiration which resulted in an estimated sink for dic of 325 μmol c kg 1 tada et al 2018 additionally tada et al 2018 showed that the influence of water temperature on photosynthesis and respiration should be included in numerical models of dic dynamics due to its significance controlling eelgrass productivity growth due to photosynthesis in eelgrass has been investigated in many previous studies based on photon flux density often termed photosynthetically active irradiance par estimates see review by lee et al 2007 a jassby type equation was found to fit to growth rates in laboratory and field experiments drew et al 1979 goodman et al 1995 holmer et al 2001 marsh et al 1986 olesen et al 1993 touchette 1999 zimmerman et al 1995 1997 however the best model resoloving dic changes in relation to photon flux density remains unresolved for investigating the effect of eelgrass photosynthesis on dic dynamics it is necessary to measure daily changes in photon flux density since dic decreases greatly due to photosynthesis during the daytime with a smaller increase in dic due to respiration during the night therefore the duration of photon flux density has been shown to be more important than the light compensation point and light saturation point in evaluating eelgrass production rates dennison et al 1982 1985 additionally tada et al 2018 revealed that accurate topography must also be resolved for evaluating variability in dic based on predictions using a three dimensional hydrodynamic model overall spatial distributions in underwater photon flux density nutrients turbidity and physical conditions have all been revealed to contribute strongly to the net growth of eelgrass dennison et al 1986 beyond depth as a primary determinant of growth turbidity plays a great role in the photosynthesis of submerged aquatic vegetation as it increases light attenuation and reduces the photon flux density which results in suppression of the growth of eelgrass dennison 1987 moore et al 1997 this turbidity effect on productivity could be due to the effect of algal blooms reducing the effective underwater photon flux density due to a high water column light extinction rate borum 1985 or due to excessive sediments brough about from inflows or resuspension adams et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to develop a dic model which can resolve changes in photon flux density precisely from the viewpoint of the suppression of photon flux density due to high turbidity or algae blooms the effect of eelgrass photosynthesis on dic has be shown to create site specific patterns for example in previous studies the minimum light requirement has been investigated showing large variability from 5 to about 40 of the maximum irradiance dennison et al al 1993 koch et al 1996 olesen et al 1993 additionally the optimal growth temperature of eelgrass has been shown to range broadly from 13 c to 24 c in temperate zones boström et al 2004 ibarra obando et al 1987 lee et al 2005 2006 moore et al 1996 sand jensen 1975 sfrisoet al 1998 watanabe et al 2005 in tropical or subtropical zones the optimal growth temperature of eelgrass has been shown to range from 16 c to 30 c biebl et al 1971 cabello pasini et al 2003 dennison 1987 drew 1979 evans et al 1986 marsh et al 1986 penhale 1977 therefore it is necessary to model the effects of eelgrass photosynthesis and respiration on dic dynamics in order to reflect regional characteristics under different climates related to respiration and photosynthesis of eelgrass it has been revealed that seagrass growth and production can be limited by nutrients even though photon flux density is plentiful coleman et al 1994 dennison et al 1987 iizumi and hattori 1982 murray et al 1992 orth 1977 orth et al 1983 short et al 1995 thursby et al 1982 van lent et al 1995 williams et al 1993 there are many studies that have related the growth rate of eelgrass to nutrient supply from the roots boström et al 2004 dennison et al 1987 iizumi et al 1982 jørgensen 1982 mazzella et al 1986 moore et al 1996 pedersen et al 1993 short 1987 the contribution of sediment nutrients to eelgrass growth rates has been found to be equal or be more than that from the water column short et al 1984 pedersen et al 1992 furthermore capone 1982 showed that nutrient concentrations vary greatly due to the presence of eelgrass and nutrient pools have been shown to have rapid turnover rates however burkholder et al 1992 1994 demonstrated that high nutrient enrichment inhibited eelgrass growth due to carbon limitation phosphorus limitation or other internal nutrient imbalances leading to physiological effects burkholder et al 1992 1994 zimmerman et al 1987 demonstrated the application of a numerical model to evaluate how nutrients affect the ecological functions of eelgrass including respiration and photosynthesis therefore in the context of nutrient supply it can again be said that it is necessary to develop a detailed and precise submerged aquatic vegetation model for evaluating co2 flux aside from light photosynthesis parameters change seasonally due to differences in growth rate and water temperatures dennison 1987 orth et al 1986 phillips et al 1983 with water temperature considered the primary factor controlling seasonal growth bulthuis 1987 setchell 1929 martin et al 2006 showed that net co2 flux increases with the seasonal increase in water temperatures in the bay of brest western brittany france with similar patterns in net o2 flux however very limited studies have investigated how this temperature variability affects dic fluxes as submerged aquatic vegetation tends to grow best in calm stratified coastal areas such as enclosed bays and lagoons methods resolving the interaction between hydrodynamics vegetation and carbon are required for application to these types of ecosystems therefore this study aims to investigate thermal effects considering irradiance on changes in dic fluxes under nutrient rich non limiting conditions we develop a simplified and practical model to understand dic dynamics based on easily measurable experimental data that can be applied to estimate seasonal productivity the model is verified through application to komuke lagoon japan where it is used to estimate carbon uptake by eelgrass 2 method 2 1 laboratory experiments komuke lagoon is connected to the sea of okhotsk through a tidal inlet and has a volume of approximately 3333 000 m3 and a maximum water depth of 3 m fig 1 although the tidal range of the sea of okhotsk is approximately 1 m the tidal range of komuke lagoon is only 0 5 m because of the narrow 15 m width of the tidal inlet for this reason calm water conditions are usual in komuke lagoon and the eelgrass population is widely distributed a laboratory experiment evaluating photosynthesis was conducted with lagoon water and eelgrass collected on the 25th of june 2018 at the sampling point 44 15 7 3 e 143 30 38 9 n shown in fig 1 the experiment was conducted outdoors in fine weather using a transparent acrylic water tank with a depth of 150 cm a width of 20 cm and a length of 20 cm fig 2 four shoots of eelgrasses taken from the lagoon were deployed in the water tank the roots of the eelgrass were covered with vinyl sheets to avoid oxygen consumption by oxygen demanding substances contained in the sediment the salinity of the water used in the experiment was 22 psu the dimensions leaf width length and thickness of eelgrass used in experiment were measured before experimentation table 1 two thermometers eijkelkamp co ltd sera diver and two light quantum loggers jfe advantec co ltd defi2 l were deployed in the water tank recording every ten minutes the experiment started at night when photosynthesis was inactive and continued for twenty four hours to provide vertically uniform conditions for eelgrass in the water tank the water was well mixed using a peristatic pump with a flow rate of 7 ml min 1 through a silicon tube with a diameter of 2 mm the water was gently taken from an inlet at a height of 100 cm from the tank bottom through the silicon tube and discharged from an outlet at a height of 0 cm from the tank bottom the uniformity of water quality profiles in the water tank was confirmed by measuring temperatures periodically approximately 200 ml water samples were taken from the water tank into a scott duran bottle by syringe and tube apparatus every hour after sampling 200 μl of a saturated aqueous solution of mercuric chloride was quickly added to the sample to prevent biological activity dic and ta of the water sample was then measured using a total alkalinity meter kimoto electronic co ltd att 15 within 2 h of sampling titrant for volumetric analysis kanto kagaku co ltd 0 1 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid was used for dic and ta measurement by high accuracy titration additionally a water tank experiment under the same conditions but without eelgrass was conducted as a control experiment concentrations of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and po4 p in water samples were measured for each experiment using an auto analyzer bltec co ltd quaatro 2hr the wet weight dry weight and carbon content of four eelgrass used in the laboratory experiment were measured separately for leaves and stems dry weight was measured after heating by an electric oven at 105 c for 24 h approximately 2 mg of dried sample was ground using a mortar and pestle and elemental carbon content analyzed using a chns analyzer parkin elmer co ltd 2400ii in chn mode to estimate eelgrass biomass 2 2 evaluation of coefficients of nep model photon flux density and water temperature were measured every 10 min the 10 minute data were converted to 1 hour interval data nitrogen and phosphorus could limit eelgrass respiration and photosynthesis when sediment water nh 4 no 3 no 2 and po 4 3 concentrations are lower than 0 1 0 5 and 0 03 μm respectively lee et al 2007 we confirmed that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were sufficient and didn t limit the eelgrass respiration and photosynthesis table 2 therefore in this study we decided to apply eq 1 for modeling net ecosystem production by eelgrass nep taking into account photon flux density and water temperature a jassby type equation and arrhenius equation were applied to simulate photosynthesis related to photon flux density and water temperature staehr et al 2011 beca carretero et al 2018 burkholz et al 2019 where nepr refers to net ecosystem production due to respiration by eelgrass and nepp to net ecosystem production due to photosynthesis by eelgrass 1 d d t dic δ dic r a exp e a r t w r p ψ tanh α ψ i p ψ r p exp e a p t w r

parameter for photosynthesis eap m2 kg s 2 is the activation energy for photosynthesis firstly the parameters for the respiration term in eq 1 ra μ mol kg 1 h 1 and ear were obtained using the fact that photosynthesis activity is negligible from sunset to sunrise when photon flux density is zero we calculated δdic under three water temperatures 12 c 20 c and 24 c in order to evaluate the effect of the change in water temperature on eelgrass respiration in dark conditions secondly the parameters for photosynthesis was obtained by considering photon flux density and using the ra and ear for nepr thirdly we proposed an eelgrass seasonal net ecosystem production snep model using the photon flux density duration recorded in the field finally we applied the snep model to estimate changes in dic due to eelgrass in komuke lagoon 3 results 3 1 biological characteristics of eelgrass the dry weight and biomass carbon content of eelgrass used in the laboratory experiment are shown in table 1 and nutrient concentrations in the lagoon water are shown in table 2 the biomass shown in table 1 was based on the carbon content per unit leaf area calculated from the elemental carbon content and measured size of eelgrass it should be noted that one data point was not available due to a measurement error mean leaf biomass was about 288 g c using the leaf area of both sides of the leaf m2 although the concentration of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and po4 p decreased during the experiment photosynthetic rates were not limited by nutrients because concentrations remained sufficiently high lee et al 2007 3 2 thermal effect on nep partial pressures of carbon dioxide in water fco2 started increasing at 8 00 pm on the 25th of june and fco2 decreased from 5 00 am on the 26th dic changed in a pattern similar to fco2 fig 3 in contrast to the eelgrass experiments in the control tank dic was almost constant which suggests that water column photosynthesis and respiration due to organisms other than eelgrass such as phytoplankton were negligible in terms of changes in dic also since ta changed only slightly we found that the eelgrass predominantly affected dic rather than ta the maximum photon flux density occurred at 11 00 am on the 26th when water temperature had increased from 12 to 27 c δdic nep μmol kg 1 h 1 was negative from 5 00 am on the 25th to 5 00 pm on the 26th which demonstrated positive net ecosystem production fig 3f when nep was plotted against photon flux density nep values showed different tendencies below and above 250 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 red circles in fig 4 indicate 5 samples from 7 00 am to 11 00 am on the 26th and green circles indicate 5 samples from 0 00 pm to 4 00 pm on the 26th red and green circle samples were sampled under mean water temperature of 16 c and 25 c respectively therefore it is noted that mean water temperature is a key factor controlling the tendencies of nep which suggests the development of a nepp parameterization needs to include the effect of water temperature in eq 1 3 3 estimation of coefficients of nepr values for ra and ear were obtained by assuming that δdic represents nepr from 7 00 pm of the 25th to 3 00 am of the 26th and from 6 00 pm to 7 00 pm of the 26th when photosynthetic activity is negligible fig 5 it should be noted that only data with the condition δdic 0 was applied because the respiration term nepr should be higher than zero since δdic from the 25th to 26th of june in 2018 was obtained when the water temperature was about 20 c we conducted separate laboratory experiments on the 10th of september 2018 with different water temperature conditions finally 9 validated samples were obtained in which a significant difference was confirmed to exist at the 5 level using a kruskal wallis test although there are some fluctuations evident in fig 5 parameters for respiration could be obtained based on strong relationships with water temperature ra 1 04 1017 μmol kg 1 h 1 and ear 1 52 10 19 m2 kg s 2 with r2 0 68 3 4 estimation of coefficients of nepp by applying ra 1 04 1017 μ mol kg 1 h 1 and ear 1 52 10 19 m2 kg s 2 into nepr of eq 1 nepp was obtained using eq 2 2 nepp δ dic nepr δ dic r a exp e a r t w r and the relationship between photon flux density and nepp is shown in fig 6 to investigate thermal dependence of eelgrass photosynthesis a value that ignores thermal

200 m2 s kg 1 h 1 comparison between nepp and nepp not revealed a large difference in the tendencies between afternoon green and morning red conditions red circles represented water samples from temperatures ranging from 12 to 20 c and green circles from 22 to 27 c the higher the water temperature the larger the nepp and vice versa which is similar to the differences in the tendencies of nepr therefore an attempt was made to correct for the effect of temperature on the parameters for photosynthetic activity rp and eap using nepp nepp not fig 7 4 nepp nep p n o t r p exp e a p t w r where rp 2 30 107 and eap 0 69 10 19 m2 kg s 2 were obtained with good agreement r 2 0 92 to test whether water temperature and nepp nepp not originate from the same distribution we applied a kruskal wallis test at the 5 level significant differences were confirmed between water temperature and nepp nepp not thus we obtained parameters for eq 1 as ra 1 04 1017 μmol kg 1 h 1 ear 1 52 10 19 m2 kg s 2 pψ 21 5 μmol kg 1 h 1 α ψ 21 5 200 m2 s kg 1 h 1 rp 2 30 107 and eap 0 69 10 19 m2 kg s 2 3 5 proposal of the snep model eq 1 can not only be applied to analyze local scale nep for example though coupling with a three dimensional hydrodynamic model but it can also be applied to estimate the long term seasonal change in dic in enclosed waterbodies to this end we propose a method to estimate seasonal net ecosystem production snep by adapting eq 1 to estimate snep it is necessary to include the hourly change in dic dennison et al 1982 1985 and snep is defined by integrating eq 1 for one day 5 snep r a 1 t 1 d a y exp e a r t w r d t p ψ 1 t 1 d a y r p tanh α ψ β i i s p ψ exp e a p t w r d t where t 1 day is the integration period 24 h βi is the effectiveness coefficient 0 no photon flux density to 1 maximum photon flux density and is is the photon flux density at water surface by assuming that water temperature changes sinusoidally 6 t w t m t h t m t h 0 sin 2 π 24 t π 2 eq 5 can be simplified to 7 snep r a exp e a r t m r γ r p ψ exp e a p t m r γ p where 8 γ r 1 t 1 d a y exp e a r t h t m 2 r d t 9 γ p 1 t 1 d a y tanh α ψ β i i s p ψ exp e a p t h t m 2 r d t where tm celsius degree is the daily mean water temperature th tw tm th 0 is the amplitude of water temperature in a day and t h is the time from 0 to 24 h it should be noted that it is necessary to include the influence of topographical and tidal effects on a specific location because the photon flux density reaching the canopy may change significantly due to changes in bathymetry and tides these effects can be included by changing the value of βi which is the parameter for attenuation of photon flux density and is a function of the extinction coefficient for light attenuation dennison et al 1986 to estimate and project dissolved oxygen do over the bottom in an enclosed bay nakayama et al 2010 demonstrated the suitability of a conceptual do model by taking into account residence time between the inside of the bay and the outer ocean okada and nakayama 2007 okada et al 2011 sato et al 2012 this study thus makes an attempt to propose a snep model to estimate dic using the snep approach and accounting for water exchange fig 8 10 v 0 d d t di c s v 0 snep q e q r di c s q e di c o u t q r di c r where dic s μmol kg 1 is the monthly mean dic v 0 m3 is the volume of the lagoon q e m3 s 1 is the exchange flux between a lake and the ocean q r m3 s 1 is the river discharge dic r μmol kg 1 is dic of a river and dic out μmol kg 1 is the typical dic concentration of the ocean we note that this model assumes the net atmospheric exchange of co2 over the period of the calculation is negligible which is supported by estimates from in situ fco2 values by assuming a steady state in eq 10 i e the left term is zero the change in dic s can be obtained as 11 δ di c s di c s t a b l e di c s t s snep 12 t s v 0 q e q r 13 di c s t a b l e q e di c o u t q r di c r q e q r where δdic s μmol kg 1 is the change in dic with nep dic stable μmol kg 1 is dic in a steady state without nep nep 0 and ts h is the residence time of the target domain in other words if we obtain residence time ts and snep the change in dic due to eelgrass can be estimated using eq 11 and used as a measure of system scale carbon uptake 4 discussion in this study we obtained parameters needed to simulate the response of photosynthesis to photon flux density and water temperature based on a jassby type p i equation and an arrhenius equation staehr et al 2011 beca carretero et al 2018 burkholz et al 2019 lee et al 2007 found that laboratory experiments tend to underestimate saturation irradiance because of the usage of leaf segments since we did not remove the roots in our laboratory experiments the saturation irradiance was estimated as 200 μmol m 2 s 1 by pψ not α ψ not where pψ not 21 5 μmol kg 1 h 1 and α ψ not 21 5 200 m2 s kg 1 h 1 the value is larger than the average level of saturation irradiance for leaf segments of zostera marina 116 μmol m 2 s 1 while the average value of saturation irradiance for whole plant is 450 μmol m 2 s 1 lee et al 2007 the rate of change in nep due to photosynthesis and respiration has been shown to increase with increasing water temperature dennison 1987 orth et al 1986 phillips et al 1983 bulthuis 1987 setchell 1929 to understand thermal dependencies nepp nepr and nep were computed by changing water temperatures from 5 c to 30 c using eq 1 fig 9 nepp and nepr increased with the increasing water temperature fig 9a and b when the photon flux density was more than about 250 μ mol m 2 s 1 nepp varied from 8 μ mol kg 1 h 1 to 34 μ mol kg 1 h 1 an increase of 26 μ mol kg 1 h 1 fig 9a in comparison nep under a thermal increase from 5 to 30 c varied from 7 μ mol kg 1 h 1 to 17 μ mol kg 1 h 1 an increase of 10 μ mol kg 1 h 1 fig 9c furthermore when photon flux density was more than 250 μ mol m 2 s 1 nep was almost constant under a thermal increase from 25 to 30 c because the increase in nepr was almost equal to the increase in nepp fig 9c lee et al 2007 revealed that the average value of optimal temperature of zostera marina is about 15 c for growth and 23 c for photosynthesis which is in good agreement with our study with optimal temperatures of about 25 c for photosynthesis we applied the snep model to komuke lagoon to explore the applicability for the evaluation of seasonal changes in dic we referred to the field observations which were conducted in komuke lagoon in may 2013 tada et al 2018 and august 2018 may and august were chosen as target months in order to clarify the seasonal effect of the difference in water temperature between spring and summer firstly γr and γp for snep were estimated from eqs 8 and 9 by giving 5 different βi 100 75 50 25 and 10 table 3 this showed that γp varied greatly with the change in βi in contrast to βi the difference in photon flux density between may and august was negligible and the values for γp were the same between the two seasons since eelgrass meadows exist from the bottom to a water depth of about 1 0 m in komuke lagoon and the extinction coefficient was about 2 0 m 1 including the effect of turbidity with a mean water depth of 2 0 m βi was obtained as 25 using eq 14 14 β i 1 h m 0 l e exp k e h m z d z where hm m is the mean water depth ke m 1 is the extinction coefficient and le m is the deflected vegetation height snep was computed against water temperature tw from βi 0 to βi 100 fig 10 although the snep did not change much from βi 50 to βi 100 snep decreases greatly from βi 50 to βi 0 when βi was 25 a peak in snep appeared at a water temperature of 15 c and snep became negative when the water temperature was more than 28 c watanabe et al 2005 demonstrated that optimal temperature for zostera marina is 16 1 c in akkeshi bay which is located close to komuke lagoon this may suggest the practical applicability of the relatively simple snep model for real field environments tada et al 2018 revealed that dic at the water surface dic s was smaller than the no eelgrass stable condition dic stabl in komuke lagoon on the 15th of may 2013 using a three dimensional hydrodynamic model which shows δdic s dic stabl dic s 325 μ mol kg 1 table 4 the residence time of komuke lagoon was ts 110 h and the mean water temperature was 7 1 c since snep is 2 82 μ mol kg 1 h 1 from fig 10 ts snep can be obtained as 310 μ mol kg 1 therefore the estimated ts snep 310 μ mol kg 1 approximately agreed with δdic s 325 μ mol kg 1 which suggests the applicability of the snep model to an enclosed waterbody when the residence time is known in addition to the estimation of ts snep in may 2013 we conducted water sampling at the water surface in komuke lagoon and measured water temperature salinity and dic in 2018 in order to investigate the applicability of the snep model eq 11 sampling stations are shown in fig 1 it should be noted that we found no significant differences in water quality and flow fields between 2013 and 2018 since komuke lagoon has a very narrow inlet and the okhotsk sea provides stable periodic annual changes in water quality the mean water temperature was 23 5 c which corresponds to snep 2 23 μ mol kg 1 h 1 using βi 25 from fig 10 table 4 as the residence time is about 110 h ts snep was found to be 245 μ mol kg 1 using the low salinity endmember of rivers and the high salinity endmember of the ocean δdic s was estimated as 255 μ mol kg 1 from field observations following zeebe et al 2001 again the estimated ts snep 245 μ mol kg 1 agreed well with δdic s 255 μ mol kg 1 from the field observations the proposed snep model is specific to enclosed or semi enclosed waterbodies and not for suitable for the open ocean because of the requirement to evaluate residence times since eelgrass appears to be adapted to calm conditions and there is the possibility to obtain residence times accurately for these waterbodies this suggests the snep model can be useful to improve predictions of carbon capture and storage by eelgrass populations in protected waters 5 conclusion aiming to understand the nep of eelgrass in komuke lagoon which is located in the east of hokkaido parameters for nepr were obtained as ra 1 04 1017 μ mol kg 1 h 1 and ear 1 52 10 19 m2 kg s 2 using the hourly change in dic without photon flux density in laboratory experiments the photosynthetic activity of eelgrass was confirmed to be affected by water temperature from laboratory experiments and parameters for nepp were obtained as pψ 21 5 μ mol kg 1 h 1 α ψ 21 5 200 m2 s kg 1 h 1 rp 2 30 107 and eap 0 69 10 19 m2 kg s 2 the snep model was proposed in which the seasonal change in dic δdic s can be estimated as ts snep by using the residence time ts the snep model was applied to two sets of field observations from komuke lagoon may 2013 and august 2018 and the estimated seasonal change in dic ts snep was confirmed to agree with δdic s from field observations in other words the seasonal change in nep can be obtained as δdic s ts using the residence time ts and the seasonal change in dic δdic s from endmember analysis using field observations since the development and implementation of mitigation measures against global warming is an urgent issue the proposed snep model in this study may be applied to assist efforts to enhance effective capture and storage of carbon dioxide through seagrass restoration also the snep model may be useful for assessing changes due to climate change e g as a screening tool to investigate

meadows capture and store autochthonous carbon from primary production and allochthonous carbon loaded from other areas during the renewal of their epigeal stem and rhizome biomass kennedy et al 2010 fourqurean et al 2012 therefore there is the possibility that co2 is captured and stored in large amounts in shallow water areas dominated by submerged aquatic vegetation macreadie et al 2019 for example beer et al 1997 demonstrated that eelgrass plays a great role in carbon fixation and palacios et al 2007 also demonstrated that seagrass meadows can be absorb co2 from the atmosphere however short 1999 indicated the difficulty in predicting the impact of global climate change effects on seagrass communities as it remains unclear how photosynthesis and the productivity of aquatic plants will react to changes in the physical conditions of aquatic ecosystems under a changing environment tada et al 2018 demonstrated the potential for application of a three dimensional hydrodynamic model to evaluate the release and absorption of co2 by eelgrass zostera marina in komuke lagoon of hokkaido island in japan shintani and nakayama 2010 nakayama et al 2012 2014 nakayama et al 2016 nakayama et al 2019 in this study an attempt was made to model dissolved inorganic carbon dic by simulating the effect of respiration and photosynthesis by eelgrass where the co2 concentrations were estimated from dic total alkalinity ta water temperature and salinity by assuming a chemical equilibrium state per zeebe et al 2001 as a result while dic in this lagoon varied in the range 300 μmol c kg 1 to 1300 μmol c kg 1 photosynthesis was found to exceed respiration which resulted in an estimated sink for dic of 325 μmol c kg 1 tada et al 2018 additionally tada et al 2018 showed that the influence of water temperature on photosynthesis and respiration should be included in numerical models of dic dynamics due to its significance controlling eelgrass productivity growth due to photosynthesis in eelgrass has been investigated in many previous studies based on photon flux density often termed photosynthetically active irradiance par estimates see review by lee et al 2007 a jassby type equation was found to fit to growth rates in laboratory and field experiments drew et al 1979 goodman et al 1995 holmer et al 2001 marsh et al 1986 olesen et al 1993 touchette 1999 zimmerman et al 1995 1997 however the best model resoloving dic changes in relation to photon flux density remains unresolved for investigating the effect of eelgrass photosynthesis on dic dynamics it is necessary to measure daily changes in photon flux density since dic decreases greatly due to photosynthesis during the daytime with a smaller increase in dic due to respiration during the night therefore the duration of photon flux density has been shown to be more important than the light compensation point and light saturation point in evaluating eelgrass production rates dennison et al 1982 1985 additionally tada et al 2018 revealed that accurate topography must also be resolved for evaluating variability in dic based on predictions using a three dimensional hydrodynamic model overall spatial distributions in underwater photon flux density nutrients turbidity and physical conditions have all been revealed to contribute strongly to the net growth of eelgrass dennison et al 1986 beyond depth as a primary determinant of growth turbidity plays a great role in the photosynthesis of submerged aquatic vegetation as it increases light attenuation and reduces the photon flux density which results in suppression of the growth of eelgrass dennison 1987 moore et al 1997 this turbidity effect on productivity could be due to the effect of algal blooms reducing the effective underwater photon flux density due to a high water column light extinction rate borum 1985 or due to excessive sediments brough about from inflows or resuspension adams et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to develop a dic model which can resolve changes in photon flux density precisely from the viewpoint of the suppression of photon flux density due to high turbidity or algae blooms the effect of eelgrass photosynthesis on dic has be shown to create site specific patterns for example in previous studies the minimum light requirement has been investigated showing large variability from 5 to about 40 of the maximum irradiance dennison et al al 1993 koch et al 1996 olesen et al 1993 additionally the optimal growth temperature of eelgrass has been shown to range broadly from 13 c to 24 c in temperate zones boström et al 2004 ibarra obando et al 1987 lee et al 2005 2006 moore et al 1996 sand jensen 1975 sfrisoet al 1998 watanabe et al 2005 in tropical or subtropical zones the optimal growth temperature of eelgrass has been shown to range from 16 c to 30 c biebl et al 1971 cabello pasini et al 2003 dennison 1987 drew 1979 evans et al 1986 marsh et al 1986 penhale 1977 therefore it is necessary to model the effects of eelgrass photosynthesis and respiration on dic dynamics in order to reflect regional characteristics under different climates related to respiration and photosynthesis of eelgrass it has been revealed that seagrass growth and production can be limited by nutrients even though photon flux density is plentiful coleman et al 1994 dennison et al 1987 iizumi and hattori 1982 murray et al 1992 orth 1977 orth et al 1983 short et al 1995 thursby et al 1982 van lent et al 1995 williams et al 1993 there are many studies that have related the growth rate of eelgrass to nutrient supply from the roots boström et al 2004 dennison et al 1987 iizumi et al 1982 jørgensen 1982 mazzella et al 1986 moore et al 1996 pedersen et al 1993 short 1987 the contribution of sediment nutrients to eelgrass growth rates has been found to be equal or be more than that from the water column short et al 1984 pedersen et al 1992 furthermore capone 1982 showed that nutrient concentrations vary greatly due to the presence of eelgrass and nutrient pools have been shown to have rapid turnover rates however burkholder et al 1992 1994 demonstrated that high nutrient enrichment inhibited eelgrass growth due to carbon limitation phosphorus limitation or other internal nutrient imbalances leading to physiological effects burkholder et al 1992 1994 zimmerman et al 1987 demonstrated the application of a numerical model to evaluate how nutrients affect the ecological functions of eelgrass including respiration and photosynthesis therefore in the context of nutrient supply it can again be said that it is necessary to develop a detailed and precise submerged aquatic vegetation model for evaluating co2 flux aside from light photosynthesis parameters change seasonally due to differences in growth rate and water temperatures dennison 1987 orth et al 1986 phillips et al 1983 with water temperature considered the primary factor controlling seasonal growth bulthuis 1987 setchell 1929 martin et al 2006 showed that net co2 flux increases with the seasonal increase in water temperatures in the bay of brest western brittany france with similar patterns in net o2 flux however very limited studies have investigated how this temperature variability affects dic fluxes as submerged aquatic vegetation tends to grow best in calm stratified coastal areas such as enclosed bays and lagoons methods resolving the interaction between hydrodynamics vegetation and carbon are required for application to these types of ecosystems therefore this study aims to investigate thermal effects considering irradiance on changes in dic fluxes under nutrient rich non limiting conditions we develop a simplified and practical model to understand dic dynamics based on easily measurable experimental data that can be applied to estimate seasonal productivity the model is verified through application to komuke lagoon japan where it is used to estimate carbon uptake by eelgrass 2 method 2 1 laboratory experiments komuke lagoon is connected to the sea of okhotsk through a tidal inlet and has a volume of approximately 3333 000 m3 and a maximum water depth of 3 m fig 1 although the tidal range of the sea of okhotsk is approximately 1 m the tidal range of komuke lagoon is only 0 5 m because of the narrow 15 m width of the tidal inlet for this reason calm water conditions are usual in komuke lagoon and the eelgrass population is widely distributed a laboratory experiment evaluating photosynthesis was conducted with lagoon water and eelgrass collected on the 25th of june 2018 at the sampling point 44 15 7 3 e 143 30 38 9 n shown in fig 1 the experiment was conducted outdoors in fine weather using a transparent acrylic water tank with a depth of 150 cm a width of 20 cm and a length of 20 cm fig 2 four shoots of eelgrasses taken from the lagoon were deployed in the water tank the roots of the eelgrass were covered with vinyl sheets to avoid oxygen consumption by oxygen demanding substances contained in the sediment the salinity of the water used in the experiment was 22 psu the dimensions leaf width length and thickness of eelgrass used in experiment were measured before experimentation table 1 two thermometers eijkelkamp co ltd sera diver and two light quantum loggers jfe advantec co ltd defi2 l were deployed in the water tank recording every ten minutes the experiment started at night when photosynthesis was inactive and continued for twenty four hours to provide vertically uniform conditions for eelgrass in the water tank the water was well mixed using a peristatic pump with a flow rate of 7 ml min 1 through a silicon tube with a diameter of 2 mm the water was gently taken from an inlet at a height of 100 cm from the tank bottom through the silicon tube and discharged from an outlet at a height of 0 cm from the tank bottom the uniformity of water quality profiles in the water tank was confirmed by measuring temperatures periodically approximately 200 ml water samples were taken from the water tank into a scott duran bottle by syringe and tube apparatus every hour after sampling 200 μl of a saturated aqueous solution of mercuric chloride was quickly added to the sample to prevent biological activity dic and ta of the water sample was then measured using a total alkalinity meter kimoto electronic co ltd att 15 within 2 h of sampling titrant for volumetric analysis kanto kagaku co ltd 0 1 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid was used for dic and ta measurement by high accuracy titration additionally a water tank experiment under the same conditions but without eelgrass was conducted as a control experiment concentrations of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and po4 p in water samples were measured for each experiment using an auto analyzer bltec co ltd quaatro 2hr the wet weight dry weight and carbon content of four eelgrass used in the laboratory experiment were measured separately for leaves and stems dry weight was measured after heating by an electric oven at 105 c for 24 h approximately 2 mg of dried sample was ground using a mortar and pestle and elemental carbon content analyzed using a chns analyzer parkin elmer co ltd 2400ii in chn mode to estimate eelgrass biomass 2 2 evaluation of coefficients of nep model photon flux density and water temperature were measured every 10 min the 10 minute data were converted to 1 hour interval data nitrogen and phosphorus could limit eelgrass respiration and photosynthesis when sediment water nh 4 no 3 no 2 and po 4 3 concentrations are lower than 0 1 0 5 and 0 03 μm respectively lee et al 2007 we confirmed that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were sufficient and didn t limit the eelgrass respiration and photosynthesis table 2 therefore in this study we decided to apply eq 1 for modeling net ecosystem production by eelgrass nep taking into account photon flux density and water temperature a jassby type equation and arrhenius equation were applied to simulate photosynthesis related to photon flux density and water temperature staehr et al 2011 beca carretero et al 2018 burkholz et al 2019 where nepr refers to net ecosystem production due to respiration by eelgrass and nepp to net ecosystem production due to photosynthesis by eelgrass 1 d d t dic δ dic r a exp e a r t w r p ψ tanh α ψ i p ψ r p exp e a p t w r

parameter for photosynthesis eap m2 kg s 2 is the activation energy for photosynthesis firstly the parameters for the respiration term in eq 1 ra μ mol kg 1 h 1 and ear were obtained using the fact that photosynthesis activity is negligible from sunset to sunrise when photon flux density is zero we calculated δdic under three water temperatures 12 c 20 c and 24 c in order to evaluate the effect of the change in water temperature on eelgrass respiration in dark conditions secondly the parameters for photosynthesis was obtained by considering photon flux density and using the ra and ear for nepr thirdly we proposed an eelgrass seasonal net ecosystem production snep model using the photon flux density duration recorded in the field finally we applied the snep model to estimate changes in dic due to eelgrass in komuke lagoon 3 results 3 1 biological characteristics of eelgrass the dry weight and biomass carbon content of eelgrass used in the laboratory experiment are shown in table 1 and nutrient concentrations in the lagoon water are shown in table 2 the biomass shown in table 1 was based on the carbon content per unit leaf area calculated from the elemental carbon content and measured size of eelgrass it should be noted that one data point was not available due to a measurement error mean leaf biomass was about 288 g c using the leaf area of both sides of the leaf m2 although the concentration of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and po4 p decreased during the experiment photosynthetic rates were not limited by nutrients because concentrations remained sufficiently high lee et al 2007 3 2 thermal effect on nep partial pressures of carbon dioxide in water fco2 started increasing at 8 00 pm on the 25th of june and fco2 decreased from 5 00 am on the 26th dic changed in a pattern similar to fco2 fig 3 in contrast to the eelgrass experiments in the control tank dic was almost constant which suggests that water column photosynthesis and respiration due to organisms other than eelgrass such as phytoplankton were negligible in terms of changes in dic also since ta changed only slightly we found that the eelgrass predominantly affected dic rather than ta the maximum photon flux density occurred at 11 00 am on the 26th when water temperature had increased from 12 to 27 c δdic nep μmol kg 1 h 1 was negative from 5 00 am on the 25th to 5 00 pm on the 26th which demonstrated positive net ecosystem production fig 3f when nep was plotted against photon flux density nep values showed different tendencies below and above 250 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 red circles in fig 4 indicate 5 samples from 7 00 am to 11 00 am on the 26th and green circles indicate 5 samples from 0 00 pm to 4 00 pm on the 26th red and green circle samples were sampled under mean water temperature of 16 c and 25 c respectively therefore it is noted that mean water temperature is a key factor controlling the tendencies of nep which suggests the development of a nepp parameterization needs to include the effect of water temperature in eq 1 3 3 estimation of coefficients of nepr values for ra and ear were obtained by assuming that δdic represents nepr from 7 00 pm of the 25th to 3 00 am of the 26th and from 6 00 pm to 7 00 pm of the 26th when photosynthetic activity is negligible fig 5 it should be noted that only data with the condition δdic 0 was applied because the respiration term nepr should be higher than zero since δdic from the 25th to 26th of june in 2018 was obtained when the water temperature was about 20 c we conducted separate laboratory experiments on the 10th of september 2018 with different water temperature conditions finally 9 validated samples were obtained in which a significant difference was confirmed to exist at the 5 level using a kruskal wallis test although there are some fluctuations evident in fig 5 parameters for respiration could be obtained based on strong relationships with water temperature ra 1 04 1017 μmol kg 1 h 1 and ear 1 52 10 19 m2 kg s 2 with r2 0 68 3 4 estimation of coefficients of nepp by applying ra 1 04 1017 μ mol kg 1 h 1 and ear 1 52 10 19 m2 kg s 2 into nepr of eq 1 nepp was obtained using eq 2 2 nepp δ dic nepr δ dic r a exp e a r t w r and the relationship between photon flux density and nepp is shown in fig 6 to investigate thermal dependence of eelgrass photosynthesis a value that ignores thermal effects nepp not was plotted against photon flux density using eq 3 solid lines in fig 6 3 nep p n o t p ψ tanh α ψ i p ψ when the parameters are given as pψ not 21 5 μmol kg 1 h 1 and α ψ not 21 5 200 m2 s kg 1 h 1 comparison between nepp and nepp not revealed a large difference in the tendencies between afternoon green and morning red conditions red circles represented water samples from temperatures ranging from 12 to 20 c and green circles from 22 to 27 c the higher the water temperature the larger the nepp and vice versa which is similar to the differences in the tendencies of nepr therefore an attempt was made to correct for the effect of temperature on the parameters for photosynthetic activity rp and eap using nepp nepp not fig 7 4 nepp nep p n o t r p exp e a p t w r where rp 2 30 107 and eap 0 69 10 19 m2 kg s 2 were obtained with good agreement r 2 0 92 to test whether water temperature and nepp nepp not originate from the same distribution we applied a kruskal wallis test at the 5 level significant differences were confirmed between water temperature and nepp nepp not thus we obtained parameters for eq 1 as ra 1 04 1017 μmol kg 1 h 1 ear 1 52 10 19 m2 kg s 2 pψ 21 5 μmol kg 1 h 1 α ψ 21 5 200 m2 s kg 1 h 1 rp 2 30 107 and eap 0 69 10 19 m2 kg s 2 3 5 proposal of the snep model eq 1 can not only be applied to analyze local scale nep for example though coupling with a three dimensional hydrodynamic model but it can also be applied to estimate the long term seasonal change in dic in enclosed waterbodies to this end we propose a method to estimate seasonal net ecosystem production snep by adapting eq 1 to estimate snep it is necessary to include the hourly change in dic dennison et al 1982 1985 and snep is defined by integrating eq 1 for one day 5 snep r a 1 t 1 d a y exp e a r t w r d t p ψ 1 t 1 d a y r p tanh α ψ β i i s p ψ exp e a p t w r d t where t 1 day is the integration period 24 h βi is the effectiveness coefficient 0 no photon flux density to 1 maximum photon flux density and is is the photon flux density at water surface by assuming that water temperature changes sinusoidally 6 t w t m t h t m t h 0 sin 2 π 24 t π 2 eq 5 can be simplified to 7 snep r a exp e a r t m r γ r p ψ exp e a p t m r γ p where 8 γ r 1 t 1 d a y exp e a r t h t m 2 r d t 9 γ p 1 t 1 d a y tanh α ψ β i i s p ψ exp e a p t h t m 2 r d t where tm celsius degree is the daily mean water temperature th tw tm th 0 is the amplitude of water temperature in a day and t h is the time from 0 to 24 h it should be noted that it is necessary to include the influence of topographical and tidal effects on a specific location because the photon flux density reaching the canopy may change significantly due to changes in bathymetry and tides these effects can be included by changing the value of βi which is the parameter for attenuation of photon flux density and is a function of the extinction coefficient for light attenuation dennison et al 1986 to estimate and project dissolved oxygen do over the bottom in an enclosed bay nakayama et al 2010 demonstrated the suitability of a conceptual do model by taking into account residence time between the inside of the bay and the outer ocean okada and nakayama 2007 okada et al 2011 sato et al 2012 this study thus makes an attempt to propose a snep model to estimate dic using the snep approach and accounting for water exchange fig 8 10 v 0 d d t di c s v 0 snep q e q r di c s q e di c o u t q r di c r where dic s μmol kg 1 is the monthly mean dic v 0 m3 is the volume of the lagoon q e m3 s 1 is the exchange flux between a lake and the ocean q r m3 s 1 is the river discharge dic r μmol kg 1 is dic of a river and dic out μmol kg 1 is the typical dic concentration of the ocean we note that this model assumes the net atmospheric exchange of co2 over the period of the calculation is negligible which is supported by estimates from in situ fco2 values by assuming a steady state in eq 10 i e the left term is zero the change in dic s can be obtained as 11 δ di c s di c s t a b l e di c s t s snep 12 t s v 0 q e q r 13 di c s t a b l e q e di c o u t q r di c r q e q r where δdic s μmol kg 1 is the change in dic with nep dic stable μmol kg 1 is dic in a steady state without nep nep 0 and ts h is the residence time of the target domain in other words if we obtain residence time ts and snep the change in dic due to eelgrass can be estimated using eq 11 and used as a measure of system scale carbon uptake 4 discussion in this study we obtained parameters needed to simulate the response of photosynthesis to photon flux density and water temperature based on a jassby type p i equation and an arrhenius equation staehr et al 2011 beca carretero et al 2018 burkholz et al 2019 lee et al 2007 found that laboratory experiments tend to underestimate saturation irradiance because of the usage of leaf segments since we did not remove the roots in our laboratory experiments the saturation irradiance was estimated as 200 μmol m 2 s 1 by pψ not α ψ not where pψ not 21 5 μmol kg 1 h 1 and α ψ not 21 5 200 m2 s kg 1 h 1 the value is larger than the average level of saturation irradiance for leaf segments of zostera marina 116 μmol m 2 s 1 while the average value of saturation irradiance for whole plant is 450 μmol m 2 s 1 lee et al 2007 the rate of change in nep due to photosynthesis and respiration has been shown to increase with increasing water temperature dennison 1987 orth et al 1986 phillips et al 1983 bulthuis 1987 setchell 1929 to understand thermal dependencies nepp nepr and nep were computed by changing water temperatures from 5 c to 30 c using eq 1 fig 9 nepp and nepr increased with the increasing water temperature fig 9a and b when the photon flux density was more than about 250 μ mol m 2 s 1 nepp varied from 8 μ mol kg 1 h 1 to 34 μ mol kg 1 h 1 an increase of 26 μ mol kg 1 h 1 fig 9a in comparison nep under a thermal increase from 5 to 30 c varied from 7 μ mol kg 1 h 1 to 17 μ mol kg 1 h 1 an increase of 10 μ mol kg 1 h 1 fig 9c furthermore when photon flux density was more than 250 μ mol m 2 s 1 nep was almost constant under a thermal increase from 25 to 30 c because the increase in nepr was almost equal to the increase in nepp fig 9c lee et al 2007 revealed that the average value of optimal temperature of zostera marina is about 15 c for growth and 23 c for photosynthesis which is in good agreement with our study with optimal temperatures of about 25 c for photosynthesis we applied the snep model to komuke lagoon to explore the applicability for the evaluation of seasonal changes in dic we referred to the field observations which were conducted in komuke lagoon in may 2013 tada et al 2018 and august 2018 may and august were chosen as target months in order to clarify the seasonal effect of the difference in water temperature between spring and summer firstly γr and γp for snep were estimated from eqs 8 and 9 by giving 5 different βi 100 75 50 25 and 10 table 3 this showed that γp varied greatly with the change in βi in contrast to βi the difference in photon flux density between may and august was negligible and the values for γp were the same between the two seasons since eelgrass meadows exist from the bottom to a water depth of about 1 0 m in komuke lagoon and the extinction coefficient was about 2 0 m 1 including the effect of turbidity with a mean water depth of 2 0 m βi was obtained as 25 using eq 14 14 β i 1 h m 0 l e exp k e h m z d z where hm m is the mean water depth ke m 1 is the extinction coefficient and le m is the deflected vegetation height snep was computed against water temperature tw from βi 0 to βi 100 fig 10 although the snep did not change much from βi 50 to βi 100 snep decreases greatly from βi 50 to βi 0 when βi was 25 a peak in snep appeared at a water temperature of 15 c and snep became negative when the water temperature was more than 28 c watanabe et al 2005 demonstrated that optimal temperature for zostera marina is 16 1 c in akkeshi bay which is located close to komuke lagoon this may suggest the practical applicability of the relatively simple snep model for real field environments tada et al 2018 revealed that dic at the water surface dic s was smaller than the no eelgrass stable condition dic stabl in komuke lagoon on the 15th of may 2013 using a three dimensional hydrodynamic model which shows δdic s dic stabl dic s 325 μ mol kg 1 table 4 the residence time of komuke lagoon was ts 110 h and the mean water temperature was 7 1 c since snep is 2 82 μ mol kg 1 h 1 from fig 10 ts snep can be obtained as 310 μ mol kg 1 therefore the estimated ts snep 310 μ mol kg 1 approximately agreed with δdic s 325 μ mol kg 1 which suggests the applicability of the snep model to an enclosed waterbody when the residence time is known in addition to the estimation of ts snep in may 2013 we conducted water sampling at the water surface in komuke lagoon and measured water temperature salinity and dic in 2018 in order to investigate the applicability of the snep model eq 11 sampling stations are shown in fig 1 it should be noted that we found no significant differences in water quality and flow fields between 2013 and 2018 since komuke lagoon has a very narrow inlet and the okhotsk sea provides stable periodic annual changes in water quality the mean water temperature was 23 5 c which corresponds to snep 2 23 μ mol kg 1 h 1 using βi 25 from fig 10 table 4 as the residence time is about 110 h ts snep was found to be 245 μ mol kg 1 using the low salinity endmember of rivers and the high salinity endmember of the ocean δdic s was estimated as 255 μ mol kg 1 from field observations following zeebe et al 2001 again the estimated ts snep 245 μ mol kg 1 agreed well with δdic s 255 μ mol kg 1 from the field observations the proposed snep model is specific to enclosed or semi enclosed waterbodies and not for suitable for the open ocean because of the requirement to evaluate residence times since eelgrass appears to be adapted to calm conditions and there is the possibility to obtain residence times accurately for these waterbodies this suggests the snep model can be useful to improve predictions of carbon capture and storage by eelgrass populations in protected waters 5 conclusion aiming to understand the nep of eelgrass in komuke lagoon which is located in the east of hokkaido parameters for nepr were obtained as ra 1 04 1017 μ mol kg 1 h 1 and ear 1 52 10 19 m2 kg s 2 using the hourly change in dic without photon flux density in laboratory experiments the photosynthetic activity of eelgrass was confirmed to be affected by water temperature from laboratory experiments and parameters for nepp were obtained as pψ 21 5 μ mol kg 1 h 1 α ψ 21 5 200 m2 s kg 1 h 1 rp 2 30 107 and eap 0 69 10 19 m2 kg s 2 the snep model was proposed in which the seasonal change in dic δdic s can be estimated as ts snep by using the residence time ts the snep model was applied to two sets of field observations from komuke lagoon may 2013 and august 2018 and the estimated seasonal change in dic ts snep was confirmed to agree with δdic s from field observations in other words the seasonal change in nep can be obtained as δdic s ts using the residence time ts and the seasonal change in dic δdic s from endmember analysis using field observations since the development and implementation of mitigation measures against global warming is an urgent issue the proposed snep model in this study may be applied to assist efforts to enhance effective capture and storage of carbon dioxide through seagrass restoration also the snep model may be useful for assessing changes due to climate change e g as a screening tool to investigate

24819,markov chain formalism developed formerly for the joint dynamics of cowberry vaccinium vitis idaea and bilberry v myrtillus in the course of post fire succession logofet maslov 2019 is applied here to a similar set of empirical data namely the rooted presence absence of these species on a great number of small 20 20 cm quadrats laid down in a protected sub xeric cladina vaccinium pine forest boreo nemoral zone and re examined each 5 years during 25 as before a discrete markov chain describes the 5 year transitions between the four quadrate states species free v myrtillus alone v vitis idaea alone and both species present in contrast to the former study we summarize the total observation period by weighted averaging the frequencies of each kind of transition thus getting a single mean frequency transition matrix p mf rather than the pattern multiplicative average g of the 5 one step transition matrices we have verified the correctness of the mean frequencies i e the strata homogeneity by a statistical mantel haenszel test and obtain the standard spatial and temporal characteristics of the observed dynamics from the fundamental matrix of the markov chain the conclusion for ecology is that there is a unidirectional trend revealed in temporal changes for three of the four chain states the share of v myrtillus quadrats and that of both species quadrats are permanently increasing while the share of species free quadrats decreases the fourth v vitis idaea alone state has a local maximum at the middle stages of succession after which its share decreases the terminal stable outcome of species dynamics is expected to be a distribution where 29 1 of quadrats are occupied by the vaccinium myrtillus alone 15 2 by v vitis idaea alone 44 4 by the both species and 11 3 be species free the results confirm that the coexistence of v myrtillus and v vitis idaea can be stable at the final stages of succession the total time of post fire succession is estimated at approximately 140 years from the forest typology point of view we have a gradual transformation of cladina vaccinium pine forest into vaccinium and further into vaccinium myrtillus pine forest the challenge for modeling was to compare the former method of averaging transition matrices vs the current one of the mean transition frequencies forming matrix p mf and find the limits to their applications the homogeneity of samples e g a positive outcome of the mantel haenszel test is an obvious limitation of our current method and there are published instances where it fails former averaging reduced to taking the 5th matrix root from the product of 5 stochastic matrices as an exact solution g to the averaging equation and whether the root did exist and was stochastic too represented the basic limitation of the method our set of data does luckily fall within the limitation though just a random perturbation of these data leads to the matrix root that is no longer stochastic however beyond the limitation we could always find an approximate solution via minimizing the approximation error under the constraint of stochasticity and this is the final advantage of

makipaa 1999 according to grime et al 1988 p 592 the similarity index of habitats is 83 for these two species which raises the question as to the mechanisms of their ecological niche partition and

myrtillus type maslov and logofet 2018 logofet and maslov 2019 a fairly rare type in the boreal zone the data scoped a 25 year period of observations divided into 5 year intervals and the model turned out nonautonomous consisting of 5 time specific one step transition matrices the final outcome was obtained from their pattern geometric average an original concept of matrix average that came from the matrix models of discrete structured population dynamics logofet 2018 the markov chain model has revealed a general tendency in the spatial bilberry vs cowberry dynamics that could hardly be seen in the data of successive re examinations alone the 2 species community tends to the state of competitive coexistence dominating those of one species exclusion and that of species absence maslov and logofet 2018 logofet and maslov 2019 it however remained unclear whether this type of dynamics was typical for only one rare type of wet forests or this kind of bilberry vs cowberry relationship should be more universal and typical for other types of pine forest another forest claimed in the title is a kind of subxeric cladina vaccinium scots pine forest on poor and drained sandy soils which is a widespread community type in the boreal forest zone hytteborn et al 2005 rysin and savel yeva 2008 successional stages of post fire dynamics in such pine forests have been studied in detail in the northern and middle taiga forests gorshkov 1995 samoilov and ipatov 1995 kuleshova et al 1996 hautala et al 2005 but there are very few publications of those in the southern taiga and boreo nemoral forest zone maslov 2002 evstigneev and korotkov 2017 lichens were shown to prevail in the ground layer at the early stages of post fire succession thereafter they are followed by feathermosses pleurozium schreberi dicranum spp and at the later stages by dwarf shrubs cowberry vaccinium vitis idaea and bilberry v myrtillus however the ratio of dwarf shrubs species is still uncertain during succession and at the final phase in particular the question remains open whether a transition is possible from the cladina vaccinium type forest to the vaccinium myrtillus pine forest type maslov 2002 another method that we apply here to get the pooled transition matrix reduces to averaging the transition frequencies of each particular transition over the total observation period i e over the 5 sets strata of transition data the mean frequency transition matrix does enable us to do so as the former pattern geometric average transition matrix did logofet and maslov 2019 along with assessing the quantitative characteristics of the stable final state of the 2 species community we estimate the rate cyclicity and time of post fire succession the field sampling design regularity and the total observation period are exactly the same as those in the former study ibid which provides for correctly comparing the outcomes of modeling the two communities in conclusion we discuss whether the conclusions from both methods turn out similar and whether applying either of them can be incorrect 2 study area and sampling design the study area was located in a forest reserve in the northern part of the moscow region scots pine pinus sylvestris dominates all over the area with a small mixture of norway spruce picea abies and silver birch betula pendula the soils are very poor fluvioglacial sands permanent sample plot of 50 m 40 m was established in 1980 in a subxeric dry cladina vaccinium scots pine forest type peucedano pinetum according floristic classification system the stand originated after a great fire in 1894 no signs of any additional fire was found on trees maslov 1990 2002 the field layer was represented mainly by vaccinium vitis idaea and v myrtillus but their total coverage did not exceed 30 the ground layer was dominated by feathermosses pleurozium schreberi and dicranum rugosum large patches mainly in canopy gaps were formed by lichens cladina arbuscula and c rangiferina fig 1 and fig s1 rooted frequency greig smith 1983 of aerial shoots rooted presence was recorded for all plant species on adjacent quadrats of 20 cm 20 cm arranged into 8 permanent transects each of 50 m long maslov 1989 the total number of quadrats was 2000 coarse woody debris cwd fallen dead trees and large branches were also recorded in terms of presence absence the observations continued over 25 years from 1980 to 2005 with the 5 yr interval between re examinations 3 markov chain as a model of fine scale dynamics if we denote as it was in the field records the presence of bilberry in the quadrat by letter v of cowberry by w then we have only four possible states of the two species system in which any quadrat may be at any time 1 both species are absent species free state 2 bilberry is present alone v 3 cowberry alone w 4 both species are present vw defined so the states of the quadrat are naturally identified with those of a discrete markov chain and the model state variables are represented by finite probability distributions x t of chain states at the moment of observation t 1980 1985 2005 maslov and logofet 2018 the postulate of markov property means that the probability distribution of transitions from every state s s v w vw to any other states including the s itself is determined entirely by the current state s and does not depend on the way the chain has come to this state it follows from the a priori biological knowledge confirmed by the data table 1 that all kinds of transition are possible in nature between each pair of the four listed states if we accept the markov property postulate then the transition scheme represents a complete directed graph shown in fig 2 where the arcs are leading from every node of the graph to every other one including the same node in addition the type of line shows the range of probability values p of the corresponding transition and we consider this issue when discussing the results in the formal terms if the probability distribution of the transitions from a certain state s s v w vw to each of the states is represented by a stochastic column vector p s p v s p w s p vw s t and the probabilities of the states themselves at the current time moment t by a stochastic column vector x t x x v x w x vw т then the elementary formula of probability theory gives the probability of the state s at the next moment equal to 1 x s t δ t x t p s x v t p s v x w t p s w x v w t p s v w s v w v w the element pij t of the transition matrix p t pij t i j 1 4 is the probability of transition from state j to i for one time step δt 5 years in general these probabilities depend on t the current moment of examination but we neglect this dependence when searching for a single matrix that would summarize the total observation period it means that we accept the time homogeneity hypothesis hence the set of all the four eqs 1 takes on the following vector matrix form 2 x t δ t p 11 p 12 p 13 p 14 p 21 p 22 p 23 p 24 p 31 p 32 p 33 p 34 p 41 p 42 p 43 p 44 x t t 1980 1985 2000 where the values of pij do not change with time and do total to 1 in each column according to their probabilistic sense such matrices are called column stochastic gantmacher 1967 p 381 horn and johnson 1990 p 526 after having been calibrated on data stochastic matrix p provides for the calculation of standard quantitative characteristics such as the steady sate distribution x x x v x w x vw t of state probabilities which is a positive and normalized by the condition x x v x w x vw 1 or 100 solution to the steady state equation 3 x p x i e the dominant eigenvector of p vector x represents also the limiting distribution because the dynamics x t p t x 0 converges to x with increasing t from any initial distribution x 0 0 kemeny and snell 1976 in spite of all variations observed table 1 the convergence reveals a kind of directionality in the process under study the markov chain formalism suggests certain temporal indices mj the expected time to change state j j 1 4 and tij the mean first passage times i e the mean number of steps needed for the chain to reach state i after starting from j i j 1 4 can be found respectively from the diagonal elements of p and the fundamental matrix of the chain kemeny and snell 1976 technical details in appendix a to logofet and maslov 2019 together with the average duration mj of each jth state the mean first passage times represent the temporal characteristics of the random process expressed in time steps given δt the length of the time step these characteristics can be expressed in chronological units years and they ground our conclusions about the general tendency rates and cyclicity of the dynamics under study also it is of interest how much the current distribution x t differs from the steady state x and it is measured by the keyfitz index of dissimilarity between stochastic vectors keyfitz 1968 p 47 4 δ x x t 1 2 j 1 n x j x j t where n the vector dimension equals 4 in our case the index varies from 0 when the vectors are equal to 1 or 100 the maximal dissimilarity being achieved by singular distributions concentrated in different vector components note that the keyfitz index 4 can easily be generalized to compare stochastic matrices by mere incorporating m the number of matrix rows into the denominator 4m δ x y i j 1 m x i j y i j 2 m x y 1 2 m thereafter the maximal index equals 1 again indeed let for instance x 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 y 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 here the standard norm x y 1 6 whereby δ x y 1 obviously m 1 for vectors note that the matlab definition of 1 norm mathworks 2020a differs form the 1 above so that 1 norm can hardly be used to calculate the index in matlab 3 1 calibration method the nature of the available data namely the presence of repeated observations on permanent transects in combination with a large sample size provides an ability quite rare in ecology to calculate all the model parameters in a unique reliable way the parameters are 16 transition probabilities pij from eq 2 or more precisely 12 transition probabilities plus 4 probabilities pjj of retaining the current state in one step we judge the probabilities by the actual picture of transitions table 1 and take the frequencies of the recorded transition and retention events as the probability values thereafter the four calibration eqs 1 are satisfied automatically at each time step 3 2 averaging method when considering the time specific transition matrices we accept that in a series of observations the frequency of transition from one state to another recorded in the current observation interval is a realization of the random number of transitions for each type of transition the absolute numbers of transitions table 1 hence the corresponding frequencies vary with the year of observation it is logical to assume that averaging the transition frequencies obtained in different samples observation intervals over the entire observation period can give a better estimate of the true transition probability this is how we have transited from the problem of averaging transition matrices logofet and maslov 2019 to that of transition probabilities to obtain p mf the mean frequency transition matrix that shall represent the outcome of the 25 year observations to assess whether averaging the transition frequencies is consistent we apply the well known mantel haenszel test for assessing the degree of homogeneity in pooled data typically this test is used in medical studies where it is crucial to check the homogeneity of the material in different strata borenstein et al 2009 in the markov model of succession we propose using the homogeneity test as an additional argument in favor of the changes in the transition probabilities for the entire observation period being random the probabilities are averaged for each transition from state j to state i by the standard formula ledermann and lloyd 1984 5 p ij l 1 k n l j i l 1 k n l where is the p i j weighted mean probability value for k observations k 5 table 1 nl is the sample size in the lth observation nl j i is the number of specific transitions recorded in this observation ibid further mathematical details of calculating the mantel haenszel test and an example of calculating the weighted mean probabilities are given in appendix a all kinds of calculation both at the data processing stage and during the model analysis are performed by automating options in ms excel including matrix algebra operations 3 3 population dynamics in the markov chain model eq 2 serves both for calibrating the transition matrices at the t t 1 time step t 1980 1985 2000 and simulating the bilberry vs cowberry dynamics with greater t under various assumptions concerning transition matrix p t in particular if p t const we can see how x t converges to x the limit distribution of quadrate states also the dynamics of x t enable calculating each species population dynamics in the traditional species specific form indeed if vm t designates the number of all quadrates with bilberries and vv t the number of all quadrates with cowberries then we have 6 v m t x v t x v w t v v t x w t x v w t at each time step thus converging to certain vm and vv the limit values at t 4 results 4 1 transition frequencies and their averages data on the actual transitions between quadrate states for five observation intervals are presented in absolute numbers in table 1 when constructing transition matrices we have excluded the quadrates with alive and dead tree trunks and those with cwd dead wood in order to avoid the influence of the spatial exclusion factor and the disturbance factor as a result the sample sizes vary from 1758 to 1909 in different observation intervals all the five transition matrices total 80 elements and only two of them vw in 1980 1985 and v w in 1985 1990 turned out to be zero justifying the assumption that all theoretically possible transitions between states do occur in each of the 5 year intervals between the observations at the same time this indicates the correct choice of the time step length and the number of test quadrates for almost every 5 years almost all transitions were realized in the community which confirms the completeness of the transition digraph fig 1 for the dry scots pine forest calculations of the mantel haenszel test for all types of transitions prove statistically significant homogeneity of the pooled data for 8 out of 16 types of transitions table 2 among the rest ones some are very rare such as vw or v w see table 3 while the others vary strongly in their frequencies appendix b yet without any apparent trend to increase or decrease 4 2 averaged transition probabilities the mean frequency transition matrix p mf calculated from the table 1 data is presented in table 3 its elements transition probabilities found as the weighted average frequencies of the corresponding events according to formula 5 are shown in percentage for clarity certain ranges of these probabilities are shown by different kinds of line in fig 2 the highest values 60 are typical only for the diagonal elements of the matrix the probabilities of making no transition by each of the four states this indicates a slow course of succession as follows from fig 2 the main directions of state changes with a probability of 10 to 30 are transitions w w vw and transitions from vw to v and back all other kinds of transition shown by the dotted line are characterized by small less than 10 probabilities 4 3 convergence to the steady state distribution of state probabilities the last column of table 3 shows the limit steady state probability vector x obtained as a solution of eq 3 with the matrix p mf from table 3 in other words the ultimate result of succession under the hypothesis of time homogeneity should be the distribution of states where 15 2 of quadrates be occupied by cowberry alone 29 1 by bilberry alone 44 4 by both species and 11 3 be without dwarf shrubs this distribution differs from those observed in particular years by different values of the keyfitz index of dissimilarity table 4 while fig 3 gives an idea of how the initial distribution x 1980 converges to the equilibrium x over 5 year steps its components approach the corresponding limit values fairly slow in particular the initial distribution differs from the steady state one by 54 5 and the last year distribution x 2005 by 18 9 a difference of less than 5 is achieved only at the 11th step which corresponds to 2035 nevertheless the dissimilarity index decreases at each step which does witness the directionality of the whole process and in favor of the consistency of the calibrated mean frequency transition matrix thus in the two species system the duration of secondary post fire succession achieving a state different from the steady state one by less than 5 is 55 years 11 five year steps from 1980 the beginning of field observations adding the 85 years between the forest fire and 1980 we get the succession time of 140 years as follows from fig 3 the proportion of quadrates with bilberry alone v increases in the course of succession the share of quadrates where both species grow together wv is growing even faster in contrast the proportion of unoccupied quadrates is rapidly declining in contrast to the monotonous increase decrease in v wv the number of quadrates with cowberry alone w first grows rapidly then gradually decreases so that the curve has a local maximum 4 4 single species population dynamics following fig 3 and eq 6 we obtain the population dynamics of bilberry and cowberry over the time steps of the mean frequency model fig 4 we see a gradual change of domination so typical for successional processes and eventually the quadrates with bilberry greatly dominate those with cowberry in the steady state distribution as they total 73 5 of all quadrates cf table 3 4 5 state duration and process cyclicity state durations or the mean numbers of steps before the states having changed are shown in the last line of table 5 the longest 20 years is the coexistence state the shortest one is the state with blueberries alone the matrix t of mean first passage times for every state from every other along various routes contains the times expressed in the numbers of time steps and with the step length δt 5 years they are approximated as shown in table 5 for example it takes 111 years on average to reach state w from v and 50 years to reach v from w altogether these indicators reflect the cyclical nature of the observed dynamics in particular the state is repeated for a different from 11 to 44 mean number of years see the diagonal cells of table 5 and the vw quadrate state reaches state in 153 years on the average 5 discussion another forest considered in this study belongs to the cladina vaccinium pine forest a kind of subxeric boreal scots pine forest more widely spread than the wet polytrichum myrtillus pine forest the subject of our former study maslov and logofet 2018 logofet and maslov 2019 another method concerns finding a transition matrix of the markov chain model to pool all the transition data and it reduces to weighting all the frequencies of each kind of transition positive outcome of the mantel haenszel test confirms our hypothesis of the total strata observations homogeneity and our dealing with pooled frequencies although the homogeneity is not so typical in plant succession series see hobbs 1984 and an overview of markov chain models in usher 1992 it is common in species poor communities lippe et al 1985 bilberry cowberry interactions in species poor boreal forests with all nonzero transition probabilities serve as an example of time homogeneous stationary markov process to see the advantages that another method has in comparison with the former one logofet and maslov 2019 we remind that matrix averaging was reduced to finding the pattern geometric or pattern multiplicative average of 5 time specific transition matrices obtained for each pair of successive observations in the special case of complete digraph ibid fig 2 the computation problem reduced just to taking the matrix root of the 5th power from the product of 5 transition matrices in the chronological order ibid but a prerequisite for doing so was the reduction of all the sample quadrates to those that had never been excluded from either of the 5 observations for external reasons such as living trunks or cwd this was necessary to provide for the logic of multiplicative averaging i e the correct transformation of y 1980 the reduced distribution of quadrat states to y 2005 by the chronological product of 5 one step transition matrices see supplementary materials in general the product prod of several p 2 stochastic matrices is also a stochastic matrix but it is not trivial to find a pth matrix root of a given stochastic matrix that would be stochastic too politi and popolizio 2014 2015 sufficient condition for the pth matrix root to exist is the absence of negative and zero eigenvalues in λ prod the spectrum of prod ibid in the formal terms 7 r λ p r o d where r is the closed negative real axis and designates the empty set however this condition does not yet guarantee the root to be a stochastic matrix condition 7 held true for the product of 5 one step transition matrices in our former study logofet and maslov 2019 table 2 and the 5th root of the product turned out fortunately stochastic which explains the effectiveness of the former averaging method ibid table 4 it holds also true for the product of 5 transition matrices obtained here from the censused observation data tables s1 s2 and the 5th root also turns out to be stochastic thus representing the multiplicative average transition matrix g table s3 meanwhile the stochasticity of g is again a matter of luck and we may well imagine a set of transition data that does not lead to a stochastic matrix root appendix c meanwhile this g the old good average matrix does noticeably not differ from the new p mf the mean frequency transition matrix table 3 the keyfitz index of dissimilarity between these matrices is only 2 57 table s3 and the temporal characteristics of the dynamics look similar сf table 5 and table s4 however what should we do if we faced such a data that neither the mean frequency transition matrix nor the multiplicative averaging approach be correct the final option we always can resort to is to find an approximate solution to the averaging problem it could be found as a solution to the constraint minimization problem for the approximation error over the set of stochastic matrices in a way similar to that in matrix population models logofet 2018 logofet et al 2018a b albeit with another kind of constraint one way or another but the markov chain model does reveal the trend in and give the quantitative characteristics of the process observed for a long time similar conclusions in the paper title means that we have revealed similar post fire successional trends in a dry cladina vaccinium scots pine forest and a wet polytrichum myrtillus type scots pine forest maslov and logofet 2016 logofet and maslov 2019 and the fact that there is no competitive exclusion between bilberry and cowberry in the both the final stages limit distributions x in both communities show the dominance of the quadrat state where both species grow together the reasons for this symbiosis between v myrtillus and v vitis idaea on small quadrats are currently unclear the markov chain ideology provides just a phenomenological picture of the process and do not require a deep insight into the causative mechanisms underlying the process however such a model can help to pinpoint areas where such insight would be valuable jeffers 1978 p 92 one of the possible interaction mechanisms could be that bilberry shoots growing next to cowberry are not so often eaten by herbivores for example bilberry is the main winter forage plant for the gray sided vole clethrionomys rufocanus while cowberry is a less preferred food dahlgren et al 2007 on the other hand similar conclusions do not mean their identity the time of succession being an obvious difference in the dry cladina vaccinium scots pine forest we estimate succession time to be 140 years while the estimation is 50 years for the wet polytrichum myrtillus forest the results obtained from this study allow us to describe the course of post fire succession at three different levels a dynamics of quadrate states b population dynamics c dynamics of the dwarf shrubs synusia by summing up the vm and vv values 6 the share of quadrats with dwarf shrubs was 37 8 at the beginning of observations 1980 in the steady state distribution the share is expected at 88 7 these results are very close to those obtained in a dry pine forest of northern finland where the dwarf shrubs cover reached 70 80 150 years after the fire ruokolainen and salo 2009 6 conclusion though taking another forest and applying another method to study the bilberry vs cowberry dynamics in the course of post fire succession by means of a markov chain formalism we have nevertheless come to similar conclusions about the directionality in the observed process and its temporal characteristics for the three quadrat states there is a unidirectional trend in changes with time the share of sites with only blueberries and that of sites with two species increase permanently while the share of sites lacking these species permanently decreases the fourth state sites with cowberry alone has a local maximum at the middle stages of succession after which the share decreases the steady state distribution is expected to have 29 1 of the sites occupied by blueberries alone 15 2 by cowberries alone both species will be present at 44 4 of the sites and 11 3 of the sites will be unoccupied this confirms the possibility of stable blueberry and cowberry coexistence at the later stages of succession and in this type of forest community we deduce a total duration estimate of the post fire succession in the dry cladina vaccinium scots pine forest in the mixed forest zone at 140 years with achieving a state different from the steady state by less than 5 this duration is almost 3 times longer than that of post fire succession obtained in a similar model for a wet polytrichum myrtillus forest in the same zone maslov logofet 2016 from the standpoint of forest typology these results mean a gradual transformation of a cladina vaccinium forest type into vaccinium forest type and then into vaccinium myrtillus type the application of the former pattern multiplicative averaging to our current data has led to similar results the both method to obtain the average transition matrix have their own advantages and disadvantages each of the methods may be preferred under certain conditions but none of them can be applied everywhere and always the case study considered here has turned out lucky with the both methods being correct but whenever none of them can be correct we recommend an approximate multiplicative average of the one step transition matrices to be found as a solution to a constraint minimization problem for the approximation error

24819,markov chain formalism developed formerly for the joint dynamics of cowberry vaccinium vitis idaea and bilberry v myrtillus in the course of post fire succession logofet maslov 2019 is applied here to a similar set of empirical data namely the rooted presence absence of these species on a great number of small 20 20 cm quadrats laid down in a protected sub xeric cladina vaccinium pine forest boreo nemoral zone and re examined each 5 years during 25 as before a discrete markov chain describes the 5 year transitions between the four quadrate states species free v myrtillus alone v vitis idaea alone and both species present in contrast to the former study we summarize the total observation period by weighted averaging the frequencies of each kind of transition thus getting a single mean frequency transition matrix p mf rather than the pattern multiplicative average g of the 5 one step transition matrices we have verified the correctness of the mean frequencies i e the strata homogeneity by a statistical mantel haenszel test and obtain the standard spatial and temporal characteristics of the observed dynamics from the fundamental matrix of the markov chain the conclusion for ecology is that there is a unidirectional trend revealed in temporal changes for three of the four chain states the share of v myrtillus quadrats and that of both species quadrats are permanently increasing while the share of species free quadrats decreases the fourth v vitis idaea alone state has a local maximum at the middle stages of succession after which its share decreases the terminal stable outcome of species dynamics is expected to be a distribution where 29 1 of quadrats are occupied by the vaccinium myrtillus alone 15 2 by v vitis idaea alone 44 4 by the both species and 11 3 be species free the results confirm that the coexistence of v myrtillus and v vitis idaea can be stable at the final stages of succession the total time of post fire succession is estimated at approximately 140 years from the forest typology point of view we have a gradual transformation of cladina vaccinium pine forest into vaccinium and further into vaccinium myrtillus pine forest the challenge for modeling was to compare the former method of averaging transition matrices vs the current one of the mean transition frequencies forming matrix p mf and find the limits to their applications the homogeneity of samples e g a positive outcome of the mantel haenszel test is an obvious limitation of our current method and there are published instances where it fails former averaging reduced to taking the 5th matrix root from the product of 5 stochastic matrices as an exact solution g to the averaging equation and whether the root did exist and was stochastic too represented the basic limitation of the method our set of data does luckily fall within the limitation though just a random perturbation of these data leads to the matrix root that is no longer stochastic however beyond the limitation we could always find an approximate solution via minimizing the approximation error under the constraint of stochasticity and this is the final advantage of

logofet 2018 logofet and maslov 2019 it however remained unclear whether this type of dynamics was typical for only one rare type of wet forests or this kind of bilberry vs cowberry relationship should be more universal and typical for other types of pine forest another forest claimed in the title is a kind of subxeric cladina vaccinium scots pine forest on poor and drained sandy soils which is a widespread community type in the boreal forest zone hytteborn et al 2005 rysin and savel yeva 2008 successional stages of post fire dynamics in such pine forests have been studied in detail in the northern and middle taiga forests gorshkov 1995 samoilov and ipatov 1995 kuleshova et al 1996 hautala et al 2005 but there are very few publications of those in the southern taiga and boreo nemoral forest zone maslov 2002 evstigneev and korotkov 2017 lichens were shown to prevail in the ground layer at the early stages of post fire succession thereafter they are followed by feathermosses pleurozium schreberi dicranum spp and at the later stages by dwarf shrubs cowberry vaccinium vitis idaea and bilberry v myrtillus however the ratio of dwarf shrubs species is still uncertain during succession and at the final phase in particular the question remains open whether a transition is possible from the cladina vaccinium type forest to the vaccinium myrtillus pine forest type maslov 2002 another method that we apply here to get the pooled transition matrix reduces to averaging the transition frequencies of each particular transition over the total observation period i e over the 5 sets strata of transition data the mean frequency transition matrix does enable us to do so as the former pattern geometric average transition matrix did logofet and maslov 2019 along with assessing the quantitative characteristics of the stable final state of the 2 species community we estimate the rate cyclicity and time of post fire succession the field sampling design regularity and the total observation period are exactly the same as those in the former study ibid which provides for correctly comparing the outcomes of modeling the two communities in conclusion we discuss whether the conclusions from both methods turn out similar and whether applying either of them can be incorrect 2 study area and sampling design the study area was located in a forest reserve in the northern part of the moscow region scots pine pinus sylvestris dominates all over the area with a small mixture of norway spruce picea abies and silver birch betula pendula the soils are very poor fluvioglacial sands permanent sample plot of 50 m 40 m was established in 1980 in a subxeric dry cladina vaccinium scots pine forest type peucedano pinetum according floristic classification system the stand originated after a great fire in 1894 no signs of any additional fire was found on trees maslov 1990 2002 the field layer was represented mainly by vaccinium vitis idaea and v myrtillus but their total coverage did not exceed 30 the ground layer was dominated by feathermosses pleurozium schreberi and dicranum rugosum large patches mainly in canopy gaps were formed by lichens cladina arbuscula and c rangiferina fig 1 and fig s1 rooted frequency greig smith 1983 of aerial shoots rooted presence was recorded for all plant species on adjacent quadrats of 20 cm 20 cm arranged into 8 permanent transects each of 50 m long maslov 1989 the total number of quadrats was 2000 coarse woody debris cwd fallen dead trees and large branches were also recorded in terms of presence absence the observations continued over 25 years from 1980 to 2005 with the 5 yr interval between re examinations 3 markov chain as a model of fine scale dynamics if we denote as it was in the field records the presence of bilberry in the quadrat by letter v of cowberry by w then we have only four possible states of the two species system in which any quadrat may be at any time 1 both species are absent species free state 2 bilberry is present alone v 3 cowberry alone w 4 both species are present vw defined so the states of the quadrat are naturally identified with those of a discrete markov chain and the model state variables are represented by finite probability distributions x t of chain states at the moment of observation t 1980 1985 2005 maslov and logofet 2018 the postulate of markov property means that the probability distribution of transitions from every state s s v w vw to any other states including the s itself is determined entirely by the current state s and does not depend on the way the chain has come to this state it follows from the a priori biological knowledge confirmed by the data table 1 that all kinds of transition are possible in nature between each pair of the four listed states if we accept the markov property postulate then the transition scheme represents a complete directed graph shown in fig 2 where the arcs are leading from every node of the graph to every other one including the same node in addition the type of line shows the range of probability values p of the corresponding transition and we consider this issue when discussing the results in the formal terms if the probability distribution of the transitions from a certain state s s v w vw to each of the states is represented by a stochastic column vector p s p v s p w s p vw s t and the probabilities of the states themselves at the current time moment t by a stochastic column vector x t x x v x w x vw т then the elementary formula of probability theory gives the probability of the state s at the next moment equal to 1 x s t δ t x t p s x v t p s v x w t p s w x v w t p s v w s v w v w the element pij t of the transition matrix p t pij t i j 1 4 is the probability of transition from state j to i for one time step δt 5 years in general these probabilities depend on t the current moment of examination but we neglect this dependence when searching for a single matrix that would summarize the total observation period it means that we accept the time homogeneity hypothesis hence the set of all the four eqs 1 takes on the following vector matrix form 2 x t δ t p 11 p 12 p 13 p 14 p 21 p 22 p 23 p 24 p 31 p 32 p 33 p 34 p 41 p 42 p 43 p 44 x t t 1980 1985 2000 where the values of pij do not change with time and do total to 1 in each column according to their probabilistic sense such matrices are called column stochastic gantmacher 1967 p 381 horn and johnson 1990 p 526 after having been calibrated on data stochastic matrix p provides for the calculation of standard quantitative characteristics such as the steady sate distribution x x x v x w x vw t of state probabilities which is a positive and normalized by the condition x x v x w x vw 1 or 100 solution to the steady state equation 3 x p x i e the dominant eigenvector of p vector x represents also the limiting distribution because the dynamics x t p t x 0 converges to x with increasing t from any initial distribution x 0 0 kemeny and snell 1976 in spite of all variations observed table 1 the convergence reveals a kind of directionality in the process under study the markov chain formalism suggests certain temporal indices mj the expected time to change state j j 1 4 and tij the mean first passage times i e the mean number of steps needed for the chain to reach state i after starting from j i j 1 4 can be found respectively from the diagonal elements of p and the fundamental matrix of the chain kemeny and snell 1976 technical details in appendix a to logofet and maslov 2019 together with the average duration mj of each jth state the mean first passage times represent the temporal characteristics of the random process expressed in time steps given δt the length of the time step these characteristics can be expressed in chronological units years and they ground our conclusions about the general tendency rates and cyclicity of the dynamics under study also it is of interest how much the current distribution x t differs from the steady state x and it is measured by the keyfitz index of dissimilarity between stochastic vectors keyfitz 1968 p 47 4 δ x x t 1 2 j 1 n x j x j t where n the vector dimension equals 4 in our case the index varies from 0 when the vectors are equal to 1 or 100 the maximal dissimilarity being achieved by singular distributions concentrated in different vector components note that the keyfitz index 4 can easily be generalized to compare stochastic matrices by mere incorporating m the number of matrix rows into the denominator 4m δ x y i j 1 m x i j y i j 2 m x y 1 2 m thereafter the maximal index equals 1 again indeed let for instance x 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 y 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 here the standard norm x y 1 6 whereby δ x y 1 obviously m 1 for vectors note that the matlab definition of 1 norm mathworks 2020a differs form the 1 above so that 1 norm can hardly be used to calculate the index in matlab 3 1 calibration method the nature of the available data namely the presence of repeated observations on permanent transects in combination with a large sample size provides an ability quite rare in ecology to calculate all the model parameters in a unique reliable way the parameters are 16 transition probabilities pij from eq 2 or more precisely 12 transition probabilities plus 4 probabilities pjj of retaining the current state in one step we judge the probabilities by the actual picture of transitions table 1 and take the frequencies of the recorded transition and retention events as the probability values thereafter the four calibration eqs 1 are satisfied automatically at each time step 3 2 averaging method when considering the time specific transition matrices we accept that in a series of observations the frequency of transition from one state to another recorded in the current observation interval is a realization of the random number of transitions for each type of transition the absolute numbers of transitions table 1 hence the corresponding frequencies vary with the year of observation it is logical to assume that averaging the transition frequencies obtained in different samples observation intervals over the entire observation period can give a better estimate of the true transition probability this is how we have transited from the problem of averaging transition matrices logofet and maslov 2019 to that of transition probabilities to obtain p mf the mean frequency transition matrix that shall represent the outcome of the 25 year observations to assess whether averaging the transition frequencies is consistent we apply the well known mantel haenszel test for assessing the degree of homogeneity in pooled data typically this test is used in medical studies where it is crucial to check the homogeneity of the material in different strata borenstein et al 2009 in the markov model of succession we propose using the homogeneity test as an additional argument in favor of the changes in the transition probabilities for the entire observation period being random the probabilities are averaged for each transition from state j to state i by the standard formula ledermann and lloyd 1984 5 p ij l 1 k n l j i l 1 k n l where is the p i j weighted mean probability value for k observations k 5 table 1 nl is the sample size in the lth observation nl j i is the number of specific transitions recorded in this observation ibid further mathematical details of calculating the mantel haenszel test and an example of calculating the weighted mean probabilities are given in appendix a all kinds of calculation both at the data processing stage and during the model analysis are performed by automating options in ms excel including matrix algebra operations 3 3 population dynamics in the markov chain model eq 2 serves both for calibrating the transition matrices at the t t 1 time step t 1980 1985 2000 and simulating the bilberry vs cowberry dynamics with greater t under various assumptions concerning transition matrix p t in particular if p t const we can see how x t converges to x the limit distribution of quadrate states also the dynamics of x t enable calculating each species population dynamics in the traditional species specific form indeed if vm t designates the number of all quadrates with bilberries and vv t the number of all quadrates with cowberries then we have 6 v m t x v t x v w t v v t x w t x v w t at each time step thus converging to certain vm and vv the limit values at t 4 results 4 1 transition frequencies and their averages data on the actual transitions between quadrate states for five observation intervals are presented in absolute numbers in table 1 when constructing transition matrices we have excluded the quadrates with alive and dead tree trunks and those with cwd dead wood in order to avoid the influence of the spatial exclusion factor and the disturbance factor as a result the sample sizes vary from 1758 to 1909 in different observation intervals all the five transition matrices total 80 elements and only two of them vw in 1980 1985 and v w in 1985 1990 turned out to be zero justifying the assumption that all theoretically possible transitions between states do occur in each of the 5 year intervals between the observations at the same time this indicates the correct choice of the time step length and the number of test quadrates for almost every 5 years almost all transitions were realized in the community which confirms the completeness of the transition digraph fig 1 for the dry scots pine forest calculations of the mantel haenszel test for all types of transitions prove statistically significant homogeneity of the pooled data for 8 out of 16 types of transitions table 2 among the rest ones some are very rare such as vw or v w see table 3 while the others vary strongly in their frequencies appendix b yet without any apparent trend to increase or decrease 4 2 averaged transition probabilities the mean frequency transition matrix p mf calculated from the table 1 data is presented in table 3 its elements transition probabilities found as the weighted average frequencies of the corresponding events according to formula 5 are shown in percentage for clarity certain ranges of these probabilities are shown by different kinds of line in fig 2 the highest values 60 are typical only for the diagonal elements of the matrix the probabilities of making no transition by each of the four states this indicates a slow course of succession as follows from fig 2 the main directions of state changes with a probability of 10 to 30 are transitions w w vw and transitions from vw to v and back all other kinds of transition shown by the dotted line are characterized by small less than 10 probabilities 4 3 convergence to the steady state distribution of state probabilities the last column of table 3 shows the limit steady state probability vector x obtained as a solution of eq 3 with the matrix p mf from table 3 in other words the ultimate result of succession under the hypothesis of time homogeneity should be the distribution of states where 15 2 of quadrates be occupied by cowberry alone 29 1 by bilberry alone 44 4 by both species and 11 3 be without dwarf shrubs this distribution differs from those observed in particular years by different values of the keyfitz index of dissimilarity table 4 while fig 3 gives an idea of how the initial distribution x 1980 converges to the equilibrium x over 5 year steps its components approach the corresponding limit values fairly slow in particular the initial distribution differs from the steady state one by 54 5 and the last year distribution x 2005 by 18 9 a difference of less than 5 is achieved only at the 11th step which corresponds to 2035 nevertheless the dissimilarity index decreases at each step which does witness the directionality of the whole process and in favor of the consistency of the calibrated mean frequency transition matrix thus in the two species system the duration of secondary post fire succession achieving a state different from the steady state one by less than 5 is 55 years 11 five year steps from 1980 the beginning of field observations adding the 85 years between the forest fire and 1980 we get the succession time of 140 years as follows from fig 3 the proportion of quadrates with bilberry alone v increases in the course of succession the share of quadrates where both species grow together wv is growing even faster in contrast the proportion of unoccupied quadrates is rapidly declining in contrast to the monotonous increase decrease in v wv the number of quadrates with cowberry alone w first grows rapidly then gradually decreases so that the curve has a local maximum 4 4 single species population dynamics following fig 3 and eq 6 we obtain the population dynamics of bilberry and cowberry over the time steps of the mean frequency model fig 4 we see a gradual change of domination so typical for successional processes and eventually the quadrates with bilberry greatly dominate those with cowberry in the steady state distribution as they total 73 5 of all quadrates cf table 3 4 5 state duration and process cyclicity state durations or the mean numbers of steps before the states having changed are shown in the last line of table 5 the longest 20 years is the coexistence state the shortest one is the state with blueberries alone the matrix t of mean first passage times for every state from every other along various routes contains the times expressed in the numbers of time steps and with the step length δt 5 years they are approximated as shown in table 5 for example it takes 111 years on average to reach state w from v and 50 years to reach v from w altogether these indicators reflect the cyclical nature of the observed dynamics in particular the state is repeated for a different from 11 to 44 mean number of years see the diagonal cells of table 5 and the vw quadrate state reaches state in 153 years on the average 5 discussion another forest considered in this study belongs to the cladina vaccinium pine forest a kind of subxeric boreal scots pine forest more widely spread than the wet polytrichum myrtillus pine forest the subject of our former study maslov and logofet 2018 logofet and maslov 2019 another method concerns finding a transition matrix of the markov chain model to pool all the transition data and it reduces to weighting all the frequencies of each kind of transition positive outcome of the mantel haenszel test confirms our hypothesis of the total strata observations homogeneity and our dealing with pooled frequencies although the homogeneity is not so typical in plant succession series see hobbs 1984 and an overview of markov chain models in usher 1992 it is common in species poor communities lippe et al 1985 bilberry cowberry interactions in species poor boreal forests with all nonzero transition probabilities serve as an example of time homogeneous stationary markov process to see the advantages that another method has in comparison with the former one logofet and maslov 2019 we remind that matrix averaging was reduced to finding the pattern geometric or pattern multiplicative average of 5 time specific transition matrices obtained for each pair of successive observations in the special case of complete digraph ibid fig 2 the computation problem reduced just to taking the matrix root of the 5th power from the product of 5 transition matrices in the chronological order ibid but a prerequisite for doing so was the reduction of all the sample quadrates to those that had never been excluded from either of the 5 observations for external reasons such as living trunks or cwd this was necessary to provide for the logic of multiplicative averaging i e the correct transformation of y 1980 the reduced distribution of quadrat states to y 2005 by the chronological product of 5 one step transition matrices see supplementary materials in general the product prod of several p 2 stochastic matrices is also a stochastic matrix but it is not trivial to find a pth matrix root of a given stochastic matrix that would be stochastic too politi and popolizio 2014 2015 sufficient condition for the pth matrix root to exist is the absence of negative and zero eigenvalues in λ prod the spectrum of prod ibid in the formal terms 7 r λ p r o d where r is the closed negative real axis and designates the empty set however this condition does not yet guarantee the root to be a stochastic matrix condition 7 held true for the product of 5 one step transition matrices in our former study logofet and maslov 2019 table 2 and the 5th root of the product turned out fortunately stochastic which explains the effectiveness of the former averaging method ibid table 4 it holds also true for the product of 5 transition matrices obtained here from the censused observation data tables s1 s2 and the 5th root also turns out to be stochastic thus representing the multiplicative average transition matrix g table s3 meanwhile the stochasticity of g is again a matter of luck and we may well imagine a set of transition data that does not lead to a stochastic matrix root appendix c meanwhile this g the old good average matrix does noticeably not differ from the new p mf the mean frequency transition matrix table 3 the keyfitz index of dissimilarity between these matrices is only 2 57 table s3 and the temporal characteristics of the dynamics look similar сf table 5 and table s4 however what should we do if we faced such a data that neither the mean frequency transition matrix nor the multiplicative averaging approach be correct the final option we always can resort to is to find an approximate solution to the averaging problem it could be found as a solution to the constraint minimization problem for the approximation error over the set of stochastic matrices in a way similar to that in matrix population models logofet 2018 logofet et al 2018a b albeit with another kind of constraint one way or another but the markov chain model does reveal the trend in and give the quantitative characteristics of the process observed for a long time similar conclusions in the paper title means that we have revealed similar post fire successional trends in a dry cladina vaccinium scots pine forest and a wet polytrichum myrtillus type scots pine forest maslov and logofet 2016 logofet and maslov 2019 and the fact that there is no competitive exclusion between bilberry and cowberry in the both the final stages limit distributions x in both communities show the dominance of the quadrat state where both species grow together the reasons for this symbiosis between v myrtillus and v vitis idaea on small quadrats are currently unclear the markov chain ideology provides just a phenomenological picture of the process and do not require a deep insight into the causative mechanisms underlying the process however such a model can help to pinpoint areas where such insight would be valuable jeffers 1978 p 92 one of the possible interaction mechanisms could be that bilberry shoots growing next to cowberry are not so often eaten by herbivores for example bilberry is the main winter forage plant for the gray sided vole clethrionomys rufocanus while cowberry is a less preferred food dahlgren et al 2007 on the other hand similar conclusions do not mean their identity the time of succession being an obvious difference in the dry cladina vaccinium scots pine forest we estimate succession time to be 140 years while the estimation is 50 years for the wet polytrichum myrtillus forest the results obtained from this study allow us to describe the course of post fire succession at three different levels a dynamics of quadrate states b population dynamics c dynamics of the dwarf shrubs synusia by summing up the vm and vv values 6 the share of quadrats with dwarf shrubs was 37 8 at the beginning of observations 1980 in the steady state distribution the share is expected at 88 7 these results are very close to those obtained in a dry pine forest of northern finland where the dwarf shrubs cover reached 70 80 150 years after the fire ruokolainen and salo 2009 6 conclusion though taking another forest and applying another method to study the bilberry vs cowberry dynamics in the course of post fire succession by means of a markov chain formalism we have nevertheless come to similar conclusions about the directionality in the observed process and its temporal characteristics for the three quadrat states there is a unidirectional trend in changes with time the share of sites with only blueberries and that of sites with two species increase permanently while the share of sites lacking these species permanently decreases the fourth state sites with cowberry alone has a local maximum at the middle stages of succession after which the share decreases the steady state distribution is expected to have 29 1 of the sites occupied by blueberries alone 15 2 by cowberries alone both species will be present at 44 4 of the sites and 11 3 of the sites will be unoccupied this confirms the possibility of stable blueberry and cowberry coexistence at the later stages of succession and in this type of forest community we deduce a total duration estimate of the post fire succession in the dry cladina vaccinium scots pine forest in the mixed forest zone at 140 years with achieving a state different from the steady state by less than 5 this duration is almost 3 times longer than that of post fire succession obtained in a similar model for a wet polytrichum myrtillus forest in the same zone maslov logofet 2016 from the standpoint of forest typology these results mean a gradual transformation of a cladina vaccinium forest type into vaccinium forest type and then into vaccinium myrtillus type the application of the former pattern multiplicative averaging to our current data has led to similar results the both method to obtain the average transition matrix have their own advantages and disadvantages each of the methods may be preferred under certain conditions but none of them can be applied everywhere and always the case study considered here has turned out lucky with the both methods being correct but whenever none of them can be correct we recommend an approximate multiplicative average of the one step transition matrices to be found as a solution to a constraint minimization problem for the approximation error
