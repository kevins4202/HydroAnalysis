13135,lead pb is a concerning water pollutant worldwide as it is highly toxic to living organisms in this research adsorption studies were carried out for the removal of pb from water graphene oxide go was used as adsorbent which was synthesized by modified hummers method using graphite from waste dry cell battery the prepared go was characterized by fesem tem xrd bet raman ftir and elemental analysis which revealed that the highly porous go was successfully prepared from graphite rod of waste dry cell battery batch experiments were performed to investigate the effects of ph contact time adsorbent dose on the adsorption process and optimum condition for adsorption was determined experiments showed 98 87 removal of pb 10 ppm in a very short time 20 min at ph 4 while adsorbent dose was 0 25 gl 1 the oxygenated groups on the surface of go played a crucial role in the adsorption of pb on go experimental data were tested against kinetic and adsorption isotherm models the adsorption process followed pseudo second order kinetics langmuir isotherm at lower temperature 20 and 30 c and freundlich isotherm at higher temperature 40 c the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 55 80 54 03 and 51 83 mg g 1 at 20 30 and 40 c respectively thermodynamic studies suggested the adsorption was exothermic and spontaneous under 20 40 c which indicates that adsorption was feasible therefore this study represents a rapid and efficient method in reducing water contamination caused by pb keywords adsorbent graphite powder graphene oxide lead dry cell battery 1 introduction the efforts in meeting the needs and demands of increased population changing in living standards technological innovation market expansion and capital accumulation resulted in a proliferation of industries throughout the world 1 3 these industries have since been ceaselessly releasing pollutants into the water air and soil at an unprecedented rate and polluting the surface water and groundwater with various toxic heavy metals pb is one of the highly toxic heavy metals which is generated from various industrial activities applications such as printing pigments mining electroplating glass dyeing lead battery textile and explosive manufacturing process 4 7 pb being non biodegradable persists in water accumulates in living organisms sediments and sludge and enters into the food chain 8 11 according to the world health organization and environmental protection agency the maximum allowable limit of lead in drinking water are 0 01 mg l and 0 015 mg l respectively and the permissible effluent discharge limit of lead in surface water bodies is 0 1 mg l 12 13 exposure to lead poses a serious threat to human health it has been reported to be linked with cognitive disorders 14 15 peripheral neuropathy 16 anemia 17 hypertension 18 renal damage 19 low fertility 20 21 miscarriage 22 and depressive disorder 23 children are more vulnerable to pb toxicity than adults 24 25 therefore pb containing wastewater must be treated before releasing into the water bodies there are various heavy metal removal technologies and methods such as chemical precipitation 26 ion exchange 27 membrane filtration 28 29 evaporation 30 reverse osmosis 31 flotation 32 coagulation flocculation 33 electrochemical deposition 34 and adsorption 35 these methods have their drawbacks for instance insufficient removal high operational cost high energy requirements difficulties in disposal toxic byproduct and sludge formation the adsorption method has the advantages of superior removal efficiency easy operation low cost and regeneration of adsorbents 36 even though the adsorption method has advantages it still suffers from lengthy operation and inefficiency of adsorbent materials these drawbacks can be resolved by developing adsorbents with proper functional groups larger surface area and greater dispersibility in recent years graphene and graphene oxide go based adsorbent has attracted researchers as a potential adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals from water and wastewater 37 38 graphene is a single atomic layer of graphite that possesses a special two dimensional 2d structure it has unique electrical optical magnetic and mechanical properties with a very large specific surface area up to 2630 m2 g 1 39 43 go is the oxidized form of graphite that can be synthesized by the oxidation of graphene go is an effective adsorbent due to its large surface area chemical tunability outstanding dispersion property and different types of oxygen containing groups hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl epoxy groups in its structure 44 50 the pi system and functional groups of go can interact with metal ions either by covalent bonding or by electrostatic interaction and increase the adsorption capacity 51 still now the cost of pure graphite is very high apart from india and china the world s largest graphite mining countries the resources of natural graphite are very limited worldwide 52 on the other hand the synthesis procedure of synthetic graphite is very complex expensive and time consuming besides the raw materials for its synthesis are scarce 53 therefore the recycling of graphite is very important dry cell batteries are cost effective primary batteries that are used in different types of devices such as toys remote controls clocks flashlights etc thousands of tons of dry cell batteries are used every year around the world which are not often recycled 54 55 without any modification direct discharge of these batteries is very harmful to nature as they leach chemicals and metals generally graphite electrodes of dry cell batteries do not undergo corrosion change hence these can be used for the synthesis of go reutilization of these graphite electrodes in preparing go provides a great solution to waste management and opens a new route in finding easy raw materials for go preparation although in some reports commercial go and go based nanocomposites have been used to remove heavy metals which is not cost effective to find a cost effective way waste product derived graphene oxide is a better solution to remove toxic pb from aqueous solution 56 57 to the best of our knowledge no such reports have yet been reported that used graphite electrodes from waste dry cell batteries to prepare go for using it as an adsorbent for the removal of pb from water in this study we have synthesized go from graphite electrodes recovered from waste dry cell batteries which we used as an adsorbent to remove pb from aqueous solution the prepared go was characterized by fesem tem xrd bet raman ftir and elemental analyzer to find the optimum adsorption conditions we have studied the effects of ph contact time and dose furthermore adsorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics were studied to investigate the adsorption mechanism efficiency and viability 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals lead standard solution 1000 mg l pb

vario micro cube germany elemental analyzer concentrations of pb ii solutions were measured by analytik jena gmbh novaa 350 flame atomic absorption spectrometer germany 2 3 graphite recovery waste dry cell batteries were collected from marketplaces and households graphite rods were separated from waste dry cells carefully using pliers the electrodes were rubbed by paper and washed with deionized water several times to clean adhering paste of mno2 nh4cl and carbon they were then air dried for 48 h and ground into a fine powder using mortar and pestle after that the graphite powder was treated with aqua regia to remove inorganic impurities and was washed several times with di water then it was dried at 60 c for 24 h scheme 1 shows the schematic illustration of the preparation of graphite powder from waste dry cell batteries 2 4 synthesis of graphene oxide graphene oxide was prepared by the modified hummers method 58 1 g of graphite powder subsequently 6 g of kmno4 was added slowly in a solution of h2so4 120 ml and h3po4 14 ml ratio 9 1 v v with stirring the mixture was heated for 6 h at 50 c with constant stirring till the mixture appeared dark green after that the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and set up in an ice bath 400 ml water and 3 ml 30 h2o2 were added with stirring to remove excess kmno4 the temperature was kept nearly 0 c with ice bath due to the occurrence of exothermic reaction at this stage then the mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm the resultant precipitate was washed with water afterward with 30 hcl for the removal of metallic impurities it was then washed with water again for chloride removal and finally with ethanol thus prepared go was dried at 45 c for 48 h in a vacuum drying oven 2 5 adsorption studies a stock aqueous solution of pb was prepared from standard 1000 ppm pb solution which was later used to make solutions of required concentrations 20 ml of pb solution was placed in erlenmeyer flasks of capacity 50 ml the ph was adjusted using hcl and naoh following that a certain amount of go was added and subjected to shaking after a certain shaking time the adsorption mixture was centrifuged and filtered with 0 45 μm chromafil xtra syringe filter concentrations of pb solutions were measured before and after adsorption by flame atomic absorption spectrometer optimum condition for adsorption was studied by changing ph 2 12 of pb solution adsorbent dosage 100 1250 mg l contact time 5 120 min and maintained in experiments for kinetic and isotherm studies contact time was variable in kinetic studies and initial concentration of pb solution was variable in isotherm studies experiments for thermodynamic studies were conducted at three different temperatures 20 30 and 40 c removal percentage was calculated by eq 1 1 removal percentage c o c t c o 100 adsorbed amount at time t q t and amount adsorbed at equilibrium q e were calculated by eqs 2 and 3 2 q t c o c t m v 3 q e c o c e m v where c o c t and c e are the initial at time t and equilibrium concentration of pb solution respectively mg l m is the adsorbent dose in gram v represents the volume of pb solution taken for batch experiments in liter 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent 3 1 1 fesem edx and tem analysis fesem and tem are very essential to understand the morphological properties of adsorbents in our study we have taken fesem images of the adsorbent before and after pb adsorption fig 1 a b shows the fesem images of go adsorbent at two different magnifications these images revealed that the surface of prepared go was highly porous scaly and layered theoretically these properties of any adsorbent enhanced the adsorption of heavy metals 59 fig 1 c d shows the fesem images of go after pb adsorption the aggregated particles appeared on the go surface which proved that the pb was adsorbed by go after anchoring of pb on go the surface appeared comparatively smooth and this smoothness might have resulted from the interaction of pb with the surface of graphene oxide 60 the edx analysis further confirmed the adsorption of pb onto the graphene oxide no pb was found in the go however after adsorption 2 07 wt pb was found given in fig 1 e f to understand the more insight into the surface morphology tem images of go before and after lead adsorption was recorded fig 1 g i the morphology of go consists of well defined multilayers with many wrinkles fig 1 g for which it can be again claimed that the prepared go has a large surface area pb particles were clearly observed on the go surface after pb adsorption fig 1 h i 3 1 2 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra of graphite go before and after lead adsorption are shown in fig 2 a the spectra of graphite showed no significant peak apart from a weak peak for benzene derivative which indicates the inadequacy of graphite as an adsorbent while in the go spectra many significant peaks showed up indicating the inclusion of different functional groups in the carbon framework 61 the ftir spectrum of go fig 2 a showed a strong and broad band around 3350 cm 1 which is attributed to the stretching mode of o h hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 62 the absorption band that appeared at 1710 cm 1 is characteristic of the stretching mode of co carboxyl group 62 the strong peaks occurring around 1010 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 are indicative of c o c stretching epoxy groups and aromatic cc stretching respectively 63 65 the peak that appeared at 707 cm 1 is characteristic of the ch bond from aromatic benzene 66 and the co2 adsorbed on go appeared at 2350 cm 1 67 so the ft ir results confirm that the graphite recovered from waste dry cell batteries was successfully oxidized and the prepared go is filled with oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl epoxy carboxyl carbonyl which may serve as active sites for pb adsorption 68 in contrast the ftir spectrum of pb adsorbed go show some change in intensities of some peaks after the accumulation of pb on go the intensities of all peaks significantly reduced which indicates that oxygenated functional groups of go may be involved in binding of pb 69 70 to further investigate the adsorption capacity of graphite and go adsorption study was performed in presence of 10 ppm pb solution and the results are shown in table 1 in this case it is clear that the prepared go shows notably higher removal percentage and amount adsorbed mg g 1 compared to the graphite powder derived from waste dry cell batteries 3 1 3 xrd x ray diffraction patterns for graphite powder recovered from waste dry cell battery and the go are shown in fig 2 b the diffraction peak for graphite powder shows a sharp peak at 2θ 26 5 corresponding to the 002 plane and the interlayer distance 0 34 nm calculated using braggs equation which have similarities with the previous reports 71 after oxidation of graphite powder the diffraction peak for graphene oxide shows at 2θ 11 34 corresponding to the 001 with interlayer distance of 0 77 nm which is similar to the previous literature 71 the interlayer distance of go is higher than graphite powder due to the incorporation of oxygenated functional groups in go in addition the appearance of diffraction peak at 2θ 43 corresponds to the turbostratic disorder carbon materials 54 3 1 4 raman analysis raman spectroscopy is a very useful technique to determine the possible structural defects and disorders in graphene based materials the raman spectra of graphite powder and go shown in fig 2 c consist of a set of two distinct peaks corresponding to the d and g bands respectively the g band is a result of in plane vibrations of sp2 bonded carbon atoms whereas the d band is due to out of plane vibrations attributed to the presence of structural defects the g band is observed at 1356 cm 1 1359 cm 1 and the d band at 1582 cm 1 and 1595 cm 1 for graphite and go respectively the intensity ratio of id ig provides direct evidence of the degree of defects present in go surface 54 the id ig ratio of go 0 95 is higher than graphite 0 7 which confirms the grafting of oxygenated functional groups to the graphitic planes 54 the peak observed at 2700 cm 1 is known as the 2d band which is related to the number of layer presence in go the ratio of 2d g is 1 which confirmed that the prepared go is multilayer structure 72 74 3 1 5 elemental analysis the elemental composition of graphite powder and prepared go has been analyzed by using an elemental chns analyzer table 2 the percentage of carbon was 87 42 in graphite rods which decreased to 47 42 in the prepared go suggesting that many oxygen atoms were added into graphite to form go besides several studies reported similar c o ratio in their go preparation which suggests that the graphene oxide preparation was successful 75 76 hydrogen was observed due to the oxygen containing functional groups in go 3 1 6 bet analysis bet surface analysis is a very useful technique to characterize the surface area and porosity of the prepared adsorbent the active surface area and pore size distribution of the go were analyzed by adsorption desorption under nitrogen by bet analysis the total active specific surface area of go is 59 98 m2 g 1 fig 3 and its average pore diameter is 6 19 nm the pore size distribution of go is 3 86 nm which was studied by bjh method from the nitrogen desorption curve fig 3 b the bet properties of go prepared from waste dry cell batteries have similarities with go prepared from commercial graphite powder 77 78 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph ph is an important factor that affects the adsorptive heavy metal removal process as the electrostatic nature of the active sites of adsorbent and the chemistry of metal are dependent on the ph of the medium 79 to investigate how the ph of pb solution affects the adsorption onto go the removal percentage of pb was observed by batch experiments at different ph ranging from 2 to 12 shown in fig 4 a removal percentage sharply increased as ph was increased from 2 to 3 then from 3 to 4 slightly positive change was observed and remained almost the same until ph 6 a similar phenomenon was reported by qianlan 80 after ph 6 removal increased slightly with increasing ph and then declined above ph 10 when the concentration of h ions is high many of the functional groups surface active sites of go become protonated resulting in electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged sites of go and pb ions which accounts for the low removal percentage at low ph increase in removal with increase in ph is due to the deprotonation of active sites which makes the surface accessible for pb adsorption the steady portion of the curve fig 4 a under ph 4 to 6 manifests the saturation of the surface with pb pb ions in an aqueous solution form different hydroxides depending on the ph of the solution 81 which is represented in eq 4 4 p b 2 pb oh pb oh 2 pb oh 3 pb oh 4 2 increase in ph a visible white precipitate was observed in the aqueous solution of pb above ph 6 this indicates that removal above ph 6 was caused by both precipitation of pb ions as pb oh 2 and adsorption as pb2 and pb oh ions the decline in removal after ph 10 was due to the increase in the concentration of pb oh 3 and pb oh 4 2 ions which experience a repulsive electrostatic force at the negatively charged adsorbent sites developed at high ph considering the precipitation phenomenon at higher ph and removal percentage ph 4 was selected as optimal ph and maintained in the other studies 3 2 2 effect of contact time for economical and effective wastewater treatment contact time is an important consideration to investigate the effect of contact time removal percentage was observed at various shaking durations from 5 to 120 min shown in fig 4 b initially adsorption was very fast initially and 92 of pb ions was removed in the first 5 min this is due to the plenty of available active sites and high concentration of pb as the number of available active sites and concentration of pb decreased with the contact time the increase in removal after 5 min was gradual and stopped at 20 min reaching 98 87 removal was pretty much steady after 20 min which is very short time compared to the previous studies 82 84 20 min of contact time was considered as adsorption equilibrium time and maintained in further studies 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dose for proper utilization of adsorbent knowledge of the effect of adsorbent dose on adsorption is imperative to explore optimal adsorbent dose batch experiments were carried out with different amounts of go as shown in fig 4 c removal percentage increased sharply with increasing adsorbent dose from 0 1 to 0 25 g l stood steady with further increase in the adsorbent dose and showed a slight decline at high adsorbent doses the rise in removal with dose is associated with the increased number of active sites the steady removal thereafter is an indication of the adsorption equilibrium 85 and the decline in removal at high dose might have resulted from the aggregation of adsorbent particles on the other hand adsorbed amount q e decreased sharply at low adsorbent doses and gradually increase at high adsorbent doses this occurred due to the increase in the number of spared active sites which do not participate in adsorption with the increase in adsorbent dose at unaltered concentration of adsorbate aggregation of adsorbent particles at higher adsorbent doses also played role in the case of reduction of adsorbed amount taking the highest removal percentage good adsorbed amount and efficient utilization of adsorbent into account 0 25 g l was fixed as optimal adsorbent dose and set as an experimental condition for further studies 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism of go for the removal of pb go possesses various oxygen containing functional groups such as epoxide carboxylic and hydroxyl functional groups these groups play an important role in the efficient removal of heavy metals pb generally the adsorption of cationic heavy metals like pb on go surface mainly involves the electrostatic attraction cation pi interaction and ionic interaction between the opposite charges and surface complexation 86 scheme 2 represents the possible adsorption mechanism of pb ions on go surface from an aqueous solution 3 2 5 kinetic studies in order to interpret the adsorption mechanism experimental data were analyzed by lagergren s pseudo first order ho s pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion models the linearized forms of the pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and weber morris intraparticle diffusion models are expressed by eqs 5 6 7 and 8 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 7 q t ln a e b e b e 1 b e ln t 8 q t k i t 0 5 c i non linear forms of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models are expressed in eqs 9 and 10 9 q t q e 1 ⅇ k 1 t 10 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q e is adsorbed amount at equilibrium mg g 1 q t is adsorbed amount at time t mg g 1 k 1 is rate constant associated with pseudo first order model g mg 1 min 1 k 2 is rate constant associated with pseudo second order model g mg 1 min 1 a e is regarded as initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min 1 b e is related to the magnitude of surface coverage and activation energy for chemisorption g mg 1 k i is rate constant associated with intraparticle diffusion model mg g 1 min 0 5 and c i is a constant and proportional to boundary layer thickness mg g 1 the linear fitting of the pseudo second order model can give spurious results taking that into account the experimental data were fitted to both the linear and non linear form of pseudo first and pseudo second order models 87 the parameters estimated from the fittings of pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion models fig 5 a f are given in table 3 from the correlation coefficients r2 of the four models it was obvious that experimental data fit best with the pseudo second order model besides calculated q e reported in table 3 values from the linear and non linear plot of pseudo second order model were similar to experimental q e values experimental values of q e are 34 53 and 52 13 mg g 1 for 10 and 20 ppm of pb respectively therefore it can be said that pb adsorption on go is best described by the pseudo second order kinetics 3 2 6 isotherm studies isotherm models give valuable insight into the mechanism of adsorption the nature of active sites and the capacity of an adsorbent to study isotherms experimental data were fitted to langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherms fig 6 a f the linear forms of the langmuir freundlich temkin and d r isotherm models are expressed by the eqs 11 12 13 and 14 11 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m 12 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 13 q e rt b ln k t rt b ln c e 14 ln q e ln q m k e

dimensionless langmuir adsorption constant k f refers to freundlich adsorption constant mg1 1 nl 1 n g 1 n is a constant related to adsorption intensity r is the universal gas constant j k 1 mol 1 t

linear forms of langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations are expressed in equation17 and 18 17 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 18 q e k f c e 1 n parameters obtained from the plots of langmuir freundlich temkin and d r isotherms are presented in table 4 from the correlation coefficient r2 values of both four models it was apparent that langmuir isotherm showed best fitting r2 0 999 in comparison to the other three isotherms at 20 and 30 c according to the assumptions of langmuir isotherm at 20 and 30 c monolayer of pb is formed on the energetically equivalent sites of the homogenous surface of go and the heat of adsorption is independent of surface coverage 89 90 while at higher temperature 40 c freundlich isotherm is more appropriate in describing the adsorption mechanism r2 0 999 it is likely that surface homogeneity is distorted at that temperature and adsorption is not limited to monolayer formation 91 several studies advised non linear fitting to describe the parameters of langmuir and freundlich isotherm 92 94 the maximum adsorption capacity q m calculated from non linear fitting of langmuir isotherm was found to be 55 80 54 03 and 51 82 mg g 1 at 20 30 and 40 c respectively the adsorption capacity did not vary significantly with temperature a list of adsorption capacities of several adsorbents and the contact time to reach adsorption equilibrium for the removal of pb is reported in table 5 it is obvious that the go of this work showed better or similar adsorption capacity compared to the other adsorbents even though some of these adsorbents such as ethylene diamine modified multi walled carbon nanotube rgo fe2o3 magnetic nanocomposite and rgo aerogel required a more complicated preparation method time is another important factor in wastewater treatment in this present work the adsorption equilibrium was attained in just 20 min which is the quickest compared to the previous studies listed in table 5 3 2 7 thermodynamic parameters to study the feasibility of the adsorption process changes in enthalpy δh and entropy s were determined by plotting eq 19 shown in fig 7 gibbs free energy δg associated with each different temperature was calculated from the eq 20 19 ln q e c e δh rt s r 20 δg δh t s where r is the universal gas constant j k 1 mol 1 t is the fixed temperature during the adsorption k the calculated data of the thermodynamic parameters are given in table 6 the negative value of enthalpy change δh suggests that the adsorption was an exothermic process the release of heat might have been caused by the diminished kinetic energy of pb ions while adsorbed onto the solid surface of go 95 entropy change s was negative which indicates that the randomness of the entities in solution decreased as a result of adsorption change in gibbs free energy δg was negative at all the three temperatures which signifies that the adsorption was spontaneous over the studied range of temperature the δg value increased with the increase in temperature that is to say higher temperature does not favor the adsorption 3 2 8 stability and reusability stability and reusability are the most important parameters for any adsorbent and these parameters are highly advantageous for environmental and economic reasons therefore the reusability and stability of the adsorbent were evaluated in six successive cycles in this work we have used 0 1 m h2so4 for the regeneration of the adsorbent the change of the removal percentage was depicted in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the go adsorbent was still capable of removing 90 pb after 6 successive cycles this proved that the go prepared from waste dry cell batteries has superior stability and reusability 3 2 9 statistical analysis all experimental data were studied by performing triplicate measurements and the mean results were calculated the regression coefficient r2 and constant values of isotherms langmuir freundlich and temkin and kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion were studied by using the statistical program of sigma plot 10 0 96 4 conclusion in this study graphene oxide was prepared from graphite electrodes of waste dry cell batteries and was utilized as a low cost adsorbent for the removal of toxic pb from water the prepared go has various oxygen containing functional groups which enhanced the removal of pb ion adsorption from water due to negatively charged functional groups high surface area and the rough texture of the surface go exhibited remarkable superior adsorption of pb ions from aqueous solution with a very low adsorbent dose 0 25 g l from our study we can see that the adsorption equilibrium 98 87 removal was established within a very short time 20 min the experimental data for the adsorption of pb on go fitted langmuir isotherm very well and the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 55 80 mg g 1 moreover the adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic within 20 40 c in addition the go adsorbent can be regenerated and capable of removing 90 pb after 6 successive cycles considering the results this study could find an important application of waste

13135,lead pb is a concerning water pollutant worldwide as it is highly toxic to living organisms in this research adsorption studies were carried out for the removal of pb from water graphene oxide go was used as adsorbent which was synthesized by modified hummers method using graphite from waste dry cell battery the prepared go was characterized by fesem tem xrd bet raman ftir and elemental analysis which revealed that the highly porous go was successfully prepared from graphite rod of waste dry cell battery batch experiments were performed to investigate the effects of ph contact time adsorbent dose on the adsorption process and optimum condition for adsorption was determined experiments showed 98 87 removal of pb 10 ppm in a very short time 20 min at ph 4 while adsorbent dose was 0 25 gl 1 the oxygenated groups on the surface of go played a crucial role in the adsorption of pb on go experimental data were tested against kinetic and adsorption isotherm models the adsorption process followed pseudo second order kinetics langmuir isotherm at lower temperature 20 and 30 c and freundlich isotherm at higher temperature 40 c the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 55 80 54 03 and 51 83 mg g 1 at 20 30 and 40 c respectively thermodynamic studies suggested the adsorption was exothermic and spontaneous under 20 40 c which indicates that adsorption was feasible therefore this study represents a rapid and efficient method in reducing water contamination caused by pb keywords adsorbent graphite powder graphene oxide lead dry cell battery 1 introduction the

industries throughout the world 1 3 these industries have since been ceaselessly releasing pollutants into the water air and soil at an unprecedented rate and polluting the surface water and groundwater with various toxic heavy metals pb is one of the highly toxic heavy metals which is generated from various industrial activities applications such as printing pigments mining electroplating glass dyeing lead battery textile and explosive manufacturing process 4 7 pb being non biodegradable persists in water accumulates in living organisms sediments and sludge and enters into the food chain 8 11 according to the world health organization and environmental protection agency the maximum allowable limit of lead in drinking water are 0 01 mg l and 0 015 mg l respectively and the permissible effluent discharge limit of lead in surface water bodies is 0 1 mg l 12 13 exposure to lead poses a serious threat to human health it has been reported to be linked with cognitive disorders 14 15 peripheral neuropathy 16 anemia 17 hypertension 18 renal damage 19 low fertility 20 21 miscarriage 22 and depressive disorder 23 children are more vulnerable to pb toxicity than adults 24 25 therefore pb containing wastewater must be treated before releasing into the water bodies there are various heavy metal removal technologies and methods such as chemical precipitation 26 ion exchange 27 membrane filtration 28 29 evaporation 30 reverse osmosis 31 flotation 32 coagulation flocculation 33 electrochemical deposition 34 and adsorption 35 these methods have their drawbacks for

as they leach chemicals and metals generally graphite electrodes of dry cell batteries do not undergo corrosion change hence these can be used for the synthesis of go reutilization of these graphite electrodes in preparing go provides a great solution to waste management and opens a new route in finding easy raw materials for go preparation although in some reports commercial go and go based nanocomposites have been used to remove heavy metals which is not cost effective to find a cost effective way waste product derived graphene oxide is a better solution to remove toxic pb from aqueous solution 56 57 to the best of our knowledge no such reports have yet been reported that used graphite electrodes from waste dry cell batteries to prepare go for using it as an adsorbent for the removal of pb from water in this study we have synthesized go from graphite electrodes recovered from waste dry cell batteries which we used as an adsorbent to remove pb from aqueous solution the prepared go was characterized by fesem tem xrd bet raman ftir and elemental analyzer to find the optimum adsorption conditions we have studied the effects of ph contact time and dose furthermore adsorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics were studied to investigate the adsorption mechanism efficiency and viability 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals lead standard solution 1000 mg l pb

cell batteries were collected from marketplaces and households graphite rods were separated from waste dry cells carefully using pliers the electrodes were rubbed by paper and washed with deionized water several times to clean adhering paste of mno2 nh4cl and carbon they were then air dried for 48 h and ground into a fine powder using mortar and pestle after that the graphite powder was treated with aqua regia to remove inorganic impurities and was washed several times with di water then it was dried at 60 c for 24 h scheme 1 shows the schematic illustration of the preparation of graphite powder from waste dry cell batteries 2 4 synthesis of graphene oxide graphene oxide was prepared by the modified hummers method 58 1 g of graphite powder subsequently 6 g of kmno4 was added slowly in a solution of h2so4 120 ml and h3po4 14 ml ratio 9 1 v v with stirring the mixture was heated for 6 h at 50 c with constant stirring till the mixture appeared dark green after that the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and set up in an ice bath 400 ml water and 3 ml 30 h2o2 were added with stirring to remove excess kmno4 the temperature was kept nearly 0 c with ice bath due to the occurrence of exothermic reaction at this stage then the mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm the resultant precipitate was washed with water afterward with 30 hcl for the removal of metallic impurities it was then washed with water again for chloride removal and finally with ethanol thus prepared go was dried at 45 c for 48 h in a vacuum drying oven 2 5 adsorption studies a stock aqueous solution of pb was prepared from standard 1000 ppm pb solution which was later used to make solutions of required concentrations 20 ml of pb solution was placed in erlenmeyer flasks of capacity 50 ml the ph was adjusted using hcl and naoh following that a certain amount of go was added and subjected to shaking after a certain shaking time the adsorption mixture was centrifuged and filtered with 0 45 μm chromafil xtra syringe filter concentrations of pb solutions were measured before and after adsorption by flame atomic absorption spectrometer optimum condition for adsorption was studied by changing ph 2 12 of pb solution adsorbent dosage 100 1250 mg l contact time 5 120 min and maintained in experiments for kinetic and isotherm studies contact time was variable in kinetic studies and initial concentration of pb solution was variable in isotherm studies experiments for thermodynamic studies were conducted at three different temperatures 20 30 and 40 c removal percentage was calculated by eq 1 1 removal percentage c o c t c o 100 adsorbed amount at time t q t and amount adsorbed at equilibrium q e were calculated by eqs 2 and 3 2 q t c o c t m v 3 q e c o c e m v where c o c t and c e are the initial at time t and equilibrium concentration of pb solution respectively mg l m is the adsorbent dose in gram v represents the volume of pb solution taken for batch experiments in liter 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent 3 1 1 fesem edx and tem analysis fesem and tem are very essential to understand the morphological properties of adsorbents in our study we have taken fesem images of the adsorbent before and after pb adsorption fig 1 a b shows the fesem images of go adsorbent at two different magnifications these images revealed that the surface of prepared go was highly porous scaly and layered theoretically these properties of any adsorbent enhanced the adsorption of heavy metals 59 fig 1 c d shows the fesem images of go after pb adsorption the aggregated particles appeared on the go surface which proved that the pb was adsorbed by go after anchoring of pb on go the surface appeared comparatively smooth and this smoothness might have resulted from the interaction of pb with the surface of graphene oxide 60 the edx analysis further confirmed the adsorption of pb onto the graphene oxide no pb was found in the go however after adsorption 2 07 wt pb was found given in fig 1 e f to understand the more insight into the surface morphology tem images of go before and after lead adsorption was recorded fig 1 g i the morphology of go consists of well defined multilayers with many wrinkles fig 1 g for which it can be again claimed that the prepared go has a large surface area pb particles were clearly observed on the go surface after pb adsorption fig 1 h i 3 1 2 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra of graphite go before and after lead adsorption are shown in fig 2 a the spectra of graphite showed no significant peak apart from a weak peak for benzene derivative which indicates the inadequacy of graphite as an adsorbent while in the go spectra many significant peaks showed up indicating the inclusion of different functional groups in the carbon framework 61 the ftir spectrum of go fig 2 a showed a strong and broad band around 3350 cm 1 which is attributed to the stretching mode of o h hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 62 the absorption band that appeared at 1710 cm 1 is characteristic of the stretching mode of co carboxyl group 62 the strong peaks occurring around 1010 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 are indicative of c o c stretching epoxy groups and aromatic cc stretching respectively 63 65 the peak that appeared at 707 cm 1 is characteristic of the ch bond from aromatic benzene 66 and the co2 adsorbed on go appeared at 2350 cm 1 67 so the ft ir results confirm that the graphite recovered from waste dry cell batteries was successfully oxidized and the prepared go is filled with oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl epoxy carboxyl carbonyl which may serve as active sites for pb adsorption 68 in contrast the ftir spectrum of pb adsorbed go show some change in intensities of some peaks after the accumulation of pb on go the intensities of all peaks significantly reduced which indicates that oxygenated functional groups of go may be involved in binding of pb 69 70 to further investigate the adsorption capacity of graphite and go adsorption study was performed in presence of 10 ppm pb solution and the results are shown in table 1 in this case it is clear that the prepared go shows notably higher removal percentage and amount adsorbed mg g 1 compared to the graphite powder derived from waste dry cell batteries 3 1 3 xrd x ray diffraction patterns for graphite powder recovered from waste dry cell battery and the go are shown in fig 2 b the diffraction peak for graphite powder shows a sharp peak at 2θ 26 5 corresponding to the 002 plane and the interlayer distance 0 34 nm calculated using braggs equation which have similarities with the previous reports 71 after oxidation of graphite powder the diffraction peak for graphene oxide shows at 2θ 11 34 corresponding to the 001 with interlayer distance of 0 77 nm which is similar to the previous literature 71 the interlayer distance of go is higher than graphite powder due to the incorporation of oxygenated functional groups in go in addition the appearance of diffraction peak at 2θ 43 corresponds to the turbostratic disorder carbon materials 54 3 1 4 raman analysis raman spectroscopy is a very useful technique to determine the possible structural defects and disorders in graphene based materials the raman spectra of graphite powder and go shown in fig 2 c consist of a set of two distinct peaks corresponding to the d and g bands respectively the g band is a result of in plane vibrations of sp2 bonded carbon atoms whereas the d band is due to out of plane vibrations attributed to the presence of structural defects the g band is observed at 1356 cm 1 1359 cm 1 and the d band at 1582 cm 1 and 1595 cm 1 for graphite and go respectively the intensity ratio of id ig provides direct evidence of the degree of defects present in go surface 54 the id ig ratio of go 0 95 is higher than graphite 0 7 which confirms the grafting of oxygenated functional groups to the graphitic planes 54 the peak observed at 2700 cm 1 is known as the 2d band which is related to the number of layer presence in go the ratio of 2d g is 1 which confirmed that the prepared go is multilayer structure 72 74 3 1 5 elemental analysis the elemental composition of graphite powder and prepared go has been analyzed by using an elemental chns analyzer table 2 the percentage of carbon was 87 42 in graphite rods which decreased to 47 42 in the prepared go suggesting that many oxygen atoms were added into graphite to form go besides several studies reported similar c o ratio in their go preparation which suggests that the graphene oxide preparation was successful 75 76 hydrogen was observed due to the oxygen containing functional groups in go 3 1 6 bet analysis bet surface analysis is a very useful technique to characterize the surface area and porosity of the prepared adsorbent the active surface area and pore size distribution of the go were analyzed by adsorption desorption under nitrogen by bet analysis the total active specific surface area of go is 59 98 m2 g 1 fig 3 and its average pore diameter is 6 19 nm the pore size distribution of go is 3 86 nm which was studied by bjh method from the nitrogen desorption curve fig 3 b the bet properties of go prepared from waste dry cell batteries have similarities with go prepared from commercial graphite powder 77 78 3 2 adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph ph is an important factor that affects the adsorptive heavy metal removal process as the electrostatic nature of the active sites of adsorbent and the chemistry of metal are dependent on the ph of the medium 79 to investigate how the ph of pb solution affects the adsorption onto go the removal percentage of pb was observed by batch experiments at different ph ranging from 2 to 12 shown in fig 4 a removal percentage sharply increased as ph was increased from 2 to 3 then from 3 to 4 slightly positive change was observed and remained almost the same until ph 6 a similar phenomenon was reported by qianlan 80 after ph 6 removal increased slightly with increasing ph and then declined above ph 10 when the concentration of h ions is high many of the functional groups surface active sites of go become protonated resulting in electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged sites of go and pb ions which accounts for the low removal percentage at low ph increase in removal with increase in ph is due to the deprotonation of active sites which makes the surface accessible for pb adsorption the steady portion of the curve fig 4 a under ph 4 to 6 manifests the saturation of the surface with pb pb ions in an aqueous solution form different hydroxides depending on the ph of the solution 81 which is represented in eq 4 4 p b 2 pb oh pb oh 2 pb oh 3 pb oh 4 2 increase in ph a visible white precipitate was observed in the aqueous solution of pb above ph 6 this indicates that removal above ph 6 was caused by both precipitation of pb ions as pb oh 2 and adsorption as pb2 and pb oh ions the decline in removal after ph 10 was due to the increase in the concentration of pb oh 3 and pb oh 4 2 ions which experience a repulsive electrostatic force at the negatively charged adsorbent sites developed at high ph considering the precipitation phenomenon at higher ph and removal percentage ph 4 was selected as optimal ph and maintained in the other studies 3 2 2 effect of contact time for economical and effective wastewater treatment contact time is an important consideration to investigate the effect of contact time removal percentage was observed at various shaking durations from 5 to 120 min shown in fig 4 b initially adsorption was very fast initially and 92 of pb ions was removed in the first 5 min this is due to the plenty of available active sites and high concentration of pb as the number of available active sites and concentration of pb decreased with the contact time the increase in removal after 5 min was gradual and stopped at 20 min reaching 98 87 removal was pretty much steady after 20 min which is very short time compared to the previous studies 82 84 20 min of contact time was considered as adsorption equilibrium time and maintained in further studies 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dose for proper utilization of adsorbent knowledge of the effect of adsorbent dose on adsorption is imperative to explore optimal adsorbent dose batch experiments were carried out with different amounts of go as shown in fig 4 c removal percentage increased sharply with increasing adsorbent dose from 0 1 to 0 25 g l stood steady with further increase in the adsorbent dose and showed a slight decline at high adsorbent doses the rise in removal with dose is associated with the increased number of active sites the steady removal thereafter is an indication of the adsorption equilibrium 85 and the decline in removal at high dose might have resulted from the aggregation of adsorbent particles on the other hand adsorbed amount q e decreased sharply at low adsorbent doses and gradually increase at high adsorbent doses this occurred due to the increase in the number of spared active sites which do not participate in adsorption with the increase in adsorbent dose at unaltered concentration of adsorbate aggregation of adsorbent particles at higher adsorbent doses also played role in the case of reduction of adsorbed amount taking the highest removal percentage good adsorbed amount and efficient utilization of adsorbent into account 0 25 g l was fixed as optimal adsorbent dose and set as an experimental condition for further studies 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism of go for the removal of pb go possesses various oxygen containing functional groups such as epoxide carboxylic and hydroxyl functional groups these groups play an important role in the efficient removal of heavy metals pb generally the adsorption of cationic heavy metals like pb on go surface mainly involves the electrostatic attraction cation pi interaction and ionic interaction between the opposite charges and surface complexation 86 scheme 2 represents the possible adsorption mechanism of pb ions on go surface from an aqueous solution 3 2 5 kinetic studies in order to interpret the adsorption mechanism experimental data were analyzed by lagergren s pseudo first order ho s pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion models the linearized forms of the pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and weber morris intraparticle diffusion models are expressed by eqs 5 6 7 and 8 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 7 q t ln a e b e b e 1 b e ln t 8 q t k i t 0 5 c i non linear forms of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models are expressed in eqs 9 and 10 9 q t q e 1 ⅇ k 1 t 10 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q e is adsorbed amount at equilibrium mg g 1 q t is adsorbed amount at time t mg g 1 k 1 is rate constant associated with pseudo first order model g mg 1 min 1 k 2 is rate constant associated with pseudo second order model g mg 1 min 1 a e is regarded as initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min 1 b e is related to the magnitude of surface coverage and activation energy for chemisorption g mg 1 k i is rate constant associated with intraparticle diffusion model mg g 1 min 0 5 and c i is a constant and proportional to boundary layer thickness mg g 1 the linear fitting of the pseudo second order model can give spurious results taking that into account the experimental data were fitted to both the linear and non linear form of pseudo first and pseudo second order models 87 the parameters estimated from the fittings of pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion models fig 5 a f are given in table 3 from the correlation coefficients r2 of the four models it was obvious that experimental data fit best with the pseudo second order model besides calculated q e reported in table 3 values from the linear and non linear plot of pseudo second order model were similar to experimental q e values experimental values of q e are 34 53 and 52 13 mg g 1 for 10 and 20 ppm of pb respectively therefore it can be said that pb adsorption on go is best described by the pseudo second order kinetics 3 2 6 isotherm studies isotherm models give valuable insight into the mechanism of adsorption the nature of active sites and the capacity of an adsorbent to study isotherms experimental data were fitted to langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherms fig 6 a f the linear forms of the langmuir freundlich temkin and d r isotherm models are expressed by the eqs 11 12 13 and 14 11 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m 12 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 13 q e rt b ln k t rt b ln c e 14 ln q e ln q m k e

linear forms of langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations are expressed in equation17 and 18 17 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 18 q e k f c e 1 n parameters obtained from the plots of langmuir freundlich temkin and d r isotherms are presented in table 4 from the correlation coefficient r2 values of both four models it was apparent that langmuir isotherm showed best fitting r2 0 999 in comparison to the other three isotherms at 20 and 30 c according to the assumptions of langmuir isotherm at 20 and 30 c monolayer of pb is formed on the energetically equivalent sites of the homogenous surface of go and the heat of adsorption is independent of surface coverage 89 90 while at higher temperature 40 c freundlich isotherm is more appropriate in describing the adsorption mechanism r2 0 999 it is likely that surface homogeneity is distorted at that temperature and adsorption is not limited to monolayer formation 91 several studies advised non linear fitting to describe the parameters of langmuir and freundlich isotherm 92 94 the maximum adsorption capacity q m calculated from non linear fitting of langmuir isotherm was found to be 55 80 54 03 and 51 82 mg g 1 at 20 30 and 40 c respectively the adsorption capacity did not vary significantly with temperature a list of adsorption capacities of several adsorbents and the contact time to reach adsorption equilibrium for the removal of pb is reported in table 5 it is obvious that the go of this work showed better or similar adsorption capacity compared to the other adsorbents even though some of these adsorbents such as ethylene diamine modified multi walled carbon nanotube rgo fe2o3 magnetic nanocomposite and rgo aerogel required a more complicated preparation method time is another important factor in wastewater treatment in this present work the adsorption equilibrium was attained in just 20 min which is the quickest compared to the previous studies listed in table 5 3 2 7 thermodynamic parameters to study the feasibility of the adsorption process changes in enthalpy δh and entropy s were determined by plotting eq 19 shown in fig 7 gibbs free energy δg associated with each different temperature was calculated from the eq 20 19 ln q e c e δh rt s r 20 δg δh t s where r is the universal gas constant j k 1 mol 1 t is the fixed temperature during the adsorption k the calculated data of the thermodynamic parameters are given in table 6 the negative value of enthalpy change δh suggests that the adsorption was an exothermic process the release of heat might have been caused by the diminished kinetic energy of pb ions while adsorbed onto the solid surface of go 95 entropy change s was negative which indicates that the randomness of the entities in solution decreased as a result of adsorption change in gibbs free energy δg was negative at all the three temperatures which signifies that the adsorption was spontaneous over the studied range of temperature the δg value increased with the increase in temperature that is to say higher temperature does not favor the adsorption 3 2 8 stability and reusability stability and reusability are the most important parameters for any adsorbent and these parameters are highly advantageous for environmental and economic reasons therefore the reusability and stability of the adsorbent were evaluated in six successive cycles in this work we have used 0 1 m h2so4 for the regeneration of the adsorbent the change of the removal percentage was depicted in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the go adsorbent was still capable of removing 90 pb after 6 successive cycles this proved that the go prepared from waste dry cell batteries has superior stability and reusability 3 2 9 statistical analysis all experimental data were studied by performing triplicate measurements and the mean results were calculated the regression coefficient r2 and constant values of isotherms langmuir freundlich and temkin and kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion were studied by using the statistical program of sigma plot 10 0 96 4 conclusion in this study graphene oxide was prepared from graphite electrodes of waste dry cell batteries and was utilized as a low cost adsorbent for the removal of toxic pb from water the prepared go has various oxygen containing functional groups which enhanced the removal of pb ion adsorption from water due to negatively charged functional groups high surface area and the rough texture of the surface go exhibited remarkable superior adsorption of pb ions from aqueous solution with a very low adsorbent dose 0 25 g l from our study we can see that the adsorption equilibrium 98 87 removal was established within a very short time 20 min the experimental data for the adsorption of pb on go fitted langmuir isotherm very well and the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 55 80 mg g 1 moreover the adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic within 20 40 c in addition the go adsorbent can be regenerated and capable of removing 90 pb after 6 successive cycles considering the results this study could find an important application of waste

13136,household based ceramic filters amended with metal iron showed great potential to remove arsenic as from groundwater gw due to their low cost and minimal maintenance requirements the present study assessed the as removal performance of iron amended ceramic filters cfs with two different filter configurations including single unit ceramic filter sucf and double unit ceramic filter ducf fifteen sucfs and one ducf were tested at different households in the khulna bagerhat region of bangladesh with freshly withdrawn gw having as and fe concentrations ranging from 141 to 585 μg l and 0 16 mg l respectively sucfs achieved as effluents below the standard level 50 μg l from medium as gw 41 231 μg l whereas ducf was efficient for high as gw 288 585 μg l removing as 86 and fe 99 below the standard limit principal component analysis pca demonstrated that as removal efficiency was positively influenced by fe and ca and negatively by as concentrations fe2 released from the amended iron net has a significant contribution to the as removal in the cfs x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis detected the presence of fe3 p si and ca on the surface of the iron net leading to insufficient fe dissolution to remove as overall it is recommended to use sucfs for low to medium as gw and ducfs for high as gw the cfs with affordable cost easy operation and minimal maintenance can produce sufficient quantity 60 80 l d to fulfill the daily drinking water demand in the rural households of developing countries keywords ceramic filter arsenic removal groundwater compositions pca analysis iron net fe2 1 introduction mass poisoning of arsenic as contamination in groundwater sources becomes a major challenge for safe drinking water supply worldwide including bangladesh india and the rest of the subcontinent 1 recently widespread groundwater arsenic contamination in vietnam cambodia and china have been reported 2 continued consumption of as contaminated water causes serious human health risks as well as severe environmental concerns 3 4 as per the world health organization who guidelines of safe drinking water the maximum permissible limit of as is 10 μg l 5 however the limit has been relaxed to 50 μg l for bangladesh where about 97 99 of drinking water and 86 90 of irrigation water relies on groundwater 6 8 currently groundwater in most more than 50 parts of bangladesh exceeds the permissible limit 50 μg l of as 6 9 10 the arsenic contamination map of bangladesh is presented in fig 1 commonly in groundwater arsenic mainly exists in two inorganic forms arsenate as v h2aso4 or haso4 2 and arsenite as iii h3aso3 or haso2 arsenate exists principally as oxyanions under oxidizing conditions and as arsenite under mildly reducing conditions arsenite is the most common species in anaerobic groundwater with a more toxic form and is generally removed less efficiently than the oxidized arsenate by the conventional treatment methods such as adsorption and precipitation 11 12 until now several household and community level technologies for as mitigation from groundwater have been introduced and tested these include adsorption and co precipitation e g with iron or aluminum salts 11 ion exchange 13 coagulation flocculation 14 membrane technologies 15 electro ultra filtration 16 and biological processes 17 however several factors including cost intensiveness high energy and chemicals requirements complicacy of operation and maintenance lack of ownership and social mobilization restrain the long term sustainability of these technologies in developing countries 18 19 for keeping the existing shallow groundwater wells usable a simple low cost household based treatment system could be a viable option for providing safe drinking water in as affected regions of developing countries 20 an effective and accepted as mitigation mechanism is the oxidation of fe2 and co removal of both as and fe through filtration the removal efficiency of this system greatly depends on the fraction of fe to as fe as in the groundwater as reported in the earlier studies the mass ratio of fe as 50 is required for reducing as to below 50 μg l while the mass ratio of fe as 250 reduces as concentration to 10 μg l 21 22 in the case of insufficiency of fe2 in groundwater required fe2 can be added to the system through single step or multi step for this purpose the use of fe 0 zero valent iron is reported as a convenient and inexpensive source of fe2 23 based on such mechanisms several household based as removal filters including sono filter composed of a composite iron matrix kanchan arsenic filter composed of iron nails two kolshi filter composed of ferric chloride and three kolshi filter composed of iron filings have been developed and implemented in as affected regions 24 27 however these filters experienced challenges associated with filter media maintenance high cost and high clogging frequency of sand beds 18 therefore fe2 oxidation co precipitation with as and subsequent filtration through medium cost low maintenance ceramic filters could be a practicable replacement such ceramic filters could be made with local materials and skills and have already proven to be socially acceptable as household based safe drinking water supply options to control diarrheal diseases 28 in the previous studies a low cost easy to operate and maintain household based arsenic removal ceramic filter cf was formulated and confirmed its as removal performance in a rural area of bangladesh 29 31 the porous cylindrical ceramic unit was made with clay soil and rice bran and nested with an iron metal net to fabricate the filter the iron metal net acted as a source of zero valent iron fe 0 and releases fe2 after the subsequent iron oxidation and or co precipitation as was trapped by the ceramic unit and subsequently removed from the water after a successful laboratory investigation 29 the filters were tested for the natural groundwater in a rural community of bangladesh 30 31 the filed results revealed that cfs effectively removed as from the low contaminated groundwater 250 μg l 30 and a simple pre aeration step significantly improved the removal efficacy 31 however the effect of groundwater compositions on as removal was not evaluated in depth moreover the role of the iron net the filter configuration and cfs operational procedure were not elucidated in the previous studies therefore based on the gw compositions it is important to explicate the different filter configurations and modes of operations of the cfs for a prevalent mitigation strategy the present study investigated as removal performances of the iron amended cfs with different filter configurations for different compositions of groundwater the aims of this research are to i examine the single unit and double unit cfs for as removal from the contaminated groundwater and ii investigate the influence of groundwater compositions on the as removal efficiency iii investigate the role of the iron net on as removal and iv clarify the operational and maintenance procedures of the cfs for field investigation households having as contaminated shallow tubewells were selected in the khulna bagerhat region of bangladesh 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceramic filters cfs construction fig 2a shows a schematic of the cfs constructed and employed in this study to manufacture the cf the cylindrical shaped ceramic candle was affixed at the bottom of a reactor 14 l clay vessel followed by the nesting with an iron net as a source of fe 0 finally the cf unit was placed on a wooden stand shaping the whole form a collection bucket plastic made was placed under the wooden stand to collect the treated water clay soil and rice bran were used with a mix ratio of 80 20 to make the ceramic candle and the details can be found in the authors previous study 29 the clay soil used for preparing the ceramic candle contained 40 sand 52 silt and 8 clay 29 the fired ceramic candle was cylindrical in shape fig 2a having 61 porosity and pore size of 1 5 μm 29 scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x ray spectrometry sem eds analysis of the ceramic candle unit indicated the presence of c o si fe and al which was reported in the authors previous study 32 furthermore analysis of chemical including trace elements and mineralogical compositions of clay soil rice bran and the iron net is necessary to understand their role in as removal 2 2 single and double unit ceramic filter two sets of ceramic filters including single unit ceramic filter sucf and double unit ceramic filter ducf were tested in the present study fig 2a shows both types of cf one set of cf was used to form sucf and tested for as removal performance from all gw whereas two sets of cfs were used to form the double unit ceramic filter ducf that enhanced the as removal efficacy of the highly as contaminated groundwater to below the bangladesh standard of 50 μg l 2 3 site selection cfs installation and field operations all cfs operations were conducted under the natural field conditions of bangladesh three widespread as contaminated areas were selected for the field trials where 66 of groundwater surpassed the national standard limit of as 50 μg l 6 fig s1 shows the study area with locations of sub districts i e rupsha fakirhat and mollahat in the khulna bagerhat region fifteen household owned tubewells were randomly selected from these three sub districts to install the sucfs cf1 to cf15 the cf operational procedures in field conditions are presented in fig 2b and the details can be seen in hasan et al 30 the cf operations were initiated by a simple and energy free pre aeration process of freshly withdrawn gw tubewells water as presented in fig 2b the pre aeration process was carried out using two buckets by alternating the freshly withdrawn gw at least 5 6 times before feeding to the cfs a 2 3 min long and energy free pre aeration process was performed for increasing the dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp of gw that eventually enhanced the oxidation of groundwater fe2 and made the whole system low cost and sustainable immediately after the pre aeration 14 l groundwater was fed to the reactors clay vessel once a day to filter by gravitational pressure fifteen sucfs cf1 cf15 were primarily operated continuously for around 3 weeks 22 days additionally a ducf was installed and operated at the same household of cf2 having average groundwater as concentration of 504 μg l a control experiment control cf were also conducted with the same household of cf15 without iron net in it to clarify the role of the materials used for ceramic candle on as removal 2 4 on

cleaned on day 14 due to the flow rate slowdown during the cleaning process the iron net was moved out and the surface of the ceramic filter candle was cleaned manually by scrubbing with a soft cloth to remove the accumulated suspended solids the surface of the iron net was also cleaned by scrubbing and rinsing with clean water and set back to the filter the filtration operation continued immediately after cleaning to investigate the effects of cleaning on the treatment efficiency of the cfs 2 6 analytical procedure for on site measurement the horiba d 54s meter horiba japan was used to measure ph orp and ec concentrations and the hach hq30d meter was used for do and temperature measurement aqua check eco test strips were used for the on site measurement of alkalinity hardness

iron net after the filter operation at the end of the filter operation the iron nets from the cfs were taken out air dried and used for xps analysis without any further preprocess such as washing xps

the gw compositions of 15 tubewells used in this study based on the measured as in the gw of different areas of bangladesh 6 the contamination levels can be defined as high medium and low the high as gw cf1 cf7 having as concentrations of more than 250 μg l 288 565 μg l whereas gw cf8 cf15 having concentrations between 250 μg l and 50 μg l was defined as medium as gw table 1 the as levels meeting drinking water standards i e 0 to 50 μg l can be considered as low however the concentrations of as and fe in all the collected gw samples exceeded the standard limits for drinking water the main source of high as concentration in groundwater is thought to be the sedimentary bengal basin which was formed by the deposition of a large volume of arsenic containing sediments originated from the himalayas oxidation of the arsenical pyrites in this alluvial sediment released as into the groundwater 1 moreover anthropogenic activities such as excessive groundwater abstraction and the use of arsenical pesticides in agriculture and wood preservation increased as in this region 1 ph orp temperature do and alkalinity did not vary significantly p 0 05 among the gw samples which were measured as 6 99 7 23 109 to 139 mv 26 7 28 1 c 2 5 3 4 mg l and 187 190 mg l respectively the range of ph orp and do indicate a reducing condition in the gw where most of the fe and as were present as fe2 and as iii 31 34 high concentrations of bicarbonate hco3 were observed in the groundwater table 1 indicated the dominance of this anion in the study area a previous study reported that groundwater in this area is dominated by na in the cations and interplays of hco3 and cl in anions with the influence of marine water 35 a relatively wide range of ec was found among the gw samples varying from 0 66 1 82 ms cm the higher range of ec in the gw indicated the enrichment of dissolved salts intruded from the nearby coast of the studied area manganese mn concentrations varied from 0 06 1 16 mg l and were found 2 3 times higher than the standard limit of 0 05 mg l 5 po4 p no2 n and no3 n concentrations were found 0 20 2 43 mg l 1 1 1 4 mg l and 0 10 0 16 mg l respectively concentrations of ca mg and si ranged between 100 152 mg l 23 6 80 mg l and 14 1 23 7 mg l respectively total organic carbon toc varied from 2 0 to 12 3 mg l in the gw samples that might be migrated from the adjacent soil to the shallow aquifers of this region the data revealed that in high as contaminated groundwater the concentrations of fe mn ec ca and mg were significantly p 0 05 lower as compared to the medium as gw fig 3 other parameters including p and si did not exhibit considerable variation p 0 05 among the two groups the overall gw compositions indicate a wide deviation of the water quality parameters that may significantly impact the as removal performances of the cfs hence it is required to identify the key parameters and operational procedures to enhance the as removal efficiency of cfs 3 2 removal performance of sucfs fig 4 presents the as removal performances of the sucfs with high as gw cf1 cf7 and medium as gw cf8 cf15 based on the analysis all sucfs with medium as gw achieved as effluents below the safe levels 50 μg l on the contrary all of the cfs with high as gw failed to remove as to effluent to below 50 μg l sucfs with medium as gw achieved average effluent concentrations ranging from 24 5 to 50 0 μg l corresponding to 65 88 removal sucfs with high as gw achieved average effluent as between 72 and 177 μg l corresponding to 66 74 removal the removals of as in all sucfs were consistent with the time of operation with a small deviation presented in fig 4c and d indicating the stability of sucfs productivity the as concentration in the effluent of control cf without the iron net and zero groundwater fe2 presented in fig 4b and d revealed that ceramic candle negligibly p 0 05 affected as removal and the effluent concentrations were consistent throughout the filter operations some natural geological clay materials like lignite bentonite and shale have some affinity to adsorb as 36 in the present study clay soil used to prepare the ceramic candle was fired at 900 c and most probably lost its chemical and morphological properties to adsorb as from the groundwater fig 5a presents the influent and effluent fe concentrations and removal of all sucfs irrespective of the concentrations of influent fe more than 99 fe was removed in all the sucfs with both high and medium as gw achieving effluent concentration of 0 1 mg l ph orp and do of the feed water in the cfs and corresponding eh ph diagram are illustrated in fig s2 supplementary materials ph eh and do of the feed water increased to 7 3 7 9 371 424 mv and 5 9 6 9 mg l respectively fig s2a in supplementary materials the increase of ph and do in the cfs were due to the stripping of co2 and the penetrating of o2 in the groundwater during the process of aeration moreover the iron dissolution from the iron net and their oxidation process is well known for the increasing ph in the system 37 the eh ph diagram constructed using the measured ph and orp values showed that the species distribution of fe of all the feed water in the cfs aerated groundwater fell within the fe oh 3 region fig s2b the half life t1 2 of fe2 oxidation to fe3 is 2 3 min at ph 7 5 8 0 under a relatively higher do 11 38 moreover as reported in the previous studies at ph above 4 5 ferrous ions are rapidly oxidized and precipitated as iron oxyhydroxides scavenging arsenic from solution via co precipitation and adsorption reactions process 39 hence in the present study fe2 from the groundwater hereafter gw fe2 and that was released from the iron net hereafter released fe2 in the sucfs were effectively oxidized to form in situ hydrous ferric oxides hfo subsequently as was adsorbed and or co precipitated with the hfo and removed by filtration through the ceramic filter 27 40 furthermore as removal was enhanced through oxidation of as iii to as v by intermediates oxidants oh h2o2 and o2 produced in the cfs during fe2 oxidation 21 41 in this study the two reaction processes adsorption and or co precipitation were considered simultaneously as the overall goal was to remove total as from the groundwater nevertheless the distinguishing between adsorbed and co precipitated as would give more insights into as removal mechanism by the cfs overall the single unit sucfs was effective in removing as from the medium as gw whereas highly effective in removing fe from both high and medium as gw fig 5b f presents the removal performances of p ca mg si and mn of the sucfs significant p 0 05 removals of p 35 98 ca 20 60 and mn 45 95 were observed while removal of mg and si were insignificant and remained almost unchanged in the effluent mn removal occurred through the simultaneous oxidation of the gw fe2 and mn2 biological chemical and their subsequent precipitation 42 ca was removed due to the formation of amorphous calcium carbonate and calcite precipitate 43 p was effectively removed through the adsorption onto the in situ formed hfo flocs 29 44 as reported in the previous study the higher concentrations of p in groundwater decrease the as removal due to their affinity and competition with as v for the sorption sites of hfo flocs 29 44 high concentrations of si in groundwater reduce the as removal efficiency by reducing the formation and precipitation of hfo flocs at a ph of 7 9 45 if these elements are abundant in gw they may have a combined or individual impact on the as removal efficiency of the sucfs table 1 describes a diverse range of groundwater compositions in the study area thus the compositions of the gw and their adverse effect on the removal of as by sucfs were examined through pca and correlation analysis 3 3 identify the factor of as removal by principle components analysis pca to determine the most important factor of as removal in sucfs pca was performed for the groundwater data set along with the effluent of each cf pca is a useful technique for reducing the number of variables in a data set to a few components or factors that represent most of the variations in the original data by simplifying multiple variable interpretations thirteen measured variables including groundwater ph orp ec temp do as ca mg si mn fe as fe p and as removal were selected for pca in addition to the pca the correlation between the as removal and physico chemical parameters of groundwater were obtained in the form of pearson correlation coefficients table 2 presents factor loadings eigenvalues and the variance percentages corresponding to each principal component eigenvalues are normally used to determine the number of principal components pcs that can be retained for further study 46 as shown in table 2 the first 3 pcs account for 82 3 of the total variances of the original dataset pc1 explained 54 21 of the total variance exhibits strong positive loading on fe as ratio ec ca mg and si concentrations moderate positive loading on as removal and strong negative loading on ph do mn and as pc2 explained 16 31 of total variances and has positive loading on as removal and fe p ratio and negative loading on orp therefore loading on pc1 and pc2 revealed that the variation of as removal by the sucfs was positively correlated with the variation of groundwater fe p ec ca mg si and negatively correlated with the variation of groundwater as do ph and mn for further clarification the score plot for the first two pcs pc1 and pc2 explaining 70 32 of the total variance is presented in fig 6 the loading plot between pc1 and pc2 has four distinct groups group 1 is associated with fe ec ca mg and p group 2 is associated with influent as do ph and mn group 3 is associated with si and group 4 is associated with orp and temperature mn in groundwater generally enhances the as removal whereas p and si have a negative effect due to their competition with as for adsorption sites the pca results in the present study completely differ from the above statement as reported in the previous study such findings can be attributed to the least concentrations of mn p and si refer to table 1 that insignificantly affect the results 44 table s1 in supplementary materials presents the pearson correlation matrix of the 13 groundwater parameters with as removal consistent with the finding of pca analysis as removal significantly p 0 05 correlated with the inf fe r 0 74 inf ca r 0 68 ec r 0 55 and inf mg r 0 5 overall pca demonstrated that as removal efficiency of studied sucfs was positively and significantly influenced by the groundwater fe and ca and negatively influenced by gw as concentrations therefore the individual role of gw fe2 and released fe2 would cautiously be considered while designing the fe based as removal process moreover the presence of ca in the gw can significantly enhance the as removal under neutral and alkaline conditions in the fe based system 43 3 4 role of gw fe2 and released fe2 iron net on as removal by sucfs the iron net was added to the sucfs as an additional source of fe2 to enhance the as removal efficiency therefore the removal of as in the sucfs was accelerated by the oxidation and co precipitation of both gw fe2 and released fe2 as shown in fig 5a the gw fe2 was oxidized and effectively removed in the sucfs leaving 0 05 mg l of fe in the effluents the molar ratio of fe and as are very useful tools to examine the role of gw fe2 on as removal 47 typically a minimum fe as ratio of 54 is required to effectively remove as to below 50 μg l from the varying compositions of gw containing silicate and carbonate 48 to examine the role of gw fe2 in the present study fe as ratios of gw and corresponding levels of as in the effluents of each cf are presented in fig 7 fe as ratio ranging from 0 2 to 38 7 was found sufficient to achieve less than 50 μg l in the effluent from the medium as groundwater containing as from 141 to 231 μg l cf8 cf15 these values of fe as ratios much lower than the typical fe as ratio of 54 48 indicated the substantial contribution of released fe2 to the as removal in the sucfs to verify this supposition the impact of the iron net on as removal was investigated with the groundwater of zero gw fe2 cf15 fig 8 presents the as removal performance of cf15 for 15 days of continuous operation an average of 66 as was removed from an average of 141 μg l of groundwater as the results indicated that released fe2 from the iron net has a significant contribution to the as removal in the sucfs in the present study both naturally occurring gw fe2 and released fe2 played a crucial role in the effective as removal to gain insights into the mechanisms of arsenic removal the hfo flocs from the selected cfs cf3 cf5 and cf10 were examined through xafs l3 edge spectra along with spectra of as iii and as v standards and the results are presented in fig 9a the xafs spectra of as standards solutions were detected around 1326 ev for as iii and 1327 5 and 1331 ev for as v the spectra for all cfs flocs samples had two peaks at 1327 5 and 1331 ev indicating that as v is the major oxidation state of as adsorbed as in the cfs nevertheless a shoulder doublet left peak at 1326 1327 5 ev of the hfo samples of the cfs belongs to both oxidation states of as iii and as v thus in the present study as iii in the groundwater was oxidized to as v during the process of fe2 oxidation and adsorbed and or co precipitated with hfo flocs in the cfs in the case of high as gw adding the iron net in the sucfs was not sufficient for the effective removal of as see fig 4 cf1 cf7 the possible causes are a insufficient release of fe2 from the iron net b incomplete as adsorption due to short hydraulic residence time hrt and c the negative impact of the groundwater composition the pca analysis revealed that except for the as concentrations no other parameters in the studied groundwater have a significant negative impact on the as removal in the sucfs on the other hand based on the measured flow rate the hydraulic residence times hrt of the sucfs were calculated to be 6 11 h see fig s3 in supplementary materials these values of hrts were sufficient to oxidize fe2 as 99 of fe was removed and the subsequent adsorption of as and other contaminants as presented in figs 4 and 5 therefore the most probable reason for ineffective removal of as for the high as gw involves the insufficient release of fe2 from the iron net during the treatment operations the surface of the iron nets might be substantially oxidized while exposed to the air as they were submerged during 6 11 h filtration and partially exposed to the air during the remaining time of each day of filtration hence the iron net surfaces were partially covered with the oxidized fe as well as other contaminants such as p si and ca precipitate resulting prevent the release of fe2 fig 9 illustrates the oxidation states of the fe on the iron net after the treatment was detected through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the fe 2p spectrum in fig 10a indicates the presence of fe3 on the iron net surface no fe2 or fe0 detected on the surface indicates that the surfaces of the iron net were significantly covered with corroded fe3 leading to reduce the fe dissolution from the iron net fig 9b and c shows that the other elements such as p si and ca were detected on the surface of the iron net because p is involved in the formation of scale on the surface of the metal iron the dissolution of fe2 was probably further inhibited due to p presence on the surface of the iron net 49 moreover the formation of calcium carbonate calcite and silicate precipitate may mask the iron net surface to inhibit the formation of hfo flocs 43 45 consequently the levels of fe2 in the sucfs were not sufficient to effectively remove as from the high as groundwater which may greatly affect the efficacy of the sucfs to implement in as contaminated region to resolve this problem an alternative double unit ceramic filter ducf was proposed and tested for the high as gw 3 5 double unit ceramic filter ducf for the treatment of high as groundwater a double unit ceramic filter ducf was tested in the field with the groundwater having an average as concentration of 504 μg l same gw of cf2 the as concentrations of the influent and effluent are presented in fig 10 in the first effluent the upper unit in fig 2 average as concentrations of the treated water was 142 μg l removal rate 69 which was further reduced to an average of 59 μg l removal rate 86 in the second filtration unit 2nd effluent as shown in fig 10a as concentrations in both the first and second effluents steadily reduced as the day of operation progressed and reached less than 50 μg l below safe level at 8 days in the 2nd effluent the steady enhancement of as removal with the operation time might be caused by the adsorption of as on the accumulated fe hydroxides in the cfs fig 10b shows that more than 99 fe raw water fe 7 14 mg l removal was also achieved in the first effluent although most of the fe2 was removed by the first filtration it can be considered that the removal of as in the second filtration unit proceeded due to the dissolution of released fe2 from the iron net and the production of iron oxide through chemical and biological oxidation overall it was clarified that the as removal can be achieved below the bangladesh standard value 50 μg l by employing ducf in the high as contaminated area 3 6 operation maintenance and practical implications of cfs the present study revealed that medium as groundwater requires single unit cf whereas a double unit cf has to be used for the high as gw to meet the national drinking water standards the filter operation began with the pumping of gw followed by a pre aeration step and finally feeding to the cfs the filtration was gravitational with a natural filtration rate as presented in fig 11 the flow rates ranged from 7 to 13 l h at the beginning of the operation and slowly decreased to 3 11 l h at day 14 the recovery of the flow rate was investigated on day 14 through cleaning of the filters as described in section 2 4 it can be observed in fig 11 that the filtration rates were restored increased in all the cfs after cleaning although the flow rates increased due to cleaning as removal rates were relatively constant see fig 4 after day 14 accordingly it is recommended to clean the filter every 15 days or whenever the flow rate reduces to an unsatisfactory level as part of the filter maintenance the iron net needs to be replaced after a useful lifespan the life span was estimated based on the fe as ratio and the average gw composition in bangladesh based on the required fe as ratio reported in the previous studies 22 a minimum of 15 20 mg l of fe is required to remove as from 500 μg l to less than 50 μg l accordingly 600 g iron net used in the cfs could be used for approximately 1 year assuming 60 dissolution of fe from the iron net for daily production of 60 l water the ceramic filter candle should be replaced if the flow rate recovery is reduced to less than 2 l h although the waste sludge produced in the cfs is not hazardous it is recommended to handle it in a safe way to minimize this possible risk such as discarded into deep pits encased in concrete or use in brick or masonry industries 50 for practical use the cfs were evaluated based on the five criteria proposed by who including effectiveness relevance satisfactoriness cost and implementations 51 the cfs in the present study were found highly effective to remove as and fe below the safe levels and can be comparable with the existing filters in practice such as sono and kanchan filters see table s2 in supplementary materials the filter is appropriate for rural households with no additional chemicals and minimal labor and skills requirements cfs can produce sufficient water 60 80 l d to fulfill the daily household demand in most developing countries it is a simple and low cost treatment technique and can be implemented with locally available materials the estimated cost of a single unit cf is 5 6 usd which will increase to 9 10 usd if ducf is applied for high as groundwater 29 these costs are much lower than the existing filter as presented in table s2 in supplementary material and are affordable for rural households in developing countries cfs also need a minimal maintenance cost between 0 5 and 1 usd including annual replacement of iron net or ceramic filter therefore the cfs can be used as a potential alternative for safe drinking water in the as contaminated regions and reduce the health risk of low income households particularly in developing countries 4 conclusions the present study evaluated the as removal performances of the cfs with different filter configurations for different compositions of gw in bangladesh single unit ceramic filter sucfs amended with an iron net was effective to remove as lower than the national standards 50 μg l from the medium as gw 141 231 μg l whereas double unit ceramic filter ducf was employed to achieve as below the standard limit for high as gw 288 585 μg l additionally cfs were able to remove fe 99 p 35 98 and mn 45 95 from the different compositions of groundwater concentrations of fe and ca positively affected the as removal efficiency of the cfs both gw and released fe2 played an important role and have a significant contribution to the as removal in the cfs fe dissolution from the iron net was insufficient due to the coating of fe3 p si and ca on the surface of the iron net making the system inadequate to remove as below the standard level from high as groundwater compared with other existing as filters the cf proposed in the present study is not only low cost and easy to operate and maintain it produces sufficient safe drinking water to fulfill the daily drinking water demand of a typical rural household in developing countries future studies can evaluate the efficacy of the cfs to improve the microbiological quality of the treated water that will further ensure safe drinking water production by the cfs future study on improving the fe2 release from the iron net to enhance as removal efficacy is recommended the analysis of chemical including trace elements and mineralogical compositions of clay soil rice bran and the iron net

13136,household based ceramic filters amended with metal iron showed great potential to remove arsenic as from groundwater gw due to their low cost and minimal maintenance requirements the present study assessed the as removal performance of iron amended ceramic filters cfs with two different filter configurations including single unit ceramic filter sucf and double unit ceramic filter ducf fifteen sucfs and one ducf were tested at different households in the khulna bagerhat region of bangladesh with freshly withdrawn gw having as and fe concentrations ranging from 141 to 585 μg l and 0 16 mg l respectively sucfs achieved as effluents below the standard level 50 μg l from medium as gw 41 231 μg l whereas ducf was efficient for high as gw 288 585 μg l removing as 86 and fe 99 below the standard limit principal component analysis pca demonstrated that as removal efficiency was positively influenced by fe and ca and negatively by as concentrations fe2 released from the amended iron net has a significant contribution to the as removal in the cfs x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis detected the presence of fe3 p si and ca on the surface of the iron net leading to insufficient fe dissolution to remove as overall it is recommended to use sucfs for low to medium as gw and ducfs for high as gw the cfs with affordable cost easy operation and minimal maintenance can produce sufficient quantity 60 80 l d to fulfill the daily drinking water demand in the rural households of developing countries keywords ceramic filter arsenic removal groundwater compositions pca analysis iron net fe2 1 introduction mass poisoning of arsenic as contamination in groundwater sources becomes a major challenge for safe drinking water supply worldwide including bangladesh india and the rest of the subcontinent 1 recently widespread groundwater arsenic contamination in vietnam cambodia and china have been reported 2 continued consumption of as contaminated water causes serious human health risks as well as severe environmental concerns 3 4 as per the world health organization who guidelines of safe drinking water the maximum permissible limit of as is 10 μg l 5 however the limit has been relaxed to 50 μg l for bangladesh where about 97 99 of drinking water and 86 90 of irrigation water relies on groundwater 6 8 currently groundwater in most more than 50 parts of bangladesh exceeds the permissible limit 50 μg l of as 6 9 10 the arsenic contamination map of bangladesh is presented in fig 1 commonly in groundwater arsenic mainly exists in two inorganic forms arsenate as v h2aso4 or haso4 2 and arsenite as iii h3aso3 or haso2 arsenate exists principally as oxyanions under oxidizing conditions and as arsenite under mildly reducing conditions arsenite is the most common species in anaerobic groundwater with a more toxic form and is generally removed less efficiently than the oxidized arsenate by the conventional treatment methods such as adsorption and precipitation 11 12 until now several household and community level technologies for as mitigation from groundwater have been introduced and tested these include adsorption and co precipitation e g with iron or aluminum salts 11 ion exchange 13 coagulation flocculation 14 membrane technologies 15 electro ultra filtration 16 and biological processes 17 however several factors including cost intensiveness high energy and chemicals requirements complicacy of operation and maintenance lack of ownership and social mobilization restrain the long term sustainability of these technologies in developing countries 18 19 for keeping the existing shallow groundwater wells usable a simple low cost household based treatment system could be a viable option for providing safe drinking water in as affected regions of developing countries 20 an effective and accepted as mitigation mechanism is the oxidation of fe2 and co removal of both as and fe through filtration the removal efficiency of this system greatly depends on the fraction of fe to as fe as in the groundwater as reported in the earlier studies the mass ratio of fe as 50 is required for reducing as to below 50 μg l while the mass ratio of fe as 250 reduces as concentration to 10 μg l 21 22 in the case of insufficiency of fe2 in groundwater required fe2 can be added to the system through single step or multi step for this purpose the use of fe 0 zero valent iron is reported as a convenient and inexpensive source of fe2 23 based on such mechanisms several household based as removal filters including sono filter composed of a composite iron matrix kanchan arsenic filter composed of iron nails two kolshi filter composed of ferric chloride and three kolshi filter composed of iron filings have been developed and implemented in as affected regions 24 27 however these filters experienced challenges associated with filter media maintenance high cost and high clogging frequency of sand beds 18 therefore fe2 oxidation co precipitation with as and subsequent filtration through medium cost low maintenance ceramic filters could be a practicable replacement such ceramic filters could be made with local materials and skills and have already proven to be socially acceptable as household based safe drinking water supply options to control diarrheal diseases 28 in the previous studies a low cost easy to operate and maintain household based arsenic removal ceramic filter cf was formulated and confirmed its as removal performance in a rural area of bangladesh 29 31 the porous cylindrical ceramic unit was made with clay soil and rice bran and nested with an iron metal net to fabricate the filter the iron metal net acted as a source of zero valent iron fe 0 and releases fe2 after the subsequent iron oxidation and or co precipitation as was trapped by the ceramic unit and subsequently removed from the water after a successful laboratory investigation 29 the filters were tested for the natural groundwater in a rural community of bangladesh 30 31 the filed results revealed that cfs effectively removed as from the low contaminated groundwater 250 μg l 30 and a simple pre aeration step significantly improved the removal efficacy 31 however the effect of groundwater compositions on as removal was not evaluated in depth moreover the role of the iron net the filter configuration and cfs operational procedure were not elucidated in the previous studies therefore based on the gw compositions it is important to explicate the different filter configurations and modes of operations of the cfs for a prevalent mitigation strategy the present study investigated as removal performances of the iron amended cfs with different filter configurations for different compositions of groundwater the aims of this research are to i examine the single unit and double unit cfs for as removal from the contaminated groundwater and ii investigate the influence of groundwater compositions on the as removal efficiency iii investigate the role of the iron net on as removal and iv clarify the operational and maintenance procedures of the cfs for field investigation households having as contaminated shallow tubewells were selected in the khulna bagerhat region of bangladesh 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceramic filters cfs construction fig 2a shows a schematic of the cfs constructed and employed in this study to manufacture the cf the cylindrical shaped ceramic candle was affixed at the bottom of a reactor 14 l clay vessel followed by the nesting with an iron net as a source of fe 0 finally the cf unit was placed on a wooden stand shaping the whole form a collection bucket plastic made was placed under the wooden stand to collect the treated water clay soil and rice bran were used with a mix ratio of 80 20 to make the ceramic candle and the details can be found in the authors previous study 29 the clay soil used for preparing the ceramic candle contained 40 sand 52 silt and 8 clay 29 the fired ceramic candle was cylindrical in shape fig 2a having 61 porosity and pore size of 1 5 μm 29 scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x ray spectrometry sem eds analysis of the ceramic candle unit indicated the presence of c o si fe and al which was reported in the authors previous study 32 furthermore analysis of chemical including trace elements and mineralogical compositions of clay soil rice bran and the iron net is necessary to understand their role in as removal 2 2 single and double unit ceramic filter two sets of ceramic filters including single unit ceramic filter sucf and double unit ceramic filter ducf were tested in the present study fig 2a shows both types of cf one set of cf was used to form sucf and tested for as removal performance from all gw whereas two sets of cfs were used to form the double unit ceramic filter ducf that enhanced the as removal efficacy of the highly as contaminated groundwater to below the bangladesh standard of 50 μg l 2 3 site selection cfs installation and field operations all cfs operations were conducted under the natural field conditions of bangladesh three widespread as contaminated areas were selected for the field trials where 66 of groundwater surpassed the national standard limit of as 50 μg l 6 fig s1 shows the study area with locations of sub districts i e rupsha fakirhat and mollahat in the khulna bagerhat region fifteen household owned tubewells were randomly selected from these three sub districts to install the sucfs cf1 to cf15 the cf operational procedures in field conditions are presented in fig 2b and the details can be seen in hasan et al 30 the cf operations were initiated by a simple and energy free pre aeration process of freshly withdrawn gw tubewells water as presented in fig 2b the pre aeration process was carried out using two buckets by alternating the freshly withdrawn gw at least 5 6 times before feeding to the cfs a 2 3 min long and energy free pre aeration process was performed for increasing the dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp of gw that eventually enhanced the oxidation of groundwater fe2 and made the whole system low cost and sustainable immediately after the pre aeration 14 l groundwater was fed to the reactors clay vessel once a day to filter by gravitational pressure fifteen sucfs cf1 cf15 were primarily operated continuously for around 3 weeks 22 days additionally a ducf was installed and operated at the same household of cf2 having average groundwater as concentration of 504 μg l a control experiment control cf were also conducted with the same household of cf15 without iron net in it to clarify the role of the materials used for ceramic candle on as removal 2 4 on

influents and effluents were collected in transparent 100 ml bottles made of polypropylene followed by acidifying with hcl solution to preserve the laboratory analyses were performed for total fe

cleaned on day 14 due to the flow rate slowdown during the cleaning process the iron net was moved out and the surface of the ceramic filter candle was cleaned manually by scrubbing with a soft cloth to remove the accumulated suspended solids the surface of the iron net was also cleaned by scrubbing and rinsing with clean water and set back to the filter the filtration operation continued immediately after cleaning to investigate the effects of cleaning on the treatment efficiency of the cfs 2 6 analytical procedure for on site measurement the horiba d 54s meter horiba japan was used to measure ph orp and ec concentrations and the hach hq30d meter was used for do and temperature measurement aqua check eco test strips were used for the on site measurement of alkalinity hardness

iron net after the filter operation at the end of the filter operation the iron nets from the cfs were taken out air dried and used for xps analysis without any further preprocess such as washing xps

the gw compositions of 15 tubewells used in this study based on the measured as in the gw of different areas of bangladesh 6 the contamination levels can be defined as high medium and low the high as gw cf1 cf7 having as concentrations of more than 250 μg l 288 565 μg l whereas gw cf8 cf15 having concentrations between 250 μg l and 50 μg l was defined as medium as gw table 1 the as levels meeting drinking water standards i e 0 to 50 μg l can be considered as low however the concentrations of as and fe in all the collected gw samples exceeded the standard limits for drinking water the main source of high as concentration in groundwater is thought to be the sedimentary bengal basin which was formed by the deposition of a large volume of arsenic containing sediments originated from the himalayas oxidation of the arsenical pyrites in this alluvial sediment released as into the groundwater 1 moreover anthropogenic activities such as excessive groundwater abstraction and the use of arsenical pesticides in agriculture and wood preservation increased as in this region 1 ph orp temperature do and alkalinity did not vary significantly p 0 05 among the gw samples which were measured as 6 99 7 23 109 to 139 mv 26 7 28 1 c 2 5 3 4 mg l and 187 190 mg l respectively the range of ph orp and do indicate a reducing condition in the gw where most of the fe and as were present as fe2 and as iii 31 34 high concentrations of bicarbonate hco3 were observed in the groundwater table 1 indicated the dominance of this anion in the study area a previous study reported that groundwater in this area is dominated by na in the cations and interplays of hco3 and cl in anions with the influence of marine water 35 a relatively wide range of ec was found among the gw samples varying from 0 66 1 82 ms cm the higher range of ec in the gw indicated the enrichment of dissolved salts intruded from the nearby coast of the studied area manganese mn concentrations varied from 0 06 1 16 mg l and were found 2 3 times higher than the standard limit of 0 05 mg l 5 po4 p no2 n and no3 n concentrations were found 0 20 2 43 mg l 1 1 1 4 mg l and 0 10 0 16 mg l respectively concentrations of ca mg and si ranged between 100 152 mg l 23 6 80 mg l and 14 1 23 7 mg l respectively total organic carbon toc varied from 2 0 to 12 3 mg l in the gw samples that might be migrated from the adjacent soil to the shallow aquifers of this region the data revealed that in high as contaminated groundwater the concentrations of fe mn ec ca and mg were significantly p 0 05 lower as compared to the medium as gw fig 3 other parameters including p and si did not exhibit considerable variation p 0 05 among the two groups the overall gw compositions indicate a wide deviation of the water quality parameters that may significantly impact the as removal performances of the cfs hence it is required to identify the key parameters and operational procedures to enhance the as removal efficiency of cfs 3 2 removal performance of sucfs fig 4 presents the as removal performances of the sucfs with high as gw cf1 cf7 and medium as gw cf8 cf15 based on the analysis all sucfs with medium as gw achieved as effluents below the safe levels 50 μg l on the contrary all of the cfs with high as gw failed to remove as to effluent to below 50 μg l sucfs with medium as gw achieved average effluent concentrations ranging from 24 5 to 50 0 μg l corresponding to 65 88 removal sucfs with high as gw achieved average effluent as between 72 and 177 μg l corresponding to 66 74 removal the removals of as in all sucfs were consistent with the time of operation with a small deviation presented in fig 4c and d indicating the stability of sucfs productivity the as concentration in the effluent of control cf without the iron net and zero groundwater fe2 presented in fig 4b and d revealed that ceramic candle negligibly p 0 05 affected as removal and the effluent concentrations were consistent throughout the filter operations some natural geological clay materials like lignite bentonite and shale have some affinity to adsorb as 36 in the present study clay soil used to prepare the ceramic candle was fired at 900 c and most probably lost its chemical and morphological properties to adsorb as from the groundwater fig 5a presents the influent and effluent fe concentrations and removal of all sucfs irrespective of the concentrations of influent fe more than 99 fe was removed in all the sucfs with both high and medium as gw achieving effluent concentration of 0 1 mg l ph orp and do of the feed water in the cfs and corresponding eh ph diagram are illustrated in fig s2 supplementary materials ph eh and do of the feed water increased to 7 3 7 9 371 424 mv and 5 9 6 9 mg l respectively fig s2a in supplementary materials the increase of ph and do in the cfs were due to the stripping of co2 and the penetrating of o2 in the groundwater during the process of aeration moreover the iron dissolution from the iron net and their oxidation process is well known for the increasing ph in the system 37 the eh ph diagram constructed using the measured ph and orp values showed that the species distribution of fe of all the feed water in the cfs aerated groundwater fell within the fe oh 3 region fig s2b the half life t1 2 of fe2 oxidation to fe3 is 2 3 min at ph 7 5 8 0 under a relatively higher do 11 38 moreover as reported in the previous studies at ph above 4 5 ferrous ions are rapidly oxidized and precipitated as iron oxyhydroxides scavenging arsenic from solution via co precipitation and adsorption reactions process 39 hence in the present study fe2 from the groundwater hereafter gw fe2 and that was released from the iron net hereafter released fe2 in the sucfs were effectively oxidized to form in situ hydrous ferric oxides hfo subsequently as was adsorbed and or co precipitated with the hfo and removed by filtration through the ceramic filter 27 40 furthermore as removal was enhanced through oxidation of as iii to as v by intermediates oxidants oh h2o2 and o2 produced in the cfs during fe2 oxidation 21 41 in this study the two reaction processes adsorption and or co precipitation were considered simultaneously as the overall goal was to remove total as from the groundwater nevertheless the distinguishing between adsorbed and co precipitated as would give more insights into as removal mechanism by the cfs overall the single unit sucfs was effective in removing as from the medium as gw whereas highly effective in removing fe from both high and medium as gw fig 5b f presents the removal performances of p ca mg si and mn of the sucfs significant p 0 05 removals of p 35 98 ca 20 60 and mn 45 95 were observed while removal of mg and si were insignificant and remained almost unchanged in the effluent mn removal occurred through the simultaneous oxidation of the gw fe2 and mn2 biological chemical and their subsequent precipitation 42 ca was removed due to the formation of amorphous calcium carbonate and calcite precipitate 43 p was effectively removed through the adsorption onto the in situ formed hfo flocs 29 44 as reported in the previous study the higher concentrations of p in groundwater decrease the as removal due to their affinity and competition with as v for the sorption sites of hfo flocs 29 44 high concentrations of si in groundwater reduce the as removal efficiency by reducing the formation and precipitation of hfo flocs at a ph of 7 9 45 if these elements are abundant in gw they may have a combined or individual impact on the as removal efficiency of the sucfs table 1 describes a diverse range of groundwater compositions in the study area thus the compositions of the gw and their adverse effect on the removal of as by sucfs were examined through pca and correlation analysis 3 3 identify the factor of as removal by principle components analysis pca to determine the most important factor of as removal in sucfs pca was performed for the groundwater data set along with the effluent of each cf pca is a useful technique for reducing the number of variables in a data set to a few components or factors that represent most of the variations in the original data by simplifying multiple variable interpretations thirteen measured variables including groundwater ph orp ec temp do as ca mg si mn fe as fe p and as removal were selected for pca in addition to the pca the correlation between the as removal and physico chemical parameters of groundwater were obtained in the form of pearson correlation coefficients table 2 presents factor loadings eigenvalues and the variance percentages corresponding to each principal component eigenvalues are normally used to determine the number of principal components pcs that can be retained for further study 46 as shown in table 2 the first 3 pcs account for 82 3 of the total variances of the original dataset pc1 explained 54 21 of the total variance exhibits strong positive loading on fe as ratio ec ca mg and si concentrations moderate positive loading on as removal and strong negative loading on ph do mn and as pc2 explained 16 31 of total variances and has positive loading on as removal and fe p ratio and negative loading on orp therefore loading on pc1 and pc2 revealed that the variation of as removal by the sucfs was positively correlated with the variation of groundwater fe p ec ca mg si and negatively correlated with the variation of groundwater as do ph and mn for further clarification the score plot for the first two pcs pc1 and pc2 explaining 70 32 of the total variance is presented in fig 6 the loading plot between pc1 and pc2 has four distinct groups group 1 is associated with fe ec ca mg and p group 2 is associated with influent as do ph and mn group 3 is associated with si and group 4 is associated with orp and temperature mn in groundwater generally enhances the as removal whereas p and si have a negative effect due to their competition with as for adsorption sites the pca results in the present study completely differ from the above statement as reported in the previous study such findings can be attributed to the least concentrations of mn p and si refer to table 1 that insignificantly affect the results 44 table s1 in supplementary materials presents the pearson correlation matrix of the 13 groundwater parameters with as removal consistent with the finding of pca analysis as removal significantly p 0 05 correlated with the inf fe r 0 74 inf ca r 0 68 ec r 0 55 and inf mg r 0 5 overall pca demonstrated that as removal efficiency of studied sucfs was positively and significantly influenced by the groundwater fe and ca and negatively influenced by gw as concentrations therefore the individual role of gw fe2 and released fe2 would cautiously be considered while designing the fe based as removal process moreover the presence of ca in the gw can significantly enhance the as removal under neutral and alkaline conditions in the fe based system 43 3 4 role of gw fe2 and released fe2 iron net on as removal by sucfs the iron net was added to the sucfs as an additional source of fe2 to enhance the as removal efficiency therefore the removal of as in the sucfs was accelerated by the oxidation and co precipitation of both gw fe2 and released fe2 as shown in fig 5a the gw fe2 was oxidized and effectively removed in the sucfs leaving 0 05 mg l of fe in the effluents the molar ratio of fe and as are very useful tools to examine the role of gw fe2 on as removal 47 typically a minimum fe as ratio of 54 is required to effectively remove as to below 50 μg l from the varying compositions of gw containing silicate and carbonate 48 to examine the role of gw fe2 in the present study fe as ratios of gw and corresponding levels of as in the effluents of each cf are presented in fig 7 fe as ratio ranging from 0 2 to 38 7 was found sufficient to achieve less than 50 μg l in the effluent from the medium as groundwater containing as from 141 to 231 μg l cf8 cf15 these values of fe as ratios much lower than the typical fe as ratio of 54 48 indicated the substantial contribution of released fe2 to the as removal in the sucfs to verify this supposition the impact of the iron net on as removal was investigated with the groundwater of zero gw fe2 cf15 fig 8 presents the as removal performance of cf15 for 15 days of continuous operation an average of 66 as was removed from an average of 141 μg l of groundwater as the results indicated that released fe2 from the iron net has a significant contribution to the as removal in the sucfs in the present study both naturally occurring gw fe2 and released fe2 played a crucial role in the effective as removal to gain insights into the mechanisms of arsenic removal the hfo flocs from the selected cfs cf3 cf5 and cf10 were examined through xafs l3 edge spectra along with spectra of as iii and as v standards and the results are presented in fig 9a the xafs spectra of as standards solutions were detected around 1326 ev for as iii and 1327 5 and 1331 ev for as v the spectra for all cfs flocs samples had two peaks at 1327 5 and 1331 ev indicating that as v is the major oxidation state of as adsorbed as in the cfs nevertheless a shoulder doublet left peak at 1326 1327 5 ev of the hfo samples of the cfs belongs to both oxidation states of as iii and as v thus in the present study as iii in the groundwater was oxidized to as v during the process of fe2 oxidation and adsorbed and or co precipitated with hfo flocs in the cfs in the case of high as gw adding the iron net in the sucfs was not sufficient for the effective removal of as see fig 4 cf1 cf7 the possible causes are a insufficient release of fe2 from the iron net b incomplete as adsorption due to short hydraulic residence time hrt and c the negative impact of the groundwater composition the pca analysis revealed that except for the as concentrations no other parameters in the studied groundwater have a significant negative impact on the as removal in the sucfs on the other hand based on the measured flow rate the hydraulic residence times hrt of the sucfs were calculated to be 6 11 h see fig s3 in supplementary materials these values of hrts were sufficient to oxidize fe2 as 99 of fe was removed and the subsequent adsorption of as and other contaminants as presented in figs 4 and 5 therefore the most probable reason for ineffective removal of as for the high as gw involves the insufficient release of fe2 from the iron net during the treatment operations the surface of the iron nets might be substantially oxidized while exposed to the air as they were submerged during 6 11 h filtration and partially exposed to the air during the remaining time of each day of filtration hence the iron net surfaces were partially covered with the oxidized fe as well as other contaminants such as p si and ca precipitate resulting prevent the release of fe2 fig 9 illustrates the oxidation states of the fe on the iron net after the treatment was detected through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the fe 2p spectrum in fig 10a indicates the presence of fe3 on the iron net surface no fe2 or fe0 detected on the surface indicates that the surfaces of the iron net were significantly covered with corroded fe3 leading to reduce the fe dissolution from the iron net fig 9b and c shows that the other elements such as p si and ca were detected on the surface of the iron net because p is involved in the formation of scale on the surface of the metal iron the dissolution of fe2 was probably further inhibited due to p presence on the surface of the iron net 49 moreover the formation of calcium carbonate calcite and silicate precipitate may mask the iron net surface to inhibit the formation of hfo flocs 43 45 consequently the levels of fe2 in the sucfs were not sufficient to effectively remove as from the high as groundwater which may greatly affect the efficacy of the sucfs to implement in as contaminated region to resolve this problem an alternative double unit ceramic filter ducf was proposed and tested for the high as gw 3 5 double unit ceramic filter ducf for the treatment of high as groundwater a double unit ceramic filter ducf was tested in the field with the groundwater having an average as concentration of 504 μg l same gw of cf2 the as concentrations of the influent and effluent are presented in fig 10 in the first effluent the upper unit in fig 2 average as concentrations of the treated water was 142 μg l removal rate 69 which was further reduced to an average of 59 μg l removal rate 86 in the second filtration unit 2nd effluent as shown in fig 10a as concentrations in both the first and second effluents steadily reduced as the day of operation progressed and reached less than 50 μg l below safe level at 8 days in the 2nd effluent the steady enhancement of as removal with the operation time might be caused by the adsorption of as on the accumulated fe hydroxides in the cfs fig 10b shows that more than 99 fe raw water fe 7 14 mg l removal was also achieved in the first effluent although most of the fe2 was removed by the first filtration it can be considered that the removal of as in the second filtration unit proceeded due to the dissolution of released fe2 from the iron net and the production of iron oxide through chemical and biological oxidation overall it was clarified that the as removal can be achieved below the bangladesh standard value 50 μg l by employing ducf in the high as contaminated area 3 6 operation maintenance and practical implications of cfs the present study revealed that medium as groundwater requires single unit cf whereas a double unit cf has to be used for the high as gw to meet the national drinking water standards the filter operation began with the pumping of gw followed by a pre aeration step and finally feeding to the cfs the filtration was gravitational with a natural filtration rate as presented in fig 11 the flow rates ranged from 7 to 13 l h at the beginning of the operation and slowly decreased to 3 11 l h at day 14 the recovery of the flow rate was investigated on day 14 through cleaning of the filters as described in section 2 4 it can be observed in fig 11 that the filtration rates were restored increased in all the cfs after cleaning although the flow rates increased due to cleaning as removal rates were relatively constant see fig 4 after day 14 accordingly it is recommended to clean the filter every 15 days or whenever the flow rate reduces to an unsatisfactory level as part of the filter maintenance the iron net needs to be replaced after a useful lifespan the life span was estimated based on the fe as ratio and the average gw composition in bangladesh based on the required fe as ratio reported in the previous studies 22 a minimum of 15 20 mg l of fe is required to remove as from 500 μg l to less than 50 μg l accordingly 600 g iron net used in the cfs could be used for approximately 1 year assuming 60 dissolution of fe from the iron net for daily production of 60 l water the ceramic filter candle should be replaced if the flow rate recovery is reduced to less than 2 l h although the waste sludge produced in the cfs is not hazardous it is recommended to handle it in a safe way to minimize this possible risk such as discarded into deep pits encased in concrete or use in brick or masonry industries 50 for practical use the cfs were evaluated based on the five criteria proposed by who including effectiveness relevance satisfactoriness cost and implementations 51 the cfs in the present study were found highly effective to remove as and fe below the safe levels and can be comparable with the existing filters in practice such as sono and kanchan filters see table s2 in supplementary materials the filter is appropriate for rural households with no additional chemicals and minimal labor and skills requirements cfs can produce sufficient water 60 80 l d to fulfill the daily household demand in most developing countries it is a simple and low cost treatment technique and can be implemented with locally available materials the estimated cost of a single unit cf is 5 6 usd which will increase to 9 10 usd if ducf is applied for high as groundwater 29 these costs are much lower than the existing filter as presented in table s2 in supplementary material and are affordable for rural households in developing countries cfs also need a minimal maintenance cost between 0 5 and 1 usd including annual replacement of iron net or ceramic filter therefore the cfs can be used as a potential alternative for safe drinking water in the as contaminated regions and reduce the health risk of low income households particularly in developing countries 4 conclusions the present study evaluated the as removal performances of the cfs with different filter configurations for different compositions of gw in bangladesh single unit ceramic filter sucfs amended with an iron net was effective to remove as lower than the national standards 50 μg l from the medium as gw 141 231 μg l whereas double unit ceramic filter ducf was employed to achieve as below the standard limit for high as gw 288 585 μg l additionally cfs were able to remove fe 99 p 35 98 and mn 45 95 from the different compositions of groundwater concentrations of fe and ca positively affected the as removal efficiency of the cfs both gw and released fe2 played an important role and have a significant contribution to the as removal in the cfs fe dissolution from the iron net was insufficient due to the coating of fe3 p si and ca on the surface of the iron net making the system inadequate to remove as below the standard level from high as groundwater compared with other existing as filters the cf proposed in the present study is not only low cost and easy to operate and maintain it produces sufficient safe drinking water to fulfill the daily drinking water demand of a typical rural household in developing countries future studies can evaluate the efficacy of the cfs to improve the microbiological quality of the treated water that will further ensure safe drinking water production by the cfs future study on improving the fe2 release from the iron net to enhance as removal efficacy is recommended the analysis of chemical including trace elements and mineralogical compositions of clay soil rice bran and the iron net

13137,the implementation of anammox based process remains a challenge in treating low ammonium wastewater in present research partial nitrification anammox pn a performance was investigated in the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas system the influent of the ifas reactor was simulated residential domestic sewage the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob s proliferation was observed when dissolved oxygen do concentrations were 0 65 and 0 35 mg l by conducting intermittent aeration aerobic 1 min anoxic 5 min and low do condition 0 20 mg l strategy the ifas reactor performed good nitrogen removal performance the average total nitrogen tn removing efficiency and tn removing rate reached 80 6 and 0 13 kg n m3 d respectively in long term operation extracellular polymeric substance eps concentration of activated sludge was largely increased which favored the formation of granules the maximum frequency diameter of sludge flocs was increased to 1000 μm the anammox bacteria and ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob were both enriched within activated sludge and biofilm high throughput analyzing result implied that anammox bacteria and aob s abundances were 2 01 and 5 04 in activated sludge while 2 43 and 2 45 in biofilm respectively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords partial nitrification anammox intermittent aeration extracellular polymeric substance microbial community integrated fixed film activated sludge system 1 introduction nitrogen contaminated wastewater will cause serious damage to the environment the effective removal of nitrogen from wastewater is an important issue of current research the nitrification denitrification process is commonly employed for biological nitrogen removal which has some problems including large sludge production insufficient carbon source and high aeration energy consumption 1 2 more sustainable and economic technologies are highly required in the current sewage treatment system 3 4 the integrated partial nitrification and anammox pn a process is recognized as a novel and sustainable method in biological wastewater treatment first ammonium is transformed to nitrite through ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob next ammonium and nitrite are transformed into n2 through anammox bacteria 5 the step equations are presented in eqs 1 and 2 the integrated equation of the combined pn a process is expressed in eq 3 compared with the traditional nitrogen removing process more than 60 aeration energy and 100 carbon source could be saved by the pn a process at present hundreds of large scale pn a projects are implemented world wide to treat wastewater at high temperature 30 c and ammonium concentrations 250 1500 mg l 6 1 nh 4 0 75 o 2 hco 3 0 5 nh 4 0 5 no 2 co 2 1 5 h 2 o 2 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0

for the applications of pn a process in treating low ammonium concentration waste water in order to diminish the activities of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob various strategies have been developed such as low dissolved oxygen do concentration 7 short sludge retention time srt 8 and intermittent aeration 9 as the anammox bacteria grow slowly it is important to increase the sludge retention capacity the biofilm could prolong the microbial retention time and is widely applied in different pn a reactors 10 recently the pn a process has been operated within integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas reactor 8 the pn a ifas reactor could be operated with sequencing batch reactor sbr mode or plug flow mode the sbr operational mode is more flexible which is not necessary to be combined with the secondary clarifier and recycle sludge system however the plug flow mode is easier for upgrading the existing sewage treatment plant previous studies have obtained high nitrogen removing performance in the pn a ifas process by operating a low do strategy 8 laureni and co workers 2019 demonstrated that it was feasible to eliminate nob from the ifas reactor by independently controlling the sludge age of flocs 11 they found that anammox bacteria mostly grew on the biofilm while nob were mainly enriched in the floc sludge however seuntjens and colleagues 2020 reported that the microbial distribution in the pn a ifas process was complex which was closely related to the operating conditions of the reactor as well as the inoculated sludge 8 therefore it is significantly important to better understand the microbe s compositions in floc sludge and biofilm the granular sludge process has been extensively studied which has many advantages 12 compared with floc sludge granular sludge has better sedimentation performance which could maintain higher biomass concentration 13 thus the granular sludge process could be operated under high hydraulic load 14 in addition granular sludge is a micro ecosystem formed by microorganisms which could enrich aerobic anaerobic and facultative bacteria at the same time 15 the diffusion distance of intermediate products is greatly shorten and the nitrogen removing performance could be improved moreover the granular sludge could maintain a relatively stable microenvironment and continue the metabolic process under adverse conditions including ph shock and toxic substances 16 17 the cooperation of granules and biofilm in the pn a process has rarely been investigated biofilm or granules is mainly composed of extracellular polymeric substance eps and microbial cells eps mainly contains polysaccharides and proteins which promotes biofilm s mechanical stability and protects the bacteria from environmental pressure besides eps creates a three dimensional network structure which favors the processes of cell adhesion aggregation biosorption and flocculation 18 it has been demonstrated that polysaccharide is the key eps component that promotes the adhesion of microorganisms 19 other studies have suggested that protein pn plays a key role in regulating biofilm or granules formation 20 21 therefore the role of eps components in biofilm or granules formation is still controversial which needs to be further investigated moreover the δno3 n δnh4 n value has been utilized to evaluate nob activity in pn a reactor 22 if δno3 n δnh4 n is 0 11 it can be concluded that nob are involved in the oxidation of nitrite however when the accumulation of nitrite is observed in the reactor this method is not accurate and needs to be modified the present study aimed to establish an efficient pn a ifas procedure in treating residential domestic sewage which has low ammonium concentration the experiment was operated in up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor the reactor s upper and bottom parts were filled with pn biofilm and inoculated with anammox sludge respectively the low do and intermittent aeration approaches were applied in inhibiting nob activity the roles of activated sludge and biofilm were explored by determining the sludge activities eps components and microbial communities the pn a granules were cultivated in the uasb reactor the findings of this experiment could give important guidance on the application of pn a ifas process in engineering projects 2 materials and methods 2 1 pn a ifas process set up and operating condition an uasb reactor was used to operate the pn a ifas process fig 1s the uasb reactor s effective volume was 3 3 l the main component of uasb reactor is cylindrical part inner diameter 100 mm height 400 mm the uasb reactor s bottom part is cone bottom diameter 100 mm height 60 mm the reactor s upper part was packed with polyurethane sponges the volume ratio of polyurethane sponge packing volume to the total volume of uasb reactor was 25 aeration was provided around the polyurethane sponge to prevent photosynthetic microbes growth a black shading cloth was used to cover the reactor the influents were supplied at the bottom part of the reactor while the effluents were obtained from the upper part of the reactor in order to favor the formation of granules high up flow rate was maintained in the uasb reactor by recycling the wastewater from the upper to the bottom part the wastewater was recycled through a peristaltic pump and the ratio of the recycled wastewater to the influents was 50 a water bath layer was set in the reactor s external part and temperature was maintained at 30 2 c the experimental processes were categorized into three phases in phase i 1 30 d and phase ii 31 70 d continuous aeration was performed and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h meanwhile aeration rates were controlled at 0 60 and 0 40 m3 h which resulted in the do levels of 0 65 0 12 and 0 35 0 15 mg l respectively in phase iii 71 120 d intermittent aeration aerobic 1 min anoxic 5 min was performed and airflow rate was 0 40 m3 h the do value reached at 0 20 0 10 mg l the hrt of phase iiia 71 100 d and phase iiib 101 120 d was controlled at 12 and 15 h respectively the detailed information is described in table 1 2 2 the inoculated sludge and wastewater the upper part of the pn a ifas reactor was filled with polyurethane sponge which was collected from the partial nitrification biofilm reactor beijing university of technology the packing volume and biomass concentration of the polyurethane sponge were 0 8 l and 26 7 kg vss m3 respectively the polyurethane sponge was bought in dongli huanneng environmental protection equipment co ltd henan china fig 2s the surface of the polyurethane sponge was covered with cationic active groups and hydroxyl groups the polyurethane sponge was designed in the shape of cube and its side length was 1 cm the polyurethane sponge s specific surface area ssa reached 4400 m2 m3 meanwhile 2 l anammox floc sludge was inoculated from the lab scale anammox reactor and the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was 4100 mg l the inoculating anammox floc sludge was added at the pn a ifas reactor s bottom part the pn a ifas reactor s influent was synthetic wastewater which was prepared by referring the residential domestic sewage nearby beijing university of technology the nh4 n concentration of domestic sewage was 70 85 mg l besides as organic carbon could favor the overgrowth of heterotrophic bacteria which might suppress the aob and anammox bacteria we proposed that a de carbon reactor could be developed before the pn a ifas process which would remove the organic carbon and produce methane gas the main components of the synthetic wastewater were nh4 n nh4cl 100 mg l nahco3 1200 mg l kh2po4 25 mg l cacl2 2h2o 50 mg l mgso4 7h2o 75 mg l trace elements liquid 1 ml l the trace elements liquid s compositions are described in the publication of seuntjens and co workers 2020 8 2 3 eps extraction and analysis after completion of each phase the biofilm and activated sludge were obtained from ifas reactor and eps was analyzed for the biofilm biomass collection polyurethane sponge carriers were transferred to the beakers first the biofilm attached to the outside of the carriers was scraped off carefully with a knife then the carriers were immersed in water and the biofilm inside the carriers was squeezed out manually the eps extraction of biofilm or activated sludge was conducted by using the following procedure first the collected sludge was transferred to the 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 r min next the supernatants were discarded and the concentrated sludge was mixed with 1 phosphate buffer solution pbs then the mixed liquid concentrated sludge and 1 pbs was treated with ultrasound 20 khz 25 w 4 c and 5 min after ultrasonic treatment the mixed liquid was subjected to secondary centrifugation 12 000 r min 5 min and filtered 0 22 μm membrane for loosely binding eps lb eps analysis in order to determine the tightly binding eps tb eps concentration mixed liquid concentrated sludge and 1 pbs was heated at 80 c for 45 min the heated mixture was further centrifuged 12 000 r min 5 min and filtered 0 22 μm membrane for tb eps analysis the total eps concentration equals to the total amount of lb eps and tb eps concentrations the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides were assessed by the modifying lowry procedure and phenol sulfuric acid procedure respectively 8 2 4 sludge activity analysis at the final stage of each phase biofilm and activated sludge s activities were measured through batch tests fig 3s the synthetic wastewater of batch test is described in table 2 the aob nob and anammox activities were analyzed according to the method published by zheng and colleagues 2019 23 the detailed sampling pre treatment and handling procedures were provided in the supporting material the anammox nob and aob activities were calculated with respect to the change of total nitrogen tn no2 n and nh4 n concentrations respectively tn concentration was defined as the sum of no2 n no3 n and nh4 n concentration 2 5 microbial community analysis via illumina sequencing in the beginning the seeding sludge of activated sludge and biofilm were collected at the end of phase ii day 70 and phase iii day 120 the sludge samples of activated sludge and biofilm were collected the microbe s communities of sludge samples were determined using the high throughput analysis method the biofilm biomass was collected according to the description in section 2 3 dna extraction was performed with e z na soil dna kit illumina sequencing was carried out by the sangon biotech company shanghai china the universal primer 341f 805r was employed to amplify the 16s rrna v3 v4 region 23 the obtained sequence was taxonomically assigned by referring to the rdp database 2 6 analytical methods the effluent and influent of the reactor were sampled every two days for water quality analysis the concentrations of mlss nitrite nitrate ammonium and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss are assessed with the standards approaches 24 the laser particle size analyzer horiba la 950 japan was employed to assess the sludge particle size over a range of 0 02 2000 μm the do temperature and ph were evaluated with wtw 3420 device germany for the biofilm biomass concentration measurement the biofilm biomass was collected according to the description in section 2 3 then the biofilm biomass was dried at 105 c and the dry weight was measured the ratio of biofilm biomass weight to the polyurethane sponge volume was calculated and the unit was defined as kg vss m3 the nob metabolic activity was evaluated in the reactor based on the modified value δno3 n δnh4 npath2 the mass conservation analysis of nitrogen in the pn a ifas process is shown in fig 4s in path 1 the nh4 n is oxidized to no2 n by aob which equals to the accumulated no2 n concentration eq 4 in path 2 the nh4 n is removed by aob and anammox bacteria the final product of nh4 n is no3 n the sum ofδnh4 npath1 and δnh4 npath2 is defined as δnh4 n eq 5 if the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 npath2 is larger than 0 11 it means that some no2 n is oxidized by nob 4 nh 4 n path 1 no 2 n path 1 no 2 n accumulated 5 nh 4 n path 2 nh 4 n nh 4 n path 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removing behavior in pn a ifas reactor fig 1 displays the changes of nitrogen concentrations in the pn a ifas reactor in phase i 1 30 d continuous aeration was performed air flow rate 0 60 m3 h do 0 65 mg l on day 1 the tn and nh4 n removing efficiencies were 49 2 and 78 1 respectively after 19 days adaptation the reactor exhibited excellent tn removing performance the effluent s nh4 n no3 n and tn concentrations reached 13 2 10 3 and 30 4 mg l respectively the tn and nh4 n removing efficiencies rose to 70 5 and 87 1 respectively however between day 21 and day 29 the tn removing efficiency gradually decreased and the effluent s no3 n concentration gradually increased on day 29 the effluent no3 n nh4 n and tn concentrations reached 16 2 14 5 and 35 4 mg l respectively the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 npath2 reached 0 19 indicating that nob has converted part of the nitrite to nitrate zheng et al 2021 reported that snad biofilm could perform high nitrogen removing efficiency by maintaining the do concentration at 0 7 mg l 25 the nob activities were greatly suppressed and total nitrogen removing efficiency tnre reached 92 7 according to their study the nitrite generated by aob was fully depleted by denitrification bacteria and anammox bacteria therefore nob s growth was suppressed due to the lack of nitrite however in this study the no2 n concentration reached 5 0 mg l which could not be entirely utilized by anammox bacteria hence the co existence of nitrite and oxygen led to the proliferation of nob to diminish nob activity a lower air flow rate was introduced in phase ii 31 70 d the air flow rate was reduced to 0 40 m3 h and the do concentration declined to 0 35 mg l on day 31 the effluent s nh4 n concentration rose to 22 9 mg l fig 1 between day 31 and day 69 the effluent s no2 n concentration ranged between 0 and 1 5 mg l however the effluent s no3 n concentration rose from 14 7 to 30 2 mg l meanwhile δno3 n δnh4 npath2 value rose from 0 18 to 0 39 suggesting that the proliferation of nob in pn a ifas reactor although do and nitrite concentrations were reduced to lower values the nob activities were not effectively suppressed which was similar with the previously findings 26 27 in the pn a ifas process some studies reported that nob were more likely to be enriched in the floc sludge 28 29 the existence of anammox bacteria and aob on biofilm could outcompete the growth of nob under oxygen limiting conditions this is probably due to the fact that nob were less competitive for do than aob and the anammox bacteria had high affinity for nitrite yang and co workers 2017 applied continuous aeration in the pn a ifas reactor do 0 15 0 36 mg l 27 they found that the ifas reactor restored from nitrate accumulation by reducing the srt of floc sludge from 40 to 20 d and inoculating pn sludge regularly seuntjens et al 2020 also claimed that the srt of floc sludge was the key to the stable operation of pn a ifas reactor 8 when the srt increased from 4 6 to 7 18 d the δno3 n δnh4 n value increased from 20 to 45 moreover some studies indicated that nob could adapt to the low do condition and perform higher do affinity than aob 22 30 in this work the floc sludge was not discharged and polyurethane sponge exhibited high biomass retention ability therefore other strategies were required to suppress the nob activity in phase iii 71 120 d intermittent aeration aerobic 1 min anoxic 5 min was used to suppress nob activities the air flow rate was 0 40 m3 h and do level reached 0 20 mg l in aerobic condition in phase iiia 71 100 d the hrt was controlled at 12 h on day 71 the effluent s nh4 n concentration rose to 33 2 mg l from day 71 to 99 the effluent no2 n concentration was 1 0 mg l meanwhile the effluent no3 n concentration gradually reduced on day 99 the effluent no3 n nh4 n and tn concentrations were 10 7 27 4 and 38 4 mg l respectively the δno3 n δnh4 npath2 was 0 12 indicating that the pn a ifas reactor was successfully restored from nitrate accumulation in order to further reduce the effluent nh4 n concentration hrt was further improved to 15 h in phase iiib 101 120 d finally stable nitrogen removing performance was obtained from day 105 to 119 the average effluent no2 n no3 n nh4 n and tn concentrations were 0 7 11 6 5 9 and 20 7 mg l respectively meanwhile average nh4 n and tn removing efficiencies were 92 5 and 80 6 respectively the average tn removing rate was 0 13 kg n m3 d according to previous studies intermittent aeration is considered the easiest way to achieve partial nitrification 25 31 after anoxic condition it was easier for aob to maintain and recover biological activity than nob miao and co workers 2018 reported that the sbr achieved excellent pn a performance in mainstream wastewater treatment 31 through intermittent aeration strategy anoxic aerobic 21 8 min and low do level 0 8 1 2 mg l the tn removing efficiency reached 77 3 when influent c n ratio was 2 5 similarly zheng and co workers 2021 described that snad biofilm reactor performed excellent nitrogen removing efficiency under intermittent aeration 25 the tnre reached 93 4 in the biofilm reactor under intermittent aeration anoxic aerobic 20 20 min and high do concentration 3 50 mg l previous studies have shown that nitrogen removing rate nrr of conventional nitrification denitrification process is 0 10 0 15 kg n m3 d 32 yang and colleagues 2019 applied the pn a process to treat wastewater with high ammonia in the ifas reactor 27 the tnre was 85 and the nrr reached 2 5 kg n m3 d for mainstream wastewater treatment low do strategy was usually applied to restrain nob activity in pn a process however the aob activities and the nitrogen removing rate were negatively influenced by low do level the tnre and nrr in mbbr were 60 70 and 0 01 0 06 kg n m3 d respectively 28 33 the nrr and tnre of pn a ifas reactor were 0 09 0 11 kg n m3 d and 73 82 respectively 8 27 our findings revealed that the nrr and tnre of the pn a ifas reactor were comparable to previous studies 3 2 sludge activities of different biological aggregates fig 2 shows the biofilm and sludge activities in batch tests in phase i the aeration flow rate of the ifas reactor was 0 60 m3 h while do concentration reached 0 65 mg l both activated sludge and biofilm performed high aob activities which were 4 18 and 7 31 mg n g vss h respectively meanwhile activated sludge and biofilm s anammox activities were 4 92 and 1 14 mg n g vss h respectively the activated sludge s anammox activity was quite higher than that of biofilm thus the activated sludge was more important in operating anammox performance this was because the activated sludge was mainly composed of anammox sludge which was inoculated to the bottom of the uasb reactor the nob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 2 20 and 0 94 mg n g vss h respectively it demonstrated that the activated sludge performed much higher nitrite oxidization performance than biofilm in phase ii in order to restrain nob the ifas reactor s air flow rate was reduced to 0 40 m3 h and the do level was declined to 0 35 mg l the batch experiment presented that the nob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 5 61 and 0 85 mg n g vss h respectively compared with phase i the nob activity of biofilm was relatively constant however the nob activity of activated sludge was significantly increased which was not suppressed by lower do concentration besides the aob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 3 84 and 6 13 mg n g vss h meanwhile anammox activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 4 31 and 1 82 mg n g vss h respectively the decrease in air flow rate only had a slight impact on the aob and anammox activities in phase iii the nob activity of activated sludge was significantly reduced by introducing intermittent aeration aerobic 1 min anoxic 5 min the nob activities of activated sludge and biofilm reduced to 1 10 and 0 41 mg n g vss h respectively meanwhile aob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 3 42 and 5 02 mg n g vss h respectively anammox activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 3 53 and 5 52 mg n g vss h respectively compared with phase i the aob activity of biofilm only decreased by 30 in phase iii however the anammox activity of biofilm was significantly improved in phase iii both the activated sludge and biofilm played important roles in operating the anammox performance 3 3 the sludge particle size and biofilm biomass concentration fig 3a shows the particle size distribution of activated sludge the maximum frequency diameters of activated sludge in phase i and iii were 600 and 1000 μm which accounted for 6 35 and 9 80 of total activated sludge respectively large flocs were gradually formed in long term operation fig 5s according to previous research the large flocs could exhibit aob and anammox activities simultaneously 8 the aob at the outer layer of large flocs produce nitrite for anammox bacteria while the anammox bacteria at the inner layer of large flocs convert nitrite and ammonium to nitrogen in this study due to the operation of uasb mode and high reflux ratio the activated sludge was subjected to high water shear force the rising velocity of water reached 2 9 m min at the bottom of the reactor which could stimulate eps production and granular formation 25 fig 3b shows the biomass concentration in biofilm notably the biofilm s biomass rose from 26 7 phase i to 33 2 phase iii kg vss m3 yang et al 2019 also used polyurethane sponge in the ifas reactor 29 in their study the biofilm biomass increased to 34 8 kg m3 during the long term operation which was similar with present study 3 4 eps components in the biofilm and activated sludge as eps was essential for the formation of biological granules and biofilm the change of eps components was further investigated fig 4 illustrates the evolution of eps components in different biological aggregates from phase i to phase iii the eps concentrations were significantly increased in phase i the eps in activated sludge and biofilm were 41 1 and 29 8 mg gvss respectively in phase ii and phase iii the eps concentrations of activated sludge increased to 63 5 and 93 9 mg gvss respectively meanwhile the eps concentrations of biofilm increased to 43 7 and 61 0 mg gvss respectively compared with biofilm the activated sludge produced higher eps concentrations previously zhang et al 2007 have found that eps was critical for the formation of biological granules 34 shao et al 2017 also investigated the eps production of biofilm and activated sludge in ifas process 35 their reactor was operated with sbr mode and the activated sludge did not contain large flocs they found that the eps production in biofilm was much higher than that in activated sludge in this study the ifas reactor was performed with up flow mode and larger flocs was formed which might account for the higher eps concentrations in activated sludge the pn ps ratio of activated sludge and biofilm was also compared in present research from phase i to phase iii pn ps ratio of activated sludge increased from 1 05 to 1 57 while that of biofilm increased from 1 27 to 2 12 the mature biofilm and activated sludge had higher pn concentration than ps concentration shao et al 2017 observed that the ps pn ratio in biofilm was higher than floc sludge which indicated that ps was more important in the attachment of nitrifying bacteria 35 however other studies demonstrated that the pn ps ratio of biofilm was higher than activated sludge 20 36 they observed that a high pn ps ratio promoted the formation of biofilm by improving the hydrophobicity of microbial surface and reducing the electronegativity of sludge surface liang et al 2010 compared the eps levels in both nitrification biofilm reactor and nitrification activated sludge reactor 20 they found that the pn ps ratios of floc sludge and biofilm were 3 5 and 4 7 respectively besides sriwiriyarat and co workers 2021 assessed the impact of ph on the strength of biofilm 36 they concluded that the pn ps ratio was markedly associated with the strength of biofilm the results of this study revealed that the pn concentration was higher than the ps concentration in biofilm and activated sludge suggesting that a high pn concentration favored the formation of biofilm and granules 3 5 microbial compositions in the reactor fig 5a represents the microbe s compositions at phylum level the ifas reactor achieved good nitrogen removal performance at the end of phase iii the predominant phylums of activated sludge were proteobacteria 42 82 bacteroidetes 26 07 acidobacteria 7 05 planctomycetes 7 04 verrucomicrobia 3 36 and nitrospirae 1 98 meanwhile in the biofilm sample the most prominent phylum was proteobacteria 50 45 followed by planctomycetes 9 59 bacteroidetes 9 44 acidobacteria 5 87 ignavibacteriae 3 37 and chloroflexi 2 37 anammox bacteria are the member of planctomycetes phylum the planctomycetes phylum abundance of biofilm and activated sludge were similar compared with this study yang and colleagues 2019 observed higher planctomycetes phylum abundances in the ifas reactor they reported that the planctomycetes phylum accounted for 15 8 24 5 and 3 5 in the biofilm large flocs 0 2 μm and small flocs 0 2 μm respectively 29 it has been reported that the chloroflexi and firmicutes phyla are crucial for the formation of biofilm 37 the results of present study showed that the chloroflexi phylum s abundance of biofilm was larger than activated sludge in each phase moreover the abundance of chloroflexi phylum was much higher than firmicutes phylum in biofilm suggesting that chloroflexi phylum played a more important role in the formation of biofilm fig 5b indicates the genus abundance of microbe s communities the proportion of nitrogen metabolizing bacteria is presented in table 3 in the beginning the anammox floc sludge and partial nitrification biofilm were inoculated to the ifas reactor the abundances of aob nob and anammox bacteria in activated sludge were 0 31 0 21 and 1 94 respectively meanwhile the abundances of aob nob and anammox bacteria in biofilm were 2 59 0 89 and 0 19 respectively in phase ii low do condition 0 35 mg l was conducted to suppress the nob activity however the nob abundances of activated sludge and biofilm remained at 2 02 and 0 64 respectively in phase iii the ifas reactor was performed with low do condition 0 20 mg l and intermittent aeration strategy as a result the nob abundances in activated sludge and biofilm reduced to 1 29 and 0 29 respectively although high nob abundance was detected in the activated sludge the nob activities were remarkably suppressed in the ifas reactor fig 2 the nob abundance of activated sludge was greater than that of biofilm which was in good agreement with a previous report 11 meanwhile the dominant nob genus in biofilm and activated sludge was nitrospira it has been reported that the nitrospira and nitrobacter were the prevalent nob in wwtp 38 ushiki and colleagues 2017 found that nitrospira was more abundant than nitrobacter under oxygen limited conditions 39 this is probably due to the fact that the nitrospira is classified as k strategists which has higher nitrite affinity than nitrobacter under low substrate conditions in phase iii the aob abundances of biofilm and activated sludge reached 2 45 and 5 04 respectively meanwhile the anammox bacteria abundances accounted for 2 43 and 2 01 respectively the dominant anammox bacteria and aob were candidatus kuenenia and nitrosomonas respectively zou et al 2018 have analyzed the microbe s communities in the snad biofilm reactor 40 they observed that the abundances of aob and anammox bacteria were 0 3 and 1 1 on the biofilm besides liang et al 2018 found that aob and anammox bacteria accounted for 2 28 and 0 82 in the snad granules 15 compared with these studies the abundances of anammox bacteria and aob are much higher moreover other studies have described the microbial communities in the ifas reactor 41 42 they demonstrated that aob were primarily enriched in the flocs while anammox bacteria were mainly located in the biofilm zhang et al 2015 applied quantitative real time pcr to assess the microbial distribution in the ifas system 42 they proposed that anammox bacteria and aob s abundances in biofilm were 87 8 and 2 4 respectively meanwhile the anammox bacteria and aob s abundances in activated sludge were 2 6 and 54 6 respectively however yang et al 2019 found the anammox bacteria s abundance of larger flocs 0 2 μm was much higher than biofilm through qpcr analysis 29 this study demonstrated that biofilm and activated sludge both favored the enrichment of aob and anammox bacteria 4 conclusion the pn a ifas process achieved high nitrogen removing efficiency in treating low ammonium concentration wastewater the activated sludge and biofilm could perform aob and anammox activities simultaneously the anammox activities of activated sludge and biofilm reached 3 53 and 5 52 mg n g vss h respectively meanwhile aob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 3 42 and 5 02 mg n g vss h respectively by introducing the low do and intermittent aeration strategy the nob activity of biofilm decreased from 0 85 to 0 41 mg n g vss h while the nob activity of activated sludge reduced from 5 61 to 1 10 mg n g vss h the predominant anammox bacteria aob and nob were candidatus kuenenia nitrosomonas and nitrospira respectively the activated sludge 1 29 had a higher nob abundance than biofilm 0 29 the findings of present study could provide important insights of the pn a ifas process in future application declaration of competing interest

13137,the implementation of anammox based process remains a challenge in treating low ammonium wastewater in present research partial nitrification anammox pn a performance was investigated in the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas system the influent of the ifas reactor was simulated residential domestic sewage the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob s proliferation was observed when dissolved oxygen do concentrations were 0 65 and 0 35 mg l by conducting intermittent aeration aerobic 1 min anoxic 5 min and low do condition 0 20 mg l strategy the ifas reactor performed good nitrogen removal performance the average total nitrogen tn removing efficiency and tn removing rate reached 80 6 and 0 13 kg n m3 d respectively in long term operation extracellular polymeric substance eps concentration of activated sludge was largely increased which favored the formation of granules the maximum frequency diameter of sludge flocs was increased to 1000 μm the anammox bacteria and ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob were both enriched within activated sludge and biofilm high throughput analyzing result implied that anammox bacteria and aob s abundances were 2 01 and 5 04 in activated sludge while 2 43 and 2 45 in biofilm respectively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords partial nitrification anammox intermittent aeration extracellular polymeric substance microbial community integrated fixed film activated sludge system 1 introduction nitrogen contaminated wastewater will cause serious damage to the environment the effective removal of nitrogen from wastewater is an important issue of current research the nitrification denitrification process is commonly employed for biological nitrogen removal which has some problems including large sludge production insufficient carbon source and high aeration energy consumption 1 2 more sustainable and economic technologies are highly required in the current sewage treatment system 3 4 the integrated partial nitrification and anammox pn a process is recognized as a novel and sustainable method in biological wastewater treatment first ammonium is transformed to nitrite through ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob next ammonium and nitrite are transformed into n2 through anammox bacteria 5 the step equations are presented in eqs 1 and 2 the integrated equation of the combined pn a process is expressed in eq 3 compared with the traditional nitrogen removing process more than 60 aeration energy and 100 carbon source could be saved by the pn a process at present hundreds of large scale pn a projects are implemented world wide to treat wastewater at high temperature 30 c and ammonium concentrations 250 1500 mg l 6 1 nh 4 0 75 o 2 hco 3 0 5 nh 4 0 5 no 2 co 2 1 5 h 2 o 2 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0

for the applications of pn a process in treating low ammonium concentration waste water in order to diminish the activities of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob various strategies have been developed such as low dissolved oxygen do concentration 7 short sludge retention time srt 8 and intermittent aeration 9 as the anammox bacteria grow slowly it is important to increase the sludge retention capacity the biofilm could prolong the microbial retention time and is widely applied in different pn a reactors 10 recently the pn a process has been operated within integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas reactor 8 the pn a ifas reactor could be operated with sequencing batch reactor sbr mode or plug flow mode the sbr operational mode is more flexible which is not necessary to be combined with the secondary clarifier and recycle sludge system however the plug flow mode is easier for upgrading the existing sewage treatment plant previous studies have obtained high nitrogen removing performance in the pn a ifas process by operating a low do strategy 8 laureni and co workers 2019 demonstrated that it was feasible to eliminate nob from the ifas reactor by independently controlling the sludge age of flocs 11 they found that anammox bacteria mostly grew on the biofilm while nob were mainly enriched in the floc sludge however seuntjens and colleagues 2020 reported that the microbial distribution in the pn a ifas process was complex which was closely related to the operating conditions of the reactor as well as the inoculated sludge 8 therefore it is significantly important to better understand the microbe s compositions in floc sludge and biofilm the granular sludge process has been extensively studied which has many advantages 12 compared with floc sludge granular sludge has better sedimentation performance which could maintain higher biomass concentration 13 thus the granular sludge process could be operated under high hydraulic load 14 in addition granular sludge is a micro ecosystem formed by microorganisms which could enrich aerobic anaerobic and facultative bacteria at the same time 15 the diffusion distance of intermediate products is greatly shorten and the nitrogen removing performance could be improved moreover the granular sludge could maintain a relatively stable microenvironment and continue the metabolic process under adverse conditions including ph shock and toxic substances 16 17 the cooperation of granules and biofilm in the pn a process has rarely been investigated biofilm or granules is mainly composed of extracellular polymeric substance eps and microbial cells eps mainly contains polysaccharides and proteins which promotes biofilm s mechanical stability and protects the bacteria from environmental pressure besides eps creates a three dimensional network structure which favors the processes of cell adhesion aggregation biosorption and flocculation 18 it has been demonstrated that polysaccharide is the key eps component that promotes the adhesion of microorganisms 19 other studies have suggested that protein pn plays a key role in regulating biofilm or granules formation 20 21 therefore the role of eps components in biofilm or granules formation is still controversial which needs to be further investigated moreover the δno3 n δnh4 n value has been utilized to evaluate nob activity in pn a reactor 22 if δno3 n δnh4 n is 0 11 it can be concluded that nob are involved in the oxidation of nitrite however when the accumulation of nitrite is observed in the reactor this method is not accurate and needs to be modified the present study aimed to establish an efficient pn a ifas procedure in treating residential domestic sewage which has low ammonium concentration the experiment was operated in up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor the reactor s upper and bottom parts were filled with pn biofilm and inoculated with anammox sludge respectively the low do and intermittent aeration approaches were applied in inhibiting nob activity the roles of activated sludge and biofilm were explored by determining the sludge activities eps components and microbial communities the pn a granules were cultivated in the uasb reactor the findings of this experiment could give important guidance on the application of pn a ifas process in engineering projects 2 materials and methods 2 1 pn a ifas process set up and operating condition an uasb reactor was used to operate the pn a ifas process fig 1s the uasb reactor s effective volume was 3 3 l the main component of uasb reactor is cylindrical part inner diameter 100 mm height 400 mm the uasb reactor s bottom part is cone bottom diameter 100 mm height 60 mm the reactor s upper part was packed with polyurethane sponges the volume ratio of polyurethane sponge packing volume to the total volume of uasb reactor was 25 aeration was provided around the polyurethane sponge to prevent photosynthetic microbes growth a black shading cloth was used to cover the reactor the influents were supplied at the bottom part of the reactor while the effluents were obtained from the upper part of the reactor in order to favor the formation of granules high up flow rate was maintained in the uasb reactor by recycling the wastewater from the upper to the bottom part the wastewater was recycled through a peristaltic pump and the ratio of the recycled wastewater to the influents was 50 a water bath layer was set in the reactor s external part and temperature was maintained at 30 2 c the experimental processes were categorized into three phases in phase i 1 30 d and phase ii 31 70 d continuous aeration was performed and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h meanwhile aeration rates were controlled at 0 60 and 0 40 m3 h which resulted in the do levels of 0 65 0 12 and 0 35 0 15 mg l respectively in phase iii 71 120 d intermittent aeration aerobic 1 min anoxic 5 min was performed and airflow rate was 0 40 m3 h the do value reached at 0 20 0 10 mg l the hrt of phase iiia 71 100 d and phase iiib 101 120 d was controlled at 12 and 15 h respectively the detailed information is described in table 1 2 2 the inoculated sludge and wastewater the upper part of the pn a ifas reactor was filled with polyurethane sponge which was collected from the partial nitrification biofilm reactor beijing university of technology the packing volume and biomass concentration of the polyurethane sponge were 0 8 l and 26 7 kg vss m3 respectively the polyurethane sponge was bought in dongli huanneng environmental protection equipment co ltd henan china fig 2s the surface of the polyurethane sponge was covered with cationic active groups and hydroxyl groups the polyurethane sponge was designed in the shape of cube and its side length was 1 cm the polyurethane sponge s specific surface area ssa reached 4400 m2 m3 meanwhile 2 l anammox floc sludge was inoculated from the lab scale anammox reactor and the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was 4100 mg l the inoculating anammox floc sludge was added at the pn a ifas reactor s bottom part the pn a ifas reactor s influent was synthetic wastewater which was prepared by referring the residential domestic sewage nearby beijing university of technology the nh4 n concentration of domestic sewage was 70 85 mg l besides as organic carbon could favor the overgrowth of heterotrophic bacteria which might suppress the aob and anammox bacteria we proposed that a de carbon reactor could be developed before the pn a ifas process which would remove the organic carbon and produce methane gas the main components of the synthetic wastewater were nh4 n nh4cl 100 mg l nahco3 1200 mg l kh2po4 25 mg l cacl2 2h2o 50 mg l mgso4 7h2o 75 mg l trace elements liquid 1 ml l the trace elements liquid s compositions are described in the publication of seuntjens and co workers 2020 8 2 3 eps extraction and analysis after completion of each phase the biofilm and activated sludge were obtained from ifas reactor and eps was analyzed for the biofilm biomass collection polyurethane sponge carriers were transferred to the beakers first the biofilm attached to the outside of the carriers was scraped off carefully with a knife then the carriers were immersed in water and the biofilm inside the carriers was squeezed out manually the eps extraction of biofilm or activated sludge was conducted by using the following procedure first the collected sludge was transferred to the 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 r min next the supernatants were discarded and the concentrated sludge was mixed with 1 phosphate buffer solution pbs then the mixed liquid concentrated sludge and 1 pbs was treated with ultrasound 20 khz 25 w 4 c and 5 min after ultrasonic treatment the mixed liquid was subjected to secondary centrifugation 12 000 r min 5 min and filtered 0 22 μm membrane for loosely binding eps lb eps analysis in order to determine the tightly binding eps tb eps concentration mixed liquid concentrated sludge and 1 pbs was heated at 80 c for 45 min the heated mixture was further centrifuged 12 000 r min 5 min and filtered 0 22 μm membrane for tb eps analysis the total eps concentration equals to the total amount of lb eps and tb eps concentrations the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides were assessed by the modifying lowry procedure and phenol sulfuric acid procedure respectively 8 2 4 sludge activity analysis at the final stage of each phase biofilm and activated sludge s activities were measured through batch tests fig 3s the synthetic wastewater of batch test is described in table 2 the aob nob and anammox activities were analyzed according to the method published by zheng and colleagues 2019 23 the detailed sampling pre treatment and handling procedures were provided in the supporting material the anammox nob and aob activities were calculated with respect to the change of total nitrogen tn no2 n and nh4 n concentrations respectively tn concentration was defined as the sum of no2 n no3 n and nh4 n concentration 2 5 microbial community analysis via illumina sequencing in the beginning the seeding sludge of activated sludge and biofilm were collected at the end of phase ii day 70 and phase iii day 120 the sludge samples of activated sludge and biofilm were collected the microbe s communities of sludge samples were determined using the high throughput analysis method the biofilm biomass was collected according to the description in section 2 3 dna extraction was performed with e z na soil dna kit illumina sequencing was carried out by the sangon biotech company shanghai china the universal primer 341f 805r was employed to amplify the 16s rrna v3 v4 region 23 the obtained sequence was taxonomically assigned by referring to the rdp database 2 6 analytical methods the effluent and influent of the reactor were sampled every two days for water quality analysis the concentrations of mlss nitrite nitrate ammonium and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss are assessed with the standards approaches 24 the laser particle size analyzer horiba la 950 japan was employed to assess the sludge particle size over a range of 0 02 2000 μm the do temperature and ph were evaluated with wtw 3420 device germany for the biofilm biomass concentration measurement the biofilm biomass was collected according to the description in section 2 3 then the biofilm biomass was dried at 105 c and the dry weight was measured the ratio of biofilm biomass weight to the polyurethane sponge volume was calculated and the unit was defined as kg vss m3 the nob metabolic activity was evaluated in the reactor based on the modified value δno3 n δnh4 npath2 the mass conservation analysis of nitrogen in the pn a ifas process is shown in fig 4s in path 1 the nh4 n is oxidized to no2 n by aob which equals to the accumulated no2 n concentration eq 4 in path 2 the nh4 n is removed by aob and anammox bacteria the final product of nh4 n is no3 n the sum ofδnh4 npath1 and δnh4 npath2 is defined as δnh4 n eq 5 if the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 npath2 is larger than 0 11 it means that some no2 n is oxidized by nob 4 nh 4 n path 1 no 2 n path 1 no 2 n accumulated 5 nh 4 n path 2 nh 4 n nh 4 n path 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removing behavior in pn a ifas reactor fig 1 displays the changes of nitrogen concentrations in the pn a ifas reactor in phase i 1 30 d continuous aeration was performed air flow rate 0 60 m3 h do 0 65 mg l on day 1 the tn and nh4 n removing efficiencies were 49 2 and 78 1 respectively after 19 days adaptation the reactor exhibited excellent tn removing performance the effluent s nh4 n no3 n and tn concentrations reached 13 2 10 3 and 30 4 mg l respectively the tn and nh4 n removing efficiencies rose to 70 5 and 87 1 respectively however between day 21 and day 29 the tn removing efficiency gradually decreased and the effluent s no3 n concentration gradually increased on day 29 the effluent no3 n nh4 n and tn concentrations reached 16 2 14 5 and 35 4 mg l respectively the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 npath2 reached 0 19 indicating that nob has converted part of the nitrite to nitrate zheng et al 2021 reported that snad biofilm could perform high nitrogen removing efficiency by maintaining the do concentration at 0 7 mg l 25 the nob activities were greatly suppressed and total nitrogen removing efficiency tnre reached 92 7 according to their study the nitrite generated by aob was fully depleted by denitrification bacteria and anammox bacteria therefore nob s growth was suppressed due to the lack of nitrite however in this study the no2 n concentration reached 5 0 mg l which could not be entirely utilized by anammox bacteria hence the co existence of nitrite and oxygen led to the proliferation of nob to diminish nob activity a lower air flow rate was introduced in phase ii 31 70 d the air flow rate was reduced to 0 40 m3 h and the do concentration declined to 0 35 mg l on day 31 the effluent s nh4 n concentration rose to 22 9 mg l fig 1 between day 31 and day 69 the effluent s no2 n concentration ranged between 0 and 1 5 mg l however the effluent s no3 n concentration rose from 14 7 to 30 2 mg l meanwhile δno3 n δnh4 npath2 value rose from 0 18 to 0 39 suggesting that the proliferation of nob in pn a ifas reactor although do and nitrite concentrations were reduced to lower values the nob activities were not effectively suppressed which was similar with the previously findings 26 27 in the pn a ifas process some studies reported that nob were more likely to be enriched in the floc sludge 28 29 the existence of anammox bacteria and aob on biofilm could outcompete the growth of nob under oxygen limiting conditions this is probably due to the fact that nob were less competitive for do than aob and the anammox bacteria had high affinity for nitrite yang and co workers 2017 applied continuous aeration in the pn a ifas reactor do 0 15 0 36 mg l 27 they found that the ifas reactor restored from nitrate accumulation by reducing the srt of floc sludge from 40 to 20 d and inoculating pn sludge regularly seuntjens et al 2020 also claimed that the srt of floc sludge was the key to the stable operation of pn a ifas reactor 8 when the srt increased from 4 6 to 7 18 d the δno3 n δnh4 n value increased from 20 to 45 moreover some studies indicated that nob could adapt to the low do condition and perform higher do affinity than aob 22 30 in this work the floc sludge was not discharged and polyurethane sponge exhibited high biomass retention ability therefore other strategies were required to suppress the nob activity in phase iii 71 120 d intermittent aeration aerobic 1 min anoxic 5 min was used to suppress nob activities the air flow rate was 0 40 m3 h and do level reached 0 20 mg l in aerobic condition in phase iiia 71 100 d the hrt was controlled at 12 h on day 71 the effluent s nh4 n concentration rose to 33 2 mg l from day 71 to 99 the effluent no2 n concentration was 1 0 mg l meanwhile the effluent no3 n concentration gradually reduced on day 99 the effluent no3 n nh4 n and tn concentrations were 10 7 27 4 and 38 4 mg l respectively the δno3 n δnh4 npath2 was 0 12 indicating that the pn a ifas reactor was successfully restored from nitrate accumulation in order to further reduce the effluent nh4 n concentration hrt was further improved to 15 h in phase iiib 101 120 d finally stable nitrogen removing performance was obtained from day 105 to 119 the average effluent no2 n no3 n nh4 n and tn concentrations were 0 7 11 6 5 9 and 20 7 mg l respectively meanwhile average nh4 n and tn removing efficiencies were 92 5 and 80 6 respectively the average tn removing rate was 0 13 kg n m3 d according to previous studies intermittent aeration is considered the easiest way to achieve partial nitrification 25 31 after anoxic condition it was easier for aob to maintain and recover biological activity than nob miao and co workers 2018 reported that the sbr achieved excellent pn a performance in mainstream wastewater treatment 31 through intermittent aeration strategy anoxic aerobic 21 8 min and low do level 0 8 1 2 mg l the tn removing efficiency reached 77 3 when influent c n ratio was 2 5 similarly zheng and co workers 2021 described that snad biofilm reactor performed excellent nitrogen removing efficiency under intermittent aeration 25 the tnre reached 93 4 in the biofilm reactor under intermittent aeration anoxic aerobic 20 20 min and high do concentration 3 50 mg l previous studies have shown that nitrogen removing rate nrr of conventional nitrification denitrification process is 0 10 0 15 kg n m3 d 32 yang and colleagues 2019 applied the pn a process to treat wastewater with high ammonia in the ifas reactor 27 the tnre was 85 and the nrr reached 2 5 kg n m3 d for mainstream wastewater treatment low do strategy was usually applied to restrain nob activity in pn a process however the aob activities and the nitrogen removing rate were negatively influenced by low do level the tnre and nrr in mbbr were 60 70 and 0 01 0 06 kg n m3 d respectively 28 33 the nrr and tnre of pn a ifas reactor were 0 09 0 11 kg n m3 d and 73 82 respectively 8 27 our findings revealed that the nrr and tnre of the pn a ifas reactor were comparable to previous studies 3 2 sludge activities of different biological aggregates fig 2 shows the biofilm and sludge activities in batch tests in phase i the aeration flow rate of the ifas reactor was 0 60 m3 h while do concentration reached 0 65 mg l both activated sludge and biofilm performed high aob activities which were 4 18 and 7 31 mg n g vss h respectively meanwhile activated sludge and biofilm s anammox activities were 4 92 and 1 14 mg n g vss h respectively the activated sludge s anammox activity was quite higher than that of biofilm thus the activated sludge was more important in operating anammox performance this was because the activated sludge was mainly composed of anammox sludge which was inoculated to the bottom of the uasb reactor the nob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 2 20 and 0 94 mg n g vss h respectively it demonstrated that the activated sludge performed much higher nitrite oxidization performance than biofilm in phase ii in order to restrain nob the ifas reactor s air flow rate was reduced to 0 40 m3 h and the do level was declined to 0 35 mg l the batch experiment presented that the nob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 5 61 and 0 85 mg n g vss h respectively compared with phase i the nob activity of biofilm was relatively constant however the nob activity of activated sludge was significantly increased which was not suppressed by lower do concentration besides the aob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 3 84 and 6 13 mg n g vss h meanwhile anammox activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 4 31 and 1 82 mg n g vss h respectively the decrease in air flow rate only had a slight impact on the aob and anammox activities in phase iii the nob activity of activated sludge was significantly reduced by introducing intermittent aeration aerobic 1 min anoxic 5 min the nob activities of activated sludge and biofilm reduced to 1 10 and 0 41 mg n g vss h respectively meanwhile aob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 3 42 and 5 02 mg n g vss h respectively anammox activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 3 53 and 5 52 mg n g vss h respectively compared with phase i the aob activity of biofilm only decreased by 30 in phase iii however the anammox activity of biofilm was significantly improved in phase iii both the activated sludge and biofilm played important roles in operating the anammox performance 3 3 the sludge particle size and biofilm biomass concentration fig 3a shows the particle size distribution of activated sludge the maximum frequency diameters of activated sludge in phase i and iii were 600 and 1000 μm which accounted for 6 35 and 9 80 of total activated sludge respectively large flocs were gradually formed in long term operation fig 5s according to previous research the large flocs could exhibit aob and anammox activities simultaneously 8 the aob at the outer layer of large flocs produce nitrite for anammox bacteria while the anammox bacteria at the inner layer of large flocs convert nitrite and ammonium to nitrogen in this study due to the operation of uasb mode and high reflux ratio the activated sludge was subjected to high water shear force the rising velocity of water reached 2 9 m min at the bottom of the reactor which could stimulate eps production and granular formation 25 fig 3b shows the biomass concentration in biofilm notably the biofilm s biomass rose from 26 7 phase i to 33 2 phase iii kg vss m3 yang et al 2019 also used polyurethane sponge in the ifas reactor 29 in their study the biofilm biomass increased to 34 8 kg m3 during the long term operation which was similar with present study 3 4 eps components in the biofilm and activated sludge as eps was essential for the formation of biological granules and biofilm the change of eps components was further investigated fig 4 illustrates the evolution of eps components in different biological aggregates from phase i to phase iii the eps concentrations were significantly increased in phase i the eps in activated sludge and biofilm were 41 1 and 29 8 mg gvss respectively in phase ii and phase iii the eps concentrations of activated sludge increased to 63 5 and 93 9 mg gvss respectively meanwhile the eps concentrations of biofilm increased to 43 7 and 61 0 mg gvss respectively compared with biofilm the activated sludge produced higher eps concentrations previously zhang et al 2007 have found that eps was critical for the formation of biological granules 34 shao et al 2017 also investigated the eps production of biofilm and activated sludge in ifas process 35 their reactor was operated with sbr mode and the activated sludge did not contain large flocs they found that the eps production in biofilm was much higher than that in activated sludge in this study the ifas reactor was performed with up flow mode and larger flocs was formed which might account for the higher eps concentrations in activated sludge the pn ps ratio of activated sludge and biofilm was also compared in present research from phase i to phase iii pn ps ratio of activated sludge increased from 1 05 to 1 57 while that of biofilm increased from 1 27 to 2 12 the mature biofilm and activated sludge had higher pn concentration than ps concentration shao et al 2017 observed that the ps pn ratio in biofilm was higher than floc sludge which indicated that ps was more important in the attachment of nitrifying bacteria 35 however other studies demonstrated that the pn ps ratio of biofilm was higher than activated sludge 20 36 they observed that a high pn ps ratio promoted the formation of biofilm by improving the hydrophobicity of microbial surface and reducing the electronegativity of sludge surface liang et al 2010 compared the eps levels in both nitrification biofilm reactor and nitrification activated sludge reactor 20 they found that the pn ps ratios of floc sludge and biofilm were 3 5 and 4 7 respectively besides sriwiriyarat and co workers 2021 assessed the impact of ph on the strength of biofilm 36 they concluded that the pn ps ratio was markedly associated with the strength of biofilm the results of this study revealed that the pn concentration was higher than the ps concentration in biofilm and activated sludge suggesting that a high pn concentration favored the formation of biofilm and granules 3 5 microbial compositions in the reactor fig 5a represents the microbe s compositions at phylum level the ifas reactor achieved good nitrogen removal performance at the end of phase iii the predominant phylums of activated sludge were proteobacteria 42 82 bacteroidetes 26 07 acidobacteria 7 05 planctomycetes 7 04 verrucomicrobia 3 36 and nitrospirae 1 98 meanwhile in the biofilm sample the most prominent phylum was proteobacteria 50 45 followed by planctomycetes 9 59 bacteroidetes 9 44 acidobacteria 5 87 ignavibacteriae 3 37 and chloroflexi 2 37 anammox bacteria are the member of planctomycetes phylum the planctomycetes phylum abundance of biofilm and activated sludge were similar compared with this study yang and colleagues 2019 observed higher planctomycetes phylum abundances in the ifas reactor they reported that the planctomycetes phylum accounted for 15 8 24 5 and 3 5 in the biofilm large flocs 0 2 μm and small flocs 0 2 μm respectively 29 it has been reported that the chloroflexi and firmicutes phyla are crucial for the formation of biofilm 37 the results of present study showed that the chloroflexi phylum s abundance of biofilm was larger than activated sludge in each phase moreover the abundance of chloroflexi phylum was much higher than firmicutes phylum in biofilm suggesting that chloroflexi phylum played a more important role in the formation of biofilm fig 5b indicates the genus abundance of microbe s communities the proportion of nitrogen metabolizing bacteria is presented in table 3 in the beginning the anammox floc sludge and partial nitrification biofilm were inoculated to the ifas reactor the abundances of aob nob and anammox bacteria in activated sludge were 0 31 0 21 and 1 94 respectively meanwhile the abundances of aob nob and anammox bacteria in biofilm were 2 59 0 89 and 0 19 respectively in phase ii low do condition 0 35 mg l was conducted to suppress the nob activity however the nob abundances of activated sludge and biofilm remained at 2 02 and 0 64 respectively in phase iii the ifas reactor was performed with low do condition 0 20 mg l and intermittent aeration strategy as a result the nob abundances in activated sludge and biofilm reduced to 1 29 and 0 29 respectively although high nob abundance was detected in the activated sludge the nob activities were remarkably suppressed in the ifas reactor fig 2 the nob abundance of activated sludge was greater than that of biofilm which was in good agreement with a previous report 11 meanwhile the dominant nob genus in biofilm and activated sludge was nitrospira it has been reported that the nitrospira and nitrobacter were the prevalent nob in wwtp 38 ushiki and colleagues 2017 found that nitrospira was more abundant than nitrobacter under oxygen limited conditions 39 this is probably due to the fact that the nitrospira is classified as k strategists which has higher nitrite affinity than nitrobacter under low substrate conditions in phase iii the aob abundances of biofilm and activated sludge reached 2 45 and 5 04 respectively meanwhile the anammox bacteria abundances accounted for 2 43 and 2 01 respectively the dominant anammox bacteria and aob were candidatus kuenenia and nitrosomonas respectively zou et al 2018 have analyzed the microbe s communities in the snad biofilm reactor 40 they observed that the abundances of aob and anammox bacteria were 0 3 and 1 1 on the biofilm besides liang et al 2018 found that aob and anammox bacteria accounted for 2 28 and 0 82 in the snad granules 15 compared with these studies the abundances of anammox bacteria and aob are much higher moreover other studies have described the microbial communities in the ifas reactor 41 42 they demonstrated that aob were primarily enriched in the flocs while anammox bacteria were mainly located in the biofilm zhang et al 2015 applied quantitative real time pcr to assess the microbial distribution in the ifas system 42 they proposed that anammox bacteria and aob s abundances in biofilm were 87 8 and 2 4 respectively meanwhile the anammox bacteria and aob s abundances in activated sludge were 2 6 and 54 6 respectively however yang et al 2019 found the anammox bacteria s abundance of larger flocs 0 2 μm was much higher than biofilm through qpcr analysis 29 this study demonstrated that biofilm and activated sludge both favored the enrichment of aob and anammox bacteria 4 conclusion the pn a ifas process achieved high nitrogen removing efficiency in treating low ammonium concentration wastewater the activated sludge and biofilm could perform aob and anammox activities simultaneously the anammox activities of activated sludge and biofilm reached 3 53 and 5 52 mg n g vss h respectively meanwhile aob activities of activated sludge and biofilm were 3 42 and 5 02 mg n g vss h respectively by introducing the low do and intermittent aeration strategy the nob activity of biofilm decreased from 0 85 to 0 41 mg n g vss h while the nob activity of activated sludge reduced from 5 61 to 1 10 mg n g vss h the predominant anammox bacteria aob and nob were candidatus kuenenia nitrosomonas and nitrospira respectively the activated sludge 1 29 had a higher nob abundance than biofilm 0 29 the findings of present study could provide important insights of the pn a ifas process in future application declaration of competing interest

13138,microbial lipases hold an unquestionable role among biocatalysts due to the broad spectrum of catalytic reactions in both aqueous and non aqueous media lipases are preferred over chemical catalysts due to their high specificity and stability the global demand of microbial lipases especially bacterial and fungal lipases is based on their application in various processes and industries engaged in meat dairy fats and oils surfactant tannery cosmetics and pharmaceuticals production lipases also have potential application in treatment of lipid rich wastewater excessive lipids in wastewater cause serious environmental problems like clogging of sewer line and oily layer generation on the water surface which prevents oxygen and sunlight penetration affecting the aquatic life existing physico chemical treatment methods for lipid rich wastewater are costly non ecofriendly and pose secondary pollution problem microbial lipase mediated bioremediation presents an attractive alternate approach to overcome these issues but it is an under explored area hence this article attempts to discuss and review the limited studies on the use of lipases in wastewater treatment and potential research gaps the review mainly focuses on the sources of lipids discharged in the wastewater and associated concerns existing techniques for lipid removal applicability of lipase mediated treatment for lipid containing wastewater which gives a typical understanding of the lipid waste management this review also summarizes the commercially available microbial lipases and need for further development for environmental application graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lipid wastewater lipid pollution physico chemical treatment lipase commercial lipases 1 introduction the demand for clean water and environment is increasing due to the growing population size industrialization and civilization wastewater treatment is an enormous challenge due to high wastewater generation and the need to recycle it 1 adequate wastewater treatment depends on various factors such as the source of waste discharge e g industrial domestic chemical composition e g heavy metals inorganic and organic matter content suspended and dissolved components in wastewater e g high ionic strength presence of inhibitory agents etc 2 lipids like fats oil and grease fog are significant components discharged in wastewater from food processing industries 3 restaurants dairy 4 5 oil refinery 6 meat processing tannery 7 cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries 8 dairy wastewater contains 8288 mg l of fog 9 while fog content of oil refinery food packaging houses and domestic wastewater ranges between 110 26 4150 100 1000 and 50 100 mg l respectively 10 13 discharge of treated or partially treated lipids from above industries leads to the development of oily layer on the water surface which prevents oxygen and sunlight penetration resulting in adverse effects on aquatic ecosystem moreover oil droplets aggregate with suspended particles in wastewater create blockages in sewer lines and interrupt the treatment process and wastewater flow further cooking oils are oxidized and change their properties when heated at high temperature in open air resulting in the formation of carcinogenic by products 14 european union banned the reuse of cooking oils even for animal feedstock as they pose threat to human life by bioaccumulation 14 15 thus lipids in wastewater are not only a threat to the ecosystem but also pose human health and carcinogenic risk due to the above issues lipid removal from wastewater is of immense importance and different mechanical and chemical techniques are used to this end but their application is limited due to the high cost and adverse environmental effects bioremediation is one of the effective and trending methods to treat pollutants naturally many bacteria and fungi produce lipase along with other hydrolytic enzymes which are helpful in bioremediation lipases are omnipresent enzymes belonging to the class of triacylglycerol acylhydrolases having enzyme commission e c number 3 1 1 3 1 16 this enzyme has extensive industrial applications due to its ability to hydrolyze triacylglycerol to glycerol and fatty acids also it does not need any additional cofactor for enzymatic reaction 17 18 studies have reported that few lipases are highly efficient even in the presence of different chemicals acids bases solvents detergents and salts and under different environmental conditions temperature ph which is essential for industrial applications 19 besides industrial applications microbial lipases potentially offer many advantages over chemical and mechanical methods in wastewater treatment however there is a considerable research gap in the utility of lipases and low cost lipase production for real world wastewater treatment lot of research work is needed in this area by exploring new sources of lipase recombinant expression for stable low cost and higher lipase production optimization of lipase production and development of application methods for improving efficiency and recyclability in treatment plant several studies have attempted lipase mediated treatment of wastewater at laboratory scale however feasibility studies at full scale are lacking for which the above issues must be addressed further the information on lipase mediated treatment of lipid rich wastewater is fragmented and is not reviewed well to fill this gap the current review focuses on the significant sources of lipid discharge and associated problems lipid concentrations in different wastewaters existing lipid removal methods application of lipase for wastewater treatment and its limitations by integrating various dimensions of wastewater and lipase enzyme this article comprehensively provides state of art and insightful view of the subject with future needs of research 2 lipids lipids are hydrophobic organic compounds that are insoluble in water but soluble in non polar solvents lipids are comprised of carbon hydrogen and oxygen as major components 20 they have high energy content and hence make significant contribution in the diet 21 lipids are distinguished into different classes shown in fig 1 free fatty acids are hydrolysis products of lipids 22 they are more susceptible to oxidation and hence are less stable than lipids triacylglycerol or triglyceride molecules contain a glycerol backbone and are significant components of vegetable oil and animal fats in dietary products 21 triacylglycerols are solids when they contain saturated fatty acids called as fats and liquids with unsaturated acids referred as oils 23 triacylglycerols are generally found in more than 95 of typical indian food such as fried food vegetable oil butter whole milk cheese meat etc 20 natural sources of triacylglycerol are avocados olive corn nuts etc phospholipids consist of esters of glycerol fatty acids phosphoric acid along with other alcohols phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine are some widespread phospholipids 24 sphingolipids steroids and lipoproteins are some other types of lipids with important biological functions in various organisms including humans 25 wax consists of fatty acids esterified to fatty alcohol and it helps in various biological functions for example waxes are present in large quantities in different life forms to prevent water loss from their body they are extensively applied in pharmaceutical cosmetic and plasticizer industries they are usually extracted from expensive jojoba and spermaceti oil for commercial applications 20 3 sources and behaviour of lipids in wastewater a variety of lipids such as fog are widely used in cosmetic oil refinery agro pharmaceutical automobile pulp tannery and food industries these industries release a lot of lipids into wastewater which causes severe environmental damage adverse effects on plants animals etc 15 lipid content and concentration in any wastewater are dependent on the source of waste generation in food processing industries oil is widely used on a large scale to process and cook a variety of food items used oil is not recyclable for cooking because of the changes in its chemical and physical properties during heating at high temperature hence such used oil is disposed into the wastewater 27 triglycerides from kitchen and restaurant waste are also dominant component of fog 28 various activities like utensil washing unintentional spillage and food waste disposal further contribute to lipid contamination in sewer lines wastewater discharged from meat processing industries contains 250 to 5000 mg l of fog 29 in the dairy industry wastewater discharge is rich in milk fats the dairy wastewater treatment is tedious due to the fat aggregation which depletes the dissolved oxygen in water increases biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod 30 discharge of various types of lipids from different sources creates special problems as lipids are hydrophobic and do not solubilize in water however they change their physical properties at low temperatures such as the formation of tiny droplets and later aggregation of such droplets it results in the clogging of water flow lipid layer formation on top of water surface and reduction in oxygen penetration which ultimately affect water quality and aquatic life 31 in urban areas lipids may block the sewer line hot water can melt the fats and clear the flow but they again aggregate downstream on the surface of the sewer line causing blockage due to low temperature therefore discharge of lipids in wastewater imposes severe environmental threat and may become a hurdle in the natural remediation process husain et al 32 explained the problem caused by fog in wastewater handling and treatment the sewer line blockage due to fog is a worldwide concern and it is estimated that at least 10 350 36 000 sanitary sewer overflows occur per year in the usa out of which approximately 47 sewer line blockages are due to the fog discharge the same issue is also recorded in various countries in uk 50 and in malaysia 70 of sewer blockage complaints are reported due to the fog discharged in sewer lines thus fog varies qualitatively and quantitatively depending on the source but it ultimately leads to similar ecological and operational problems therefore proper fog management in wastewater is necessary to prevent environmental pollution 4 lipid removal techniques lipid removal from wastewater is a very crucial step and it is a major challenge for effective wastewater treatment many techniques are being tested to emulsify or remove fog from wastewater before the treatment process major lipid removal approaches are discussed below 4 1 chemical and mechanical techniques different mechanical methods are conventionally employed to remove lipids in primary wastewater treatment skimming tank and oil grease trap are widely installed at wastewater treatment plants to remove fog grease trap is based on gravity separation due to the density difference between oil and water it helps remove free oil having droplet size of 150 μm by aggregating the lighter lipids particles at the top surface of water skimming tank involves skimming off the oily layer these conventional methods have several limitations like low efficiency higher operational and maintenance cost besides they are not effective in removing emulsified lipids 15 some alternative methods like floatation and hydro cyclone are also reported to separate lipids from wastewater flotation method was earlier used in mineral and metal separation but has now found environmental applications this method is useful in removal of emulsified lipids in dissolved air flotation daf fine air bubbles are pumped into the wastewater which promote the aggregation and subsequent removal of lipids only 50 fog removal is achieved by traditional sedimentation method which is improved to 74 by daf 34 hydro cyclone forces liquid into a circular motion by injecting it tangentially against a circular configuration and collects the lighter lipids particles at the top however the method is cost and energy intensive chemical mediated treatment is useful to remove dispersed oil some widely used chemical methods are coagulation flocculation and precipitation these methods aid in aggregating suspended and colloidal oil droplets into larger particles and improve the performance of mechanical lipid removal techniques due to the high porosity and or large surface area of various sorbent materials lipids are adsorbed and can be easily removed 33 about 71 fog removal is reported by using chemical coagulants 34 these chemical methods for lipid removal suffer from issues like low efficiency higher operational cost and generation of secondary environmental pollution abd el gawad 15 reported that natural material like zeolite is better organic pollutant removal under optimal conditions which shown 99 fog removal by increasing contact period with the adsorbent apart from these conventional methods some advanced techniques like chemical oxidation electrochemical methods 35 and electrocoagulation techniques are also available 36 ozone oxidation and fenton oxidation can remove the cooking oil from water 37 38 the major mechanical and chemical lipid removal techniques are summarized in table 1a however these methods are expensive and use hazardous reagents finally the lipid waste collected from mechanical and chemical treatment methods is either incinerated or dumped in landfills which creates environmental pollution 31 these issues warrant investigation into ecofriendly and sustainable methods for lipid rich wastewater treatment 4 2 biological techniques the attention has been shifted towards eco friendly and cost effective techniques to overcome the issues posed by chemical and mechanical methods different methods have been studied for the biodegradation of lipids in wastewater treatment processes for natural bioremediation it is essential to maintain the necessary nutrient load in the wastewater treatment plant 39 several researchers further advised adding pre cultured microbes for the sustained growth of biological agents which play an essential role in pollutant removal microbes have the ability to secrete extracellular lipases which effectively degrade the lipids and are ecofriendly and cost effective over the physico chemical methods it may be noted that microbes and enzymes are susceptible to variable environmental and physico chemical conditions temperature ph presence of organic solvents metals salts in wastewater etc hence their pollutant removal efficiency depends on the wastewater composition and prevailing conditions industrial effluents are often complex compositions with different types of organics inorganics and many recalcitrant components therefore effective treatment of lipid rich wastewater is majorly dependent on the nature of lipase enzyme ideal lipase should tolerate such complex conditions such as different temperature 5 60 c ph 5 9 and presence of solvents for efficient lipid removal jaganmai and jinka 30 highlighted various lipase producing microbes for different applications pseudomonas sp was reported to remove lipids from wastewater at alkaline ph and varied temperature range the potential biological lipid removal techniques can be broadly categorized into 3 groups which are discussed below and summarized in table 1b 4 2 1 whole cell biocatalysis microbes generally secrete lipase extracellularly in the growth medium such microorganisms can be directly used for wastewater treatment the microbes can utilize the complex organic load present in wastewater for their growth however survival in wastewater conditions inoculum size and other parameters must be standardized before actual field application several studies have reported isolation of lipase producers from lipid rich wastewater which presents a suitable niche for promising lipolytic microbes bacterial consortium of pseudomonas aeruginosa lp602 bacillus sp b304 and acinetobacter calcoaceticus lp009 was formulated at a lab scale to treat lipid rich wastewater 40 tsuji et al 41 reported mrakia blollopis for treatment of milk fat containing wastewater in cold region in another study yarrowia lipolytica was used for oily wastewater treatment because it could thrive for long time in the conventional activated sludge process however the lipase production was slow and not effective for lipid degradation to overcome this difficulty song et al 42 over expressed the lipase liprs from the fungus rhizopus stolonifer on the cell surface of y lipolytica using the flocculation functional domain flo1p of saccharomyces cerevisiae as the protein anchor the characteristic of lipase from r stolonifer was fit for oily wastewater treatment while y lipolytica can stay alive in oily wastewater for a long time it resulted in an effective recombinant strain with higher activity which removed 96 9 of oil and 97 6 of cod in 72 h fungi are extensively reported for lipase production but their application in wastewater presents operational problems and hence they are not investigated extensively some lipase producing fungal species widely reported are rhizopus aspergillus beauveria botrytis cladosporium colletotrichum fusarium geotrichum penicillium rhizomucor and verticillium 4 2 2 application of crude lipase preparation purification of lipase is costly and hence the application of commercially available pure lipases is not feasible therefore use of lipase for wastewater treatment is limited to circumvent this problem crude or partially purified lipases preparations have been used by researchers for wastewater treatment mahdi et al 43 studied crude lipase production from aeromonas sp s1 using sal deoiled seed cake extract and its application in dairy wastewater treatment it gave 86 reduction of cod after 12 h and 75 reduction of fog after 96 h of treatment saraca and ugur 44 studied the hydrolysis of kitchen waste oil and edible oil using crude lipase obtained from acinetobacter haemolyticus ns02 30 partially purified lipase from aspergillus awamori which was isolated from seawater showed 92 lipid removal in simulated wastewater 45 many laboratory studies are available for the possibility of lipid rich wastewater treatment with crude lipases but the real world application is still lacking 4 2 3 immobilization of lipase lipid degradation in wastewater by whole cells or enzyme preparations suffers from limitations like low stability low activity wash out etc these issues can be overcome by immobilization of cells or lipases to increase their stability and reusability using cheap support materials the research interest is attracted towards the immobilization of lipases lipase immobilization can be achieved by physical adsorption encapsulation and confinement or chemical methods cross linking covalent binding choice of immobilization method depends on the interaction between enzyme and support for instance immobilization of y lipolytica lipase on octyl agarose and octadecyl sepabeads led to higher enzyme activity and greater stability 46 in another study pseudomonas sp lipase was covalently immobilized on porous polymethyl acrylamide cross linked with n n methylene bisacrylamide for wastewater treatment 47 dumore and mukhopadhyay 48 studied lipase immobilization on chitosan support for synthetic oily wastewater treatment which removed 48 fog and 47 cod kamini et al 49 reported 52 fog and 32 cod reduction in coconut oil mill effluent by immobilizing partially purified lipase from staphylococcus pasteuri com 4a on celite 5 properties of lipase enzyme lipase was first discovered by claude bernard in 1856 in pancreatic juice as an enzyme that hydrolyzed hydrophobic oil droplets and converted them into soluble forms it is triacylglycerol hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides to free fatty acids diacylglycerol monoacylglycerol and glycerol 19 21 28 32 65 some lipases have affinity for short chain fatty acids acetic butyric capric decanoic acid etc while others have preference for unsaturated fatty acids oleic linolenic acid etc many others are non specific and randomly split the fatty acids from triglycerides 66 thus the lipase activity depends on the chain length of the fatty acid location of fatty acid in the glycerol backbone and its degree of unsaturation besides hydrolytic reaction lipases can exhibit variety of catalytic activities such as interesterification esterification aminolysis acidolysis and alcoholysis which contribute to its application in a wide range of industries fig 2 19 67 in esterification lipases can synthesize esters from glycerol and long chain fatty acids in a non aqueous medium other reactions such as interesterification aminolysis acidolysis and alcoholysis involve transesterification process where an alkoxy group is exchanged between an ester and respective chemical agent 68 transesterification reaction is useful in biodiesel production lipases do not require a cofactor for their reactions which is an added advantage for biocatalysis 19 69 as per various reports lipases have a molecular weight in the range of 19 60 kda and are monomeric proteins they have high specificity catalytic efficiency 70 and wide scope in various industries and environmental management applications 6 sources of lipase enzyme lipase is a ubiquitous enzyme lipase can be produced from various natural sources like animals plants and microbes among the lipases reported in the literature 18 are derived from animals 11 from plants 3 from algae 21 from fungi 45 from bacteria and 2 are from other sources 71 lipases are classified based on the sources from which they are screened and their substrate range fig 3 among them microbial lipases are widely used due to their unique properties such as high stability in various physico chemical conditions selectivity substrate specificity easy production and isolation mostly microbial lipases are glycoproteins and they may be intracellular extracellular or membrane bound 68 a representative list of microbes reported for lipase production is given in table 2 an extracellular microbial lipase is freely released in the growth medium and is easy to extract hence extracellular lipases are widely studied as compared to intracellular lipases 72 74 lipolytic activity of lipase is dependent on the source of microorganism from which it is screened therefore a wide diversity of microbes in various environments like seawater alkaline lakes hot springs volcanic escapes extremely contaminated soil and frozen soil like antarctica are being explored for lipase production with desirable properties 41 75 6 1 bacterial lipase bacterial lipases are omnipresent enzymes that have the ability to use wide range of substrates many lipases have the ability to catalyze reactions at high temperature wide ph range and in the presence of solvents several lipase catalyzed reactions are enantioselective or regioselective while others are non specific 66 76 bacterial lipases can also work in heterogeneous media and exhibit interfacial activation which is useful in various industrial applications 77 78 these properties render bacterial lipases suitable for application in wastewater treatment lipase producing bacteria are widely distributed in the environment and are mostly non pathogenic and do not pose any harm to the environment or humans bacillus and pseudomonas are reported as prominent lipase producers in the literature thermo tolerant lipases are reported from thermophilic bacteria such as bacillus stearothermophilus and bacillus thermoleovorans 79 other potential lipase producing bacterial species such as acinetobacter calcoaceticus bacillus serratia pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus epidermidis thermobifida fusca burkholderia etc are also reported 66 bacterial lipase production can be improved by optimizing nitrogen and carbon sources temperature ph inorganic salts or other growth parameters recombinant lipase production or protein engineering can further enhance their efficiency in wastewater treatment as discussed in the section on advantages of microbial lipase in wastewater treatment 6 2 fungal lipase fungal lipases have been extensively studied and reported as early as the 1950s some well studied lipase producing fungi include aspergillus penicillium rhizopus oryzae kg 5 colletotrichum gloeosporioides mucor sp y lipolytica aspergillus niger mtcc 2594 pseudozyma hubeiensis hb85a and fusarium 26 66 like bacteria lipase producing fungal species are also isolated from lipid contaminated environment and are generally non hazardous several fungal lipases are reported for industrial uses but their application towards bioremediation of lipid rich wastewater is scanty it may be because filaments fungi create froth in the wastewater causing operational difficulties to overcome this issue a crude lipase obtained from various fungi can be used for ecofriendly treatment of lipids in wastewater 7 applications of lipase enzyme the circular economy and bio economy concepts have gained popularity in recent years not only to reduce the environmental impact of waste but also to promote the expansion and diversification of bio based markets the microbial lipase market was estimated to be usd 425 0 million in 2018 and it is predictable to reach usd 590 2 million by 2023 19 the market price of lipase is estimated to range between 23 9 and 207 usd 100 mg enzyme 68 different applications of lipase are summarized in fig 4 apart from the industrial applications lipases are helpful in wastewater treatment which is the primary focus of this review 7 1 application of lipase in wastewater treatment lipases are very effective for biofilm degradation sludge digestion improving sludge dewatering and fog digestion in the wastewater treatment plant 15 30 94 lipases are increasingly studied for the bioremediation process because of their advantages over chemically catalyzed processes the worldwide scenario on the utilization of lipase for various bioremediation processes is summarized in table 3 lipase is useful to overcome blockage problems posed by milk fats curdling in dairy wastewater the decrease in cod and bod in dairy waste is demonstrated to be due to the degradation of fats by lipase producing microbes tsuji et al 41 studied thermo tolerant and ph tolerant lipase from the antarctic yeast strain m blollopis sk4 the strain portrayed 1 25 fold higher bod removal rate and its lipase was stable in a wide temperature range 10 c to 65 c and ph range 4 10 it was recommended for dairy wastewater treatment to reduce milk fats lipase from aeribacillus pallidus showed thermostability 65 c ph stability ph 10 halo tolerance solvent stability 50 stability for 2 h and was recommended for oil removal from wastewater 95 rigo et al 29 worked on lipid containing wastewater from the meat processing industry they used 0 1 and 5 of commercial lipase for the treatment of 250 mg l and 5000 mg l fog containing wastewater which showed promising results in pre treatment process few researchers have suggested extraction of microbial lipases from lipid containing wastewater nabarlatz et al 96 studied the activity and recovery of lipase from wastewater sludge heater et al 75 reported that immobilization of lipase can improve its environmental applications efficiency and sustainability talbert et al 97 discussed application of immobilized lipase to convert food waste to valuable products integrated approach consisting of identifying and preventing oil spill sources separation from waste before treatment and lipid removal using lipase can result in effective lipid waste management 7 2 other applications of lipases enzyme apart from the applications of lipases in bioremediation and solving environmental issues microbial lipases are also widely used in the industrial processes such as biodiesel production 100 production of enzyme modified cheese emc 101 enzyme modified dairy ingredients 102 fatty acids 103 surfactants for the baking industries etc 19 30 priyanka et al 104 reported solvent ph 5 9 and temperature 40 c stable lipase from pseudomonas reineke for biodiesel production modi et al 105 also reported the possibility of converting vegetable oil into biodiesel using microbial lipases lipases play a very crucial role in food industries for various product formation such as flavour and fragrance long chain carboxylic acids and long chain alcohols are used to produce wax esters for personal care products in a lipase catalyzed reaction 106 thus microbial lipases are important for industries to produce dozens of products without using hazardous chemicals table 4 shows the role of microbial lipases in different industrial processes 7 3 indian scenario on research and application of lipase enzyme in india lipase production and optimization from different microbes have been studied by several researchers table 5 dhundale and hemke 116 isolated broad temperature range 40 to 90 c and halo tolerant nacl concentration 0 5 4 m lipases from haloalkaliphilic bacteria from water and sediment of lonar crater for various applications milk fat oil waste from restaurants and food processing factories can be cleaned by employing such lipases prasad and manjunath 117 studied bacterial lipases from oil mill domestic dumpsite and dairy and carried out comparative study for oily wastewater treatment bhavani et al 118 screened lipase stability from bacteria under various environmental conditions like temperature dharmsthiti and kuhasuntisuk 60 isolated and identified p aeruginosa lp602 from wastewater for kitchen wastewater treatment apart from this attention was given by few researchers to the cold adaptive lipase from the himalayan glacier kumar and thakur 112 reported lipase from a psychrotrophic bacterium from sikkim himalaya for detergent formulation pandey et al 119 reported cold adaptive lipase from cold desert and glacier for applications in biotechnological industries another cold adaptive lipase was produced optimized and characterized from microbacterium luteolum isolated from gangotri glacier 120 lipase purification characterization and immobilization methods are also described for industrial application by various indian researchers but the detailed field study on lipid rich wastewater treatment is still missing 8 advantages of lipase enzyme in wastewater treatment industries are focusing on lipid waste management due to the importance in environmental conservation due to the limitations of physico chemical methods like formation of hazardous by products high cost higher energy requirement etc preference is shifted towards biological wastewater treatment for lipids removal lipase is one of the effective enzymes for lipids removal from wastewater lipases consume low energy do not require harsh conditions or chemicals and have varied substrate specificity 18 several lipases have other desired characteristics such as stability in extreme condition and easy production lipases also do not require cofactor for their reactions which is an advantage for in vitro reactions 19 69 microbial lipase can also help in the production of different value added products from waste lipids 121 lipase is projected to be the best option for bioenergy production from food waste and wastewater due to its ability to tolerate a variety of solvents and temperatures further lipase is promising for anaerobic digestion of waste containing lipids which yields biogas in a significant amount now a day attention is given to the isolation of lipase producing strains from different environmental sources enzyme purification characterization and their applications in various industrial and environmental settings this is because lipases from different sources differ in their substrate range selectivity and tolerance to environmental parameters moreover recombinant lipase production and protein engineering can improve its yield and efficiency hence there is need to focus on recombinant dna technology for directed evolution of improved lipase biocatalysts mou et al 122 over expressed calb lipase from candida antarctica in y lipolytica as cell factory the strain showed higher lipase productivity in an in situ fibrous bed bioreactor isfbb developed using sugarcane bagasse as the immobilization support in another study zhang et al over expressed thermophilic bacillus thermocatenulatus lipase btl2 in escherichia coli bl21 de3 which showed excellent resistance to high temperature and organic solvents with enzyme activity of 35 54 u mg cells 123 another advantage of microbial lipolytic enzymes is their compatibility with support materials immobilization of lipase with the help of hydrophobic acyl chain glutaraldehyde ionic groups vinyl sulfone or glyoxyl groups has been successfully tested immobilization of lipase helps to improve lipase stability and prevent enzyme wash out 124 125 economic production of lipase is essential for its environmental application microbial lipase production is strongly influenced by culture medium composition the nitrogen and carbon sources in the media can be replaced by using cheap agro waste material for the low cost production of lipase optimization of growth and medium conditions can lead to enhanced lipase production the fermentation process i e solid substrate submerge fermentation or batch continuous process also affects lipase production depending on the lipase producing microbes many research reports have emphasized the application of agricultural waste for the production of some fine chemicals and enzymes 127 soybean meal 128 various oils 129 corn steep liquor 130 ice husk wheat bran lentil husk banana waste watermelon waste etc are reported for high lipase production in solid state fermentation 131 maria et al 132 developed sustainable bioprocess for lipase production from diutina rugosa using alternative culture media the authors studied and reported cheaper medium price per unit lipase production using agro industrial waste different cheap raw materials used for microbial lipases production are shown in table 6 due to the many advantages discussed above and the eco friendly nature lipases have great potential for environmental applications 38 9 limitations of lipase enzyme in wastewater treatment the utilization of lipases has certain limitations due to their high production costs some lipase mediated processes can also under perform due to issues like stability or inactivation under desired conditions 1 126 there is a lack of scientifically accepted lipase based technology for large scale lipid rich wastewater treatment microbial whole cell or lipase mediated treatments generally require specific range of environmental conditions like temperature ph nutrient availability carbon and nitrogen sources limiting their application under dynamic wastewater conditions moreover some factors such as high cod temperature ph color metal ions and solvents make it very difficult to treat industrial effluent 150 lipase enzymes are prone to inactivation or reduced activity in the complex condition of wastewater while application of whole cells may result in low survival or slow lipase production immobilization can improve stability and prevent wash out but its applicability in full scale wastewater treatment is poorly studied improvement of the natural lipid degrading capacity of microbes and their ready commercial availability are also necessary for their applicability most studies have reported microbial lipases especially from fungi for specific industrial applications while studies on lipase mediated treatment of wastewater are limited to laboratory scale the use of costly commercially available lipases is not cost effective for wastewater application as there is no value added production to meet the enzyme cost hence low cost microbial lipase production optimization and characterization are urgently needed for economical lipid rich waste treatment the environmental applications of enzymes can become economical when their environmental effects are taken into consideration it is evident that physico chemical wastewater treatment methods generally involve high energy and temperature chemicals with adverse ecological and health effects safety risk recalcitrant agents high water consumption and generation of secondary pollution the cost of these damages can offset the higher cost of enzymatic lipid removal methods boyce et al 151 assessed the suitability and economics of commercial protease and lipase products for cleaning in place application in the dairy industry by considering benefits of enzyme treatment like operation at lower temperature decreased energy and water consumption improved safety reduced waste generation and environmental impact they suggested that replacing caustic based cleaning procedures with enzymes would be economically viable 10 commercial lipases in the era of enzyme technology the concern is being given to lipolytic enzymes for environmental management and industrial applications purified and concentrated lipases are necessary for industrial applications which are mainly obtained from microbial sources through submerged or solid state fermentation lipolytic enzymes are commercially available in powder form or occasionally in microencapsulated form 152 microbial lipases have predominant importance in market more than 200 microbial enzymes are used commercially and 20 types are produced on an actual industrial scale 26 the market cost varies between 23 90 and 207 usd per 100 mg of lipase enzyme 68 castilho et al analysed the economy of lipase production by penicillium restrictum using solid substrate and submerged fermentation processes 153 for a production scale of 100 m3 year the submerged fermentation cost was 68 higher than the product selling price while solid substrate fermentation cost was 47 lower than the selling price the lower cost of fungal solid substrate fermentation was attributed to low capital investment and cheap agro waste raw material 153 hidayatullah et al 154 also assessed the economy of lipase production from aspergillus sp using solid substrate fermentation in terms of npv net present value irr internal rate of return payback period and the benefit cost ratio the results for 10 kg production scale showed npv of 8500 usd 54 20 of irr 1 95 years of payback period and 3 36 of benefit cost ratio lipases are very selective for their catalytic reactions and hence they are commercialized for a particular application some commercially available lipases for various industrial applications and their suppliers are listed in table 7 67 commercially available lipases are mostly used in the industrial process and very limited studies are reported for wastewater treatment due to their high cost thus production cost is a very important hurdle in environmental application of lipases there is a need to establish low cost lipase production techniques yielding high volumes of crude or partially purified enzyme preparations which are more suitable for environmental applications this endeavour will require screening of broad specificity and highly tolerant lipases optimization of cheap raw materials and low cost extraction techniques which can separate undesirable components from the enzyme extract 11 future scope several studies are available on screening of lipases from bacteria and fungi from various environmental sources for industrial application however a considerable research gap is observed in the screening and full scale application of lipases in wastewater treatment fig 5 outlines the major problems posed by lipids in wastewater and potential solutions fungal lipases are more extensively reported than bacterial lipases bacterial lipase production is rapid and easily scalable and hence must be investigated further lipid waste treatment strategy significantly depends on the types of lipid waste generated by industries further industrial effluent is a complex mixture of various chemicals and pollutants which may affect the lipase activity or the bacterial growth and lipase production ability proper characterization of lipid wastewater and normalization of physico chemical parameters before lipase treatment may help alleviate the inhibitory effects characterization of lipase for stability under large range of solvents detergents ph metal ions and temperature can also be targeted to select lipases suitable for specific wastewater type lipase activity and stability under different environmental conditions depends on the source of lipase producing microbes hence screening from microbes isolated from extreme environmental sources is needed for isolation and characterization of stable lipases while selecting suitable producers other desired characteristics such as fast growth rate biosafety concerns cheap nutrient requirement etc should also be considered besides such lipases should be scaled up and demonstrated at industrial level to determine the feasibility which has not happened so far rational use of lipases for lipid removal from wastewater remains largely unexplored purified lipase can be added to the lipid rich wastewater but purification costs may be high hence crude lipase or lipase producing whole cells can be used addition of enzyme cocktail or microbial consortia can provide functional redundancy and increased sustainability better understanding and designing of treatment process such as immobilization may improve stability and reusability of lipases thereby improving the process efficiency low cost and natural materials for immobilization of lipase need to be explored in more detail recombinant over expression of lipase with suitable expression vector can help to improve production environmental applicability of recombinant lipases or microbes must be explored under the prevailing regulations of genetically modified organisms extraction of valuable by products from lipid rich wastewater may attract the industries by improving economy this aspect should be kept in mind in further research in this field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13138,microbial lipases hold an unquestionable role among biocatalysts due to the broad spectrum of catalytic reactions in both aqueous and non aqueous media lipases are preferred over chemical catalysts due to their high specificity and stability the global demand of microbial lipases especially bacterial and fungal lipases is based on their application in various processes and industries engaged in meat dairy fats and oils surfactant tannery cosmetics and pharmaceuticals production lipases also have potential application in treatment of lipid rich wastewater excessive lipids in wastewater cause serious environmental problems like clogging of sewer line and oily layer generation on the water surface which prevents oxygen and sunlight penetration affecting the aquatic life existing physico chemical treatment methods for lipid rich wastewater are costly non ecofriendly and pose secondary pollution problem microbial lipase mediated bioremediation presents an attractive alternate approach to overcome these issues but it is an under explored area hence this article attempts to discuss and review the limited studies on the use of lipases in wastewater treatment and potential research gaps the review mainly focuses on the sources of lipids discharged in the wastewater and associated concerns existing techniques for lipid removal applicability of lipase mediated treatment for lipid containing wastewater which gives a typical understanding of the lipid waste management this review also summarizes the commercially available microbial lipases and need for further development for environmental application graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lipid wastewater lipid pollution physico chemical treatment lipase commercial lipases 1 introduction the demand for clean water and environment is increasing due to the growing population size industrialization and civilization wastewater treatment is an enormous challenge due to high wastewater generation and the need to recycle it 1 adequate wastewater treatment depends on various factors such as the source of waste discharge e g industrial domestic chemical composition e g heavy metals inorganic and organic matter content suspended and dissolved components in wastewater e g high ionic strength presence of inhibitory agents etc 2 lipids like fats oil and grease fog are significant components discharged in wastewater from food processing industries 3 restaurants dairy 4 5 oil refinery 6 meat processing tannery 7 cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries 8 dairy wastewater contains 8288 mg l of fog 9 while fog content of oil refinery food packaging houses and domestic wastewater ranges between 110 26 4150 100 1000 and 50 100 mg l respectively 10 13 discharge of treated or partially treated lipids from above industries leads to the development of oily layer on the water surface which prevents oxygen and sunlight penetration resulting in adverse effects on aquatic ecosystem moreover oil droplets aggregate with suspended particles in wastewater create blockages in sewer lines and interrupt the treatment process and wastewater flow further cooking oils are oxidized and change their properties when heated at high temperature in open air resulting in the formation of carcinogenic by products 14 european union banned the reuse of cooking oils even for animal feedstock as they pose threat to human life by bioaccumulation 14 15 thus lipids in wastewater are not only a threat to the ecosystem but also pose human health and carcinogenic risk due to the above issues lipid removal from wastewater is of immense importance and different mechanical and chemical techniques are used to this end but their application is limited due to the high cost and adverse environmental effects bioremediation is one of the effective and trending methods to treat pollutants naturally many bacteria and fungi produce lipase along with other hydrolytic enzymes which are helpful in bioremediation lipases are omnipresent enzymes belonging to the class of triacylglycerol acylhydrolases having enzyme commission e c number 3 1 1 3 1 16 this enzyme has extensive industrial applications due to its ability to hydrolyze triacylglycerol to glycerol and fatty acids also it does not need any additional cofactor for enzymatic reaction 17 18 studies have reported that few lipases are highly efficient even in the presence of different chemicals acids bases solvents detergents and salts and under different environmental conditions temperature ph which is essential for industrial applications 19 besides industrial applications microbial lipases potentially offer many advantages over chemical and mechanical methods in wastewater treatment however there is a considerable research gap in the utility of lipases and low cost lipase production for real world wastewater treatment lot of research work is needed in this area by exploring new sources of lipase recombinant expression for stable low cost and higher lipase production optimization of lipase production and development of application methods for improving efficiency and recyclability in treatment plant several studies have attempted lipase mediated treatment of wastewater at laboratory scale however feasibility studies at full scale are lacking for which the above issues must be addressed further the information on lipase mediated treatment of lipid rich wastewater is fragmented and is not reviewed well to fill this gap the current review focuses on the significant sources of lipid discharge and associated problems lipid concentrations in different wastewaters existing lipid removal methods application of lipase for wastewater treatment and its limitations by integrating various dimensions of wastewater and lipase enzyme this article comprehensively provides state of art and insightful view of the subject with future needs of research 2 lipids lipids are hydrophobic organic compounds that are insoluble in water but soluble in non polar solvents lipids are comprised of carbon hydrogen and oxygen as major components 20 they have high energy content and hence make significant contribution in the diet 21 lipids are distinguished into different classes shown in fig 1 free fatty acids are hydrolysis products of lipids 22 they are more susceptible to oxidation and hence are less stable than lipids triacylglycerol or triglyceride molecules contain a glycerol backbone and are significant components of vegetable oil and animal fats in dietary products 21 triacylglycerols are solids when they contain saturated fatty acids called as fats and liquids with unsaturated acids referred as oils 23 triacylglycerols are generally found in more than 95 of typical indian food such as fried food vegetable oil butter whole milk cheese meat etc 20 natural sources of triacylglycerol are avocados olive corn nuts etc phospholipids consist of esters of glycerol fatty acids phosphoric acid along with other alcohols phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine are some widespread phospholipids 24 sphingolipids steroids and lipoproteins are some other types of lipids with important biological functions in various organisms including humans 25 wax consists of fatty acids esterified to fatty alcohol and it helps in various biological functions for example waxes are present in large quantities in different life forms to prevent water loss from their body they are extensively applied in pharmaceutical cosmetic and plasticizer industries they are usually extracted from expensive jojoba and spermaceti oil for commercial applications 20 3 sources and behaviour of lipids in wastewater a variety of lipids such as fog are widely used in cosmetic oil refinery agro pharmaceutical automobile pulp tannery and food industries these industries release a lot of lipids into wastewater which causes severe environmental damage adverse effects on plants animals etc 15 lipid content and concentration in any wastewater are dependent on the source of waste generation in food processing industries oil is widely used on a large scale to process and cook a variety of food items used oil is not recyclable for cooking because of the changes in its chemical and physical properties during heating at high temperature hence such used oil is disposed into the wastewater 27 triglycerides from kitchen and restaurant waste are also dominant component of fog 28 various activities like utensil washing unintentional spillage and food waste disposal further contribute to lipid contamination in sewer lines wastewater discharged from meat processing industries contains 250 to 5000 mg l of fog 29 in the dairy industry wastewater discharge is rich in milk fats the dairy wastewater treatment is tedious due to the fat aggregation which depletes the dissolved oxygen in water increases biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod 30 discharge of various types of lipids from different sources creates special problems as lipids are hydrophobic and do not solubilize in water however they change their physical properties at low temperatures such as the formation of tiny droplets and later aggregation of such droplets it results in the clogging of water flow lipid layer formation on top of water surface and reduction in oxygen penetration which ultimately affect water quality and aquatic life 31 in urban areas lipids may block the sewer line hot water can melt the fats and clear the flow but they again aggregate downstream on the surface of the sewer line causing blockage due to low temperature therefore discharge of lipids in wastewater imposes severe environmental threat and may become a hurdle in the natural remediation process husain et al 32 explained the problem caused by fog in wastewater handling and treatment the sewer line blockage due to fog is a worldwide concern and it is estimated that at least 10 350 36 000 sanitary sewer overflows occur per year in the usa out of which approximately 47 sewer line blockages are due to the fog discharge the same issue is also recorded in various countries in uk 50 and in malaysia 70 of sewer blockage complaints are reported due to the fog discharged in sewer lines thus fog varies qualitatively and quantitatively depending on the source but it ultimately leads to similar ecological and operational problems therefore proper fog management in wastewater is necessary to prevent environmental pollution 4 lipid removal techniques lipid removal from wastewater is a very crucial step and it is a major challenge for effective wastewater treatment many techniques are being tested to emulsify or remove fog from wastewater before the treatment process major lipid removal approaches are discussed below 4 1 chemical and mechanical techniques different mechanical methods are conventionally employed to remove lipids in primary wastewater treatment skimming tank and oil grease trap are widely installed at wastewater treatment plants to remove fog grease trap is based on gravity separation due to the density difference between oil and water it helps remove free oil having droplet size of 150 μm by aggregating the lighter lipids particles at the top surface of water skimming tank involves skimming off the oily layer these conventional methods have several limitations like low efficiency higher operational and maintenance cost besides they are not effective in removing emulsified lipids 15 some alternative methods like floatation and hydro cyclone are also reported to separate lipids from wastewater flotation method was earlier used in mineral and metal separation but has now found environmental applications this method is useful in removal of emulsified lipids in dissolved air flotation daf fine air bubbles are pumped into the wastewater which promote the aggregation and subsequent removal of lipids only 50 fog removal is achieved by traditional sedimentation method which is improved to 74 by daf 34 hydro cyclone forces liquid into a circular motion by injecting it tangentially against a circular configuration and collects the lighter lipids particles at the top however the method is cost and energy intensive chemical mediated treatment is useful to remove dispersed oil some widely used chemical methods are coagulation flocculation and precipitation these methods aid in aggregating suspended and colloidal oil droplets into larger particles and improve the performance of mechanical lipid removal techniques due to the high porosity and or large surface area of various sorbent materials lipids are adsorbed and can be easily removed 33 about 71 fog removal is reported by using chemical coagulants 34 these chemical methods for lipid removal suffer from issues like low efficiency higher operational cost and generation of secondary environmental pollution abd el gawad 15 reported that natural material like zeolite is better organic pollutant removal under optimal conditions which shown 99 fog removal by increasing contact period with the adsorbent apart from these conventional methods some advanced techniques like chemical oxidation electrochemical methods 35 and electrocoagulation techniques are also available 36 ozone oxidation and fenton oxidation can remove the cooking oil from water 37 38 the major mechanical and chemical lipid removal techniques are summarized in table 1a however these methods are expensive and use hazardous reagents finally the lipid waste collected from mechanical and chemical treatment methods is either incinerated or dumped in landfills which creates environmental pollution 31 these issues warrant investigation into ecofriendly and sustainable methods for lipid rich wastewater treatment 4 2 biological techniques the attention has been shifted towards eco friendly and cost effective techniques to overcome the issues posed by chemical and mechanical methods different methods have been studied for the biodegradation of lipids in wastewater treatment processes for natural bioremediation it is essential to maintain the necessary nutrient load in the wastewater treatment plant 39 several researchers further advised adding pre cultured microbes for the sustained growth of biological agents which play an essential role in pollutant removal microbes have the ability to secrete extracellular lipases which effectively degrade the lipids and are ecofriendly and cost effective over the physico chemical methods it may be noted that microbes and enzymes are susceptible to variable environmental and physico chemical conditions temperature ph presence of organic solvents metals salts in wastewater etc hence their pollutant removal efficiency depends on the wastewater composition and prevailing conditions industrial effluents are often complex compositions with different types of organics inorganics and many recalcitrant components therefore effective treatment of lipid rich wastewater is majorly dependent on the nature of lipase enzyme ideal lipase should tolerate such complex conditions such as different temperature 5 60 c ph 5 9 and presence of solvents for efficient lipid removal jaganmai and jinka 30 highlighted various lipase producing microbes for different applications pseudomonas sp was reported to remove lipids from wastewater at alkaline ph and varied temperature range the potential biological lipid removal techniques can be broadly categorized into 3 groups which are discussed below and summarized in table 1b 4 2 1 whole cell biocatalysis microbes generally secrete lipase extracellularly in the growth medium such microorganisms can be directly used for wastewater treatment the microbes can utilize the complex organic load present in wastewater for their growth however survival in wastewater conditions inoculum size and other parameters must be standardized before actual field application several studies have reported isolation of lipase producers from lipid rich wastewater which presents a suitable niche for promising lipolytic microbes bacterial consortium of pseudomonas aeruginosa lp602 bacillus sp b304 and acinetobacter calcoaceticus lp009 was formulated at a lab scale to treat lipid rich wastewater 40 tsuji et al 41 reported mrakia blollopis for treatment of milk fat containing wastewater in cold region in another study yarrowia lipolytica was used for oily wastewater treatment because it could thrive for long time in the conventional activated sludge process however the lipase production was slow and not effective for lipid degradation to overcome this difficulty song et al 42 over expressed the lipase liprs from the fungus rhizopus stolonifer on the cell surface of y lipolytica using the flocculation functional domain flo1p of saccharomyces cerevisiae as the protein anchor the characteristic of lipase from r stolonifer was fit for oily wastewater treatment while y lipolytica can stay alive in oily wastewater for a long time it resulted in an effective recombinant strain with higher activity which removed 96 9 of oil and 97 6 of cod in 72 h fungi are extensively reported for lipase production but their application in wastewater presents operational problems and hence they are not investigated extensively some lipase producing fungal species widely reported are rhizopus aspergillus beauveria botrytis cladosporium colletotrichum fusarium geotrichum penicillium rhizomucor and verticillium 4 2 2 application of crude lipase preparation purification of lipase is costly and hence the application of commercially available pure lipases is not feasible therefore use of lipase for wastewater treatment is limited to circumvent this problem crude or partially purified lipases preparations have been used by researchers for wastewater treatment mahdi et al 43 studied crude lipase production from aeromonas sp s1 using sal deoiled seed cake extract and its application in dairy wastewater treatment it gave 86 reduction of cod after 12 h and 75 reduction of fog after 96 h of treatment saraca and ugur 44 studied the hydrolysis of kitchen waste oil and edible oil using crude lipase obtained from acinetobacter haemolyticus ns02 30 partially purified lipase from aspergillus awamori which was isolated from seawater showed 92 lipid removal in simulated wastewater 45 many laboratory studies are available for the possibility of lipid rich wastewater treatment with crude lipases but the real world application is still lacking 4 2 3 immobilization of lipase lipid degradation in wastewater by whole cells or enzyme preparations suffers from limitations like low stability low activity wash out etc these issues can be overcome by immobilization of cells or lipases to increase their stability and reusability using cheap support materials the research interest is attracted towards the immobilization of lipases lipase immobilization can be achieved by physical adsorption encapsulation and confinement or chemical methods cross linking covalent binding choice of immobilization method depends on the interaction between enzyme and support for instance immobilization of y lipolytica lipase on octyl agarose and octadecyl sepabeads led to higher enzyme activity and greater stability 46 in another study pseudomonas sp lipase was covalently immobilized on porous polymethyl acrylamide cross linked with n n methylene bisacrylamide for wastewater treatment 47 dumore and mukhopadhyay 48 studied lipase immobilization on chitosan support for synthetic oily wastewater treatment which removed 48 fog and 47 cod kamini et al 49 reported 52 fog and 32 cod reduction in coconut oil mill effluent by immobilizing partially purified lipase from staphylococcus pasteuri com 4a on celite 5 properties of lipase enzyme lipase was first discovered by claude bernard in 1856 in pancreatic juice as an enzyme that hydrolyzed hydrophobic oil droplets and converted them into soluble forms it is triacylglycerol hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides to free fatty acids diacylglycerol monoacylglycerol and glycerol 19 21 28 32 65 some lipases have affinity for short chain fatty acids acetic butyric capric decanoic acid etc while others have preference for unsaturated fatty acids oleic linolenic acid etc many others are non specific and randomly split the fatty acids from triglycerides 66 thus the lipase activity depends on the chain length of the fatty acid location of fatty acid in the glycerol backbone and its degree of unsaturation besides hydrolytic reaction lipases can exhibit variety of catalytic activities such as interesterification esterification aminolysis acidolysis and alcoholysis which contribute to its application in a wide range of industries fig 2 19 67 in esterification lipases can synthesize esters from glycerol and long chain fatty acids in a non aqueous medium other reactions such as interesterification aminolysis acidolysis and alcoholysis involve transesterification process where an alkoxy group is exchanged between an ester and respective chemical agent 68 transesterification reaction is useful in biodiesel production lipases do not require a cofactor for their reactions which is an added advantage for biocatalysis 19 69 as per various reports lipases have a molecular weight in the range of 19 60 kda and are monomeric proteins they have high specificity catalytic efficiency 70 and wide scope in various industries and environmental management applications 6 sources of lipase enzyme lipase is a ubiquitous enzyme lipase can be produced from various natural sources like animals plants and microbes among the lipases reported in the literature 18 are derived from animals 11 from plants 3 from algae 21 from fungi 45 from bacteria and 2 are from other sources 71 lipases are classified based on the sources from which they are screened and their substrate range fig 3 among them microbial lipases are widely used due to their unique properties such as high stability in various physico chemical conditions selectivity substrate specificity easy production and isolation mostly microbial lipases are glycoproteins and they may be intracellular extracellular or membrane bound 68 a representative list of microbes reported for lipase production is given in table 2 an extracellular microbial lipase is freely released in the growth medium and is easy to extract hence extracellular lipases are widely studied as compared to intracellular lipases 72 74 lipolytic activity of lipase is dependent on the source of microorganism from which it is screened therefore a wide diversity of microbes in various environments like seawater alkaline lakes hot springs volcanic escapes extremely contaminated soil and frozen soil like antarctica are being explored for lipase production with desirable properties 41 75 6 1 bacterial lipase bacterial lipases are omnipresent enzymes that have the ability to use wide range of substrates many lipases have the ability to catalyze reactions at high temperature wide ph range and in the presence of solvents several lipase catalyzed reactions are enantioselective or regioselective while others are non specific 66 76 bacterial lipases can also work in heterogeneous media and exhibit interfacial activation which is useful in various industrial applications 77 78 these properties render bacterial lipases suitable for application in wastewater treatment lipase producing bacteria are widely distributed in the environment and are mostly non pathogenic and do not pose any harm to the environment or humans bacillus and pseudomonas are reported as prominent lipase producers in the literature thermo tolerant lipases are reported from thermophilic bacteria such as bacillus stearothermophilus and bacillus thermoleovorans 79 other potential lipase producing bacterial species such as acinetobacter calcoaceticus bacillus serratia pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus epidermidis thermobifida fusca burkholderia etc are also reported 66 bacterial lipase production can be improved by optimizing nitrogen and carbon sources temperature ph inorganic salts or other growth parameters recombinant lipase production or protein engineering can further enhance their efficiency in wastewater treatment as discussed in the section on advantages of microbial lipase in wastewater treatment 6 2 fungal lipase fungal lipases have been extensively studied and reported as early as the 1950s some well studied lipase producing fungi include aspergillus penicillium rhizopus oryzae kg 5 colletotrichum gloeosporioides mucor sp y lipolytica aspergillus niger mtcc 2594 pseudozyma hubeiensis hb85a and fusarium 26 66 like bacteria lipase producing fungal species are also isolated from lipid contaminated environment and are generally non hazardous several fungal lipases are reported for industrial uses but their application towards bioremediation of lipid rich wastewater is scanty it may be because filaments fungi create froth in the wastewater causing operational difficulties to overcome this issue a crude lipase obtained from various fungi can be used for ecofriendly treatment of lipids in wastewater 7 applications of lipase enzyme the circular economy and bio economy concepts have gained popularity in recent years not only to reduce the environmental impact of waste but also to promote the expansion and diversification of bio based markets the microbial lipase market was estimated to be usd 425 0 million in 2018 and it is predictable to reach usd 590 2 million by 2023 19 the market price of lipase is estimated to range between 23 9 and 207 usd 100 mg enzyme 68 different applications of lipase are summarized in fig 4 apart from the industrial applications lipases are helpful in wastewater treatment which is the primary focus of this review 7 1 application of lipase in wastewater treatment lipases are very effective for biofilm degradation sludge digestion improving sludge dewatering and fog digestion in the wastewater treatment plant 15 30 94 lipases are increasingly studied for the bioremediation process because of their advantages over chemically catalyzed processes the worldwide scenario on the utilization of lipase for various bioremediation processes is summarized in table 3 lipase is useful to overcome blockage problems posed by milk fats curdling in dairy wastewater the decrease in cod and bod in dairy waste is demonstrated to be due to the degradation of fats by lipase producing microbes tsuji et al 41 studied thermo tolerant and ph tolerant lipase from the antarctic yeast strain m blollopis sk4 the strain portrayed 1 25 fold higher bod removal rate and its lipase was stable in a wide temperature range 10 c to 65 c and ph range 4 10 it was recommended for dairy wastewater treatment to reduce milk fats lipase from aeribacillus pallidus showed thermostability 65 c ph stability ph 10 halo tolerance solvent stability 50 stability for 2 h and was recommended for oil removal from wastewater 95 rigo et al 29 worked on lipid containing wastewater from the meat processing industry they used 0 1 and 5 of commercial lipase for the treatment of 250 mg l and 5000 mg l fog containing wastewater which showed promising results in pre treatment process few researchers have suggested extraction of microbial lipases from lipid containing wastewater nabarlatz et al 96 studied the activity and recovery of lipase from wastewater sludge heater et al 75 reported that immobilization of lipase can improve its environmental applications efficiency and sustainability talbert et al 97 discussed application of immobilized lipase to convert food waste to valuable products integrated approach consisting of identifying and preventing oil spill sources separation from waste before treatment and lipid removal using lipase can result in effective lipid waste management 7 2 other applications of lipases enzyme apart from the applications of lipases in bioremediation and solving environmental issues microbial lipases are also widely used in the industrial processes such as biodiesel production 100 production of enzyme modified cheese emc 101 enzyme modified dairy ingredients 102 fatty acids 103 surfactants for the baking industries etc 19 30 priyanka et al 104 reported solvent ph 5 9 and temperature 40 c stable lipase from pseudomonas reineke for biodiesel production modi et al 105 also reported the possibility of converting vegetable oil into biodiesel using microbial lipases lipases play a very crucial role in food industries for various product formation such as flavour and fragrance long chain carboxylic acids and long chain alcohols are used to produce wax esters for personal care products in a lipase catalyzed reaction 106 thus microbial lipases are important for industries to produce dozens of products without using hazardous chemicals table 4 shows the role of microbial lipases in different industrial processes 7 3 indian scenario on research and application of lipase enzyme in india lipase production and optimization from different microbes have been studied by several researchers table 5 dhundale and hemke 116 isolated broad temperature range 40 to 90 c and halo tolerant nacl concentration 0 5 4 m lipases from haloalkaliphilic bacteria from water and sediment of lonar crater for various applications milk fat oil waste from restaurants and food processing factories can be cleaned by employing such lipases prasad and manjunath 117 studied bacterial lipases from oil mill domestic dumpsite and dairy and carried out comparative study for oily wastewater treatment bhavani et al 118 screened lipase stability from bacteria under various environmental conditions like temperature dharmsthiti and kuhasuntisuk 60 isolated and identified p aeruginosa lp602 from wastewater for kitchen wastewater treatment apart from this attention was given by few researchers to the cold adaptive lipase from the himalayan glacier kumar and thakur 112 reported lipase from a psychrotrophic bacterium from sikkim himalaya for detergent formulation pandey et al 119 reported cold adaptive lipase from cold desert and glacier for applications in biotechnological industries another cold adaptive lipase was produced optimized and characterized from microbacterium luteolum isolated from gangotri glacier 120 lipase purification characterization and immobilization methods are also described for industrial application by various indian researchers but the detailed field study on lipid rich wastewater treatment is still missing 8 advantages of lipase enzyme in wastewater treatment industries are focusing on lipid waste management due to the importance in environmental conservation due to the limitations of physico chemical methods like formation of hazardous by products high cost higher energy requirement etc preference is shifted towards biological wastewater treatment for lipids removal lipase is one of the effective enzymes for lipids removal from wastewater lipases consume low energy do not require harsh conditions or chemicals and have varied substrate specificity 18 several lipases have other desired characteristics such as stability in extreme condition and easy production lipases also do not require cofactor for their reactions which is an advantage for in vitro reactions 19 69 microbial lipase can also help in the production of different value added products from waste lipids 121 lipase is projected to be the best option for bioenergy production from food waste and wastewater due to its ability to tolerate a variety of solvents and temperatures further lipase is promising for anaerobic digestion of waste containing lipids which yields biogas in a significant amount now a day attention is given to the isolation of lipase producing strains from different environmental sources enzyme purification characterization and their applications in various industrial and environmental settings this is because lipases from different sources differ in their substrate range selectivity and tolerance to environmental parameters moreover recombinant lipase production and protein engineering can improve its yield and efficiency hence there is need to focus on recombinant dna technology for directed evolution of improved lipase biocatalysts mou et al 122 over expressed calb lipase from candida antarctica in y lipolytica as cell factory the strain showed higher lipase productivity in an in situ fibrous bed bioreactor isfbb developed using sugarcane bagasse as the immobilization support in another study zhang et al over expressed thermophilic bacillus thermocatenulatus lipase btl2 in escherichia coli bl21 de3 which showed excellent resistance to high temperature and organic solvents with enzyme activity of 35 54 u mg cells 123 another advantage of microbial lipolytic enzymes is their compatibility with support materials immobilization of lipase with the help of hydrophobic acyl chain glutaraldehyde ionic groups vinyl sulfone or glyoxyl groups has been successfully tested immobilization of lipase helps to improve lipase stability and prevent enzyme wash out 124 125 economic production of lipase is essential for its environmental application microbial lipase production is strongly influenced by culture medium composition the nitrogen and carbon sources in the media can be replaced by using cheap agro waste material for the low cost production of lipase optimization of growth and medium conditions can lead to enhanced lipase production the fermentation process i e solid substrate submerge fermentation or batch continuous process also affects lipase production depending on the lipase producing microbes many research reports have emphasized the application of agricultural waste for the production of some fine chemicals and enzymes 127 soybean meal 128 various oils 129 corn steep liquor 130 ice husk wheat bran lentil husk banana waste watermelon waste etc are reported for high lipase production in solid state fermentation 131 maria et al 132 developed sustainable bioprocess for lipase production from diutina rugosa using alternative culture media the authors studied and reported cheaper medium price per unit lipase production using agro industrial waste different cheap raw materials used for microbial lipases production are shown in table 6 due to the many advantages discussed above and the eco friendly nature lipases have great potential for environmental applications 38 9 limitations of lipase enzyme in wastewater treatment the utilization of lipases has certain limitations due to their high production costs some lipase mediated processes can also under perform due to issues like stability or inactivation under desired conditions 1 126 there is a lack of scientifically accepted lipase based technology for large scale lipid rich wastewater treatment microbial whole cell or lipase mediated treatments generally require specific range of environmental conditions like temperature ph nutrient availability carbon and nitrogen sources limiting their application under dynamic wastewater conditions moreover some factors such as high cod temperature ph color metal ions and solvents make it very difficult to treat industrial effluent 150 lipase enzymes are prone to inactivation or reduced activity in the complex condition of wastewater while application of whole cells may result in low survival or slow lipase production immobilization can improve stability and prevent wash out but its applicability in full scale wastewater treatment is poorly studied improvement of the natural lipid degrading capacity of microbes and their ready commercial availability are also necessary for their applicability most studies have reported microbial lipases especially from fungi for specific industrial applications while studies on lipase mediated treatment of wastewater are limited to laboratory scale the use of costly commercially available lipases is not cost effective for wastewater application as there is no value added production to meet the enzyme cost hence low cost microbial lipase production optimization and characterization are urgently needed for economical lipid rich waste treatment the environmental applications of enzymes can become economical when their environmental effects are taken into consideration it is evident that physico chemical wastewater treatment methods generally involve high energy and temperature chemicals with adverse ecological and health effects safety risk recalcitrant agents high water consumption and generation of secondary pollution the cost of these damages can offset the higher cost of enzymatic lipid removal methods boyce et al 151 assessed the suitability and economics of commercial protease and lipase products for cleaning in place application in the dairy industry by considering benefits of enzyme treatment like operation at lower temperature decreased energy and water consumption improved safety reduced waste generation and environmental impact they suggested that replacing caustic based cleaning procedures with enzymes would be economically viable 10 commercial lipases in the era of enzyme technology the concern is being given to lipolytic enzymes for environmental management and industrial applications purified and concentrated lipases are necessary for industrial applications which are mainly obtained from microbial sources through submerged or solid state fermentation lipolytic enzymes are commercially available in powder form or occasionally in microencapsulated form 152 microbial lipases have predominant importance in market more than 200 microbial enzymes are used commercially and 20 types are produced on an actual industrial scale 26 the market cost varies between 23 90 and 207 usd per 100 mg of lipase enzyme 68 castilho et al analysed the economy of lipase production by penicillium restrictum using solid substrate and submerged fermentation processes 153 for a production scale of 100 m3 year the submerged fermentation cost was 68 higher than the product selling price while solid substrate fermentation cost was 47 lower than the selling price the lower cost of fungal solid substrate fermentation was attributed to low capital investment and cheap agro waste raw material 153 hidayatullah et al 154 also assessed the economy of lipase production from aspergillus sp using solid substrate fermentation in terms of npv net present value irr internal rate of return payback period and the benefit cost ratio the results for 10 kg production scale showed npv of 8500 usd 54 20 of irr 1 95 years of payback period and 3 36 of benefit cost ratio lipases are very selective for their catalytic reactions and hence they are commercialized for a particular application some commercially available lipases for various industrial applications and their suppliers are listed in table 7 67 commercially available lipases are mostly used in the industrial process and very limited studies are reported for wastewater treatment due to their high cost thus production cost is a very important hurdle in environmental application of lipases there is a need to establish low cost lipase production techniques yielding high volumes of crude or partially purified enzyme preparations which are more suitable for environmental applications this endeavour will require screening of broad specificity and highly tolerant lipases optimization of cheap raw materials and low cost extraction techniques which can separate undesirable components from the enzyme extract 11 future scope several studies are available on screening of lipases from bacteria and fungi from various environmental sources for industrial application however a considerable research gap is observed in the screening and full scale application of lipases in wastewater treatment fig 5 outlines the major problems posed by lipids in wastewater and potential solutions fungal lipases are more extensively reported than bacterial lipases bacterial lipase production is rapid and easily scalable and hence must be investigated further lipid waste treatment strategy significantly depends on the types of lipid waste generated by industries further industrial effluent is a complex mixture of various chemicals and pollutants which may affect the lipase activity or the bacterial growth and lipase production ability proper characterization of lipid wastewater and normalization of physico chemical parameters before lipase treatment may help alleviate the inhibitory effects characterization of lipase for stability under large range of solvents detergents ph metal ions and temperature can also be targeted to select lipases suitable for specific wastewater type lipase activity and stability under different environmental conditions depends on the source of lipase producing microbes hence screening from microbes isolated from extreme environmental sources is needed for isolation and characterization of stable lipases while selecting suitable producers other desired characteristics such as fast growth rate biosafety concerns cheap nutrient requirement etc should also be considered besides such lipases should be scaled up and demonstrated at industrial level to determine the feasibility which has not happened so far rational use of lipases for lipid removal from wastewater remains largely unexplored purified lipase can be added to the lipid rich wastewater but purification costs may be high hence crude lipase or lipase producing whole cells can be used addition of enzyme cocktail or microbial consortia can provide functional redundancy and increased sustainability better understanding and designing of treatment process such as immobilization may improve stability and reusability of lipases thereby improving the process efficiency low cost and natural materials for immobilization of lipase need to be explored in more detail recombinant over expression of lipase with suitable expression vector can help to improve production environmental applicability of recombinant lipases or microbes must be explored under the prevailing regulations of genetically modified organisms extraction of valuable by products from lipid rich wastewater may attract the industries by improving economy this aspect should be kept in mind in further research in this field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13139,in this work feco ldh derived from mof was successfully prepared which showed excellent catalytic activity for pms activation and 2 4 d degradation in the presence of 0 1 g l feco 10 and 1 mm pms 2 4 d 10 mg l was completely removed within 15 min various reactive oxygen species ros were produced in the feco 10 pms catalytic process the quenching experiments of mil 101 and feco 10 showed that the dominant role in feco 10 pms system was the non radical effect caused by 1o2 using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a chemical probe we quantitatively evaluated the relative contribution of high valent iron species in the system which unfortunately were found to be absent the degradation pathway of 2 4 d was calculated by gc ms analysis and density functional theory dft quantitative structure activity relationship qasr analysis showed that 2 4 d was transformed into the corresponding low toxic intermediate within 3 0 min in addition the structurally stable feco 10 showed low levels of metal leaching and preferable 2 4 d degradation reusability therefore the feco 10 pms system may provide new insights into the development of ldh for efficient remediation of organic herbicides in the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords layered double hydroxides singlet oxygen high valent iron species dft calculations degradation pathway 1 introduction 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d is one of the most commonly used broad leaved herbicides and widely used all over the world however it has teratogenic and carcinogenic effects which has been recognized by international agency for research on cancer iarc 1 therefore the world health organization who recommends 30 μg l as the maximum allowable concentration of 2 4 d in drinking water 2 and due to its poor volatility and biodegradation 2 4 d is often detected in water bodies around the world 3 therefore it is necessary to find a safe and effective way to deal with the effects of 2 4 d in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops based on sulfate radical so 4 sr aops have been regarded as an effective technology for the treatment of organic pollutants in water 4 compared with traditional aops based on hydroxyl radical oh 5 sr aops show more efficient performance against stubborn organic pollutants due to their higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v wider ph range 2 9 longer half life 30 40 s and higher reaction selectivity 6 pms with asymmetric structure ho o so 3 have longer oo bonds loo 1 326 å which requires lower activation energy 7 generally transition metals thermal activation semiconductors 8 heterogeneous catalysts and electrochemistry are used to activate pms 9 transition metals have been proven to be excellent activators for pms activation 10 the transition metal ions especially co ii exhibit outstanding catalytic performance for the formation of so 4 11 unfortunately due to the inevitable aggregation and cobalt leaching of nanoparticles nps the catalytic activity of co based catalysts is suppressed and thus their application is limited therefore sustainable technologies are needed to either improve the catalytic performance of other transition metal based catalysts or reduce the cobalt content in heterogeneous catalysts to avoid secondary contamination by cobalt ions 12 14 layered double hydroxides ldhs are a kind of emerging multifunctional two dimensional inorganic layered nanomaterials which have been explored for many environmental applications such as adsorption 15 17 catalysis 18 photoelectric catalysts 19 21 synthesizing ldhs by traditional methods of coprecipitation ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis is uncontrollable and complicated and difficult to obtain heterogeneous catalysts 22 therefore a simple efficient and easy to operate method is needed to synthesize ldh with good performance recently metal organic frameworks mofs have shown great potential for gas separation storage adsorption chemical sensing and catalysis due to their great advantages high density coordination unsaturated metal sites in their skeletons 23 highly ordered structures large specific surface areas and adjustable structural characteristics by substituting the organic ligands in mof with oh the obtained double metal hydroxides can have large surface areas and high porosity which may be conducive to achieving excellent catalytic performance for example cao et al used zif 67 to synthesize alco ldh and studied their catalytic performance for the degradation of tetracycline by pms activation 24 to address the above issues in this study fe mil101 with octahedral morphology was selected as a template to synthesize feco ldh the morphology of feco ldh was adjusted by controlling the hydrolysis time to adjust the template etching and metal precipitation time and the degradation efficiency of the catalyst activated pms to degrade the herbicide was studied the morphology chemical composition and structural characteristics of feco ldh were analyzed through systematic characterization in addition the effects of different parameters such as the amount of catalyst pms concentration ph and inorganic anions on the removal of 2 4 d were carefully studied we found that compared with mil 101 the ldh formed by adding co promoted the generation of 1o2 based on the fukui function the vulnerable points were calculated and the possible degradation pathways of 2 4 d were proposed meanwhile the toxicity of 2 4 d and its products were evaluated the stability and metal dissolution of the catalyst were investigated this study aimed to provide a new approach for mof derived ldh as a heterogeneous catalyst to degrade organic pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials as for the chemicals used in the experiments please refer to text s1 in si 2 2 catalyst preparation mil 101 fe was prepared by a previously reported method with some modifications 25 briefly fecl3 10 mmol and h2bdc 5 mmol were dissolved in 60 ml dmf and stirred for 60 min then the mixture was put in a 100 ml autoclave and maintained at 110 c for 36 h afterwards the mixture was cooled down then the samples were centrifugally collected and washed with dmf and etoh the mil 101 fe was obtained by freeze drying overnight to obtain feco ldh composite 0 6 g cocl2 was dispersed in 40 ml of fe mil 0 3 g solution and stirred for 60 min the mixture was placed in an autoclave at 120 c for 2 h 5 h 10 h and 24 h then washed with ethanol until the supernatant was clear then the mixture was dried overnight in a 70 c oven to obtain the samples the prepared samples with the different hydrothermal times were labeled as feco 2 feco 5 feco 10 and feco 24 the samples used in the following experiments were all feco 10 2 3 experimental procedure 2 4 d solution with an initial concentration of 20 mg l was kept in a constant temperature water bath shaker sha b shanghai china at 180 rpm oscillation rate at room temperature 30 c the initial concentrations of pms and 2 4 d were 1 0 mm and 20 mg l respectively the reaction started when the catalyst was added to the mixed solution at the selected time intervals 0 3 6 9 15 20 25 min 1 ml sample was filtered through 0 22 μm nylon membrane and finally methanol meoh was added to stop the reaction 2 4 analytical methods and kinetic analysis the analytical methods can be seen in text s2 a pseudo first order equation was used to evaluate 2 4 d degradation process eq 1 1 ln c c 0 k obs t where c and c0 are the 2 4 d concentrations at time t and time 0 min and kobs is the observed rate constant min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the xrd spectra of feco ldh and fe mil101 prepared under different hydrothermal times were plotted in fig 1a with the increase of hydrothermal time the crystalline strength of fe and co increased significantly 9 1 753 10 4 1022 and 16 54 matched the purity of mil 101 fe well 26 the main characteristic peak observed at 44 2 corresponded to the 111 crystal plane of co particles jcpds no 15 0806 27 no obvious impurities were found in feco 10 indicating that the obtained material has high purity however the fe mof diffraction peak completely disappeared after 24 h hydrolysis time indicating that the fe mof structure was completely transformed due to the anion exchange process 22 fig s1 depicts the xrd pattern of the feco 10 sample after the reaction compared with before the reaction the peaks of fe and co were more obvious after used indicating that fe and co participated in the reaction here raman spectroscopy was used to further measure the carbon structure of the pyrolysis sample fig 1b shows that the characteristic peaks between 350 and 450 cm 1 belong to the coo tensile mode 28 the sharp peak of 672 cm 1 shown in the figure is assigned to the characteristic peak of cobalt nanoparticles the peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1589 cm 1 are related to disordered or defective carbon d bond and graphite carbon g bond respectively 29 the presence of g bond was found in feco 10 but the more obvious d bond was not observed the ftir spectrum of the catalyst is shown in fig 1c the characteristic absorption bands related to fe mil101 and functional groups with different hydrothermal times were observed except mil101 the structures of all catalysts showed similar spectral patterns and the results were consistent with previous reports 30 the peak found at 3438 cm 1 belongs to the tensile and flexural vibration modes of the oh group the peak at 1695 cm 1 was due to the co stretching vibration of the carboxyl group and feco 2 was transferred to 1700 cm 1 due to the short hydrothermal time the observed peaks at 1315 cm 1 1153 cm 1 and 877 cm 1 belong to cn bond co stretching vibration and ch bending vibration respectively in the low frequency region the characteristic peaks near 568 cm 1 and 475 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of feo and coo respectively 31 however the characteristic peak at 475 cm 1 was not observed in mil 101 fig 1d depicts a typical type iv n2 adsorption desorption isotherm 13 with a clear hysteresis loop in the range of about 0 3 1 0 p p0 the pore sizes of feco 10 mainly fall within 50 nm and some smaller pore sizes are between 5 and 8 nm which indicates the existence of mesoporous structure in these samples among the studied samples feco 10 had a bet surface area of 37 63 m2 g and a bjh pore volume of 0 071 cm3 g 1 the bjh curve inset in fig 1d further confirmed the mesoporous characteristics of the feco 10 sample the higher catalytic activity of feco 10 was attributed to the high surface area and pore volume the sem micrographs of the samples are shown in fig 2 a d the short hydrothermal time fig 2a and b failed to form regular shape as the hydrothermal time increased a relatively regular spindle structure with an average diameter of 200 500 nm was formed the fine particles on the particle surface were the loaded cobalt which could expose more active sites the eds diagram in fig 2e clearly shows that there were iron cobalt carbon and oxygen elements in these spindle structures with the contents of 5 1 0 8 67 5 and 26 6 respectively and they were regularly distributed in the catalyst which further verifies the successful incorporation of cobalt into the catalyst the microstructure of feco 10 was further studied by tem as depicted in fig 2f h the structure of the spindle could be clearly observed fig 2i shows that the lattice spacing of the catalyst was 0 205 nm indicating that the 111 lattice plane of co0 was very consistent with the xrd diffraction peak 27 which further confirms the experimental results the elemental composition of the prepared feco ldh was studied by xps analysis the presence of each element in the sample could be seen in the complete investigated spectrum the atomic percentages in feco 10 were fe 9 69 co 8 59 c 45 81 o 33 87 n 2 04 in the co 2p spectrum fig 3b the fitting peaks at 779 2 and 794 6 ev were related to co ii and the characteristic peaks at 782 1 and 796 8 ev were classified as co iii 802 8 and 785 8 ev satellite peaks indicating the presence of co ii ions in the sample 22 the results showed that co ions existed and matched well with xrd and tem in the xps spectrum of fe 2p fig 3c the two main peaks occupying 710 1 and 725 7 ev coincided with fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 and the satellite peak of fe cation was located at 718 ev three fitting peaks could be observed in the high resolution spectrum of o1s fig 3d the peak at 529 9 ev indicated the feo bond and the peak at 530 5 ev indicated that the oxygen in the hydroxyl group was bound to carbon 32 the combination of the oxygen in the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl group could be represented by the peak at 531 7 ev 33 the peaks at 284 6 and 285 3 ev fig 3e indicated graphitic carbon and sp 3 carbon atoms or carbon defects 34 respectively and the peak at 288 4 ev indicated double and single bonds to nitrogen fig 3f 35 36 the successful synthesis of feco ldh catalyst could be obtained from the above comprehensive characterization results 3 2 catalytic performance in fig 4a the performance of feco ldh catalyst on the degradation of 2 4 d caused by activated pms was examined and the adsorption effect of the sample was tested without the addition of pms due to the weak adsorption capacity of the catalyst surface only 17 8 of 2 4 d was removed within 25 min which indicates that the adsorption of the catalyst could be ignored however when only pms existed the removal effect was also poor and the removal rate was only 9 8 indicating that 2 4 d could hardly be degraded by pms itself at this temperature in contrast fe mof can remove 63 1 of 2 4 d within 20 min in the presence of pms however the removal rate did not increase significantly with the increase of time which was obviously not an ideal removal rate however in the feco ldh system with the increase of hydrothermal time a significant increase in the removal rate of 2 4 d could be observed especially in fig 4b and it could be seen more intuitively that the reaction rate constant kobs of feco 10 was calculated to be 0 426 min 1 which was 9 9 times higher than that of fe mof however when the hydrothermal time exceeded 10 h and reached 24 h the removal rate did not increase but decreased as shown in fig 2d too long hydrothermal time destroyed part of the material structure and the samples became columnar shape which may reduce the performance of activated pms fig 5a depicts the influence of catalyst dosage on 2 4 d degradation with the increase of catalyst from 2 to 16 mg l the degradation efficiency of 2 4 d was significantly improved and the reaction rate kobs value increased from 0 12 to 0 64 min 1 fig 5a inset as the total amount of catalyst increased the number of surface active sites increased which accelerated the activation of pms and generated more active radicals to degrade 2 4 d and resulted in a significant increase in the degradation rate fig 5b displays the effect of the initial ph value the ph value of the solution is an important factor that affects the effect of pms activation and removal of organic pollutants in the aop system based on pms 37 the ph of all experimental groups was set at 3 11 the highest kobs of 0 49 min 1 appeared at ph 5 and the lowest kobs of 0 12 min 1 at ph 11 the target pollutant was almost 100 removed within 15 min in the range of ph 3 9 indicating that feco 10 could effectively degrade 2 4 d at a wide ph range because hso 5 was the dominant form of pms at ph 3 9 pk a1 0 and pk a2 9 4 it could be converted to so 4 oh or other ros 38 a satisfactory removal rate of 82 6 could still be obtained at a higher initial ph ph 11 because when the solution ph reached 10 5 pms behaved as so 5 2 species and its catalytic activity was weaker than that of hso 5 which resulted in a reduced removal rate of 2 4 d 39 fig 5c shows the degradation results of 2 4 d at different pms doses in 15 min nearly 97 5 of 2 4 d was degraded by 0 5 mm pms with the increase of pms concentration the time of completely degrading 2 4 d was shortened and the reaction kinetics of 2 4 d fig 5c insert degradation followed the similar trend when the concentration of pms was 5 mm the kinetic constant reached the highest value of 1 14 min 1 which was approximately 5 times that of the pms concentration of 0 5 g l in addition increasing the dose of pms can promote the interaction between the catalyst and pms to degrade pollutants accordingly the total amount of pms in the system was the key factor of radical formation fig 5d shows the degradation results of 2 4 d at different temperatures the degradation rate of 2 4 d increased sharply with the increase of temperature the apparent reaction rate constant clearly shows that kobs increased from 0 19 to 0 65 in the same way as temperature did the thermal activation of pms was related to the destruction of oo bonds the oo bond energy was estimated to be in the range of 140 213 3 kj mol as the temperature of the water system increases with the increase of room temperature pms begins to decompose and accelerate the generation of so 4 oh as shown in eq 2 notably these results further suggest that feco 10 was an outstanding candidate for efficient degradation of 2 4 d by activating pms at ambient temperatures 2 hs o 5 δ s o 4 o h some anions exist cl hco 3 no 3 etc naturally in water which also play an important role in the activation of pms 40 they would compete with the target pollutants for crucial radicals and form other radicals with weaker oxidizing power which resulted in a decline in the degradation of pollutants 6 figs 6 and s2 present the effects of several anions on the 2 4 d degradation in the feco 10 pms system when the cl concentration was increased from 1 mm to 5 mm the removal rate remained at about 25 when the concentration of cl was further increased to 10 mm the removal efficiency was reduced to 22 9 possibly due to the fact that chloride ions are equation based free radical scavengers eqs 3 6 41 cl was produced by the reaction of so 4 and cl and the oxidation potential of cl was lower than that of so 4 in fact cl competed with organic compounds to react with sulfate therefore in the presence of chloride the degradation of 2 4 d was significantly reduced 42 3 s o 4 c l s o 4 2 c l 4 c l c l c l 2 5 c l 2 c l 2 2 c l c l 2 6 c l c l c l 2 chloride ions could directly react with pms to generate sulfate ions eqs 7 8 in fact pms decomposition occurred in the non free radical pathway and a reduction in 2 4 d degradation was observed 43 7 c l hs o 5 s o 4 2 hocl 8 2 c l hs o 5 h s o 4 2 c l 2 h 2 o in fig s2b with the increase of hco 3 an obvious suppression effect of 2 4 d was observed when hco 3 was 1 0 mm the removal rate of 2 4 d was 59 6 in 15 min when hco 3 was 10 0 mm the removal rate was reduced to 35 2 hco 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the removal of 2 4 d during pms activation which coincides with he s report 44 in the reaction hco 3 and oh or so 4 formed radicals with less oxidizing power according to eqs 9 11 although the reaction rate of hco 3 co 3 with phenol and other electron rich molecules was still relatively high the rate constant of the reaction with so 4 and oh was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower furthermore the reaction of hco 3 with 1o2 showed the inhibition of hco 3 eq 12 which was also reported in hong s report 6 9 o h hc o 3 h c o 3 o h 10 s o 4 hc o 3 s o 4 2 hc o 3 11 hc o 3 h c o 3 12 o 1 2 hc o 3 o h c o 3 even in the presence of 10 mm nitrate ion the degradation efficiency of 2 4 d was only slightly reduced fig s2c because nitrate ions rarely react with free radicals in addition the performance of the feco 10 pms system with the increase in the amount of ha as a typical organic matter was also evaluated 45 ha has complex composition and multiple functional groups and its performance as a typical organic compound in feco 10 pms system was evaluated in this study 37 as depicted in fig s2d 2 4 d removal rate declined with the increase in ha concentration for example the removal rate was slightly reduced to 90 in the presence of 1 mg ha but the removal rate was only 25 3 when ha was 10 mg l 32 this effect may be related to the scavenging ability of ha by competing with the target compound for so 4 and oh in addition the functional groups phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl on ha might adhere to the catalyst surface which results in the reduction of active sites 3 3 identification of active species to further confirm the superiority of ros generated in the feco 10 pms system radical scavenging experiments were carried out during the entire 2 4 d oxidation process because of its high reaction rate methanol k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 k so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and tert butanol koh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 k so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 were used to calculate the contribution of oh and so 4 in the system p benzoquinone pbq and furfuryl alcohol were used to quench o 2 9 0 108 m 1s 1 and 1o2 1 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively in the system in the multi phase advanced oxidation process potassium iodide ki was used to quench the surface bound oh and so 4 46 in the presence of meoh the degradation of 2 4 d was greatly inhibited in fig 7a and the removal rate was only 20 indicating that radicals such as oh and or so 4 played an important role in the oxidation process with the addition of tba the degradation rate decreased slightly which indicates that the contribution of oh to the reaction was limited the addition of pbq slightly reduced the degradation rate of 2 4 d by 83 indicating that o 2 played a part in degrading 2 4 d however in the presence of ffa the degradation of 2 4 d was greatly inhibited fig 7b indicating that 1o2 played an important role in the oxidation reaction 47 fig 7c further shows that the presence of ffa alone would lead to degradation of 2 4 d which confirmed that the degradation of 2 4 d was caused by 1o2 inhibited by ffa in addition with the introduction of ki the degradation rate of 2 4 d was only 11 indicating that radicals were generated on the surface binding layer of feco 10 and participated in degrading 2 4 d according to eqs 13 16 the contribution rates were 1o2 96 o 2 77 oh 57 and so 4 40 respectively the results of xps and quenching experiments show that pms molecules were more easily adsorbed on the positively charged c nucleus connected to the c atom at the con site in oco the o atoms in oco and the n atoms in co nx acted as electron acceptors in depleting the adsorbed pms to release 1o2 in addition co and graphite n tended to activate pms to generate 1o2 these defects could enhance the adsorption of pms molecules on the surface of the catalyst and contribute to the formation of 1o2 13 r o h k o h k app k app k tba k app 14 r s o 4 k s o 4 k app k tba

rate constant in feco 10 pms system ktba kmeoh kffa and kpbq are the apparent degradation rate constants of tba meoh pba and ffa respectively we also compared the mil 101 pms system with the feco 10 pms system the former is a radical oxidation system that plays a major role through so 4 radicals as depicted in fig 8 the degradation rate of 2 4 d was only 17 when meoh was added moreover the addition of tba ffa and pbq slightly affected the removal of 2 4 d the contribution rates of ros were 1o2 9 o 2 8 oh 11 and so 4 70 in contrast the feco 10 pms system showed rapid degradation of 2 4 d the obvious degradation of feco 10 pms system indicates that the non radical oxidation process was enhanced the radicals generated in the feco 10 pms system were further evaluated by the epr spin trap technique and the results are presented in fig 9 dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent for oh so 4 and o 2 and temp was used as a trapping agent for 1o2 all signals were detected indicating that both free radical and non radical pathways contributed to the 2 4 d degradation process however no signal peak was observed when pms was added alone the esr results show that all so 4 oh o 2 and 1o2 were produced in the feco 10 pms system peng et al found that the reactive species fe could be produced in the persulfate reaction 48 they added citrate to the system and verified the contribution of high valent iron oxides to the degradation of tc as shown in fig 7d the addition of citrate inhibited the degradation of 2 4 d by about 20 which aroused our interest it has been reported that pmso readily reacts with fe to form pmso2 49 therefore the formation of fe in feco 10 pms system was investigated by detecting changes in concentrating pmso and pmso2 in the fig 7d the concentration of pmso decreased by 40 after 20 min however no pmso2 formation was observed and the consumption of pmso may be due to the degradation of pmso caused by ros produced in the system as demonstrated by wang et al 50 these results indicate that in the degradation process of 2 4 d all active substances of 1o2 oh so 4 and o 2 were involved compared with mil 101 the successful preparation of feco ldh enhanced the production of 1o2 and promoted the degradation of 2 4 d by 1o2 among these active substances 1o2 and the radicals generated on the surface of the catalyst contributed the most to the reaction while high valent iron did not play a role in the system based on the above analysis the mechanism of enhancing catalytic performance of feco 10 on pms activation was proposed as shown in fig 10 the initial metal ions co 2 and fe 2 on the surface could catalyze hso 5 to generate so 4 and oxidize to co 3 and fe 3 after that co 3 and fe 3 oxidized hso 5 and returned to the initial valence state eqs 17 18 51 at the same time so 4 could further react with h2o to form oh the main reaction equations generated by other free radicals were eqs 19 24 52 17 c o 2 f e 2 hs o 5 s o 4 o h c o 3 f e 3 18 c o

products c o 2 h 2 o 3 4 possible degradation pathway and toxicity assessment the hplc ms was employed to identify the degradation intermediates of 2 4 d in feco 10 pms system the results of eis spectroscopy figs s3 4 and the fukui index based on the density functional theory dft were used to analyze the reaction sites of organic molecules in the feco 10 pms system the combination of the two methods proposed the possible degradation pathway of 2 4 d in this study the main active substances were 1o2 so 4 o 2 and oh and the fukui index f f and f0 distributions were calculated using natural population analysis npa charges fig 11a shows the 2 4 d molecular structure after the gaussian software geometry optimization fig 11b d show the homo lumo orbital and 2 4 d molecular surface electrostatic potential distribution respectively molecular orbital distribution could reflect the reactivity of molecules and the homo orbits indicate areas that were prone to losing electrons for electrophilic attacks 53 it could be seen from the fig 11b that for 2 4 d the homo orbitals mainly distributed near the benzene ring where the atoms associated with cl and oh were more reactive 7 the distribution of molecular surface charges affected would affect the distribution of molecular orbitals the blue part in fig 11d represents the area where the global maximum appeared which represents the positive charge the red part represents the area where the global minimum appeared which represents the negative charge the fig 11d shows that o17 and o19 connected to c16 mainly occupied the most negatively charged area and the maximum point of the molecule concentrated around o12 indicating its high electrophilic activity c6 f f0 0 21 0 14 c3 f f0 0 12 0 12 o12 f f0 0 43 0 08 cl10 f f0 0 16 0 10 and cl11 f f0 0 10 0 08 showed high fukui index table s1 which might be attacked by ros fig 11e shows the degradation pathway of 2 4 d the degradation pathways mainly include hydroxylation dechlorination and ring cleavage specifically in the 2 4 d degradation process the hydroxylation process occurred first 54 when so 4 and oh attacked the o12 atom 2 4 d were converted into 24 dcp by hydroxylation and the subsequent 1 4 cycloaddition triggered by 1o2 attacked c1 which caused 2 4 d oxidation 55 namely f and then led to the formation of phenolic intermediates 56 afterwards hq reacted with oxygen radicals to form benzoquinone bq in addition products with smaller molecules such as a passed the ring opening step when attacked by so 4 once the benzene ring was opened the further degradation of these intermediate products became easier which also brought the intuitive reduction of toc see fig s5 57 it is worth noting that during the formation of chq chlorine radicals were generated which could be further oxidized to produce chloride ions glycolic acid and other small molecules can be converted into simpler alcohols and aldehydes through dehydrogenation and hydroxylation and eventually mineralized into co2 and h2o to verify the green safety of the feco 10 pms system during the decomposition process of 2 4 d the toxicity estimation software t e s t was used to explore the acute toxicity of 2 4 d and its degradation intermediates based on the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction daphnia magna lc 50 and oral rat ld 50 58 the ld50 fig 12a of 2 4 d was 424 07 mg l which could be classified as very toxic almost all degradation intermediates showed ld50 higher than 2 4 d indicating that feco 10 pms degradation of 2 4 d reduced the oral toxicity of rats the acute toxicity of daphnia magna lc50 fig 12b was 36 43 mg l which could be classified as harmful except a few intermediates which were classified as toxic most of them were harmful or harmless 59 in conclusion these results indicate that feco 10 pms system could not only completely remove 2 4 d but also reduce the toxicity of 2 4 d the reusability of the catalyst was very important in practical applications five cycles were performed to test the stability of the feco 10 pms system for 2 4 d degradation as displayed in fig 13 the degradation rate of 2 4 d remained above 99 8 in five consecutive runs the small decrease in catalytic activity less than 1 after 5 cycles might be due to the coverage of surface organic matter and active sites mineralization and dechlorination rates were also tested in fig s5a the incomplete mineralization of 2 4 d 69 7 might be related to the difficulty in completely removing the residual intermediates and these intermediates needed to be further oxidized another important factor affecting the long term stability and safety of heterogeneous catalysts is metal leaching 37 during the oxidation process the leaching of the cobalt ion concentration was monitored by icp oes in fig s5b the leaching of cobalt ion increased slowly and the concentration within 15 min was only 35 μg l far below the national standard to further investigate the 2 4 d decomposition mechanism fe species extracted from the feco 10 pms system were also measured fig s5b after 15 min the concentrations of total fe fe2 and fe3 were 2 42 1 89 and 0 49 mg l respectively indicating that more fe2 was used in decomposing pms to produce more 2 4 d degraded so 4 which explains why the excellent performance was achieved in the feco 10 pms system 60 the above results confirm that the system had a high efficiency in processing 2 4 d and the stabilizing effect shown after cycling catalysis highlighted its excellent structural stability 4 conclusion in summary the stable structure spindle feco ldh catalyst was successfully synthesized and characterized by xrd ft ir sem tem bet and xps techniques the removal efficiency of feco ldh pms system toward 2 4 d degradation can reach up to 100 within 12 min and the degradation rate constants of feco ldh pms system was about 9 9 times higher than mil 101 pms system 1o2 so 4 and oh were simultaneously generated during the pms activation and 1o2 played a pivotal role with 96 contribution rate in the oxidation of 2 4 d according to the quenching reactions and esr study more importantly the 2 4 d intermediates during the degradation process were confirmed by gc ms and dft calculations and the degradation pathway mainly included hydroxylation dechlorination and ring cleavage process the toxicity of 2 4 d and degradation intermediates were assessed as well showing that sr aop caused the decreased toxicity the findings of this study provide information about the

13139,in this work feco ldh derived from mof was successfully prepared which showed excellent catalytic activity for pms activation and 2 4 d degradation in the presence of 0 1 g l feco 10 and 1 mm pms 2 4 d 10 mg l was completely removed within 15 min various reactive oxygen species ros were produced in the feco 10 pms catalytic process the quenching experiments of mil 101 and feco 10 showed that the dominant role in feco 10 pms system was the non radical effect caused by 1o2 using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a chemical probe we quantitatively evaluated the relative contribution of high valent iron species in the system which unfortunately were found to be absent the degradation pathway of 2 4 d was calculated by gc ms analysis and density functional theory dft quantitative structure activity relationship qasr analysis showed that 2 4 d was transformed into the corresponding low toxic intermediate within 3 0 min in addition the structurally stable feco 10 showed low levels of metal leaching and preferable 2 4 d degradation reusability therefore the feco 10 pms system may provide new insights into the development of ldh for efficient remediation of organic herbicides in the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords layered double hydroxides singlet oxygen high valent iron species dft calculations degradation pathway 1 introduction 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d is one of the most commonly used broad leaved herbicides and widely used all over the world however it has teratogenic and carcinogenic effects which has been recognized by international agency for research on cancer iarc 1 therefore the world health organization who recommends 30 μg l as the maximum allowable concentration of 2 4 d in drinking water 2 and due to its poor volatility and biodegradation 2 4 d is often detected in water bodies around the world 3 therefore it is necessary to find a safe and effective way to deal with the effects of 2 4 d in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops based on sulfate radical so 4 sr aops have been regarded as an effective technology for the treatment of organic pollutants in water 4 compared with traditional aops based on hydroxyl radical oh 5 sr aops show more efficient performance against stubborn organic pollutants due to their higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v wider ph range 2 9 longer half life 30 40 s and higher reaction selectivity 6 pms with asymmetric structure ho o so 3 have longer oo bonds loo 1 326 å which requires lower activation energy 7 generally transition metals thermal activation semiconductors 8 heterogeneous catalysts and electrochemistry are used to activate pms 9 transition metals have been proven to be excellent activators for pms activation 10 the transition metal ions especially co ii exhibit outstanding catalytic performance for the formation of so 4 11 unfortunately due to the inevitable aggregation and cobalt leaching of nanoparticles nps the catalytic activity of co based catalysts is suppressed and thus their application is limited therefore sustainable technologies are needed to either improve the catalytic performance of other transition metal based catalysts or reduce the cobalt content in heterogeneous catalysts to avoid secondary contamination by cobalt ions 12 14 layered double hydroxides ldhs are a kind of emerging multifunctional two dimensional inorganic layered nanomaterials which have been explored for many environmental applications such as adsorption 15 17 catalysis 18 photoelectric catalysts 19 21 synthesizing ldhs by traditional methods of coprecipitation ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis is uncontrollable and complicated and difficult to obtain heterogeneous catalysts 22 therefore a simple efficient and easy to operate method is needed to synthesize ldh with good performance recently metal organic frameworks mofs have shown great potential for gas separation storage adsorption chemical sensing and catalysis due to their great advantages high density coordination unsaturated metal sites in their skeletons 23 highly ordered structures large specific surface areas and adjustable structural characteristics by substituting the organic ligands in mof with oh the obtained double metal hydroxides can have large surface areas and high porosity which may be conducive to achieving excellent catalytic performance for example cao et al used zif 67 to synthesize alco ldh and studied their catalytic performance for the degradation of tetracycline by pms activation 24 to address the above issues in this study fe mil101 with octahedral morphology was selected as a template to synthesize feco ldh the morphology of feco ldh was adjusted by controlling the hydrolysis time to adjust the template etching and metal precipitation time and the degradation efficiency of the catalyst activated pms to degrade the herbicide was studied the morphology chemical composition and structural characteristics of feco ldh were analyzed through systematic characterization in addition the effects of different parameters such as the amount of catalyst pms concentration ph and inorganic anions on the removal of 2 4 d were carefully studied we found that compared with mil 101 the ldh formed by adding co promoted the generation of 1o2 based on the fukui function the vulnerable points were calculated and the possible degradation pathways of 2 4 d were proposed meanwhile the toxicity of 2 4 d and its products were evaluated the stability and metal dissolution of the catalyst were investigated this study aimed to provide a new approach for mof derived ldh as a heterogeneous catalyst to degrade organic pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials as for the chemicals used in the experiments please refer to text s1 in si 2 2 catalyst preparation mil 101 fe was prepared by a previously reported method with some modifications 25 briefly fecl3 10 mmol and h2bdc 5 mmol were dissolved in 60 ml dmf and stirred for 60 min then the mixture was put in a 100 ml autoclave and maintained at 110 c for 36 h afterwards the mixture was cooled down then the samples were centrifugally collected and washed with dmf and etoh the mil 101 fe was obtained by freeze drying overnight to obtain feco ldh composite 0 6 g cocl2 was dispersed in 40 ml of fe mil 0 3 g solution and stirred for 60 min the mixture was placed in an autoclave at 120 c for 2 h 5 h 10 h and 24 h then washed with ethanol until the supernatant was clear then the mixture was dried overnight in a 70 c oven to obtain the samples the prepared samples with the different hydrothermal times were labeled as feco 2 feco 5 feco 10 and feco 24 the samples used in the following experiments were all feco 10 2 3 experimental procedure 2 4 d solution with an initial concentration of 20 mg l was kept in a constant temperature water bath shaker sha b shanghai china at 180 rpm oscillation rate at room temperature 30 c the initial concentrations of pms and 2 4 d were 1 0 mm and 20 mg l respectively the reaction started when the catalyst was added to the mixed solution at the selected time intervals 0 3 6 9 15 20 25 min 1 ml sample was filtered through 0 22 μm nylon membrane and finally methanol meoh was added to stop the reaction 2 4 analytical methods and kinetic analysis the analytical methods can be seen in text s2 a pseudo first order equation was used to evaluate 2 4 d degradation process eq 1 1 ln c c 0 k obs t where c and c0 are the 2 4 d concentrations at time t and time 0 min and kobs is the observed rate constant min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the xrd spectra of feco ldh and fe mil101 prepared under different hydrothermal times were plotted in fig 1a with the increase of hydrothermal time the crystalline strength of fe and co increased significantly 9 1 753 10 4 1022 and 16 54 matched the purity of mil 101 fe well 26 the main characteristic peak observed at 44 2 corresponded to the 111 crystal plane of co particles jcpds no 15 0806 27 no obvious impurities were found in feco 10 indicating that the obtained material has high purity however the fe mof diffraction peak completely disappeared after 24 h hydrolysis time indicating that the fe mof structure was completely transformed due to the anion exchange process 22 fig s1 depicts the xrd pattern of the feco 10 sample after the reaction compared with before the reaction the peaks of fe and co were more obvious after used indicating that fe and co participated in the reaction here raman spectroscopy was used to further measure the carbon structure of the pyrolysis sample fig 1b shows that the characteristic peaks between 350 and 450 cm 1 belong to the coo tensile mode 28 the sharp peak of 672 cm 1 shown in the figure is assigned to the characteristic peak of cobalt nanoparticles the peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1589 cm 1 are related to disordered or defective carbon d bond and graphite carbon g bond respectively 29 the presence of g bond was found in feco 10 but the more obvious d bond was not observed the ftir spectrum of the catalyst is shown in fig 1c the characteristic absorption bands related to fe mil101 and functional groups with different hydrothermal times were observed except mil101 the structures of all catalysts showed similar spectral patterns and the results were consistent with previous reports 30 the peak found at 3438 cm 1 belongs to the tensile and flexural vibration modes of the oh group the peak at 1695 cm 1 was due to the co stretching vibration of the carboxyl group and feco 2 was transferred to 1700 cm 1 due to the short hydrothermal time the observed peaks at 1315 cm 1 1153 cm 1 and 877 cm 1 belong to cn bond co stretching vibration and ch bending vibration respectively in the low frequency region the characteristic peaks near 568 cm 1 and 475 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of feo and coo respectively 31 however the characteristic peak at 475 cm 1 was not observed in mil 101 fig 1d depicts a typical type iv n2 adsorption desorption isotherm 13 with a clear hysteresis loop in the range of about 0 3 1 0 p p0 the pore sizes of feco 10 mainly fall within 50 nm and some smaller pore sizes are between 5 and 8 nm which indicates the existence of mesoporous structure in these samples among the studied samples feco 10 had a bet surface area of 37 63 m2 g and a bjh pore volume of 0 071 cm3 g 1 the bjh curve inset in fig 1d further confirmed the mesoporous characteristics of the feco 10 sample the higher catalytic activity of feco 10 was attributed to the high surface area and pore volume the sem micrographs of the samples are shown in fig 2 a d the short hydrothermal time fig 2a and b failed to form regular shape as the hydrothermal time increased a relatively regular spindle structure with an average diameter of 200 500 nm was formed the fine particles on the particle surface were the loaded cobalt which could expose more active sites the eds diagram in fig 2e clearly shows that there were iron cobalt carbon and oxygen elements in these spindle structures with the contents of 5 1 0 8 67 5 and 26 6 respectively and they were regularly distributed in the catalyst which further verifies the successful incorporation of cobalt into the catalyst the microstructure of feco 10 was further studied by tem as depicted in fig 2f h the structure of the spindle could be clearly observed fig 2i shows that the lattice spacing of the catalyst was 0 205 nm indicating that the 111 lattice plane of co0 was very consistent with the xrd diffraction peak 27 which further confirms the experimental results the elemental composition of the prepared feco ldh was studied by xps analysis the presence of each element in the sample could be seen in the complete investigated spectrum the atomic percentages in feco 10 were fe 9 69 co 8 59 c 45 81 o 33 87 n 2 04 in the co 2p spectrum fig 3b the fitting peaks at 779 2 and 794 6 ev were related to co ii and the characteristic peaks at 782 1 and 796 8 ev were classified as co iii 802 8 and 785 8 ev satellite peaks indicating the presence of co ii ions in the sample 22 the results showed that co ions existed and matched well with xrd and tem in the xps spectrum of fe 2p fig 3c the two main peaks occupying 710 1 and 725 7 ev coincided with fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 and the satellite peak of fe cation was located at 718 ev three fitting peaks could be observed in the high resolution spectrum of o1s fig 3d the peak at 529 9 ev indicated the feo bond and the peak at 530 5 ev indicated that the oxygen in the hydroxyl group was bound to carbon 32 the combination of the oxygen in the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl group could be represented by the peak at 531 7 ev 33 the peaks at 284 6 and 285 3 ev fig 3e indicated graphitic carbon and sp 3 carbon atoms or carbon defects 34 respectively and the peak at 288 4 ev indicated double and single bonds to nitrogen fig 3f 35 36 the successful synthesis of feco ldh catalyst could be obtained from the above comprehensive characterization results 3 2 catalytic performance in fig 4a the performance of feco ldh catalyst on the degradation of 2 4 d caused by activated pms was examined and the adsorption effect of the sample was tested without the addition of pms due to the weak adsorption capacity of the catalyst surface only 17 8 of 2 4 d was removed within 25 min which indicates that the adsorption of the catalyst could be ignored however when only pms existed the removal effect was also poor and the removal rate was only 9 8 indicating that 2 4 d could hardly be degraded by pms itself at this temperature in contrast fe mof can remove 63 1 of 2 4 d within 20 min in the presence of pms however the removal rate did not increase significantly with the increase of time which was obviously not an ideal removal rate however in the feco ldh system with the increase of hydrothermal time a significant increase in the removal rate of 2 4 d could be observed especially in fig 4b and it could be seen more intuitively that the reaction rate constant kobs of feco 10 was calculated to be 0 426 min 1 which was 9 9 times higher than that of fe mof however when the hydrothermal time exceeded 10 h and reached 24 h the removal rate did not increase but decreased as shown in fig 2d too long hydrothermal time destroyed part of the material structure and the samples became columnar shape which may reduce the performance of activated pms fig 5a depicts the influence of catalyst dosage on 2 4 d degradation with the increase of catalyst from 2 to 16 mg l the degradation efficiency of 2 4 d was significantly improved and the reaction rate kobs value increased from 0 12 to 0 64 min 1 fig 5a inset as the total amount of catalyst increased the number of surface active sites increased which accelerated the activation of pms and generated more active radicals to degrade 2 4 d and resulted in a significant increase in the degradation rate fig 5b displays the effect of the initial ph value the ph value of the solution is an important factor that affects the effect of pms activation and removal of organic pollutants in the aop system based on pms 37 the ph of all experimental groups was set at 3 11 the highest kobs of 0 49 min 1 appeared at ph 5 and the lowest kobs of 0 12 min 1 at ph 11 the target pollutant was almost 100 removed within 15 min in the range of ph 3 9 indicating that feco 10 could effectively degrade 2 4 d at a wide ph range because hso 5 was the dominant form of pms at ph 3 9 pk a1 0 and pk a2 9 4 it could be converted to so 4 oh or other ros 38 a satisfactory removal rate of 82 6 could still be obtained at a higher initial ph ph 11 because when the solution ph reached 10 5 pms behaved as so 5 2 species and its catalytic activity was weaker than that of hso 5 which resulted in a reduced removal rate of 2 4 d 39 fig 5c shows the degradation results of 2 4 d at different pms doses in 15 min nearly 97 5 of 2 4 d was degraded by 0 5 mm pms with the increase of pms concentration the time of completely degrading 2 4 d was shortened and the reaction kinetics of 2 4 d fig 5c insert degradation followed the similar trend when the concentration of pms was 5 mm the kinetic constant reached the highest value of 1 14 min 1 which was approximately 5 times that of the pms concentration of 0 5 g l in addition increasing the dose of pms can promote the interaction between the catalyst and pms to degrade pollutants accordingly the total amount of pms in the system was the key factor of radical formation fig 5d shows the degradation results of 2 4 d at different temperatures the degradation rate of 2 4 d increased sharply with the increase of temperature the apparent reaction rate constant clearly shows that kobs increased from 0 19 to 0 65 in the same way as temperature did the thermal activation of pms was related to the destruction of oo bonds the oo bond energy was estimated to be in the range of 140 213 3 kj mol as the temperature of the water system increases with the increase of room temperature pms begins to decompose and accelerate the generation of so 4 oh as shown in eq 2 notably these results further suggest that feco 10 was an outstanding candidate for efficient degradation of 2 4 d by activating pms at ambient temperatures 2 hs o 5 δ s o 4 o h some anions exist cl hco 3 no 3 etc naturally in water which also play an important role in the activation of pms 40 they would compete with the target pollutants for crucial radicals and form other radicals with weaker oxidizing power which resulted in a decline in the degradation of pollutants 6 figs 6 and s2 present the effects of several anions on the 2 4 d degradation in the feco 10 pms system when the cl concentration was increased from 1 mm to 5 mm the removal rate remained at about 25 when the concentration of cl was further increased to 10 mm the removal efficiency was reduced to 22 9 possibly due to the fact that chloride ions are equation based free radical scavengers eqs 3 6 41 cl was produced by the reaction of so 4 and cl and the oxidation potential of cl was lower than that of so 4 in fact cl competed with organic compounds to react with sulfate therefore in the presence of chloride the degradation of 2 4 d was significantly reduced 42 3 s o 4 c l s o 4 2 c l 4 c l c l c l 2 5 c l 2 c l 2 2 c l c l 2 6 c l c l c l 2 chloride ions could directly react with pms to generate sulfate ions eqs 7 8 in fact pms decomposition occurred in the non free radical pathway and a reduction in 2 4 d degradation was observed 43 7 c l hs o 5 s o 4 2 hocl 8 2 c l hs o 5 h s o 4 2 c l 2 h 2 o in fig s2b with the increase of hco 3 an obvious suppression effect of 2 4 d was observed when hco 3 was 1 0 mm the removal rate of 2 4 d was 59 6 in 15 min when hco 3 was 10 0 mm the removal rate was reduced to 35 2 hco 3 showed an inhibitory effect on the removal of 2 4 d during pms activation which coincides with he s report 44 in the reaction hco 3 and oh or so 4 formed radicals with less oxidizing power according to eqs 9 11 although the reaction rate of hco 3 co 3 with phenol and other electron rich molecules was still relatively high the rate constant of the reaction with so 4 and oh was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower furthermore the reaction of hco 3 with 1o2 showed the inhibition of hco 3 eq 12 which was also reported in hong s report 6 9 o h hc o 3 h c o 3 o h 10 s o 4 hc o 3 s o 4 2 hc o 3 11 hc o 3 h c o 3 12 o 1 2 hc o 3 o h c o 3 even in the presence of 10 mm nitrate ion the degradation efficiency of 2 4 d was only slightly reduced fig s2c because nitrate ions rarely react with free radicals in addition the performance of the feco 10 pms system with the increase in the amount of ha as a typical organic matter was also evaluated 45 ha has complex composition and multiple functional groups and its performance as a typical organic compound in feco 10 pms system was evaluated in this study 37 as depicted in fig s2d 2 4 d removal rate declined with the increase in ha concentration for example the removal rate was slightly reduced to 90 in the presence of 1 mg ha but the removal rate was only 25 3 when ha was 10 mg l 32 this effect may be related to the scavenging ability of ha by competing with the target compound for so 4 and oh in addition the functional groups phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl on ha might adhere to the catalyst surface which results in the reduction of active sites 3 3 identification of active species to further confirm the superiority of ros generated in the feco 10 pms system radical scavenging experiments were carried out during the entire 2 4 d oxidation process because of its high reaction rate methanol k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 k so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and tert butanol koh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 k so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 were used to calculate the contribution of oh and so 4 in the system p benzoquinone pbq and furfuryl alcohol were used to quench o 2 9 0 108 m 1s 1 and 1o2 1 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively in the system in the multi phase advanced oxidation process potassium iodide ki was used to quench the surface bound oh and so 4 46 in the presence of meoh the degradation of 2 4 d was greatly inhibited in fig 7a and the removal rate was only 20 indicating that radicals such as oh and or so 4 played an important role in the oxidation process with the addition of tba the degradation rate decreased slightly which indicates that the contribution of oh to the reaction was limited the addition of pbq slightly reduced the degradation rate of 2 4 d by 83 indicating that o 2 played a part in degrading 2 4 d however in the presence of ffa the degradation of 2 4 d was greatly inhibited fig 7b indicating that 1o2 played an important role in the oxidation reaction 47 fig 7c further shows that the presence of ffa alone would lead to degradation of 2 4 d which confirmed that the degradation of 2 4 d was caused by 1o2 inhibited by ffa in addition with the introduction of ki the degradation rate of 2 4 d was only 11 indicating that radicals were generated on the surface binding layer of feco 10 and participated in degrading 2 4 d according to eqs 13 16 the contribution rates were 1o2 96 o 2 77 oh 57 and so 4 40 respectively the results of xps and quenching experiments show that pms molecules were more easily adsorbed on the positively charged c nucleus connected to the c atom at the con site in oco the o atoms in oco and the n atoms in co nx acted as electron acceptors in depleting the adsorbed pms to release 1o2 in addition co and graphite n tended to activate pms to generate 1o2 these defects could enhance the adsorption of pms molecules on the surface of the catalyst and contribute to the formation of 1o2 13 r o h k o h k app k app k tba k app 14 r s o 4 k s o 4 k app k tba

rate constant in feco 10 pms system ktba kmeoh kffa and kpbq are the apparent degradation rate constants of tba meoh pba and ffa respectively we also compared the mil 101 pms system with the feco 10 pms system the former is a radical oxidation system that plays a major role through so 4 radicals as depicted in fig 8 the degradation rate of 2 4 d was only 17 when meoh was added moreover the addition of tba ffa and pbq slightly affected the removal of 2 4 d the contribution rates of ros were 1o2 9 o 2 8 oh 11 and so 4 70 in contrast the feco 10 pms system showed rapid degradation of 2 4 d the obvious degradation of feco 10 pms system indicates that the non radical oxidation process was enhanced the radicals generated in the feco 10 pms system were further evaluated by the epr spin trap technique and the results are presented in fig 9 dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent for oh so 4 and o 2 and temp was used as a trapping agent for 1o2 all signals were detected indicating that both free radical and non radical pathways contributed to the 2 4 d degradation process however no signal peak was observed when pms was added alone the esr results show that all so 4 oh o 2 and 1o2 were produced in the feco 10 pms system peng et al found that the reactive species fe could be produced in the persulfate reaction 48 they added citrate to the system and verified the contribution of high valent iron oxides to the degradation of tc as shown in fig 7d the addition of citrate inhibited the degradation of 2 4 d by about 20 which aroused our interest it has been reported that pmso readily reacts with fe to form pmso2 49 therefore the formation of fe in feco 10 pms system was investigated by detecting changes in concentrating pmso and pmso2 in the fig 7d the concentration of pmso decreased by 40 after 20 min however no pmso2 formation was observed and the consumption of pmso may be due to the degradation of pmso caused by ros produced in the system as demonstrated by wang et al 50 these results indicate that in the degradation process of 2 4 d all active substances of 1o2 oh so 4 and o 2 were involved compared with mil 101 the successful preparation of feco ldh enhanced the production of 1o2 and promoted the degradation of 2 4 d by 1o2 among these active substances 1o2 and the radicals generated on the surface of the catalyst contributed the most to the reaction while high valent iron did not play a role in the system based on the above analysis the mechanism of enhancing catalytic performance of feco 10 on pms activation was proposed as shown in fig 10 the initial metal ions co 2 and fe 2 on the surface could catalyze hso 5 to generate so 4 and oxidize to co 3 and fe 3 after that co 3 and fe 3 oxidized hso 5 and returned to the initial valence state eqs 17 18 51 at the same time so 4 could further react with h2o to form oh the main reaction equations generated by other free radicals were eqs 19 24 52 17 c o 2 f e 2 hs o 5 s o 4 o h c o 3 f e 3 18 c o

products c o 2 h 2 o 3 4 possible degradation pathway and toxicity assessment the hplc ms was employed to identify the degradation intermediates of 2 4 d in feco 10 pms system the results of eis spectroscopy figs s3 4 and the fukui index based on the density functional theory dft were used to analyze the reaction sites of organic molecules in the feco 10 pms system the combination of the two methods proposed the possible degradation pathway of 2 4 d in this study the main active substances were 1o2 so 4 o 2 and oh and the fukui index f f and f0 distributions were calculated using natural population analysis npa charges fig 11a shows the 2 4 d molecular structure after the gaussian software geometry optimization fig 11b d show the homo lumo orbital and 2 4 d molecular surface electrostatic potential distribution respectively molecular orbital distribution could reflect the reactivity of molecules and the homo orbits indicate areas that were prone to losing electrons for electrophilic attacks 53 it could be seen from the fig 11b that for 2 4 d the homo orbitals mainly distributed near the benzene ring where the atoms associated with cl and oh were more reactive 7 the distribution of molecular surface charges affected would affect the distribution of molecular orbitals the blue part in fig 11d represents the area where the global maximum appeared which represents the positive charge the red part represents the area where the global minimum appeared which represents the negative charge the fig 11d shows that o17 and o19 connected to c16 mainly occupied the most negatively charged area and the maximum point of the molecule concentrated around o12 indicating its high electrophilic activity c6 f f0 0 21 0 14 c3 f f0 0 12 0 12 o12 f f0 0 43 0 08 cl10 f f0 0 16 0 10 and cl11 f f0 0 10 0 08 showed high fukui index table s1 which might be attacked by ros fig 11e shows the degradation pathway of 2 4 d the degradation pathways mainly include hydroxylation dechlorination and ring cleavage specifically in the 2 4 d degradation process the hydroxylation process occurred first 54 when so 4 and oh attacked the o12 atom 2 4 d were converted into 24 dcp by hydroxylation and the subsequent 1 4 cycloaddition triggered by 1o2 attacked c1 which caused 2 4 d oxidation 55 namely f and then led to the formation of phenolic intermediates 56 afterwards hq reacted with oxygen radicals to form benzoquinone bq in addition products with smaller molecules such as a passed the ring opening step when attacked by so 4 once the benzene ring was opened the further degradation of these intermediate products became easier which also brought the intuitive reduction of toc see fig s5 57 it is worth noting that during the formation of chq chlorine radicals were generated which could be further oxidized to produce chloride ions glycolic acid and other small molecules can be converted into simpler alcohols and aldehydes through dehydrogenation and hydroxylation and eventually mineralized into co2 and h2o to verify the green safety of the feco 10 pms system during the decomposition process of 2 4 d the toxicity estimation software t e s t was used to explore the acute toxicity of 2 4 d and its degradation intermediates based on the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction daphnia magna lc 50 and oral rat ld 50 58 the ld50 fig 12a of 2 4 d was 424 07 mg l which could be classified as very toxic almost all degradation intermediates showed ld50 higher than 2 4 d indicating that feco 10 pms degradation of 2 4 d reduced the oral toxicity of rats the acute toxicity of daphnia magna lc50 fig 12b was 36 43 mg l which could be classified as harmful except a few intermediates which were classified as toxic most of them were harmful or harmless 59 in conclusion these results indicate that feco 10 pms system could not only completely remove 2 4 d but also reduce the toxicity of 2 4 d the reusability of the catalyst was very important in practical applications five cycles were performed to test the stability of the feco 10 pms system for 2 4 d degradation as displayed in fig 13 the degradation rate of 2 4 d remained above 99 8 in five consecutive runs the small decrease in catalytic activity less than 1 after 5 cycles might be due to the coverage of surface organic matter and active sites mineralization and dechlorination rates were also tested in fig s5a the incomplete mineralization of 2 4 d 69 7 might be related to the difficulty in completely removing the residual intermediates and these intermediates needed to be further oxidized another important factor affecting the long term stability and safety of heterogeneous catalysts is metal leaching 37 during the oxidation process the leaching of the cobalt ion concentration was monitored by icp oes in fig s5b the leaching of cobalt ion increased slowly and the concentration within 15 min was only 35 μg l far below the national standard to further investigate the 2 4 d decomposition mechanism fe species extracted from the feco 10 pms system were also measured fig s5b after 15 min the concentrations of total fe fe2 and fe3 were 2 42 1 89 and 0 49 mg l respectively indicating that more fe2 was used in decomposing pms to produce more 2 4 d degraded so 4 which explains why the excellent performance was achieved in the feco 10 pms system 60 the above results confirm that the system had a high efficiency in processing 2 4 d and the stabilizing effect shown after cycling catalysis highlighted its excellent structural stability 4 conclusion in summary the stable structure spindle feco ldh catalyst was successfully synthesized and characterized by xrd ft ir sem tem bet and xps techniques the removal efficiency of feco ldh pms system toward 2 4 d degradation can reach up to 100 within 12 min and the degradation rate constants of feco ldh pms system was about 9 9 times higher than mil 101 pms system 1o2 so 4 and oh were simultaneously generated during the pms activation and 1o2 played a pivotal role with 96 contribution rate in the oxidation of 2 4 d according to the quenching reactions and esr study more importantly the 2 4 d intermediates during the degradation process were confirmed by gc ms and dft calculations and the degradation pathway mainly included hydroxylation dechlorination and ring cleavage process the toxicity of 2 4 d and degradation intermediates were assessed as well showing that sr aop caused the decreased toxicity the findings of this study provide information about the
