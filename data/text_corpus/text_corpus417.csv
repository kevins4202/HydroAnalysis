2085,cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs in reservoirs can be transported to downstream waters via scheduled discharges transport dynamics are difficult to capture in traditional cyanohab monitoring which can be spatially disparate and temporally discontinuous the introduction of satellite remote sensing for cyanohab monitoring provides opportunities to detect where cyanohabs occur in relation to reservoir release locations like canal inlets the study objectives were to assess 1 differences in reservoir cyanohab frequencies as determined by in situ and remotely sensed data and 2 the feasibility of using satellite imagery to identify conditions associated with release driven cyanohab export as a representative case lake okeechobee and the st lucie estuary florida usa which receives controlled releases from lake okeechobee were examined both systems are impacted by cyanohabs and the st lucie estuary experienced states of emergency for extreme cyanohabs in 2016 and 2018 using the european space agency s sentinel 3 olci imagery processed with the cyanobacteria index cicyano cyanohab frequencies across lake okeechobee from may 2016 april 2021 were compared to frequencies from in situ data strong agreement was observed in frequency rankings between the in situ and remotely sensed data in capturing intra annual variability in bloom frequencies across lake okeechobee kendall s tau 0 85 p value 0 0002 whereas no alignment was observed when evaluating inter annual variation kendall s tau 0 p value 1 further remotely sensed observations revealed that cyanohabs were highly frequent near the inlet to the canal connecting lake okeechobee to the st lucie estuary in state of emergency years a pattern not evident from in situ data alone this study demonstrates how remote sensing can complement traditional cyanohab monitoring to inform reservoir release decision making keywords cyanobacteria satellite remote sensing reservoir management water quality monitoring sentinel 3 lake okeechobee st lucie estuary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs are a pressing issue in fresh waterbodies having the potential for health consequences when they form as the predominant bloom formers in freshwater ecosystems cyanobacteria are often associated with ecological and human health risk the growth and decay of cyanohabs can lead to hypoxic and anoxic conditions in the water column resulting in the death of fish and benthic invertebrates food web imbalances and loss of biological diversity burkholder et al 2018 kenneth and dortch 2008 furthermore various cyanobacteria can produce toxins harmful to mammals including hepatotoxins which affect the liver dermatoxins which affect the skin and neurotoxins which affect the nervous system burkholder et al 2018 ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 cyanobacteria proliferate in nutrient enriched waters with long residence times making managed reservoirs vulnerable to cyanohab occurrence paerl et al 2018 the formation of blooms in reservoirs creates the opportunity for cyanobacteria to be transported to downstream systems when water is released there have been reports of cyanohabs occurring in brackish waters due to transport from upstream freshwater reservoirs in large estuarine systems across maryland north carolina florida and california paerl et al 2018 cyanohab transport has also been reported between reservoir systems and infrastructure systems such as irrigation tanks when source waters were coincident with in reservoir cyanohabs copetti et al 2021 with continued global warming and eutrophication the presence of cyanohabs and increases in magnitude extent and frequency of cyanohab occurrence are anticipated paerl et al 2016 thus also increasing the potential for blooms to be transported to downstream waters as a function of reservoir management understanding the connections between cyanohabs forming in reservoirs and potential transport to downstream waters is challenging due to the spatial and temporal disparities in hydrologic and cyanohab monitoring data availability for many managed reservoirs continual gauge and flow data are available at discharge locations u s geological survey 2021 because field sampling of cyanobacteria is expensive and time intensive traditional long term monitoring practices typically consist of seasonal monthly or twice monthly water samples at a few locations across a waterbody papenfus et al 2020 traditional in situ monitoring data can provide long term insights into typical cyanohab conditions siders and havens 2020 and detailed data regarding many water quality parameters known to influence cyanohabs however the spatial and temporal resolutions of discrete in situ cyanobacteria data are often too disparate and discontinuous for characterizing cyanohab dynamics in relation to reservoir water releases and associated hydrologic data consequently the potential for reservoir releases to export cyanohabs to downstream waters remains poorly characterized the introduction of satellite remote sensing has provided data complimentary to in situ monitoring practices that can address gaps in our understanding of how reservoir releases may export cyanohabs to downstream waters there are many algorithms for quantifying chlorophyll a biomass detected in waterbodies using satellite imagery seegers et al 2018 some of which are specific to cyanobacteria in inland waters seegers et al 2021 despite certain limitations due to pixel resolution revisit time algorithm uncertainty and cloud coverage satellite imagery can provide data for cyanohab detection at regular temporal intervals that is more spatially continuous than field monitoring practices without significant added costs for field managers greater spatial continuity in cyanohab observations provided via satellite imagery could enable managers to visualize and understand where blooms are concentrated within a reservoir insights from which could directly inform management decisions for example satellite imagery could reveal whether cyanohabs are concentrated near a primary discharge point resulting in a manager potentially deciding to postpone releasing water until the bloom has dissipated or migrated to another region of the reservoir the efficacy of using satellite imagery to examine cyanohabs on a regional and national scale has been adequately demonstrated clark et al 2017 coffer et al 2020 coffer et al 2021 and has been applied to individual systems across the united states to complement in situ monitoring of cyanobacteria little work however has connected satellite remote sensing of cyanohabs to hydrologic data testing whether cyanohab observations collected via satellite remote sensing could prove useful for informing reservoir release decisions and mitigating bloom export to downstream waters to address this knowledge gap and better understand in reservoir bloom dynamics during extreme downstream bloom events our study supplemented historical in situ data with satellite derived cyanohab estimates to better understand bloom dynamics with respect to reservoir release decisions this study had two objectives 1 to assess the differences between in situ and remotely sensed cyanohab observations and understand the impacts of differences between the spatial and temporal resolutions of monitoring on cyanohab frequencies and 2 to assess the feasibility of using satellite remote sensing to identify conditions associated with cyanobacteria export based on historical extreme cyanohab events in our study extreme historical events were downstream cyanohabs associated with issued states of emergency specifically where downstream cyanohabs were attributed to transport of cyanobacteria blooming in upstream reservoirs lake okeechobee and the st lucie estuary in south florida usa are connected systems impacted by recurrent cyanohabs and were used as a representative study area for this analysis cyanohabs forming in the st lucie can be severe with states of emergency issued in the summers of 2016 and 2018 krimsky et al 2018 such events are widely attributed to waters discharged from lake okeechobee krimsky et al 2018 where cyanobacteria proliferate havens et al 1996 havens and gawlik 2005 paerl and scott 2010 however claims regarding relationships between recent cyanohabs within the st lucie and water releases are anecdotal creating a compelling opportunity to identify whether the use of satellite remote sensing could provide fresh insights to this historical management challenge 2 methods 2 1 study area south florida has a sub tropical climate with two predominate seasons the rainy season comprising may through october and the dry season comprising november through april phlips et al 2012 accordingly the florida water year wy is defined as may through april julian and osborne 2018 fully encompassing both wet and dry seasons each wy is refenced by the calendar year in which it ends the states of emergency issued for cyanohabs in the st lucie the summers of 2016 and 2018 therefore occurred in wy 2017 and wy 2019 due to data availability our study period spanned wy 2017 through wy 2021 may 1 2016 april 30 2021 water released from lake okeechobee is primarily discharged to the caloosahatchee estuary to the west and secondarily to the st lucie estuary to the east fig 1 during our study period lake discharges were primarily driven by flood prevention according to the 2008 lake okeechobee regulation schedule lake okeechobee has three dominant ecological zones the littoral zone along the western edge the near shore zone by the littoral zone to the west and along the southern edge of the lake and the pelagic zone in the central and eastern portions of the lake to account for ecological zones and the location of different inlets and outlets we examined the lake by dividing it into quadrants northwest northeast southwest and southeast fig 2 more information regarding the quadrants lake hydrology and ecology and the st lucie estuary system can be found in the supplemental information si 2 2 satellite imagery we used sentinel 3 ocean and land colour instrument olci data to detect cyanohabs across lake okeechobee olci images have a 300 m spatial resolution and there are two sentinel 3 satellites a and b each with a 2 3 day return period sentinel 3a was launched in 2016 with the first images available april 2016 and sentinel 3b in 2018 with the first images available may 2018 we included data from both satellites in this analysis the entire analysis including satellite image analysis and production of thematic maps was done in r and rstudio r core team 2021 a code repository is available at https github com nvontress lok frequencies the olci images we used in this analysis were processed by the nasa ocean biology processing group obpg https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov projects cyan according to the descriptions in seegers et al 2021 using the cyanobacteria index cicyano algorithm from the cyanobacteria assessment network cyan schaeffer et al 2015 preliminary processing by the obpg was conducted in seadas wherein the olci level 1b top of atmosphere signal was corrected for rayleigh scattering quality assurance masks were applied for cloud cover sun glint land and mixed land water pixels the cicyano algorithm was applied and composite images were generated seegers et al 2021 wynne et al 2018 we used weekly composite cyan images in our analysis to limit the impacts of cloud cover in our calculations the ci algorithm was first developed by wynne et al 2008 to approximate cyanobacterial abundance in inland lakes clark et al 2017 wynne et al 2010 such that 1 ci s s λ and 2 s s λ ρ s λ ρ s λ ρ s λ ρ s λ λ λ λ λ where ci is the cyanobacteria index ss λ is the spectral shape ss at a given wavelength λ and ρ is the rayleigh corrected top of atmosphere reflectance ci is calculated at ss 681 using eq 2 where λ is 681 nm λ is 665 nm and λ is 709 nm the algorithm was later updated from ci to cicyano by lunetta et al 2015 to incorporate phycocyanin presence and thus prevent false positives from chlorophyll a containing organisms aside from cyanobacteria wynne et al 2013 cyanobacterial identification with phycocyanin presence was accomplished by applying ss 665 as filter where positive ss 665 values indicate the presence of cyanobacteria whereas the negative ss 665 values indicate the absence of cyanobacteria ss 665 is calculated using eq 2 but with respective λ λ and λ values of 665 nm 620 nm and 681 nm the two spectral shapes together were used to differentiate non cyanobacterial taxa from cyanobacteria because ss 681 is sensitive to the light scattering and lower fluorescence signal unique to cyanobacterial populations wynne et al 2008 and ss 665 is sensitive to phycocyanin s response at 620 nm lunetta et al 2015 remotely sensed and in situ observations of cyanohabs are reported in different units of measurement i e cicyano vs chlorophyll a respectively and across different spatial scales i e continuous 300 m pixels vs discrete grab sample locations to analyze differences between the two datasets we categorized all detected cicyano values into three classifications that could be used for one to one comparisons bloom possible bloom and no bloom the florida department of environmental protection fdep uses chlorophyll a concentration as an indicator for cyanohabs within lake okeechobee designating that bloom forming algae are considered a bloom at chlorophyll a concentrations above 40 µg l havens et al 1994 because bloom forming algal populations within the lake are often dominated by cyanobacteria we applied the 40 µg l threshold as an indicator for cyanohabs fdep 2001 classification ranges were determined by applying an uncertainty range around the 40 µg l threshold using error metrics from a cicyano to chlorophyll a conversion the conversion we used to estimate chlorophyll a from cicyano data was reported in tomlinson et al 2016 and developed using data specifically from florida lakes eq 3 3 chla 4050 271 c i cyano 20 3 where chla represents chlorophyll a in µg l while eq 3 was initially developed using ci not cicyano it was calibrated with cyanobacteria dominated waters and demonstrated for chlorophyll a estimation from cicyano in seegers et al 2021 we defined the uncertainty range i e the range of possible bloom values detected in the satellite imagery using error metrics reported in seegers et al 2021 calculated using matchups of cicyano chlorophyll a estimates from eq 3 and in situ chlorophyll a measurements seegers et al 2021 used national data to calculate error metrics not just data from florida lakes reporting log transformed bias biaslog eq 4 and mean absolute error maelog eq 5 biaslog and maelog were calculated for different ranges of in situ chlorophyll a concentrations according to trophic state we implemented the error metrics seegers et al 2021 reported for the hypereutrophic range 30 90 µg l which contained the 40 µg l bloom threshold for lake okeechobee applying the maelog as the uncertainty range surrounding the bloom threshold maelog rather than an algorithm confidence interval was used to quantify uncertainty because maelog is less sensitive to outliers in non normally distributed data like chlorophyll a seegers et al 2018 4 bia s log 10 i 1 n log 10 y i log 10 x i n 5 ma e log 10 i 1 n log 10 y i log 10 x i n in eqs 4 and 5 yi represents each remotely sensed chlorophyll a estimate xi represents each corresponding in situ chlorophyll a samle and n represents the total number of samples because all observations were log transformed to account for the non normal distribution of chlorophyll a data and the final metrics back transformed from the log scale biaslog and maelog are multiplicative error e g a biaslog of 1 1 would indicate 10 bias a biaslog of 0 9 would indicate 10 bias and a maelog of 1 1 would indicate 10 mean absolute error for the national data the maelog for eq 3 was 1 3 meaning the mae was 30 error between the national in situ measures and the cicyano derived chlorophyll a estimates seegers et al 2021 to address misfit between in situ and satellite derived chlorophyll a values we chose to apply the maelog reported in seegers et al 2021 rather than those calculated for lake okeechobee section 2 3 as the uncertainty range around the bloom threshold because it provided a more conservative estimate of possible bloom values due to the larger sample size and smaller resulting possible bloom range section 3 1 maelog was applied as an uncertainty range around the 40 µg l bloom threshold resulting classification ranges can be found in table 1 all classification thresholds were then converted from chlorophyll a values to cicyano values using eq 3 thresholds were then directly applied to the cicyano imagery to assign pixels to the bloom possible bloom and no bloom classifications we additionally included pixels with observations falling below the cicyano algorithm detection limit in the no bloom classification missing and masked values due to cloud cover sun glint land presence and vegetation seegers et al 2021 wynne et al 2018 were excluded from the analysis seegers et al 2021 reported biaslog for the hypereutrophic range as 1 16 for eq 3 meaning bias observed in the national data was 16 while we did not adjust the classification thresholds according to bias when classifying the cicyano images it is important to recognize as a possible source of error in the remotely sensed dataset 2 3 in situ chlorophyll a data we used chlorophyll a samples from the south florida water management district sfwmd dbhydro environmental database sfwmd 2021 lake okeechobee had 36 active water quality stations with monthly occasionally twice monthly sampling for in situ chlorophyll a observations at the end of our study period however many active in situ monitoring stations were initiated mid way through our study period thus stations used in our study were selected based on data availability with the condition of having no more than one month of missing data from wy 2017 through wy 2021 resulting in 14 stations across the lake we then omitted sampling sites located on or directly next to mixed land water pixels urquhart and schaeffer 2020 removing four additional stations in total ten chlorophyll a monitoring stations across lake okeechobee were used three of which were in the northwest quadrant two in the northeast quadrant one in the southwest quadrant and four in the southeast quadrant fig 2 chlorophyll a field samples consisted of surface grab samples collected within the top half meter of the water column by sfwmd south florida water management district 2021 chlorophyll a values were determined using method 447 0 which uses high performance liquid chromatography hplc at 440 nm to detect chlorophyll a and b pigments in freshwater and marine algae arar 1997 we classified the in situ data into bloom chlorophyll a 40 µg l and no bloom chlorophyll a 40 µg l based on the bloom threshold for lake okeechobee we also calculated maelog and biaslog between the in situ samples and same day chlorophyll a satellite imagery estimates 2 4 bloom frequency analysis 2 4 1 frequency calculations we examined frequencies of the satellite imagery classifications bloom possible bloom and no bloom and the in situ classifications bloom and no bloom across two time groups wy and month and five spatial boundaries lake okeechobee and each of its quadrants frequencies were analyzed by wy to determine whether cyanohabs were more frequent in wys with states of emergency wy 2017 and wy 2019 and by month to observe seasonal trends of cyanohab frequency and compare to previously reported trends determined from in situ observations all data were aggregated across time groupings so wy data included observations aggregated from may through april for each year and monthly data included observations aggregated from wy2017 through wy2021 for each month for the satellite imagery we calculated frequency for each classification spatial boundary i e quadrant or entire lake and time group combination by dividing the number of pixels in a given classification by the total number of valid pixels i e all classified pixels excluding missing values within a spatial boundary during the time group of interest fig 3 frequencies for in situ data were similarly calculated where the frequency for a given classification spatial boundary and time group was equal to the number of observations within a classification divided by the total number of grab samples taken within the spatial boundary and time group fig 3 all resulting frequencies were converted to percent to ensure the merging of sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b into weekly composites did not artificially inflate annual frequencies following the launch of sentinel 3b in wy 2019 we also examined frequencies from daily images which indicated sentinel 3b s launch had a negligible effect on the resulting annual frequencies more information regarding this analysis can be found in the si 2 4 2 comparing bloom frequencies from satellite remote sensing and in situ data we compared the in situ frequency of the bloom classification to the remotely sensed total potential bloom frequency by conducting a two tailed kendall s tau b correlation test hereon kendall s tau kendall s tau is a non parametric rank based correlation coefficient that is robust in handling tied data and is good for small non normal datasets akoglu 2018 remotely sensed frequencies were distilled into two classifications total potential bloom frequency being the combined bloom and possible bloom frequencies and no bloom frequency to allow for comparison to the in situ data which had only two classifications kendall s tau across no bloom classifications was not examined more information on kendall s tau can be found in the si 2 5 flow analysis 2 5 1 flow data flow exiting lake okeechobee is monitored at several sites for this study we focused on s 308 which is a lock and dam water control structure that discharges to the c 44 canal connecting lake okeechobee to the st lucie estuary fig 1 continual flow and gauge data were obtained from the u s geological survey at s 308 site number 02276877 from 2016 through 2020 reported in fifteen minute increments 2 5 2 area of influence to understand the connections between cyanohabs occurring within the lake and states of emergency being issued in the st lucie estuary an area of influence aoi was calculated encompassing a small region of lake okeechobee surrounding s 308 the aoi represents the area of lake okeechobee from which water released at s 308 originates and therefore is likely to contribute any cyanobacteria transported to downstream waters exact calculation methods are located in the si 2 5 3 comparing discharge rate to satellite imagery for every month throughout the study period we calculated the total potential bloom frequency i e frequency of bloom frequency of the possible bloom categories within the aoi based on the satellite imagery to understand bloom dynamics near the lake outlet with respect to flow at s 308 percentiles of the resulting total potential bloom frequencies were calculated to examine how often the aoi experienced frequent blooms in comparison to the aggregated monthly total potential bloom frequencies across the entire lake a time series plot was constructed comparing flow at s 308 with the total potential bloom frequency within the aoi to determine whether more information regarding bloom dynamics in years with and without states of emergency could be gathered than by in situ data alone chlorophyll a measurements from s 308 throughout the study period were also incorporated into the time series to examine information available from in situ alone as compared to information from total potential bloom frequencies 3 results 3 1 comparing satellite imagery and in situ cyanohab monitoring 3 1 1 in situ to remotely sensed chlorophyll a comparisons we had 78 matchups of in situ and remotely sensed chlorophyll a observations from lake okeechobee 16 of which had in situ measurements within the hypereutrophic range as defined by seegers et al 2021 maelog and biaslog were calculated for the full range of lake okeechobee values as well as for just the hypereutrophic range table 2 the full range of in situ observations for lake okeechobee was relatively small 3 86 µg l when compared to the range of chlorophyll a data presented in seegers et al 0 700 µg l 2021 based on the summary statistics for the full range of data both the lake okeechobee dataset and national dataset experienced high maelog which were respectively 2 2 120 error and 1 8 80 error the lake okeechobee data had a high positive bias of 1 6 63 whereas the national dataset had high positive bias of 1 33 33 within the hypereutrophic range 30 90 µg l the maelog for lake okeechobee was 1 8 80 error and the biaslog was 0 55 45 like the national response the data from lake okeechobee showed closer alignment between in situ chlorophyll a samples and remotely sensed chlorophyll a estimates in the hypereutrophic range than in the overall dataset unlike the national dataset however the lake okeechobee specific data showed negative rather than positive biaslog in the hypereutrophic range the poorer overall performance of the lake okeechobee data when compared to the national dataset could be due to the smaller sample size of available data or the high baseline response observed in the lake okeechobee satellite response fig 4 in situ and remotely sensed data are subject to error and matchups therefore should not be expected to perfectly fit a one to one regression papenfus et al 2020 3 1 2 comparison of annual and monthly in situ and remotely sensed frequencies annual frequencies calculated from remotely sensed and in situ observations were neither strongly correlated tau 0 5 nor statistically significant p value 0 05 across lake okeechobee or any of its quadrants table 3 kendall s tau across the whole lake was 0 meaning the rankings of total potential bloom frequencies as determined by the satellite imagery completely varied from the bloom frequencies from the in situ data despite differences in rankings there was not much inter wy variability in bloom frequency across lake okeechobee within each dataset with total potential bloom frequency from the remotely sensed data ranging from 3 3 to 12 7 and the bloom frequency from the in situ data ranging from 1 7 to 11 3 fig 5 for most wys the difference between total potential bloom frequency and in situ bloom frequency pairs was less than 5 the least similar frequencies across the two datasets occurred in wy 2019 where the in situ bloom frequency was 1 7 and the satellite derived total potential bloom frequency was 12 7 across lake okeechobee similar to the frequencies across the entire lake there was a large disparity between the in situ bloom frequencies and satellite derived total potential bloom frequency in wy 2019 in every quadrant wherein the satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies were consistently greater than the in situ bloom frequencies fig 5 the greatest differences occurred in the northeast and southwest quadrants where the in situ bloom frequency was 0 while the respective total potential bloom frequencies from the satellite imagery were 11 8 and 14 5 while there were other instances of large disparities in the annual quadrant frequencies 5 annual frequency difference between the two datasets wy 2019 was the only wy in which the remotely sensed data consistently yielded higher frequency estimates than the in situ data for other large disparities there was a more even division between which dataset yielded the larger frequency estimate the in situ frequencies exceeded the satellite derived frequency estimates by more than 5 twice in the northwest quadrant in wy 2017 and the northeast quadrant in wy 2020 and the satellite derived frequencies exceeded the in situ frequency estimates by more than 5 three times in the northwest quadrant in wy 2020 and in the southwest quadrant in wy 2020 and wy 2021 the more even division in which dataset yielded the higher frequency across other wys of our study indicates that the large disparity observed in the wy 2019 frequencies is not due solely to error or bias in the satellite imagery estimates unlike the annual frequencies the monthly frequencies calculated using the remote sensing and in situ datasets across lake okeechobee were strongly correlated with a kendall s tau value of 0 85 and a p value far less than 0 05 indicating agreement in intra annual variability in frequencies determined from the two datasets the monthly trends in both data sets reveal more frequent blooms in the peak of the wet season june through august in the satellite data and june through october in the in situ data and less frequent blooms in the dry season fig 6 the greatest difference in frequencies occurred in the aggregated data for july where the satellite derived total potential bloom frequency was 31 5 and the in situ bloom frequency was 10 yielding a difference of 21 5 august also experienced a large disparity between the two datasets with respective total potential bloom frequencies and in situ frequencies of 17 9 and 11 7 yielding a difference of 6 3 as in the annual frequencies however all other disparities between the two datasets were within 5 of each other when broken down by quadrants both the remote sensing and in situ monthly frequencies indicated blooms more frequently occur in the northern half of lake okeechobee than in the southern half fig 6 kendall s tau for the northwest and northeast quadrants were both 0 68 with respective p values of 0 003 and 0 005 indicating strong alignment between the satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies and in situ data while there were multiple ties in the in situ monthly frequencies of the northern quadrants when the bloom frequency was 0 across many dry season months these ties coincided with extremely low total potential bloom frequencies in the remotely sensed data the monthly frequencies across the two datasets in the southern portion of the lake were moderately but not significantly correlated with respective kendall s tau values of 0 33 and 0 4 and respective p values of 0 2 and 0 1 in the southwest and southeast quadrants the satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies were consistently higher than the in situ estimates for almost all months with the only exceptions being october and november in the southeast quadrant this disparity is largely due to the large number of ties i e equally ranked frequencies from the in situ dataset with ten ties in the southwestern quadrant s in situ bloom frequencies and eight in the southeastern quadrant s wherein the in situ bloom frequency was 0 like the northern half of the lake most ties in the in situ bloom frequencies occur when the satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies are also very low 5 the key exception occurred in july when in situ frequencies for both the southern quadrants were 0 yet remote sensing total potential bloom frequencies were respectively 30 2 and 24 4 in the southwest and southeast quadrants some of the highest of all twelve months this contrast indicates that the location of in situ monitoring stations or timing of sampling runs missed bloom events in the southern portion of lake okeechobee during our study period meaning in situ samples were taken during the 70 75 of the time when blooms were not occuring in the southern quadrants 3 2 identifying bloom conditions associated with export events 3 2 1 area of influence the maximum calculated aoi encompassed 4 8 km2 of lake okeechobee and had a radius of 1 502 m representing the region of lake okeechobee likely to contribute cyanobacteria when water is discharged from s 308 fig 7 a the aoi overlapped with 56 pixels within lake okeechobee used to determine the total potential frequency of blooms i e combined frequency of the possible bloom and bloom classifications within the aoi for each month from wy 2017 through wy 2021 fig 7b 3 2 2 examining frequencies with flow based on calculated total potential bloom frequencies cyanohabs routinely occurred within the aoi examining the percentiles of aoi total potential bloom frequencies revealed that the aoi experienced low total potential bloom frequencies for most months throughout the study period 70th percentile 5 6 frequency table 4 however the aoi also experienced more frequent blooms than those represented in the monthly frequencies with a maximum total potential bloom frequency within the aoi of 50 2 in comparison the highest total potential bloom frequency from the monthly data across the whole lake was 31 5 in july falling just below the 90th percentile of total potential bloom frequencies within the aoi during our study period the second highest monthly total potential bloom frequency across lake okeechobee was 22 3 in june also falling in the 80th percentile of aoi frequencies while data were compiled differently for the lake wide and aoi total potential bloom frequencies the peak lake wide monthly frequencies serve as a reference for how extreme frequencies above the 80th percentile in the aoi were as compared to the rest of lake okeechobee months wherein the aoi total potential bloom frequency was above the 80th percentile were june and july of wy 2017 july and august of wy 2018 july august september and october of wy 2019 june july and august of wy 2020 and july and august of wy 2019 despite having total potential bloom frequencies in the 80th and 90th percentiles during all five years of our study the only two years when these high frequencies coincided with high discharges from s 308 were wy 2017 and wy 2019 when the states of emergency occurred in all other years flow at s 308 was either very low or negative when the aoi experienced frequent or highly frequent cyanohabs fig 8 the patterns revealed by satellite imagery were reflected in the in situ chlorophyll a grab samples wherein the only instances of chlorophyll a grab samples at s 308 exceeding the 40 µg l threshold during periods with high discharge occurred in wy 2017 and wy 2019 however these instances were non consecutive and coupled with a same month measurement falling below the threshold possibly due to flushing or mixing in the water column making the pattern of cyanohabs aligned with high discharge rates difficult to detect from in situ data alone table 5 in contrast when looking at the remotely sensed total potential bloom frequencies within the aoi a pattern of consecutive highly frequent cyanohabs aligned with high discharges becomes much more apparent fig 8 4 discussion in this study we adapted methods of calculating cyanohab frequency with satellite imagery clark et al 2017 coffer et al 2021 to incorporate fdep chlorophyll a bloom thresholds and proposed methods for assessing cyanohab export potential in a single system using satellite remote sensing and hydrologic data in doing so novel methods of examining hydrologic in situ water quality data and satellite imagery collected across multiple time scales were established the methods presented are directly applicable to other freshwater reservoirs resolvable by sentinel 3 olci imagery furthermore methodology used to determine an aoi in reservoirs can be utilized to better determine when cyanohabs may be transported to downstream waters we used lake okeechobee and the st lucie estuary as a representative study system examining the frequency of blooms within different regions of the lake to better understand bloom dynamics and factors contributing to downstream states of emergency issued for cyanohabs we also analyzed monthly and annual bloom frequencies from satellite imagery and compared to in situ bloom monitoring by examining rank based correlation across the two datasets this research helps bridge the use of traditional in situ and satellite remote sensing for monitoring cyanohabs in individual systems although this study underlines the utility of satellite remote sensing for addressing observational data gaps and informing management limitations were also noted our study period was limited to time following the launch of sentinel 3 however the inclusion of other extreme blooms events could be helpful in better understanding the dynamics of cyanobacteria in the lake okeechobee waterway although the sentinel 3 missions did not launch until 2016 the cicyano algorithm was originally developed for esa s medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris the dataset for which spans 2002 2012 the cicyano algorithm can also be applied to nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and the datasets which can be used to examine events between the meris and olci time spans clark et al 2017 wynne et al 2021 while we used a cicyano to chlorophyll a relationship specific to florida lakes there are other published algorithms and error metrics for estimating chlorophyll a that could be applied in different systems seegers et al 2021 proposed a bootstrapped algorithm created using cicyano and in situ data from a wider variety of lakes than the algorithm published by tomlinson et al 2016 that may be better suited to systems outside the state of florida that are resolvable by sentinel 3 olci data for systems where a finer spatial resolution is required chlorophyll a algorithms for other satellites have been proposed like the sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi which has a spatial resolution of 10 m to 60 m and has been used to calculate chlorophyll a biomass in smaller systems ansper and alikas 2018 while sentinel 2 offers a finer spatial resolution it lacks the spectral resolution for detecting phycocyanin fluorescence so it cannot be used to differentiate cyanobacteria from other chlorophyll a containing biomass clark et al 2017 furthermore the combined revisit time of sentinel 2a and 2b is 5 days ansper and alikas 2018 as compared to the near daily combined revisit time of sentinel 3a and 3b satellites lunetta et al 2015 greatly reducing the number of images captured on a weekly basis in our study system there was error between in situ chlorophyll a measurements and satellite derived chlorophyll a estimates which should be accounted for when interpreting results while we adjusted for error by the bloom threshold for lake okeechobee to a range of possible bloom thresholds according to published maelog there are several possible explanations for error between remotely sensed and in situ chlorophyll a values which are detailed in the si when examining frequencies clear distinctions arose between annual and monthly results monthly frequencies of total potential bloom frequency showed clear seasonality with more frequent blooms during the wet season and less frequent blooms during the dry season furthermore monthly frequencies were strongly correlated across in situ and remotely sensed datasets according to kendall s tau in contrast the rankings of annual total potential bloom frequencies and in situ bloom frequencies were neither strongly nor significantly correlated in any part of lake okeechobee according to kendall s tau one potential explanation for the insignificant correlations for annual frequencies is that the signal of seasonal variation in cyanohabs observed in the monthly frequencies was flattened by aggregating frequencies across all months in a wy the flattening of strong seasonal patterns in cyanohab frequency was especially evident in the northern portion of lake okeechobee wherein the northwest and northeast quadrants respectively yielded negligible and weak insignificant kendall s tau values in the annual frequencies but strong and significant tau values in the monthly data alternatively the southern quadrants yielded moderate albeit insignificant kendall s tau values in both the annual and monthly frequencies the rankings of satellite derived monthly frequencies in our dataset differ from monthly bloom frequencies previously reported for lake okeechobee using in situ sampling data from 1980 to 1992 havens et al 1994 observed bloom frequencies based on the 40 µg l threshold were greatest from may through june and august through december in contrast the month of december yielded some of the lowest frequencies in both the in situ and remotely sensed data in our study furthermore july was excluded from the list of months with frequent blooms in havens et al 1994 but experienced the most frequent blooms according to the satellite imagery dataset and tied for third most frequent according to the in situ dataset in our study differences in frequencies could be due to the inclusion of different monitoring sites for calculating bloom frequencies different time scales for data aggregation 13 years vs five years and possible changes to the lake itself given the over twenty year time span between the two studies our results revealed a general trend in the southern quadrants wherein the remotely sensed total potential bloom frequencies were often larger than the in situ bloom frequencies a pattern not observed in the northern quadrants as mentioned in the results this was largely because many in situ frequencies in the southern portion of lake okeechobee were 0 meaning there were no chlorophyll a samples larger than 40 µg l increased sampling should bias resulting frequencies to be higher havens et al 1994 however the southwest and southeast quadrants respectively contained the fewest sampling stations one and the most sampling stations four thus it is particularly interesting that the in situ frequencies would miss bloom events as compared to the satellite imagery indicating that the distinction is not solely due to the number of in situ stations used and accordingly the number of observations available for our analysis while our study focused on frequency previous magnitude and spatial extent studies have included lake okeechobee in a study using satellite imagery from 2003 to 2011 mishra et al 2019 found that lake okeechobee experienced blooms that were relatively high in magnitude yet relatively low in spatial extent it is possible therefore that the variation in the spatial extent of cyanohabs would cause them to be missed by in situ sampling stations some stations in the southern region of lake okeechobee were located around the near shore zone along the southern edge of the lake where cyanobacteria are less likely to form due to competition with submerged aquatic vegetation havens and gawlik 2005 this observation is supported by our examination of total potential bloom frequencies from the aggregated july data which showed exceptionally high disparities between in situ and remotely sensed frequencies while poor correlations between in situ and remotely sensed frequencies may be improved by incorporating monitoring stations that were excluded from our study the disparity also highlights the benefits of coupling in situ data with remote sensing for cyanohab monitoring the spatial continuity of satellite observations allowed for the expansion of monitoring beyond in situ locations allowing for more information about bloom location without increasing in situ monitoring costs for managers the benefits of expanding in situ cyanohab frequency monitoring with satellite remote sensing were especially evident in our analysis of blooms located near the s 308 outlet we examined frequencies near s 308 at multiple spatial and temporal scales the spatial scales we examined were within the northeast quadrant wherein s 308 is located and within the aoi which directly surrounded s 308 the temporal scales varied across the two spatial scales for the northeastern quadrant we examined frequencies across aggregated remote sensing data for wys and months for the aoi we examined frequencies across each individual month of our study period furthermore all satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies near s 308 were in some form compared to in situ data northeastern quadrant frequencies were compared to the corresponding bloom frequencies across both timescales whereas aoi frequencies were compared to individual chlorophyll a grab samples at s 308 in examining frequencies within the northeast quadrant little inter annual variation was observed in total potential bloom frequencies revealing cyanohabs were not exceptionally frequent in years with states of emergency in the st lucie it is possible however that the signal of inter wy variability was flattened by calculating frequencies with data from the entire wy and not separating out by season months this is supported by the high intra annual bloom variability revealed in the monthly total potential bloom frequencies in the northeast quadrant where blooms were absent in the dry season and very frequent in the peak wet season monthly total potential bloom frequencies were highly and significantly correlated with the in situ bloom frequencies indicating both datasets adequately capture interannual variability accordingly while aoi total potential bloom frequencies were not directly compared to in situ bloom frequencies we assumed aoi frequencies broken down by month would be representative of actual cyanohabs occurring near s 308 when frequencies were spatially and temporally focused to the aoi on a per month time step and compared to flow clearer patterns distinguishing years with and without states of emergency were revealed in the aoi frequencies patterns reflected in the northeastern monthly frequencies remained with highly frequent blooms occurring near s 308 in each wet season of the study period while frequent cyanohabs occurred in each year of our study high frequency blooms only aligned with high discharges at s 308 in years with states of emergency wy 2017 and wy 2019 occurrences of frequent blooms in the aoi did not always align with in situ grab samples exceeding the 40 µg l bloom threshold but such instances are possibly due to in situ grab samples representing the chlorophyll at s 308 at a given instant whereas the satellite derived frequencies represented monthly total potential bloom frequencies across a comparatively large area the in situ chlorophyll a measurements at s 308 did not reveal a definitive distinction between years with and without states of emergency when compared to flow while instances of in situ sample collection at s 308 only aligned with high discharges to the st lucie during wys 2017 and 2019 instances were isolated and surrounded by either low flow or low chlorophyll a observations accordingly these isolated observations cannot be used to independently explain relationships between blooms forming near s 308 and extreme downstream cyanohabs however the occurrences of extreme downstream habs support the findings from the satellite imagery wherein more frequent blooms in the aoi aligned with high discharge rates only during years with states of emergency for downstream cyanohabs a trend not observed in years without states of emergency our results for the wy 2017 and wy 2019 states of emergency align with observations from studies that have focused on previous severe blooms in the st lucie estuary and connections with discharges from s 308 in 2005 a cyanobacterial bloom formed in the st lucie following a period of heavy rainfall and discharges from lake okeechobee during this bloom elevated chlorophyll a concentrations 50 µg l were located along the south fork of the st lucie estuary which receives water from the c 44 canal phlips et al 2012 the 2005 bloom event in the inner st lucie also aligned with lake wide cyanobacterial blooms and near freshwater salinities within the estuary phlips et al 2020 wan et al 2012 implemented a hydrodynamic water quality model to investigate a similar cyanobacterial bloom that occurred in the st lucie in may 2000 which also aligned with discharges from lake okeechobee and elevated chlorophyll a near s 308 during the 2000 bloom high flushing rates in the south fork of the st lucie which should have limited phytoplankton growth aligned with high chlorophyll a concentrations wan et al 2012 concluded that the presence of phytoplankton despite high flushing rates from lake okeechobee releases supported claims by phlips et al 2012 that cyanobacteria are allochthonous in the st lucie estuary while these studies focused on conditions in the st lucie rather than those in lake okeechobee as our study did each cites evidence of in lake cyanohabs timed with discharges it is likely therefore that releases when timed with frequent cyanohabs contribute to downstream blooms given the trends observed in the data relative to when the states of emergency occurred other likely factors contributing to severe blooms in the st lucie have been identified the high discharge rates in the first three years of our study period were a result of extreme rainfall and tropical storms in south florida krimsky et al 2018 phlips et al 2020 accordingly high discharges were made as a necessary safety precaution under the lors 2008 the lake okeechobee regulation schedule in place during our study period considering increased precipitation drove the need for scheduled releases discharges likely aligned with increased basin runoff to the st lucie similar conditions in precipitation and runoff were observed for the 2005 st lucie cyanohab event which followed a series of five hurricanes in south florida from 2004 to 2005 phlips et al 2020 freshwater inputs to the st lucie from lake okeechobee and surface runoff are known to decrease the salinity within the estuary cerp recover team 2020 furthermore phlips et al 2012 observed a negative correlation between salinity and nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus indicating that increased freshwater inputs to the estuary can both lower salinities and increase nutrient availability rosen et al 2017 found that cyanobacteria from lake okeechobee can tolerate brackish salinities up to 18 psu for several days but increased salinity exposure led to cell membrane depreciation and increased cyanotoxin releases together the discharges and runoff concurrent with the states of emergency in wys 2017 and 2019 may have lowered the salinity in the estuary and raised nutrient concentrations to support the cyanobacterial blooms which typically proliferate in freshwater further examination of downstream in situ data is needed to confirm the extent to which other factors contributed to the proliferation of downstream cyanobacterial blooms the st lucie estuary example illustrates how satellite remote sensing serves as a powerful source of information that can be used to inform managers tasked with scheduling water releases our examination of cyanohab frequencies on multiple spatial and temporal scales indicate that monthly rather than annual frequencies are more informative in examining historical cyanohabs in reservoirs in addition to having better alignment with observed in situ frequencies the monthly satellite derived frequencies revealed intra annual variability that was flattened in the annual frequency data while annual frequencies have value in understanding overall long term trends in waterbodies coffer et al 2021 they offered little information regarding the states of emergency examined in our analysis a finer temporal scale could be used to assess cyanohab frequencies e g biweekly or weekly if daily images were to be used to form a timelier monitoring and warning system regarding key bloom position across reservoirs e g the aoi near s 308 implemented in our study but data availability may pose limitations due to cloud cover and satellite flyover rates in examining the monthly frequencies in the aoi we established a methodology that could be used to assess cyanobacteria transport potential across interconnected hydrologic systems for example copetti et al 2021 observed transport of cyanobacterial biomass and associated toxins from a reservoir across irrigation tanks coincident with in reservoir cyanohabs which may potentially accumulate in resulting produce lee et al 2017 other reservoirs in the southern united states wherein the spatial distributions of cyanohab frequency have been studied demonstrated frequent blooms in the upper reaches of reservoirs rather than near major water control structures ignatius et al 2022 however because water intake locations can be located at other locations within a reservoir examination of cyanohab frequency using methods proposed in our study may help assess biomass hydrologic transport across systems 5 conclusions our study demonstrates how in situ monitoring of cyanohabs can be complemented by satellite remote sensing of cyanohabs by examining cyanohab frequencies across in situ and remotely sensed data and how to account for error between remotely sensed and in situ data when monitoring blooms in an individual reservoir through examining annual and monthly cyanohab frequencies it was revealed that there was weak alignment in remotely sensed and in situ annual frequencies yet strong alignment in monthly frequencies between the two datasets for the northern half of lake okeechobee ultimately this disparity indicates that examining annual frequencies may flatten seasonal variation in cyanohabs and frequencies should rather be considered on finer timescales due to limited in situ sampling our study further exhibits how monthly cyanohab frequency monitoring can be bolstered by the inclusion of remotely sensed data the frequency portion of our analysis demonstrated how to use remotely sensed data to identify where more in situ monitoring may be needed in a waterbody based on consistently higher frequency estimates from satellite imagery in the southern portion of the lake in the flow portion of our analysis we demonstrated how to use remote sensing to expand monitoring at a single location to a small region in our study of lake okeechobee and potential cyanobacteria export to the st lucie estuary expanding cyanobacteria monitoring from s 308 to the aoi revealed cyanohabs were frequent near s 308 when large quantities of water were discharged into the st lucie only in state of emergency years a pattern not evident from in situ data alone illustrating how satellite monitoring can bolster in situ data to understand otherwise elusive processes our findings advance the field of hydrology in highlighting the potential for cyanobacterial biomass to transport across systems when frequent blooms near reservoir discharge locations occur during high flow discharge events although there are sources of error and uncertainty in employing satellite imagery for cyanohab monitoring it serves as a powerful tool for expanding monitoring regimes with relatively low cost to resource managers and provides greater

2085,cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs in reservoirs can be transported to downstream waters via scheduled discharges transport dynamics are difficult to capture in traditional cyanohab monitoring which can be spatially disparate and temporally discontinuous the introduction of satellite remote sensing for cyanohab monitoring provides opportunities to detect where cyanohabs occur in relation to reservoir release locations like canal inlets the study objectives were to assess 1 differences in reservoir cyanohab frequencies as determined by in situ and remotely sensed data and 2 the feasibility of using satellite imagery to identify conditions associated with release driven cyanohab export as a representative case lake okeechobee and the st lucie estuary florida usa which receives controlled releases from lake okeechobee were examined both systems are impacted by cyanohabs and the st lucie estuary experienced states of emergency for extreme cyanohabs in 2016 and 2018 using the european space agency s sentinel 3 olci imagery processed with the cyanobacteria index cicyano cyanohab frequencies across lake okeechobee from may 2016 april 2021 were compared to frequencies from in situ data strong agreement was observed in frequency rankings between the in situ and remotely sensed data in capturing intra annual variability in bloom frequencies across lake okeechobee kendall s tau 0 85 p value 0 0002 whereas no alignment was observed when evaluating inter annual variation kendall s tau 0 p value 1 further remotely sensed observations revealed that cyanohabs were highly frequent near the inlet to the canal connecting lake okeechobee to the st lucie estuary in state of emergency years a pattern not evident from in situ data alone this study demonstrates how remote sensing can complement traditional cyanohab monitoring to inform reservoir release decision making keywords cyanobacteria satellite remote sensing reservoir management water quality monitoring sentinel 3 lake okeechobee st lucie estuary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs are a pressing issue in fresh waterbodies having the potential for health consequences when they form as the predominant bloom formers in freshwater ecosystems cyanobacteria are often associated with ecological and human health risk the growth and decay of cyanohabs can lead to hypoxic and anoxic conditions in the water column resulting in the death of fish and benthic invertebrates food web imbalances and loss of biological diversity burkholder et al 2018 kenneth and dortch 2008 furthermore various cyanobacteria can produce toxins harmful to mammals including hepatotoxins which affect the liver dermatoxins which affect the skin and neurotoxins which affect the nervous system burkholder et al 2018 ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 cyanobacteria proliferate in nutrient enriched waters with long residence times making managed reservoirs vulnerable to cyanohab occurrence paerl et al 2018 the formation of blooms in reservoirs creates the opportunity for cyanobacteria to be transported to downstream systems when water is released there have been reports of cyanohabs occurring in brackish waters due to transport from upstream freshwater reservoirs in large estuarine systems across maryland north carolina florida and california paerl et al 2018 cyanohab transport has also been reported between reservoir systems and infrastructure systems such as irrigation tanks when source waters were coincident with in reservoir cyanohabs copetti et al 2021 with continued global warming and eutrophication the presence of cyanohabs and increases in magnitude extent and frequency of cyanohab occurrence are anticipated paerl et al 2016 thus also increasing the potential for blooms to be transported to downstream waters as a function of reservoir management understanding the connections between cyanohabs forming in reservoirs and potential transport to downstream waters is challenging due to the spatial and temporal disparities in hydrologic and cyanohab monitoring data availability for many managed reservoirs continual gauge and flow data are available at discharge locations u s geological survey 2021 because field sampling of cyanobacteria is expensive and time intensive traditional long term monitoring practices typically consist of seasonal monthly or twice monthly water samples at a few locations across a waterbody papenfus et al 2020 traditional in situ monitoring data can provide long term insights into typical cyanohab conditions siders and havens 2020 and detailed data regarding many water quality parameters known to influence cyanohabs however the spatial and temporal resolutions of discrete in situ cyanobacteria data are often too disparate and discontinuous for characterizing cyanohab dynamics in relation to reservoir water releases and associated hydrologic data consequently the potential for reservoir releases to export cyanohabs to downstream waters remains poorly characterized the introduction of satellite remote sensing has provided data complimentary to in situ monitoring practices that can address gaps in our understanding of how reservoir releases may export cyanohabs to downstream waters there are many algorithms for quantifying chlorophyll a biomass detected in waterbodies using satellite imagery seegers et al 2018 some of which are specific to cyanobacteria in inland waters seegers et al 2021 despite certain limitations due to pixel resolution revisit time algorithm uncertainty and cloud coverage satellite imagery can provide data for cyanohab detection at regular temporal intervals that is more spatially continuous than field monitoring practices without significant added costs for field managers greater spatial continuity in cyanohab observations provided via satellite imagery could enable managers to visualize and understand where blooms are concentrated within a reservoir insights from which could directly inform management decisions for example satellite imagery could reveal whether cyanohabs are concentrated near a primary discharge point resulting in a manager potentially deciding to postpone releasing water until the bloom has dissipated or migrated to another region of the reservoir the efficacy of using satellite imagery to examine cyanohabs on a regional and national scale has been adequately demonstrated clark et al 2017 coffer et al 2020 coffer et al 2021 and has been applied to individual systems across the united states to complement in situ monitoring of cyanobacteria little work however has connected satellite remote sensing of cyanohabs to hydrologic data testing whether cyanohab observations collected via satellite remote sensing could prove useful for informing reservoir release decisions and mitigating bloom export to downstream waters to address this knowledge gap and better understand in reservoir bloom dynamics during extreme downstream bloom events our study supplemented historical in situ data with satellite derived cyanohab estimates to better understand bloom dynamics with respect to reservoir release decisions this study had two objectives 1 to assess the differences between in situ and remotely sensed cyanohab observations and understand the impacts of differences between the spatial and temporal resolutions of monitoring on cyanohab frequencies and 2 to assess the feasibility of using satellite remote sensing to identify conditions associated with cyanobacteria export based on historical extreme cyanohab events in our study extreme historical events were downstream cyanohabs associated with issued states of emergency specifically where downstream cyanohabs were attributed to transport of cyanobacteria blooming in upstream reservoirs lake okeechobee and the st lucie estuary in south florida usa are connected systems impacted by recurrent cyanohabs and were used as a representative study area for this analysis cyanohabs forming in the st lucie can be severe with states of emergency issued in the summers of 2016 and 2018 krimsky et al 2018 such events are widely attributed to waters discharged from lake okeechobee krimsky et al 2018 where cyanobacteria proliferate havens et al 1996 havens and gawlik 2005 paerl and scott 2010 however claims regarding relationships between recent cyanohabs within the st lucie and water releases are anecdotal creating a compelling opportunity to identify whether the use of satellite remote sensing could provide fresh insights to this historical management challenge 2 methods 2 1 study area south florida has a sub tropical climate with two predominate seasons the rainy season comprising may through october and the dry season comprising november through april phlips et al 2012 accordingly the florida water year wy is defined as may through april julian and osborne 2018 fully encompassing both wet and dry seasons each wy is refenced by the calendar year in which it ends the states of emergency issued for cyanohabs in the st lucie the summers of 2016 and 2018 therefore occurred in wy 2017 and wy 2019 due to data availability our study period spanned wy 2017 through wy 2021 may 1 2016 april 30 2021 water released from lake okeechobee is primarily discharged to the caloosahatchee estuary to the west and secondarily to the st lucie estuary to the east fig 1 during our study period lake discharges were primarily driven by flood prevention according to the 2008 lake okeechobee regulation schedule lake okeechobee has three dominant ecological zones the littoral zone along the western edge the near shore zone by the littoral zone to the west and along the southern edge of the lake and the pelagic zone in the central and eastern portions of the lake to account for ecological zones and the location of different inlets and outlets we examined the lake by dividing it into quadrants northwest northeast southwest and southeast fig 2 more information regarding the quadrants lake hydrology and ecology and the st lucie estuary system can be found in the supplemental information si 2 2 satellite imagery we used sentinel 3 ocean and land colour instrument olci data to detect cyanohabs across lake okeechobee olci images have a 300 m spatial resolution and there are two sentinel 3 satellites a and b each with a 2 3 day return period sentinel 3a was launched in 2016 with the first images available april 2016 and sentinel 3b in 2018 with the first images available may 2018 we included data from both satellites in this analysis the entire analysis including satellite image analysis and production of thematic maps was done in r and rstudio r core team 2021 a code repository is available at https github com nvontress lok frequencies the olci images we used in this analysis were processed by the nasa ocean biology processing group obpg https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov projects cyan according to the descriptions in seegers et al 2021 using the cyanobacteria index cicyano algorithm from the cyanobacteria assessment network cyan schaeffer et al 2015 preliminary processing by the obpg was conducted in seadas wherein the olci level 1b top of atmosphere signal was corrected for rayleigh scattering quality assurance masks were applied for cloud cover sun glint land and mixed land water pixels the cicyano algorithm was applied and composite images were generated seegers et al 2021 wynne et al 2018 we used weekly composite cyan images in our analysis to limit the impacts of cloud cover in our calculations the ci algorithm was first developed by wynne et al 2008 to approximate cyanobacterial abundance in inland lakes clark et al 2017 wynne et al 2010 such that 1 ci s s λ and 2 s s λ ρ s λ ρ s λ ρ s λ ρ s λ λ λ λ λ where ci is the cyanobacteria index ss λ is the spectral shape ss at a given wavelength λ and ρ is the rayleigh corrected top of atmosphere reflectance ci is calculated at ss 681 using eq 2 where λ is 681 nm λ is 665 nm and λ is 709 nm the algorithm was later updated from ci to cicyano by lunetta et al 2015 to incorporate phycocyanin presence and thus prevent false positives from chlorophyll a containing organisms aside from cyanobacteria wynne et al 2013 cyanobacterial identification with phycocyanin presence was accomplished by applying ss 665 as filter where positive ss 665 values indicate the presence of cyanobacteria whereas the negative ss 665 values indicate the absence of cyanobacteria ss 665 is calculated using eq 2 but with respective λ λ and λ values of 665 nm 620 nm and 681 nm the two spectral shapes together were used to differentiate non cyanobacterial taxa from cyanobacteria because ss 681 is sensitive to the light scattering and lower fluorescence signal unique to cyanobacterial populations wynne et al 2008 and ss 665 is sensitive to phycocyanin s response at 620 nm lunetta et al 2015 remotely sensed and in situ observations of cyanohabs are reported in different units of measurement i e cicyano vs chlorophyll a respectively and across different spatial scales i e continuous 300 m pixels vs discrete grab sample locations to analyze differences between the two datasets we categorized all detected cicyano values into three classifications that could be used for one to one comparisons bloom possible bloom and no bloom the florida department of environmental protection fdep uses chlorophyll a concentration as an indicator for cyanohabs within lake okeechobee designating that bloom forming algae are considered a bloom at chlorophyll a concentrations above 40 µg l havens et al 1994 because bloom forming algal populations within the lake are often dominated by cyanobacteria we applied the 40 µg l threshold as an indicator for cyanohabs fdep 2001 classification ranges were determined by applying an uncertainty range around the 40 µg l threshold using error metrics from a cicyano to chlorophyll a conversion the conversion we used to estimate chlorophyll a from cicyano data was reported in tomlinson et al 2016 and developed using data specifically from florida lakes eq 3 3 chla 4050 271 c i cyano 20 3 where chla represents chlorophyll a in µg l while eq 3 was initially developed using ci not cicyano it was calibrated with cyanobacteria dominated waters and demonstrated for chlorophyll a estimation from cicyano in seegers et al 2021 we defined the uncertainty range i e the range of possible bloom values detected in the satellite imagery using error metrics reported in seegers et al 2021 calculated using matchups of cicyano chlorophyll a estimates from eq 3 and in situ chlorophyll a measurements seegers et al 2021 used national data to calculate error metrics not just data from florida lakes reporting log transformed bias biaslog eq 4 and mean absolute error maelog eq 5 biaslog and maelog were calculated for different ranges of in situ chlorophyll a concentrations according to trophic state we implemented the error metrics seegers et al 2021 reported for the hypereutrophic range 30 90 µg l which contained the 40 µg l bloom threshold for lake okeechobee applying the maelog as the uncertainty range surrounding the bloom threshold maelog rather than an algorithm confidence interval was used to quantify uncertainty because maelog is less sensitive to outliers in non normally distributed data like chlorophyll a seegers et al 2018 4 bia s log 10 i 1 n log 10 y i log 10 x i n 5 ma e log 10 i 1 n log 10 y i log 10 x i n in eqs 4 and 5 yi represents each remotely sensed chlorophyll a estimate xi represents each corresponding in situ chlorophyll a samle and n represents the total number of samples because all observations were log transformed to account for the non normal distribution of chlorophyll a data and the final metrics back transformed from the log scale biaslog and maelog are multiplicative error e g a biaslog of 1 1 would indicate 10 bias a biaslog of 0 9 would indicate 10 bias and a maelog of 1 1 would indicate 10 mean absolute error for the national data the maelog for eq 3 was 1 3 meaning the mae was 30 error between the national in situ measures and the cicyano derived chlorophyll a estimates seegers et al 2021 to address misfit between in situ and satellite derived chlorophyll a values we chose to apply the maelog reported in seegers et al 2021 rather than those calculated for lake okeechobee section 2 3 as the uncertainty range around the bloom threshold because it provided a more conservative estimate of possible bloom values due to the larger sample size and smaller resulting possible bloom range section 3 1 maelog was applied as an uncertainty range around the 40 µg l bloom threshold resulting classification ranges can be found in table 1 all classification thresholds were then converted from chlorophyll a values to cicyano values using eq 3 thresholds were then directly applied to the cicyano imagery to assign pixels to the bloom possible bloom and no bloom classifications we additionally included pixels with observations falling below the cicyano algorithm detection limit in the no bloom classification missing and masked values due to cloud cover sun glint land presence and vegetation seegers et al 2021 wynne et al 2018 were excluded from the analysis seegers et al 2021 reported biaslog for the hypereutrophic range as 1 16 for eq 3 meaning bias observed in the national data was 16 while we did not adjust the classification thresholds according to bias when classifying the cicyano images it is important to recognize as a possible source of error in the remotely sensed dataset 2 3 in situ chlorophyll a data we used chlorophyll a samples from the south florida water management district sfwmd dbhydro environmental database sfwmd 2021 lake okeechobee had 36 active water quality stations with monthly occasionally twice monthly sampling for in situ chlorophyll a observations at the end of our study period however many active in situ monitoring stations were initiated mid way through our study period thus stations used in our study were selected based on data availability with the condition of having no more than one month of missing data from wy 2017 through wy 2021 resulting in 14 stations across the lake we then omitted sampling sites located on or directly next to mixed land water pixels urquhart and schaeffer 2020 removing four additional stations in total ten chlorophyll a monitoring stations across lake okeechobee were used three of which were in the northwest quadrant two in the northeast quadrant one in the southwest quadrant and four in the southeast quadrant fig 2 chlorophyll a field samples consisted of surface grab samples collected within the top half meter of the water column by sfwmd south florida water management district 2021 chlorophyll a values were determined using method 447 0 which uses high performance liquid chromatography hplc at 440 nm to detect chlorophyll a and b pigments in freshwater and marine algae arar 1997 we classified the in situ data into bloom chlorophyll a 40 µg l and no bloom chlorophyll a 40 µg l based on the bloom threshold for lake okeechobee we also calculated maelog and biaslog between the in situ samples and same day chlorophyll a satellite imagery estimates 2 4 bloom frequency analysis 2 4 1 frequency calculations we examined frequencies of the satellite imagery classifications bloom possible bloom and no bloom and the in situ classifications bloom and no bloom across two time groups wy and month and five spatial boundaries lake okeechobee and each of its quadrants frequencies were analyzed by wy to determine whether cyanohabs were more frequent in wys with states of emergency wy 2017 and wy 2019 and by month to observe seasonal trends of cyanohab frequency and compare to previously reported trends determined from in situ observations all data were aggregated across time groupings so wy data included observations aggregated from may through april for each year and monthly data included observations aggregated from wy2017 through wy2021 for each month for the satellite imagery we calculated frequency for each classification spatial boundary i e quadrant or entire lake and time group combination by dividing the number of pixels in a given classification by the total number of valid pixels i e all classified pixels excluding missing values within a spatial boundary during the time group of interest fig 3 frequencies for in situ data were similarly calculated where the frequency for a given classification spatial boundary and time group was equal to the number of observations within a classification divided by the total number of grab samples taken within the spatial boundary and time group fig 3 all resulting frequencies were converted to percent to ensure the merging of sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b into weekly composites did not artificially inflate annual frequencies following the launch of sentinel 3b in wy 2019 we also examined frequencies from daily images which indicated sentinel 3b s launch had a negligible effect on the resulting annual frequencies more information regarding this analysis can be found in the si 2 4 2 comparing bloom frequencies from satellite remote sensing and in situ data we compared the in situ frequency of the bloom classification to the remotely sensed total potential bloom frequency by conducting a two tailed kendall s tau b correlation test hereon kendall s tau kendall s tau is a non parametric rank based correlation coefficient that is robust in handling tied data and is good for small non normal datasets akoglu 2018 remotely sensed frequencies were distilled into two classifications total potential bloom frequency being the combined bloom and possible bloom frequencies and no bloom frequency to allow for comparison to the in situ data which had only two classifications kendall s tau across no bloom classifications was not examined more information on kendall s tau can be found in the si 2 5 flow analysis 2 5 1 flow data flow exiting lake okeechobee is monitored at several sites for this study we focused on s 308 which is a lock and dam water control structure that discharges to the c 44 canal connecting lake okeechobee to the st lucie estuary fig 1 continual flow and gauge data were obtained from the u s geological survey at s 308 site number 02276877 from 2016 through 2020 reported in fifteen minute increments 2 5 2 area of influence to understand the connections between cyanohabs occurring within the lake and states of emergency being issued in the st lucie estuary an area of influence aoi was calculated encompassing a small region of lake okeechobee surrounding s 308 the aoi represents the area of lake okeechobee from which water released at s 308 originates and therefore is likely to contribute any cyanobacteria transported to downstream waters exact calculation methods are located in the si 2 5 3 comparing discharge rate to satellite imagery for every month throughout the study period we calculated the total potential bloom frequency i e frequency of bloom frequency of the possible bloom categories within the aoi based on the satellite imagery to understand bloom dynamics near the lake outlet with respect to flow at s 308 percentiles of the resulting total potential bloom frequencies were calculated to examine how often the aoi experienced frequent blooms in comparison to the aggregated monthly total potential bloom frequencies across the entire lake a time series plot was constructed comparing flow at s 308 with the total potential bloom frequency within the aoi to determine whether more information regarding bloom dynamics in years with and without states of emergency could be gathered than by in situ data alone chlorophyll a measurements from s 308 throughout the study period were also incorporated into the time series to examine information available from in situ alone as compared to information from total potential bloom frequencies 3 results 3 1 comparing satellite imagery and in situ cyanohab monitoring 3 1 1 in situ to remotely sensed chlorophyll a comparisons we had 78 matchups of in situ and remotely sensed chlorophyll a observations from lake okeechobee 16 of which had in situ measurements within the hypereutrophic range as defined by seegers et al 2021 maelog and biaslog were calculated for the full range of lake okeechobee values as well as for just the hypereutrophic range table 2 the full range of in situ observations for lake okeechobee was relatively small 3 86 µg l when compared to the range of chlorophyll a data presented in seegers et al 0 700 µg l 2021 based on the summary statistics for the full range of data both the lake okeechobee dataset and national dataset experienced high maelog which were respectively 2 2 120 error and 1 8 80 error the lake okeechobee data had a high positive bias of 1 6 63 whereas the national dataset had high positive bias of 1 33 33 within the hypereutrophic range 30 90 µg l the maelog for lake okeechobee was 1 8 80 error and the biaslog was 0 55 45 like the national response the data from lake okeechobee showed closer alignment between in situ chlorophyll a samples and remotely sensed chlorophyll a estimates in the hypereutrophic range than in the overall dataset unlike the national dataset however the lake okeechobee specific data showed negative rather than positive biaslog in the hypereutrophic range the poorer overall performance of the lake okeechobee data when compared to the national dataset could be due to the smaller sample size of available data or the high baseline response observed in the lake okeechobee satellite response fig 4 in situ and remotely sensed data are subject to error and matchups therefore should not be expected to perfectly fit a one to one regression papenfus et al 2020 3 1 2 comparison of annual and monthly in situ and remotely sensed frequencies annual frequencies calculated from remotely sensed and in situ observations were neither strongly correlated tau 0 5 nor statistically significant p value 0 05 across lake okeechobee or any of its quadrants table 3 kendall s tau across the whole lake was 0 meaning the rankings of total potential bloom frequencies as determined by the satellite imagery completely varied from the bloom frequencies from the in situ data despite differences in rankings there was not much inter wy variability in bloom frequency across lake okeechobee within each dataset with total potential bloom frequency from the remotely sensed data ranging from 3 3 to 12 7 and the bloom frequency from the in situ data ranging from 1 7 to 11 3 fig 5 for most wys the difference between total potential bloom frequency and in situ bloom frequency pairs was less than 5 the least similar frequencies across the two datasets occurred in wy 2019 where the in situ bloom frequency was 1 7 and the satellite derived total potential bloom frequency was 12 7 across lake okeechobee similar to the frequencies across the entire lake there was a large disparity between the in situ bloom frequencies and satellite derived total potential bloom frequency in wy 2019 in every quadrant wherein the satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies were consistently greater than the in situ bloom frequencies fig 5 the greatest differences occurred in the northeast and southwest quadrants where the in situ bloom frequency was 0 while the respective total potential bloom frequencies from the satellite imagery were 11 8 and 14 5 while there were other instances of large disparities in the annual quadrant frequencies 5 annual frequency difference between the two datasets wy 2019 was the only wy in which the remotely sensed data consistently yielded higher frequency estimates than the in situ data for other large disparities there was a more even division between which dataset yielded the larger frequency estimate the in situ frequencies exceeded the satellite derived frequency estimates by more than 5 twice in the northwest quadrant in wy 2017 and the northeast quadrant in wy 2020 and the satellite derived frequencies exceeded the in situ frequency estimates by more than 5 three times in the northwest quadrant in wy 2020 and in the southwest quadrant in wy 2020 and wy 2021 the more even division in which dataset yielded the higher frequency across other wys of our study indicates that the large disparity observed in the wy 2019 frequencies is not due solely to error or bias in the satellite imagery estimates unlike the annual frequencies the monthly frequencies calculated using the remote sensing and in situ datasets across lake okeechobee were strongly correlated with a kendall s tau value of 0 85 and a p value far less than 0 05 indicating agreement in intra annual variability in frequencies determined from the two datasets the monthly trends in both data sets reveal more frequent blooms in the peak of the wet season june through august in the satellite data and june through october in the in situ data and less frequent blooms in the dry season fig 6 the greatest difference in frequencies occurred in the aggregated data for july where the satellite derived total potential bloom frequency was 31 5 and the in situ bloom frequency was 10 yielding a difference of 21 5 august also experienced a large disparity between the two datasets with respective total potential bloom frequencies and in situ frequencies of 17 9 and 11 7 yielding a difference of 6 3 as in the annual frequencies however all other disparities between the two datasets were within 5 of each other when broken down by quadrants both the remote sensing and in situ monthly frequencies indicated blooms more frequently occur in the northern half of lake okeechobee than in the southern half fig 6 kendall s tau for the northwest and northeast quadrants were both 0 68 with respective p values of 0 003 and 0 005 indicating strong alignment between the satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies and in situ data while there were multiple ties in the in situ monthly frequencies of the northern quadrants when the bloom frequency was 0 across many dry season months these ties coincided with extremely low total potential bloom frequencies in the remotely sensed data the monthly frequencies across the two datasets in the southern portion of the lake were moderately but not significantly correlated with respective kendall s tau values of 0 33 and 0 4 and respective p values of 0 2 and 0 1 in the southwest and southeast quadrants the satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies were consistently higher than the in situ estimates for almost all months with the only exceptions being october and november in the southeast quadrant this disparity is largely due to the large number of ties i e equally ranked frequencies from the in situ dataset with ten ties in the southwestern quadrant s in situ bloom frequencies and eight in the southeastern quadrant s wherein the in situ bloom frequency was 0 like the northern half of the lake most ties in the in situ bloom frequencies occur when the satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies are also very low 5 the key exception occurred in july when in situ frequencies for both the southern quadrants were 0 yet remote sensing total potential bloom frequencies were respectively 30 2 and 24 4 in the southwest and southeast quadrants some of the highest of all twelve months this contrast indicates that the location of in situ monitoring stations or timing of sampling runs missed bloom events in the southern portion of lake okeechobee during our study period meaning in situ samples were taken during the 70 75 of the time when blooms were not occuring in the southern quadrants 3 2 identifying bloom conditions associated with export events 3 2 1 area of influence the maximum calculated aoi encompassed 4 8 km2 of lake okeechobee and had a radius of 1 502 m representing the region of lake okeechobee likely to contribute cyanobacteria when water is discharged from s 308 fig 7 a the aoi overlapped with 56 pixels within lake okeechobee used to determine the total potential frequency of blooms i e combined frequency of the possible bloom and bloom classifications within the aoi for each month from wy 2017 through wy 2021 fig 7b 3 2 2 examining frequencies with flow based on calculated total potential bloom frequencies cyanohabs routinely occurred within the aoi examining the percentiles of aoi total potential bloom frequencies revealed that the aoi experienced low total potential bloom frequencies for most months throughout the study period 70th percentile 5 6 frequency table 4 however the aoi also experienced more frequent blooms than those represented in the monthly frequencies with a maximum total potential bloom frequency within the aoi of 50 2 in comparison the highest total potential bloom frequency from the monthly data across the whole lake was 31 5 in july falling just below the 90th percentile of total potential bloom frequencies within the aoi during our study period the second highest monthly total potential bloom frequency across lake okeechobee was 22 3 in june also falling in the 80th percentile of aoi frequencies while data were compiled differently for the lake wide and aoi total potential bloom frequencies the peak lake wide monthly frequencies serve as a reference for how extreme frequencies above the 80th percentile in the aoi were as compared to the rest of lake okeechobee months wherein the aoi total potential bloom frequency was above the 80th percentile were june and july of wy 2017 july and august of wy 2018 july august september and october of wy 2019 june july and august of wy 2020 and july and august of wy 2019 despite having total potential bloom frequencies in the 80th and 90th percentiles during all five years of our study the only two years when these high frequencies coincided with high discharges from s 308 were wy 2017 and wy 2019 when the states of emergency occurred in all other years flow at s 308 was either very low or negative when the aoi experienced frequent or highly frequent cyanohabs fig 8 the patterns revealed by satellite imagery were reflected in the in situ chlorophyll a grab samples wherein the only instances of chlorophyll a grab samples at s 308 exceeding the 40 µg l threshold during periods with high discharge occurred in wy 2017 and wy 2019 however these instances were non consecutive and coupled with a same month measurement falling below the threshold possibly due to flushing or mixing in the water column making the pattern of cyanohabs aligned with high discharge rates difficult to detect from in situ data alone table 5 in contrast when looking at the remotely sensed total potential bloom frequencies within the aoi a pattern of consecutive highly frequent cyanohabs aligned with high discharges becomes much more apparent fig 8 4 discussion in this study we adapted methods of calculating cyanohab frequency with satellite imagery clark et al 2017 coffer et al 2021 to incorporate fdep chlorophyll a bloom thresholds and proposed methods for assessing cyanohab export potential in a single system using satellite remote sensing and hydrologic data in doing so novel methods of examining hydrologic in situ water quality data and satellite imagery collected across multiple time scales were established the methods presented are directly applicable to other freshwater reservoirs resolvable by sentinel 3 olci imagery furthermore methodology used to determine an aoi in reservoirs can be utilized to better determine when cyanohabs may be transported to downstream waters we used lake okeechobee and the st lucie estuary as a representative study system examining the frequency of blooms within different regions of the lake to better understand bloom dynamics and factors contributing to downstream states of emergency issued for cyanohabs we also analyzed monthly and annual bloom frequencies from satellite imagery and compared to in situ bloom monitoring by examining rank based correlation across the two datasets this research helps bridge the use of traditional in situ and satellite remote sensing for monitoring cyanohabs in individual systems although this study underlines the utility of satellite remote sensing for addressing observational data gaps and informing management limitations were also noted our study period was limited to time following the launch of sentinel 3 however the inclusion of other extreme blooms events could be helpful in better understanding the dynamics of cyanobacteria in the lake okeechobee waterway although the sentinel 3 missions did not launch until 2016 the cicyano algorithm was originally developed for esa s medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris the dataset for which spans 2002 2012 the cicyano algorithm can also be applied to nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and the datasets which can be used to examine events between the meris and olci time spans clark et al 2017 wynne et al 2021 while we used a cicyano to chlorophyll a relationship specific to florida lakes there are other published algorithms and error metrics for estimating chlorophyll a that could be applied in different systems seegers et al 2021 proposed a bootstrapped algorithm created using cicyano and in situ data from a wider variety of lakes than the algorithm published by tomlinson et al 2016 that may be better suited to systems outside the state of florida that are resolvable by sentinel 3 olci data for systems where a finer spatial resolution is required chlorophyll a algorithms for other satellites have been proposed like the sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi which has a spatial resolution of 10 m to 60 m and has been used to calculate chlorophyll a biomass in smaller systems ansper and alikas 2018 while sentinel 2 offers a finer spatial resolution it lacks the spectral resolution for detecting phycocyanin fluorescence so it cannot be used to differentiate cyanobacteria from other chlorophyll a containing biomass clark et al 2017 furthermore the combined revisit time of sentinel 2a and 2b is 5 days ansper and alikas 2018 as compared to the near daily combined revisit time of sentinel 3a and 3b satellites lunetta et al 2015 greatly reducing the number of images captured on a weekly basis in our study system there was error between in situ chlorophyll a measurements and satellite derived chlorophyll a estimates which should be accounted for when interpreting results while we adjusted for error by the bloom threshold for lake okeechobee to a range of possible bloom thresholds according to published maelog there are several possible explanations for error between remotely sensed and in situ chlorophyll a values which are detailed in the si when examining frequencies clear distinctions arose between annual and monthly results monthly frequencies of total potential bloom frequency showed clear seasonality with more frequent blooms during the wet season and less frequent blooms during the dry season furthermore monthly frequencies were strongly correlated across in situ and remotely sensed datasets according to kendall s tau in contrast the rankings of annual total potential bloom frequencies and in situ bloom frequencies were neither strongly nor significantly correlated in any part of lake okeechobee according to kendall s tau one potential explanation for the insignificant correlations for annual frequencies is that the signal of seasonal variation in cyanohabs observed in the monthly frequencies was flattened by aggregating frequencies across all months in a wy the flattening of strong seasonal patterns in cyanohab frequency was especially evident in the northern portion of lake okeechobee wherein the northwest and northeast quadrants respectively yielded negligible and weak insignificant kendall s tau values in the annual frequencies but strong and significant tau values in the monthly data alternatively the southern quadrants yielded moderate albeit insignificant kendall s tau values in both the annual and monthly frequencies the rankings of satellite derived monthly frequencies in our dataset differ from monthly bloom frequencies previously reported for lake okeechobee using in situ sampling data from 1980 to 1992 havens et al 1994 observed bloom frequencies based on the 40 µg l threshold were greatest from may through june and august through december in contrast the month of december yielded some of the lowest frequencies in both the in situ and remotely sensed data in our study furthermore july was excluded from the list of months with frequent blooms in havens et al 1994 but experienced the most frequent blooms according to the satellite imagery dataset and tied for third most frequent according to the in situ dataset in our study differences in frequencies could be due to the inclusion of different monitoring sites for calculating bloom frequencies different time scales for data aggregation 13 years vs five years and possible changes to the lake itself given the over twenty year time span between the two studies our results revealed a general trend in the southern quadrants wherein the remotely sensed total potential bloom frequencies were often larger than the in situ bloom frequencies a pattern not observed in the northern quadrants as mentioned in the results this was largely because many in situ frequencies in the southern portion of lake okeechobee were 0 meaning there were no chlorophyll a samples larger than 40 µg l increased sampling should bias resulting frequencies to be higher havens et al 1994 however the southwest and southeast quadrants respectively contained the fewest sampling stations one and the most sampling stations four thus it is particularly interesting that the in situ frequencies would miss bloom events as compared to the satellite imagery indicating that the distinction is not solely due to the number of in situ stations used and accordingly the number of observations available for our analysis while our study focused on frequency previous magnitude and spatial extent studies have included lake okeechobee in a study using satellite imagery from 2003 to 2011 mishra et al 2019 found that lake okeechobee experienced blooms that were relatively high in magnitude yet relatively low in spatial extent it is possible therefore that the variation in the spatial extent of cyanohabs would cause them to be missed by in situ sampling stations some stations in the southern region of lake okeechobee were located around the near shore zone along the southern edge of the lake where cyanobacteria are less likely to form due to competition with submerged aquatic vegetation havens and gawlik 2005 this observation is supported by our examination of total potential bloom frequencies from the aggregated july data which showed exceptionally high disparities between in situ and remotely sensed frequencies while poor correlations between in situ and remotely sensed frequencies may be improved by incorporating monitoring stations that were excluded from our study the disparity also highlights the benefits of coupling in situ data with remote sensing for cyanohab monitoring the spatial continuity of satellite observations allowed for the expansion of monitoring beyond in situ locations allowing for more information about bloom location without increasing in situ monitoring costs for managers the benefits of expanding in situ cyanohab frequency monitoring with satellite remote sensing were especially evident in our analysis of blooms located near the s 308 outlet we examined frequencies near s 308 at multiple spatial and temporal scales the spatial scales we examined were within the northeast quadrant wherein s 308 is located and within the aoi which directly surrounded s 308 the temporal scales varied across the two spatial scales for the northeastern quadrant we examined frequencies across aggregated remote sensing data for wys and months for the aoi we examined frequencies across each individual month of our study period furthermore all satellite derived total potential bloom frequencies near s 308 were in some form compared to in situ data northeastern quadrant frequencies were compared to the corresponding bloom frequencies across both timescales whereas aoi frequencies were compared to individual chlorophyll a grab samples at s 308 in examining frequencies within the northeast quadrant little inter annual variation was observed in total potential bloom frequencies revealing cyanohabs were not exceptionally frequent in years with states of emergency in the st lucie it is possible however that the signal of inter wy variability was flattened by calculating frequencies with data from the entire wy and not separating out by season months this is supported by the high intra annual bloom variability revealed in the monthly total potential bloom frequencies in the northeast quadrant where blooms were absent in the dry season and very frequent in the peak wet season monthly total potential bloom frequencies were highly and significantly correlated with the in situ bloom frequencies indicating both datasets adequately capture interannual variability accordingly while aoi total potential bloom frequencies were not directly compared to in situ bloom frequencies we assumed aoi frequencies broken down by month would be representative of actual cyanohabs occurring near s 308 when frequencies were spatially and temporally focused to the aoi on a per month time step and compared to flow clearer patterns distinguishing years with and without states of emergency were revealed in the aoi frequencies patterns reflected in the northeastern monthly frequencies remained with highly frequent blooms occurring near s 308 in each wet season of the study period while frequent cyanohabs occurred in each year of our study high frequency blooms only aligned with high discharges at s 308 in years with states of emergency wy 2017 and wy 2019 occurrences of frequent blooms in the aoi did not always align with in situ grab samples exceeding the 40 µg l bloom threshold but such instances are possibly due to in situ grab samples representing the chlorophyll at s 308 at a given instant whereas the satellite derived frequencies represented monthly total potential bloom frequencies across a comparatively large area the in situ chlorophyll a measurements at s 308 did not reveal a definitive distinction between years with and without states of emergency when compared to flow while instances of in situ sample collection at s 308 only aligned with high discharges to the st lucie during wys 2017 and 2019 instances were isolated and surrounded by either low flow or low chlorophyll a observations accordingly these isolated observations cannot be used to independently explain relationships between blooms forming near s 308 and extreme downstream cyanohabs however the occurrences of extreme downstream habs support the findings from the satellite imagery wherein more frequent blooms in the aoi aligned with high discharge rates only during years with states of emergency for downstream cyanohabs a trend not observed in years without states of emergency our results for the wy 2017 and wy 2019 states of emergency align with observations from studies that have focused on previous severe blooms in the st lucie estuary and connections with discharges from s 308 in 2005 a cyanobacterial bloom formed in the st lucie following a period of heavy rainfall and discharges from lake okeechobee during this bloom elevated chlorophyll a concentrations 50 µg l were located along the south fork of the st lucie estuary which receives water from the c 44 canal phlips et al 2012 the 2005 bloom event in the inner st lucie also aligned with lake wide cyanobacterial blooms and near freshwater salinities within the estuary phlips et al 2020 wan et al 2012 implemented a hydrodynamic water quality model to investigate a similar cyanobacterial bloom that occurred in the st lucie in may 2000 which also aligned with discharges from lake okeechobee and elevated chlorophyll a near s 308 during the 2000 bloom high flushing rates in the south fork of the st lucie which should have limited phytoplankton growth aligned with high chlorophyll a concentrations wan et al 2012 concluded that the presence of phytoplankton despite high flushing rates from lake okeechobee releases supported claims by phlips et al 2012 that cyanobacteria are allochthonous in the st lucie estuary while these studies focused on conditions in the st lucie rather than those in lake okeechobee as our study did each cites evidence of in lake cyanohabs timed with discharges it is likely therefore that releases when timed with frequent cyanohabs contribute to downstream blooms given the trends observed in the data relative to when the states of emergency occurred other likely factors contributing to severe blooms in the st lucie have been identified the high discharge rates in the first three years of our study period were a result of extreme rainfall and tropical storms in south florida krimsky et al 2018 phlips et al 2020 accordingly high discharges were made as a necessary safety precaution under the lors 2008 the lake okeechobee regulation schedule in place during our study period considering increased precipitation drove the need for scheduled releases discharges likely aligned with increased basin runoff to the st lucie similar conditions in precipitation and runoff were observed for the 2005 st lucie cyanohab event which followed a series of five hurricanes in south florida from 2004 to 2005 phlips et al 2020 freshwater inputs to the st lucie from lake okeechobee and surface runoff are known to decrease the salinity within the estuary cerp recover team 2020 furthermore phlips et al 2012 observed a negative correlation between salinity and nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus indicating that increased freshwater inputs to the estuary can both lower salinities and increase nutrient availability rosen et al 2017 found that cyanobacteria from lake okeechobee can tolerate brackish salinities up to 18 psu for several days but increased salinity exposure led to cell membrane depreciation and increased cyanotoxin releases together the discharges and runoff concurrent with the states of emergency in wys 2017 and 2019 may have lowered the salinity in the estuary and raised nutrient concentrations to support the cyanobacterial blooms which typically proliferate in freshwater further examination of downstream in situ data is needed to confirm the extent to which other factors contributed to the proliferation of downstream cyanobacterial blooms the st lucie estuary example illustrates how satellite remote sensing serves as a powerful source of information that can be used to inform managers tasked with scheduling water releases our examination of cyanohab frequencies on multiple spatial and temporal scales indicate that monthly rather than annual frequencies are more informative in examining historical cyanohabs in reservoirs in addition to having better alignment with observed in situ frequencies the monthly satellite derived frequencies revealed intra annual variability that was flattened in the annual frequency data while annual frequencies have value in understanding overall long term trends in waterbodies coffer et al 2021 they offered little information regarding the states of emergency examined in our analysis a finer temporal scale could be used to assess cyanohab frequencies e g biweekly or weekly if daily images were to be used to form a timelier monitoring and warning system regarding key bloom position across reservoirs e g the aoi near s 308 implemented in our study but data availability may pose limitations due to cloud cover and satellite flyover rates in examining the monthly frequencies in the aoi we established a methodology that could be used to assess cyanobacteria transport potential across interconnected hydrologic systems for example copetti et al 2021 observed transport of cyanobacterial biomass and associated toxins from a reservoir across irrigation tanks coincident with in reservoir cyanohabs which may potentially accumulate in resulting produce lee et al 2017 other reservoirs in the southern united states wherein the spatial distributions of cyanohab frequency have been studied demonstrated frequent blooms in the upper reaches of reservoirs rather than near major water control structures ignatius et al 2022 however because water intake locations can be located at other locations within a reservoir examination of cyanohab frequency using methods proposed in our study may help assess biomass hydrologic transport across systems 5 conclusions our study demonstrates how in situ monitoring of cyanohabs can be complemented by satellite remote sensing of cyanohabs by examining cyanohab frequencies across in situ and remotely sensed data and how to account for error between remotely sensed and in situ data when monitoring blooms in an individual reservoir through examining annual and monthly cyanohab frequencies it was revealed that there was weak alignment in remotely sensed and in situ annual frequencies yet strong alignment in monthly frequencies between the two datasets for the northern half of lake okeechobee ultimately this disparity indicates that examining annual frequencies may flatten seasonal variation in cyanohabs and frequencies should rather be considered on finer timescales due to limited in situ sampling our study further exhibits how monthly cyanohab frequency monitoring can be bolstered by the inclusion of remotely sensed data the frequency portion of our analysis demonstrated how to use remotely sensed data to identify where more in situ monitoring may be needed in a waterbody based on consistently higher frequency estimates from satellite imagery in the southern portion of the lake in the flow portion of our analysis we demonstrated how to use remote sensing to expand monitoring at a single location to a small region in our study of lake okeechobee and potential cyanobacteria export to the st lucie estuary expanding cyanobacteria monitoring from s 308 to the aoi revealed cyanohabs were frequent near s 308 when large quantities of water were discharged into the st lucie only in state of emergency years a pattern not evident from in situ data alone illustrating how satellite monitoring can bolster in situ data to understand otherwise elusive processes our findings advance the field of hydrology in highlighting the potential for cyanobacterial biomass to transport across systems when frequent blooms near reservoir discharge locations occur during high flow discharge events although there are sources of error and uncertainty in employing satellite imagery for cyanohab monitoring it serves as a powerful tool for expanding monitoring regimes with relatively low cost to resource managers and provides greater

2086,an accurate knowledge of the water and energy exchanges in the soil crop atmosphere system is critical for a precise and aware control of all agricultural operations from field management to irrigation and harvest this concern is more complex to address in heterogeneous systems with the presence of bare soil or simple grass in between the main crop in this work a two source energy water balance model is developed joining the advantages of the single source fest ewb model internal computation of surface temperature and time continuous modelling and those of two source approaches employing two surface temperatures to accurately characterize the intra pixel heterogeneity in order to validate the model results a laboratory experiment has been designed over a lysimeter with the target of obtaining partitioned estimates of evaporation and transpiration over a heterogeneous grass crop these partitioned fluxes were supported by a safe error margin in the scaling procedure less than 1 mm d the fest ewb and fest 2 ewb models were first calibrated using surface temperature obtained from thermal camera observations with roughly 1 7 c of average bias then they were validated against the partitioned estimated the single source modelling showed a consistent overestimation of the estimated transpiration by an amount roughly 20 of the average irrigation event on the other hand the two source model shows much lower 6 errors portraying more accurately the transpired water volume such an improvement in crop water consumption estimation can provide a successful reference

model parameters are calibrated through the land surface temperature lst corbari and mancini 2014b corbari et al 2015 indeed the uniqueness to this model stands in its use of the lst product while most models require it as an input and are thus constrained to its availability for model continuous running sishodia et al 2020 piles et al 2014 fest ewb has its own model equivalent parameter the representative equilibrium temperature ret that is used as a calibration variable against lst data fest ewb has already performed in a wide variety of contexts providing fairly positive results joint temperature discharge model calibration corbari and mancini 2014a high resolution et modelling paciolla et al 2021a corbari et al 2020 smart irrigation forecast corbari et al 2019 and irrigation optimization corbari and mancini 2022 in this work a new water energy balance model the fest 2 ewb is proposed as a translation of the original fest ewb model into a two source structure providing a separation of the energy fluxes for the crop and bare soil one main driver for such a step is the possibility to differentiate the contributions to the energy balance in heterogeneous areas crop temperatures have been found to be generally lower than soil temperatures in heterogeneous scenarios nieto et al 2019 bian et al 2017 and also for homogeneous crops although with a heavier dependency on the solar radiation colaizzi et al 2012 this means that when assuming one single temperature for a heterogeneous pixel e g for single source models this temperature is actually somewhere in between a cooler canopy temperature which powers plant transpiration and a warmer soil temperature which determines water evaporation from the soil by estimating total evapotranspiration with just one global temperature single source models are liable to overestimate the canopy contribution and underestimate the soil one thus a two source version of fest ewb might attain a more accurate modelling than that of the single source fest ewb model as t is a major indicator of plant water consumption this potential overestimation could lead to erroneous amplification of crop yield or irrigation requirements with consequent harvest value forecast errors or water resource waste the assessment and accuracy quantification of partitioned e and t estimates from other measurements is itself object of a quite recent interest in the scientific community li gentine et al 2019 have proposed an improved parametrization of the aerodynamic resistances alternatively the conductances of soil and canopy linking their relative weight to the transpiration fraction t et both aouade et al 2020 and aron et al 2020 have made use of either isotope tracing or sap flow observations or both which require a considerably heavy data collecting effort furthermore et partitioning has also been obtained by exploiting co2 concentration measurements commonly performed in ec stations with positive results zahn et al 2022 numerous studies have provided an intercomparison of different approaches such as the one by nelson et al 2020 whereas a full overview of the different disaggregation schemes being debated throughout the scientific community is provided in stoy et al 2019 one major driving force for this work is the possibility of testing a two source modelling structure widely discussed in the literature with the fest ewb approach independent of land surface temperature data and thus able to continuously simulate large areas without depending on satellite retrievals this practice is not very common throughout the scientific literature and most two source model applications available have been limited by the satellite overpasses or were able to conduct continuous simulations only in single points using the measurements from an autonomous radiometer the aim of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of transpiration estimates provided by a single source and two source version of the same continuously simulating energy and water balance model to validate the two source model improvements a dedicated laboratory experimental set up has been designed at the fantoli laboratory at politecnico di milano based on a lysimeter able to monitor all water fluxes in a controlled soil volume which has provided us with partitioned e and t fluxes to be compared with the model outputs 2 methodology 2 1 fest ewb the fest ewb flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation energy water balance model is a distributed energy water balance model corbari et al 2011 mancini 1990 its structure prescribes a pixel by pixel joint solution of the water mass eq 1 and energy eq 2 balance equations at each calculation step the two equations are linked by the latent heat evapotranspiration correspondence eq 3 and the solution to this system is found iteratively by searching for the surface temperature that ensures the closure of both balances 1 dsm dt wi r p e e t dz 2 rn g h s h c l s l c δ w δ t 3 l l s l c λ w ρ w e t where the first equation refers to the water mass balance and the second to the energy balance with the s and c subscripts identifying the soil and canopy components of the fluxes respectively the energy storage terms δw δt can generally be assumed negligible at low resolutions meyers and hollinger 2004 but can also be parametrized if local flux measurements are available the list of the symbols employed in eqs 1 3 and further on in the article is provided in table 1 model inputs either varying with time or fixed are highlighted in yellow whereas model outputs are marked in light green the other parameters are instead computed internally within the model the modelled surface temperature which is the result of the enforcement of the energy balance hence its name representative equilibrium temperature or ret can be used in comparison with the satellite retrieved land surface temperature lst more or less explicitly all the terms in eqs 1 3 are functions of the input soil and vegetation parameters these can be either stationary or time varying soil and terrain parameters generally belong to the former category and include descriptors of the soil water motion e g hydraulic conductivity pore size index bubbling pressure residual and saturation water contents active soil depth and geo morphological characteristic of the basin e g aspect elevation slope vegetation e g plant height vegetation fraction and leaf area index and meteorological e g rainfall incoming shortwave radiation air temperature and relative humidity parameters on the other hand mostly belong to the time varying category minimum stomatal resistance depending on the specific plant and wet soil resistance to evaporation depending on the soil type are generally assumed to be fixed with time finally all input data can be provided either as single valued or with their own spatial distribution depending on data availability the fest ewb hydrological model allows a pixel by pixel calibration differentiating the calibration parameters with a spatial heterogeneity derived from the calibration variable patterns corbari and mancini 2014a 2014b paciolla et al 2021a paciolla et al 2021b the calibration is performed pixel by pixel comparing the modelled representative equilibrium temperature ret and the remotely sensed land surface temperature lst the calibration parameters change depending on the uncertainties of the input data and on the investigated process but generally refer to the soil chiefly the soil saturation conductivity the pore size index and resistance mainly the minimum stomatal resistance and the wet soil resistance parameters for each pixel these parameters are gradually corrected staying within their physical bounds set from literature in order to minimize the average model error defined as the objective function o equation 4 4 o 1 n i 1 n ret i lst i where n stands for the total number of calibration data available the distributed approach of the calibration allows to refine the spatial heterogeneity of the calibration parameters involved as the model can only use lst information for the calibration phase and does not need flux tower data as an input energy fluxes can be used for the validation moreover since model inputs and energy fluxes measurements originate from independent sources and given the integrated nature of the model which simulates the entire water cycle calibration and validation can be performed over the same time window without the need of identifying a calibration only and a validation only period 2 2 fest 2 ewb in this work the fest 2 ewb flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation 2 source energy water balance model is presented as an extension to the original hybrid structured fest ewb model described above the main assumption is that each pixel can be split into a vegetated and a non vegetated fraction according to its vegetation fraction parameter fv fig 1 as a step forward from the original model each pixel sub area is assumed in independent thermal equilibrium with its own subsoil and atmosphere surface layer this means that the superficial temperatures at which these equilibria are reached are separate for the two sub areas and are identified as the soil temperature tsoil and the crop temperature tcrop thus the model can be classified as patch uncoupled pu meaning that the pixel sub areas are independent of each other and interact solely with the atmosphere through their own energy balance lhomme et al 2012 this is opposed to other two source schemes identifiable as layered coupled lc where the subpixel partition is horizontal rather than vertical with a lower and upper layer that influence each other in terms of energy fluxes e g the upper layer dampens the radiation reaching the lower one or this latter is the only one exchanging energy with the soil a common example of such a scheme is the two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 kustas and norman 1999b the original fest ewb energy balance equation eq 2 is split into equations 5 14 which describe two hypothetical pixels one completely bare eqs 5 9 and the other wholly vegetated eqs 10 14 5 rn soil g soil l soil h soil 6 rn soil s in 1 α r ld ε s σ t soil k 4 7 g soil g th z t soil t zero 8 l soil

t crop e a γ r a r c 14 h crop ρ c t crop t air r a with respect to the original equations the only addition concerns a slightly differentiated value for soil and canopy emissivity for longwave emitted radiation with two distinct values instead of the global one employed in the original soil energy balance a mention should be made for the soil heat flux g the surface temperature below the canopy which regulates the energy exchanges with the subsoil can be lower than the canopy temperature by more than 10 c rahman et al 2017 as this work represents a first step towards a more complete representation of complex soil canopy systems we have chosen to treat the canopy and its underlying soil surface as a single component of the energy balance i e characterised by a single radiative temperature thus approximating some energy exchange mechanisms such as the soil heat flux triple source models are being discussed in the scientific community such as 3seb burchard levine et al 2022 but represent a step beyond the scopes of this work the final pixel scenario will be somewhere in between the two extreme balances shown above the energy balances structure is such that the closure is performed both at sub pixel and global pixel level following the steps presented in equations 15 19 15 eq 5 1 f v e q 10 f v rn pixel g pixel l pixel h pixel 0 16 rn pixel rn soil 1 f v rn crop f v 17 g pixel g soil 1 f v g crop f v 18 l pixel l soil 1 f v l crop f v 19 h pixel h soil 1 f v h crop f v finally as is usual practice for two source energy balance models norman et al 1995 kustas and anderson 2009 a pixel level global representative temperature is obtained from the two subpixel temperatures this equivalent pixel level temperature which is necessary for model output interaction with outsourced satellite data is obtained from the longwave upwelling radiation balance 20 r l u p p i x e l r l u p s o i l 1 f v r l u p c r o p f v 21 ret 4 t soil 4 1 f v t crop 4 f v the overall pixel temperature is identified with the acronym ret which stands again for representative equilibrium temperature by usage similarity with the ret from fest ewb however the two critically differ from a conceptual point of view the fest ewb ret is the temperature that closes the energy balance for the overall pixel whereas the fest 2 ewb ret is the representative radiative temperature for the pixel which joins the two fraction level temperatures tsoil and tcrop that actually close the single and separate energy balances for their respective pixel sub areas with respect to the original fest ewb structure this expansion allows to compute two additional outputs tsoil and tcrop provided the same input data required by fest ewb this should allow a more precise sub pixel representation of et components which could be critical in estimating crop water consumption in heterogeneous scenarios 2 3 error estimators the average error ae is computed as the average of all the differences between model and observation eq 22 closely related to ae is the mean absolute error mae which accounts only for absolute deviations from the observed data eq 23 their formulations are summed up below with n

second degree moment of the differences between modelled and observed values just as the other error estimators here used it is scale dependent being a dimensional quantity 24 rmse i 1 n m i o i 2 n 3 laboratory lysimeter case study a lysimeter is a device employed to perform high accuracy measurements of the water fluxes in the soil crop atmosphere system it consists of a volume of soil isolated from its surroundings through a usually metallic container and placed over a weighing scale able to assess the global weight variations continuously in time the main concept is that all water fluxes are measurable precipitation or irrigation are known quantities deep percolation can be obtained by measuring the flux through a dedicated outlet at the bottom of the lysimeter and evapotranspiration can be gathered through the weight change in time with the necessary precautions a lysimeter can also be installed directly in field in order to work in a scenario as close as possible to real life applications otherwise laboratory set ups can be organized with consequent highly controlled albeit less realistic boundary conditions such a set up has been employed to gather useful data for the validation of the fest 2 ewb model 3 1 instrumentation the main setup is the laboratory lysimeter located in the gaudenzio fantoli laboratory at politecnico di milano corbari and mancini 2022 the lysimeter fig 2 has a 1 5 m 1 5 m basal area and is 1 m high it is filled with silty clay soil from which most of the coarser grains 5 mm in diameter have been removed in preceding studies mantovani

power one infrared and ultraviolet lamp with 300 w nominal power and able to convey that part of the solar radiation not provided by the halogen lights a drip irrigation set up all the measurements are provided by the following instruments the letters in the list correspond to the labels in fig 2 a a pluviometer used to measure deep percolation and connected to the lower outlet where percolation

lysimeter at a depth around 10 cm d a soil heat plate which uses a thermopile to measure the soil temperature gradient over its surface e a four component radiometer capable of measuring both the short and long wave components of the radiance both downwelling from the lamps and upwelling from the lysimeter f a thermo hygrometer providing both air relative humidity and temperature g a smaller weighing scale employed for the smaller box weight variations h a thermal camera bound to a wooden pole positioned at 1 2 m height above the lysimeter which is used to mimic flight or satellite overpasses and retrieves both visible rgb and thermal tir data the instruments characteristics have been summed up in table 2 all instruments except the weighing scales and the thermal camera are connected with a datalogger campbell scientific cr3000 which continuously receives the incoming data at their varying sampling frequency ranging from milliseconds to minutes and provides 10 minutes averages as an output identified as i in fig 2 this overall sampling time step has been suggested by past experience mantovani 2016 rozzoni 2017 with the lysimeter as a safe compromise between good representation of rapid variations of the measured variables and practical data management the data sampling is continuous in time even at night and during the weekends however some issues e g power outages datalogger or single sensor failures have caused the loss of some of the data in particular with soil moisture sensors only when the data gap was sufficiently small 6 time steps or less than an hour and within relatively stable boundary conditions with lights off far from any irrigation event it was filled in by way of simple linear interpolation 3 2 experimental outline an overhead view of the experimental set up is shown in fig 3 with the lysimeter surface split into two distinct sectors firstly sector 1 is organized into eight rows each 15 cm wide four vegetated and four non vegetated the former zone 1 are sown with grass and a drip irrigation line is arranged in order to provide water just to this specific area the latter zone 2 are left unsown and unirrigated weeding out possible crop growth brought on by stray seeds the main weighing scale provides the weight variations of the lysimeter as a whole without distinguishing between the two sub areas to this aim in sector 2 two plastic boxes have been positioned measuring 400 300 120 mm3 364 264 115 mm3 internally these two correspond to the categories in sector 1 one being fully vegetated box 1 the other bare box 2 and can be temporarily moved from the lysimeter to be weighted separately using a smaller weighing scale this allows to measure the distinct et from crop and bare soil provided a sound proportionality is established between each box and the corresponding zone in sector 2 the et measured for the whole lysimeter can be disaggregated into its crop and soil related components furthermore 5 soil moisture probes sm3 sm4 sm6 sm7 and sm8 have been deployed in the lysimeter at shallow depth 10 cm and covering both vegetated and non vegetated stripes two more probes sm1 and sm5 have been similarly placed in the two boxes to monitor their water balance the calibration of all probes against wet and dry measurements in order to provide reliable data has been detailed in appendix c the experiment started with the sowing of the grass on 29th may 2021 and ended on 14th july 2021 46 days in the first days few and large 10 litres irrigations were performed to boost the growth of the grass while a steadier twice a week irrigation schedule was performed later on overall there were 14 irrigation events with an average irrigation amount of 11 1 litres for the zone 1 area and proportionally 1 6 litres for box 1 3 3 experimental routine the instruments deployed over the lysimeter record continuously the micro meteorological data required for the model runs further data both for the model runs and their validation are obtained in instantaneous data gathering routines with expected temporal frequency of two times a week these routines allow to gather the following a weights of the plastic boxes b lysimeter total weight c surface temperature data and d irrigation when performed this last step is generally variable with the crop growth stage at the beginning a few heavy irrigations are required to prepare the soil for the seed development once the first plants have started development a more regular regime can be enforced generally maintaining the soil moisture above the fao provided crop stress threshold cst allen et al 1998 finally when the plants reach a full growth and their water demand increases irrigations can be performed more frequently and or with higher amounts to avoid stressful situations for the plants for the computation of the depletion factor necessary for the cst computation see more at allen et al 1998 a reference value of 0 5 has been chosen suggested for turf grass in the warm season the lights above the lysimeter were turned on every weekday between 09 00 a m and 10 00 a m and switched off between 04 00 p m and 05 00 p m with an average lights on time of 6 h and 29 min a day lighting conditions in the laboratory were so that when lights were off the only light inlets were the nearby windows resulting in low incoming shortwave radiation readings from the radiometer 1 1 3 1 w m 2 conversely with the lights on the radiometer readings were quite stable at 186 2 6 4 w m 2 atmospheric conditions were also quite stable across the monitoring period relative humidity showed a daily average of 0 496 with a standard deviation of 0 049 over the experiment duration and a daily excursion of 0 157 32 of the average value air temperature saw an increasing trend in the first half of the experiment from 22 1 c in the first days up to 27 7 c in the last half with an average value of 26 3 c over the whole period daily excursions were correlated to the lysimeter lights staying on average around 2 9 c but reaching as high as 5 2 c with the lights on and as low as 0 7 c in lights off days in such conditions the vapour pressure deficit vpd of the laboratory environment was calculated at 1 75 0 32 kpa one weakness of the experimental set up was the low wind conditions as no artificial ventilation was available the only possible air circulation was obtained by opening some windows although this rarely resulted in major wind intensity conditions 1 m s 3 4 box lysimeter correspondence in order to validate the use of the boxes to obtain the differentiated crop and soil ets two approaches will be explored with the more accurate one to be employed in the box lysimeter conversion the conceptual diagrams for the approaches are outlined in fig 4 for the first one grass to bare g2b the starting point will be the vegetated box box 1 weightings for any given time interval between two successive weightings the sm evolution is used in determining the total percolated volume employing brooks corey formula brooks corey formula 1964 following the mass conservation principle subtracting this volume to the weightings difference provides the vegetated box et the main assumption here is that the evapotranspiration rate is the same in both box 1 and zone 1 and also for box 2 and zone 2 using the same et rate for zone 1 provides residually from the lysimeter weightings difference the et for zone 2 which in turn can be associated to box 2 this value can also be independently computed by subtracting its percolation volume from the weightings difference the comparison between these two box 2 ets ideally equal can be used as an estimate of the scaling process error the second approach bare to grass b2g is composed of the same exact equations but arranged in reverse order starting from box 2 et upscaling to zone 2 et then residually computing zone 1 et and finally downgrading back to box 1 et to be compared with the same value obtained by box weightings difference it should be noted that while box 2 et could safely be assumed equal to a pure evaporation box 1 et can never be considered a pure transpiration as a contribution from the underlying soil will always be present thus the results from box 2 will necessarily be more unreliable in the early crop growth stages and will progressively be closer and closer to a pure transpiration as vegetation density increases in time 4 results in the following section the experiment and modelling results are outlined in section 4 1 the pre processing required to correctly employ the experimental data is detailed in section 4 2 the calibration and validation of the hydrological models is performed section 4 3 and 4 4 delve into model mechanics in terms of soil moisture and energy partition finally section 4 5 compares the disaggregated e and t fluxes from the lysimeter with the modelling results 4 1 experiment data pre processing 4 1 1 thermal camera data and spatial resolution a total of 13 proximal sensing acquisitions have been completed during the monitoring period with a thermal camera each acquisition provided both rgb and thermal infrared data at different resolutions at the camera height above lysimeter level 1 20 m these spatial resolutions amount to 0 39 mm and 1 2 mm respectively with the experimental configuration the area covered by one image is roughly 1200 cm2 around 5 of the whole lysimeter surface this means that a minimum of 19 images are required to fully cover the whole lysimeter however for georeferentiation and mutual correction purposes some overlapping areas had to be maintained among all images the final acquisition scheme has involved four distinct stripes each made up of 5 6 acquisitions for a total of 20 24 acquisitions for each global lysimeter image in fig 5 a and 5b two examples of thermal and visible data are shown it is possible to distinguish the different images that make up the global lysimeter map which have been mosaicked together by using some control points over the lysimeter surface vegetation information fig 5c has been obtained by following the algorithm detailed in appendix a all distributed data have been resampled through simple spatial averages to a 10 cm resolution from their native scale before being fed to the model this allows to achieve various levels of vegetation soil mixing within each pixel thus creating optimal heterogeneity conditions the upscaling for thermal imagery has been performed with simple averages instead of a more accurate radiation inversion method mccabe et al 2008 since in our specific laboratory conditions the two approaches yielded close results on average the absolute difference between the two approaches was 0 22 c with only 1 of the pixels across all images above 1 c in fig 5d an example of final pre processed vegetation map is provided for the example date of july 7th the darker pixels are those that result better aligned with the main vegetated row fig 3 while the lighter ones cover mostly bare soil generally at this resolution no pixel has a definite 0 or 1 vegetation fraction with a good portion roughly one fifth falling close 10 of the 50 mark that represents ideal heterogeneity conditions for the models comparison finally some measures had to be taken to accurately model irrigation distribution their development is characterised in full in appendix b from a posteriori checks irrigation distribution shows some inconsistencies with the one expected from the disposition of the drip line some factors e g the position of the irrigation outlets the unevenness of the lysimeter surface and horizontal soil water transmission contributed to spread out the water distribution to account for these issues modelled irrigation was organized around three main categories figure b 4 1 2 evaporation and transpiration disaggregation a total of 16 weightings were performed during the observation period 3rd june 15th july 2021 42 days marking start and endings of 15 monitoring intervals mis in the first part of the experiment the weightings were performed twice a week with mis lasting 3 4 days in the last part a denser data collection schedule was enforced and the average mi duration decreased to 1 2 days overall the global average interval is 2 78 days all the information about the performed weightings is detailed in table 3 some mis for each box had to be discarded from the analysis as they lacked sm data needed to compute percolation because of sm probes malfunction for all valid mis the weight difference was contrasted to the contemporary percolation and irrigation when present to determine the box et by enforcing a simple mass balance at box level wend wstart δw irrigation percolation et over these mass balances two controls have been performed firstly data about water losses have been contrasted from independent measurements from the successive weightings at beginning and end of each mi and from the sm probes outputs the results have shown low differences between the two most of the time within 0 5 mm d the two data sources seem to be more in agreement for box 1 with an absolute error of 0 57 mm d against the 0 91 mm d of box 2 the second control concerns the relative partition of the water loss between percolation and et as in some instances the modelled percolation values were so high that residual et resulted negative a non feasible scenario in these conditions the saturated conductivity of each box was slightly adjusted to avoid such scenarios finally the results of the disaggregation approaches detailed in section 3 4 are shown in fig 6 dashed black lines highlight the global measurement error propagated to the final water loss error from the measurement uncertainties shown in table 2 and as a result of the disaggregation algorithm 0 12 mm d this propagated error represents an underlying or baseline error that might be expected from the approaches and is presented to highlight how much of each error point can be attributed to measurement errors from the equipment and how much is instead originated in the approach itself as a consequence of imperfect hypotheses both disaggregation approaches seem to provide non negligible uncertainties although the mean absolute errors were contained with 0 56 mm d for the grass to bare g2b approach 0 20 mm d average error and 1 16 mm d for the bare to grass b2g approach 0 42 mm d their variability was quite large with instances in which both approaches surpassed the 1 mm d threshold and peak errors worse than 3 mm d b2g in most cases these uncertainties exceeded the measurement error propagation within the algorithms meaning that some external uncertainties does play a role 4 2 fest ewb and fest 2 ewb calibration on lst both fest ewb and fest 2 ewb models are run for the lysimeter the optimization of the model error function section 2 1 was used for the calibration of both the results are detailed in fig 7 both in form of day by day lumped bias and of average error distribution the overall model errors are quite similar across both models both in terms of average error 1 80 1 9 c for fest ewb and 1 76 1 9 c for fest 2 ewb and pixel wise rmse 2 87 c for both fest ewb and fest 2 ewb in the comparison against the measured lst both models shared a similar slope of the linear interpolation 1 33 for fest ewb and 1 38 for fest 2 ewb and a similar regression coefficient r2 0 71 for fest ewb and 0 70 for fest 2 ewb in terms of spatial distribution some inconsistencies seem to emerge with the radiation distribution as a quasi radial symmetry can be detected with a temperature underestimation in the central part of the image however this estimation errors again seem similar for both models in particular the underestimation errors in the middle of the lysimeter bare a striking resemblance to the shape of the radiometer which is located in that exact point although the pixels directly covering the radiometer were removed during pre processing the resulting data quality may have been negatively affected nonetheless 4 3 soil moisture modelling one of the distinctive features of the fest ewb model structure is that soil moisture is continuously modelled starting from an initial condition by maintaining the energy and water mass balances closure this allows to preserve in the long term the sm dynamics providing physical consistence to the different et estimations in table 4 error descriptors about the modelled and estimated sm data are shown overall both fest ewb and fest 2 ewb seem to positively identify the measured sm dynamics in particular for sm probes 7 bare soil and 6 vegetation in terms of rmse the model performances are also quite good where three probes out of five cluster below 0 04 m3 m 3 a value frequently associated with satellite surface sm accuracy the other two being not far off generally it strikes how the results from the two models are similar which is consistent with the principle of preserving the global status quo among both models in terms of surface temperature global evapotranspiration and soil moisture condition one main concept to retain when looking at these data is that although each sm probe is specifically assigned to one land cover either completely bare or fully vegetated the model pixels with their 10 cm spatial resolution are much more mixed and this means that their values will inevitably be influenced by different land cover types from the one associated to the given sm probe for instance different modelled vegetation degrees from the actual ones relative to the sm probe could cause an excess or lack of transpiration activity causing the soil moisture to deplete more slowly and thus yielding after a few irrigation cycles quite diverging conditions from the initial ones however the low errors allow a positive interpretation of the model results this is consistent with the fact that the amount of sm overestimation is not directly linked to the sm probe land cover with different performances both from the two bare soil probes sm probe 3 registering an average rmse of 0 053 m3 m 3 double that of the other bare soil sm probe no 7 with 0 026 m3 m 3 and the three fully vegetated probes with sm probe 4 scoring the highest rmse at 0 071 m3 m 3 roughly doubling the values from sm probe 6 0 035 m3 m 3 and sm probe 8 0 039 m3 m 3 4 4 relationship between modelled variables in order to provide a further insight into the models functioning a focus on the simulations for midday 1st july 2021 is provided in fig 8 with modelled soil moisture surface temperature and vegetation fraction mapped for all 185 valid lysimeter pixels this instance was within a 5 day period in which no water was provided to the grass and the lights were left on all the time this created stressful conditions for the plant that were aimed at heightening contrast between different areas of the lysimeter three major groups can be identified each clustered around different values of the vegetation fraction these groups correspond to the three main irrigation categories detailed in section 4 1 1 and appendix b the pixels irrigated most frequently dark blue circle are as a result the most vegetated in the light blue circle the pixels receiving lower amounts of water generally show a lower vegetation presence while the pixels to which the least water amount is assigned are enclosed in the yellow circle for each category the most vegetated pixels are oriented towards the lower left edge of the plot towards cooler surface temperatures and lower soil moisture values this means that when any two pixels receive the same water amount a higher vegetation presence because of different sowing distributions determines a higher water consumption through evapotranspiration resulting in lower final sm values as a result the energy demand associated to this water consumption determines the cooler surface temperatures in the analysis of fig 9 a the same modelling time step midday 1st july was chosen to display the differences between the models in terms of relative transpiration t et this was mapped against vegetation fraction together with sm information in the colours for each pixel the distinction between the two models is strongly linked to the vegetation fraction the more extreme the value with fv either nearing one of its limits at 0 or 1 the more the two models tend to converge while the most critical differences appear visible around the intermediate values furthermore the relationship between relative transpiration and vegetation fraction is clear with the former being directly dependent on the latter as the importance of the plant contribution to the total pixel et activity increases with a more consistent vegetation presence in the pixel itself finally in fig 9b the same variables are re arranged to show the relation between relative transpiration and surface temperature the three irrigation categories are again visible with the lower intra category soil moisture contents associated to cooler surface temperatures and higher relative transpirations the different process control from fest 2 ewb provides a different distribution of relative transpiration with lower values than fest ewb as a consequence of the process being powered by tcrop lower than ret for the same reason higher sm values are found in the mid irrigation category with fest 2 ewb as a result of less transpiration and hence water consumption while in the low irrigation category associated with low vegetation fraction values the impact of higher soil temperatures creates drier conditions 4 5 evaporation and transpiration comparison in fig 10 a the total et rate is shown for the nine monitoring intervals mis in which box sm data were available together with measured values corresponding models simulations are shown with both models performing equally good this is consistent with the similar temperature biases shown above in the second panel of fig 10 the lysimeter transpiration rates are detailed the lysimeter values are obtained following g2b approach in section 3 4 and can be higher than the contemporary et values as they refer to rates i e water evaporation intensities per unit area by looking at the model outputs a distinguishable difference now emerges between the two with fest ewb always exceeding fest 2 ewb this is an expected result as the former s transpiration is regulated by ret and the latter s by tcrop which is by construction lower than ret as explained in section 2 2 the important result is that especially in the second part of the experiment from mi 5 onward when vegetation was denser and pixel heterogeneity at its maximum lysimeter data seem to agree more with fest 2 ewb confirming how a two source approach is more suitable in this kind of heterogeneous scenario focusing on the last five mis the mean absolute error with fest 2 ewb is 0 16 mm d while the single source model performs a slightly worse 0 54 mm d in terms of water volumes difference the average fest 2 ewb error amounts to 0 5 lt less than one third of the single source model s 1 8 lt to provide an idea of how much this impacts in the overall water volume economics of our system fest ewb errs daily by roughly 20 of the ordinary irrigation volume fest 2 ewb own error skims 5 5 discussion numerous studies in the literature have successfully employed two source modelling structures in more or less heterogeneous scenarios starting from the two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 and its numerous applications cammalleri et al 2010 2012 colaizzi et al 2012 2014 nieto et al 2019 li kustas et al 2019 the more or less common goal for such modelling structures was the improvement of et estimations khan et al 2021 devised a lai based methodology to develop a two source version of the single source sebs model su 2002 obtaining similar overall evapotranspiration estimations over forests both full and mixed cropland and grassland aguirre garcía et al 2021 and mentioned studies successfully applied two source structures to olive groves in arid environments by exploiting satellite information for vegetation and thermal data input into the model many studies have also focused on the integration of satellite observations in order to obtain more accurate et estimations such as d urso et al 2021 who explored the possible improvements in et estimation in a complex area such as a vineyard by employing a thermal based data fusion approach this article presents a novel version of the well established corbari et al 2011 hybrid source fest ewb model its founding principles are i closure of both water mass and energy balances ii usage of the surface temperature as an internal variable and not as an input iii characterization of the different contributions to the energy balance from different land cover classes within the given pixel all the while maintaining a single energy balance equation these have been preserved when building the novel fest 2 ewb with the aim of further characterizing heterogeneous scenarios and enhancing latent heat and conversely evapotranspiration estimations two additional variables the soil and crop surface temperatures are computed using the same number of inputs as the original fest ewb this has been done by running separate energy balances for the different parts of the given pixel and then identifying a global radiometric type temperature to be representative of the whole pixel this approach labelled as patch uncoupled pu for the energetical independence of the subpixel areas lhomme et al 2012 is opposed to the layered coupled lc one characteristic of other two source schemes such as tseb norman et al 1995 one main driving concept for this adaptation is the fact that using just one global temperature for the computation of the energy fluxes may be seen as an implicit mistake crop temperatures have been found to be generally lower than soil temperatures in heterogeneous scenarios nieto et al 2019 bian et al 2017 and this holds even for more homogeneous crops although with a heavier dependency on the amount of incoming radiation colaizzi et al 2012 if only one representative temperature is used for the computation of the vegetation transpiration this would necessarily be somewhere in between a cooler canopy temperature which powers plant transpiration and a warmer soil temperature which determines water evaporation from the soil as a consequence the transpiration computed based on such a temperature could be overestimated against the actual value for these reasons a full characterization of the sub pixel temperatures would allow a more precise estimation of the irrigation water needs and a curb on irrigation water waste to verify such a claim however it is necessary to employ evaporation and transpiration singled out data in this respect recent years have seen a considerable interest from the scientific community with focus on different variables to extract this information aerodynamic resistances parametrization li gentine et al 2019 mallick et al 2015 isotope tracing or sap flow observations aouade et al 2020 aron et al 2020 employment of co2 concentration observations from ec stations zahn et al 2022 a full overview of similar approaches is available at stoy et al 2019 in this work the necessary data for the validation of the fest 2 ewb modelling framework have been obtained from an experiment conducted at the fantoli laboratory at politecnico di milano using a lysimeter transpiration estimates were obtained by establishing a connection between two control boxes and the whole lysimeter this approach has some limitations and requires a few clarifications the closed quarters of the plastic box hinder both soil heat and lateral soil moisture exchanges for the former separate soil heat flux measurements performed with the soil heat flux plate mentioned in section 3 1 yielded amounts roughly equal to 8 3 w m 2 5 2 of the global net radiation meaning that the absence of such a flux is of light impact to the overall energy balance in terms of lateral soil moisture exchange the small scale and mostly flat scenario of the lysimeter cause this phenomenon to be quite negligible in the water mass balance modelling scheme as both model and box transpiration on which lysimeter transpiration is founded as shown in section 3 4 are associated to negligible lateral soil moisture motion the comparison between the two is actually well founded the accuracies of the et disaggregation approaches was estimated at 0 56 mm d for the g2b approach and 1 16 mm d for the b2g approach in terms of mean absolute error models calibrations results in terms of surface temperature were strong in terms of average model bias 1 80 c for fest ewb and 1 77 c for fest 2 ewb equally for both models an improvement in performances was detected with time and vegetation development potentially something could be perfected in the representation of mostly bare areas while the model accuracy in modelling surface temperatures in complex soil vegetation systems is quite high absolute errors close to 0 c the final comparison of the models was carried out in terms of global lysimeter et and partitioned local transpiration using estimates obtained through a merge of lysimeter and scale weightings and soil moisture retrievals the accuracy of these estimates was quite variable across the different monitoring intervals with an average absolute error of 0 56 mm d these uncertainties stem from the underlying assumptions of the used approaches which have been discussed earlier the better model performances at later monitoring intervals and the more unstable transpiration data in the early period fig 10b could be attributed to the effect of soil evaporation within the vegetated box as plant growth was still incomplete what was considered as pure transpiration was in fact noticeably affected by the soil contribution thus overestimating the water fluxes mediated by plant activity this effect fades off with time as vegetation density increases and consequently t becomes dominant to the global box et output estimated et and t values were compared to their modelling counterparts from both fest ewb and fest 2 ewb provided similar surface temperature outputs both models et errors are small within 0 25 mm d but differ when extracting the transpiration component fest ewb in line with the theoretical expectations produces transpiration estimates higher average absolute error of 0 54 mm d than those from fest 2 ewb which are much more in line with the disaggregated estimates from the lysimeter average absolute error of 0 16 mm d formulating these errors in practical terms the daily transpiration error for fest ewb amounts to 20 of the ordinary irrigation volume whereas fest 2 ewb own daily t error barely skims the 5 by contrasting these results with the ones shown in fig 9 it is evident how such differences increase with the spatial heterogeneity the more inter mixed the pixel vegetation fractions around the peak value of 0 5 cause the models to diverge the most as the assumption of one single temperature representing a diverse pixel is at its weakest the strength of fest 2 ewb is that such considerations involve the inner pixel dynamics not affecting the overall pixel response to the outside inputs e g et lst as shown in fig 10a improvements in model accuracy could be obtained with a separation of the pixel sub areas also in terms of water mass balance which could reproduce more closely the actual in field dynamics however provided the complexity of retrieving disaggregated transpiration data in most model performance studies the model results and the experimental set up are especially valuable as they demonstrate the need for distinguishing intra pixel heterogeneity when dealing with mixed land covers these results are especially valuable for future remote sensing applications fest ewb has already been successfully tested in similar scenarios corbari and mancini 2014b corbari et al 2020 and it shares the main founding scheme with fest 2 ewb distributed structure use of proximal remote sensing data of vegetation and temperature this link allows fest 2 ewb to be intrinsically ready for external environment applications from drone airborne sensing to satellite observations agricultural applications in particular focusing on medium range resolutions 5 100 m in low urbanized soil vegetation systems provide the perfect testing ground in particular for row crops and fruit trees scenarios paciolla et al 2021a another possible field of expansion for fest 2 ewb is the possibility to acknowledge different intra pixel sources for example diverse in terms of phenology e g leaf density growth stage senescence ongoing studies are focusing on this aspect in order to successfully cover more real life conditions e g grass cover crops used in the inter rows of major tree crops the founding aim of fest 2 ewb was to develop more accurate transpiration estimate the added value of our final result was a model that joined the ability to work continuously with easy to retrieve data from the fest ewb scheme and the increased accuracy in plant transpiration of two source approaches in terms of modelling accuracy the enhanced t estimates over those from fest ewb represent a consistent gain in necessary irrigation volumes 15 less in this specific application on the other hand many two source models norman et al 1995 aguirre garcia et al 2021 employ lst data as input and are thus able to work only when these are available or need otherwise to enforce hypotheses to cover the rest of the time like the constant evaporative fraction hypothesis brutsaert and sugita 1992 the time continuous seamless simulation provided by the underlying fest ewb scheme corbari ravazzani and mancini 2011 allows fest 2 ewb to be independent of satellite lst availability extending the advantages of two source schemes to distributed remote sensing driven large scale applications 6 conclusions the necessity of improving the accuracy of hydrological models employed in agricultural management is paramount to the optimization of the water resource the energetical scheme proposed by two source approaches is much closer to reality than that of single source ones in heterogeneous agricultural scenarios in this work a two source version of a well established distributed water energy balance model has been developed its findings in terms of composition of the evapotranspiration flux and its components have been validated employing the data from an experimental activity designed for the purpose using a laboratory lysimeter the transpiration has been found overestimated with respect to the data when modelled using a single source model while the modelling was much more accurate when employing its two source counterpart two source modelling can help provide a more precise estimation of the crop irrigation water needs in particular in heterogeneous agricultural areas with consistent savings in terms of irrigation furthermore the use of continuous modelling water and energy balance models allows to recreate the entire seasonal dynamic of crop growth allowing an accurate representation of the major water and energy fluxes over large areas and without requiring lst

that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix appendix a thermal camera data the thermal information gathered by the camera is in form of upwelling long wave radiation from the lysimeter surface the camera software automatically converts this data in land surface temperature by inverting stefan boltzmann law and employing as surface emissivity an a priori user defined value 0 95 was used for these samplings the single images obtained from the camera were then patched together to obtain a full lysimeter matrix such as the one shown in fig 5 the rgb data on the other hand require a further processing step as the final aim is determining the fractional vegetation cover the following algorithm has been used over each pixel rgb triplet 1 if the green digital number dn is higher than both the red and the blue ones the pixel is classified as vegetated 2 if the highest dn is in the red band the pixel is classified as vegetated only if the green dn is not much smaller than the red one a threshold green red ratio of 0 75 has been chosen after some comparative analyses 3 in all other cases the pixel is classified as non vegetated this follows in the steps of other works which employed vegetation data from rgb images marcial pablo et al 2019 based on similarly constructed indexes like exg woebbecke et al 1995 vig gitelson et al 2002 and cive kataoka et al 2003 the developed algorithm was favoured over others after some inter comparison with some of the above algorithms because of its simplicity and the sufficient accuracy for a relatively coarse resolution 10 cm application such as the one we had designed this work is performed at the high resolution of rgb images 0 39 mm so that the assumption of obtaining only fully vegetated and completely bare pixels can be considered safe as this spatial resolution is comparable with the reference scale of the final object an example of vegetation distribution is visible in fig 5c appendix b irrigation distribution modelling irrigation distribution should have been quite straightforward to model starting from the geometrical outline of the seeded zone 1 and unseeded zone 2 areas as described in the experimental outline in section 3 2 however a combination of factors complicated the final pattern firstly the structural pattern of the drip irrigation line was so that not all outlets were positioned within zone 1 areas blocking with tape the outlets located in zone 2 was only partially effective as some water reached zone 2 nonetheless clearly visible in the focus in fig 3b another cause for zone 2 pixels receiving some irrigation water was the partial unevenness of the lysimeter surface small roughness patches caused some of the water accumulated during irrigation to flow towards zone 2 pixels also visible in fig 3b finally even for drip outlets located within zone 1 horizontal soil water transmission caused the actual irrigated footprint to reach in particular for the heavier irrigations areas within zone 2 in order to account for all these issues the irrigation map has been extracted a posteriori from the last vegetation data attributing more water to the highly vegetated areas fig b1 appendix c soil moisture probes calibration the data from the soil moisture probes has been calibrated using the following procedure firstly with the soil in very dry conditions one undisturbed soil sample was collected in the vicinity of each soil moisture probe using metallic cylinders the sensor output so values from the sm probes during the sampling were also recorded and the cylinders were weighted both at that moment wwet and after 24 h in an oven at 100 c wdry this assured that all the moisture was removed and the weight difference awa allowed to determine the actual water content awc at sampling following equations c 1 c 2 c 1 awa w wet w dry c 2 awc ρ w a w a ρ s w dry where awa is the actual water amount g in the soil sample wwet g and wdry g are the sample weights before and after oven desiccation respectively and ρw and ρs represent the water and soil densities respectively equal to 1 g cm 3 and 1 3 g cm 3 this value being obtained in precedent tests mantovani 2016 a second sampling was taken after heavy irrigation obtaining for each probe another so awc couple the result of this data collection is detailed in fig c1 sm as perceived from the probes results weakly perceptive of extreme either very dry or very wet water contents thus a linear correction quite similar in parameters across all soil moisture probes with the exception of sm probe 5 was enforced for the successive steps in fig c1 b the final soil moisture profiles are displayed the peaks corresponding to the irrigation events also detailed in the figure are quite visible together with different decreasing curves with the steeper ones associated to lights on periods and the milder ones mainly to the weekends appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2023 129265

2086,an accurate knowledge of the water and energy exchanges in the soil crop atmosphere system is critical for a precise and aware control of all agricultural operations from field management to irrigation and harvest this concern is more complex to address in heterogeneous systems with the presence of bare soil or simple grass in between the main crop in this work a two source energy water balance model is developed joining the advantages of the single source fest ewb model internal computation of surface temperature and time continuous modelling and those of two source approaches employing two surface temperatures to accurately characterize the intra pixel heterogeneity in order to validate the model results a laboratory experiment has been designed over a lysimeter with the target of obtaining partitioned estimates of evaporation and transpiration over a heterogeneous grass crop these partitioned fluxes were supported by a safe error margin in the scaling procedure less than 1 mm d the fest ewb and fest 2 ewb models were first calibrated using surface temperature obtained from thermal camera observations with roughly 1 7 c of average bias then they were validated against the partitioned estimated the single source modelling showed a consistent overestimation of the estimated transpiration by an amount roughly 20 of the average irrigation event on the other hand the two source model shows much lower 6 errors portraying more accurately the transpired water volume such an improvement in crop water consumption estimation can provide a successful reference to optimize the use of the irrigation water resource with consistent water savings keywords energy water balance evapotranspiration heterogeneous crops lysimeter hydrological modelling irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in our changing climate the progressive automation of agriculture is critical towards its flexibility and resiliency against possible shocks such as water scarcity a good knowledge of the hydrological processes surrounding the growing crop is thus key to the identification of crop water needs and crop consumption themselves necessary in irrigation scheduling and management recent still ongoing progress in remote sensing rs cracknell 2018 shanmugapriya et al 2019 technology has provided ideal support to the formulation of distributed land surface models lsms parametrizing to varying degrees all the processes within the water cycle hoefsloot et al 2012 hank et al 2015 huang et al 2019 gonzalez dugo et al 2009 the wide variety of measurable parameters and the wealth of available data ranging across different spatial and temporal resolution combinations has allowed lsms to describe large areas from the field to the irrigation consortium and the whole hydrological basin scale numerous hydrological models place foremost importance on the soil moisture sm as a key hydrological variable that defines the status of a basin dooge 1986 however the uncertainties lying in sm data retrieval from rs giacomelli et al 1995 mancini et al 1999 have pushed towards a re formulation of hydrological models with other variables as their main focus such as evapotranspiration monteith et al 1965 or land surface temperature lst anderson et al 1997 because of the easier retrieval of ground and satellite data for the calibration and validation phases jackson et al 2010 czapla myers et al 2015 lst in particular is directly linked with all of the components of the energy and water mass balances also through its direct connection with sm anderson et al 1997 bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 and has the advantage of being an easy target for rs retrievals with lesser errors and a wide variety of operating thermal sensors duan et al 2020 minacapilli et al 2009 lst is one of the main protagonists in a lot of surface energy balance seb models mostly employed as either input variable or boundary condition zhang et al 2016 among these different model approaches some of the most common can be labelled as residual where one of the components of the energy balance either latent or sensible heat is obtained by enforcing the energy balance closure after the computation of other fluxes these can be further subdivided into a single source 1s schemes in which the pixel is assumed homogeneous with no distinction between the evaporation and transpiration components of the et bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 b two source 2s schemes that identify different energy exchange mechanics according to the type of land cover kustas and norman 1999a montaldo et al 2001 norman et al 1995 formulating evaporation e and transpiration t as two distinct fluxes colaizzi et al 2012 their characteristics suggest a better applicability of 1s schemes to homogeneous crops e g maize cotton and of 2s schemes for heterogeneous ones e g row crops like vines or fruit trees the fest ewb model is a distributed hydrological model mancini 1990 corbari ravazzani and mancini 2011 identifiable as hybrid between the two abovementioned approaches with a double formulation for each energy flux acknowledging the difference in contribution from the vegetated and bare soil part of any land surface patch but a single energy balance equation the water mass and energy balance equations are coupled and solved jointly and the model parameters are calibrated through the land surface temperature lst corbari and mancini 2014b corbari et al 2015 indeed the uniqueness to this model stands in its use of the lst product while most models require it as an input and are thus constrained to its availability for model continuous running sishodia et al 2020 piles et al 2014 fest ewb has its own model equivalent parameter the representative equilibrium temperature ret that is used as a calibration variable against lst data fest ewb has already performed in a wide variety of contexts providing fairly positive results joint temperature discharge model calibration corbari and mancini 2014a high resolution et modelling paciolla et al 2021a corbari et al 2020 smart irrigation forecast corbari et al 2019 and irrigation optimization corbari and mancini 2022 in this work a new water energy balance model the fest 2 ewb is proposed as a translation of the original fest ewb model into a two source structure providing a separation of the energy fluxes for the crop and bare soil one main driver for such a step is the possibility to differentiate the contributions to the energy balance in heterogeneous areas crop temperatures have been found to be generally lower than soil temperatures in heterogeneous scenarios nieto et al 2019 bian et al 2017 and also for homogeneous crops although with a heavier dependency on the solar radiation colaizzi et al 2012 this means that when assuming one single temperature for a heterogeneous pixel e g for single source models this temperature is actually somewhere in between a cooler canopy temperature which powers plant transpiration and a warmer soil temperature which determines water evaporation from the soil by estimating total evapotranspiration with just one global temperature single source models are liable to overestimate the canopy contribution and underestimate the soil one thus a two source version of fest ewb might attain a more accurate modelling than that of the single source fest ewb model as t is a major indicator of plant water consumption this potential overestimation could lead to erroneous amplification of crop yield or irrigation requirements with consequent harvest value forecast errors or water resource waste the assessment and accuracy quantification of partitioned e and t estimates from other measurements is itself object of a quite recent interest in the scientific community li gentine et al 2019 have proposed an improved parametrization of the aerodynamic resistances alternatively the conductances of soil and canopy linking their relative weight to the transpiration fraction t et both aouade et al 2020 and aron et al 2020 have made use of either isotope tracing or sap flow observations or both which require a considerably heavy data collecting effort furthermore et partitioning has also been obtained by exploiting co2 concentration measurements commonly performed in ec stations with positive results zahn et al 2022 numerous studies have provided an intercomparison of different approaches such as the one by nelson et al 2020 whereas a full overview of the different disaggregation schemes being debated throughout the scientific community is provided in stoy et al 2019 one major driving force for this work is the possibility of testing a two source modelling structure widely discussed in the literature with the fest ewb approach independent of land surface temperature data and thus able to continuously simulate large areas without depending on satellite retrievals this practice is not very common throughout the scientific literature and most two source model applications available have been limited by the satellite overpasses or were able to conduct continuous simulations only in single points using the measurements from an autonomous radiometer the aim of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of transpiration estimates provided by a single source and two source version of the same continuously simulating energy and water balance model to validate the two source model improvements a dedicated laboratory experimental set up has been designed at the fantoli laboratory at politecnico di milano based on a lysimeter able to monitor all water fluxes in a controlled soil volume which has provided us with partitioned e and t fluxes to be compared with the model outputs 2 methodology 2 1 fest ewb the fest ewb flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation energy water balance model is a distributed energy water balance model corbari et al 2011 mancini 1990 its structure prescribes a pixel by pixel joint solution of the water mass eq 1 and energy eq 2 balance equations at each calculation step the two equations are linked by the latent heat evapotranspiration correspondence eq 3 and the solution to this system is found iteratively by searching for the surface temperature that ensures the closure of both balances 1 dsm dt wi r p e e t dz 2 rn g h s h c l s l c δ w δ t 3 l l s l c λ w ρ w e t where the first equation refers to the water mass balance and the second to the energy balance with the s and c subscripts identifying the soil and canopy components of the fluxes respectively the energy storage terms δw δt can generally be assumed negligible at low resolutions meyers and hollinger 2004 but can also be parametrized if local flux measurements are available the list of the symbols employed in eqs 1 3 and further on in the article is provided in table 1 model inputs either varying with time or fixed are highlighted in yellow whereas model outputs are marked in light green the other parameters are instead computed internally within the model the modelled surface temperature which is the result of the enforcement of the energy balance hence its name representative equilibrium temperature or ret can be used in comparison with the satellite retrieved land surface temperature lst more or less explicitly all the terms in eqs 1 3 are functions of the input soil and vegetation parameters these can be either stationary or time varying soil and terrain parameters generally belong to the former category and include descriptors of the soil water motion e g hydraulic conductivity pore size index bubbling pressure residual and saturation water contents active soil depth and geo morphological characteristic of the basin e g aspect elevation slope vegetation e g plant height vegetation fraction and leaf area index and meteorological e g rainfall incoming shortwave radiation air temperature and relative humidity parameters on the other hand mostly belong to the time varying category minimum stomatal resistance depending on the specific plant and wet soil resistance to evaporation depending on the soil type are generally assumed to be fixed with time finally all input data can be provided either as single valued or with their own spatial distribution depending on data availability the fest ewb hydrological model allows a pixel by pixel calibration differentiating the calibration parameters with a spatial heterogeneity derived from the calibration variable patterns corbari and mancini 2014a 2014b paciolla et al 2021a paciolla et al 2021b the calibration is performed pixel by pixel comparing the modelled representative equilibrium temperature ret and the remotely sensed land surface temperature lst the calibration parameters change depending on the uncertainties of the input data and on the investigated process but generally refer to the soil chiefly the soil saturation conductivity the pore size index and resistance mainly the minimum stomatal resistance and the wet soil resistance parameters for each pixel these parameters are gradually corrected staying within their physical bounds set from literature in order to minimize the average model error defined as the objective function o equation 4 4 o 1 n i 1 n ret i lst i where n stands for the total number of calibration data available the distributed approach of the calibration allows to refine the spatial heterogeneity of the calibration parameters involved as the model can only use lst information for the calibration phase and does not need flux tower data as an input energy fluxes can be used for the validation moreover since model inputs and energy fluxes measurements originate from independent sources and given the integrated nature of the model which simulates the entire water cycle calibration and validation can be performed over the same time window without the need of identifying a calibration only and a validation only period 2 2 fest 2 ewb in this work the fest 2 ewb flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation 2 source energy water balance model is presented as an extension to the original hybrid structured fest ewb model described above the main assumption is that each pixel can be split into a vegetated and a non vegetated fraction according to its vegetation fraction parameter fv fig 1 as a step forward from the original model each pixel sub area is assumed in independent thermal equilibrium with its own subsoil and atmosphere surface layer this means that the superficial temperatures at which these equilibria are reached are separate for the two sub areas and are identified as the soil temperature tsoil and the crop temperature tcrop thus the model can be classified as patch uncoupled pu meaning that the pixel sub areas are independent of each other and interact solely with the atmosphere through their own energy balance lhomme et al 2012 this is opposed to other two source schemes identifiable as layered coupled lc where the subpixel partition is horizontal rather than vertical with a lower and upper layer that influence each other in terms of energy fluxes e g the upper layer dampens the radiation reaching the lower one or this latter is the only one exchanging energy with the soil a common example of such a scheme is the two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 kustas and norman 1999b the original fest ewb energy balance equation eq 2 is split into equations 5 14 which describe two hypothetical pixels one completely bare eqs 5 9 and the other wholly vegetated eqs 10 14 5 rn soil g soil l soil h soil 6 rn soil s in 1 α r ld ε s σ t soil k 4 7 g soil g th z t soil t zero 8 l soil

t crop e a γ r a r c 14 h crop ρ c t crop t air r a with respect to the original equations the only addition concerns a slightly differentiated value for soil and canopy emissivity for longwave emitted radiation with two distinct values instead of the global one employed in the original soil energy balance a mention should be made for the soil heat flux g the surface temperature below the canopy which regulates the energy exchanges with the subsoil can be lower than the canopy temperature by more than 10 c rahman et al 2017 as this work represents a first step towards a more complete representation of complex soil canopy systems we have chosen to treat the canopy and its underlying soil surface as a single component of the energy balance i e characterised by a single radiative temperature thus approximating some energy exchange mechanisms such as the soil heat flux triple source models are being discussed in the scientific community such as 3seb burchard levine et al 2022 but represent a step beyond the scopes of this work the final pixel scenario will be somewhere in between the two extreme balances shown above the energy balances structure is such that the closure is performed both at sub pixel and global pixel level following the steps presented in equations 15 19 15 eq 5 1 f v e q 10 f v rn pixel g pixel l pixel h pixel 0 16 rn pixel rn soil 1 f v rn crop f v 17 g pixel g soil 1 f v g crop f v 18 l pixel l soil 1 f v l crop f v 19 h pixel h soil 1 f v h crop f v finally as is usual practice for two source energy balance models norman et al 1995 kustas and anderson 2009 a pixel level global representative temperature is obtained from the two subpixel temperatures this equivalent pixel level temperature which is necessary for model output interaction with outsourced satellite data is obtained from the longwave upwelling radiation balance 20 r l u p p i x e l r l u p s o i l 1 f v r l u p c r o p f v 21 ret 4 t soil 4 1 f v t crop 4 f v the overall pixel temperature is identified with the acronym ret which stands again for representative equilibrium temperature by usage similarity with the ret from fest ewb however the two critically differ from a conceptual point of view the fest ewb ret is the temperature that closes the energy balance for the overall pixel whereas the fest 2 ewb ret is the representative radiative temperature for the pixel which joins the two fraction level temperatures tsoil and tcrop that actually close the single and separate energy balances for their respective pixel sub areas with respect to the original fest ewb structure this expansion allows to compute two additional outputs tsoil and tcrop provided the same input data required by fest ewb this should allow a more precise sub pixel representation of et components which could be critical in estimating crop water consumption in heterogeneous scenarios 2 3 error estimators the average error ae is computed as the average of all the differences between model and observation eq 22 closely related to ae is the mean absolute error mae which accounts only for absolute deviations from the observed data eq 23 their formulations are summed up below with n

second degree moment of the differences between modelled and observed values just as the other error estimators here used it is scale dependent being a dimensional quantity 24 rmse i 1 n m i o i 2 n 3 laboratory lysimeter case study a lysimeter is a device employed to perform high accuracy measurements of the water fluxes in the soil crop atmosphere system it consists of a volume of soil isolated from its surroundings through a usually metallic container and placed over a weighing scale able to assess the global weight variations continuously in time the main concept is that all water fluxes are measurable precipitation or irrigation are known quantities deep percolation can be obtained by measuring the flux through a dedicated outlet at the bottom of the lysimeter and evapotranspiration can be gathered through the weight change in time with the necessary precautions a lysimeter can also be installed directly in field in order to work in a scenario as close as possible to real life applications otherwise laboratory set ups can be organized with consequent highly controlled albeit less realistic boundary conditions such a set up has been employed to gather useful data for the validation of the fest 2 ewb model 3 1 instrumentation the main setup is the laboratory lysimeter located in the gaudenzio fantoli laboratory at politecnico di milano corbari and mancini 2022 the lysimeter fig 2 has a 1 5 m 1 5 m basal area and is 1 m high it is filled with silty clay soil from which most of the coarser grains 5 mm in diameter have been removed in preceding studies mantovani

connected with a datalogger campbell scientific cr3000 which continuously receives the incoming data at their varying sampling frequency ranging from milliseconds to minutes and provides 10 minutes averages as an output identified as i in fig 2 this overall sampling time step has been suggested by past experience mantovani 2016 rozzoni 2017 with the lysimeter as a safe compromise between good representation of rapid variations of the measured variables and practical data management the data sampling is continuous in time even at night and during the weekends however some issues e g power outages datalogger or single sensor failures have caused the loss of some of the data in particular with soil moisture sensors only when the data gap was sufficiently small 6 time steps or less than an hour and within relatively stable boundary conditions with lights off far from any irrigation event it was filled in by way of simple linear interpolation 3 2 experimental outline an overhead view of the experimental set up is shown in fig 3 with the lysimeter surface split into two distinct sectors firstly sector 1 is organized into eight rows each 15 cm wide four vegetated and four non vegetated the former zone 1 are sown with grass and a drip irrigation line is arranged in order to provide water just to this specific area the latter zone 2 are left unsown and unirrigated weeding out possible crop growth brought on by stray seeds the main weighing scale provides the weight variations of the lysimeter as a whole without distinguishing between the two sub areas to this aim in sector 2 two plastic boxes have been positioned measuring 400 300 120 mm3 364 264 115 mm3 internally these two correspond to the categories in sector 1 one being fully vegetated box 1 the other bare box 2 and can be temporarily moved from the lysimeter to be weighted separately using a smaller weighing scale this allows to measure the distinct et from crop and bare soil provided a sound proportionality is established between each box and the corresponding zone in sector 2 the et measured for the whole lysimeter can be disaggregated into its crop and soil related components furthermore 5 soil moisture probes sm3 sm4 sm6 sm7 and sm8 have been deployed in the lysimeter at shallow depth 10 cm and covering both vegetated and non vegetated stripes two more probes sm1 and sm5 have been similarly placed in the two boxes to monitor their water balance the calibration of all probes against wet and dry measurements in order to provide reliable data has been detailed in appendix c the experiment started with the sowing of the grass on 29th may 2021 and ended on 14th july 2021 46 days in the first days few and large 10 litres irrigations were performed to boost the growth of the grass while a steadier twice a week irrigation schedule was performed later on overall there were 14 irrigation events with an average irrigation amount of 11 1 litres for the zone 1 area and proportionally 1 6 litres for box 1 3 3 experimental routine the instruments deployed over the lysimeter record continuously the micro meteorological data required for the model runs further data both for the model runs and their validation are obtained in instantaneous data gathering routines with expected temporal frequency of two times a week these routines allow to gather the following a weights of the plastic boxes b lysimeter total weight c surface temperature data and d irrigation when performed this last step is generally variable with the crop growth stage at the beginning a few heavy irrigations are required to prepare the soil for the seed development once the first plants have started development a more regular regime can be enforced generally maintaining the soil moisture above the fao provided crop stress threshold cst allen et al 1998 finally when the plants reach a full growth and their water demand increases irrigations can be performed more frequently and or with higher amounts to avoid stressful situations for the plants for the computation of the depletion factor necessary for the cst computation see more at allen et al 1998 a reference value of 0 5 has been chosen suggested for turf grass in the warm season the lights above the lysimeter were turned on every weekday between 09 00 a m and 10 00 a m and switched off between 04 00 p m and 05 00 p m with an average lights on time of 6 h and 29 min a day lighting conditions in the laboratory were so that when lights were off the only light inlets were the nearby windows resulting in low incoming shortwave radiation readings from the radiometer 1 1 3 1 w m 2 conversely with the lights on the radiometer readings were quite stable at 186 2 6 4 w m 2 atmospheric conditions were also quite stable across the monitoring period relative humidity showed a daily average of 0 496 with a standard deviation of 0 049 over the experiment duration and a daily excursion of 0 157 32 of the average value air temperature saw an increasing trend in the first half of the experiment from 22 1 c in the first days up to 27 7 c in the last half with an average value of 26 3 c over the whole period daily excursions were correlated to the lysimeter lights staying on average around 2 9 c but reaching as high as 5 2 c with the lights on and as low as 0 7 c in lights off days in such conditions the vapour pressure deficit vpd of the laboratory environment was calculated at 1 75 0 32 kpa one weakness of the experimental set up was the low wind conditions as no artificial ventilation was available the only possible air circulation was obtained by opening some windows although this rarely resulted in major wind intensity conditions 1 m s 3 4 box lysimeter correspondence in order to validate the use of the boxes to obtain the differentiated crop and soil ets two approaches will be explored with the more accurate one to be employed in the box lysimeter conversion the conceptual diagrams for the approaches are outlined in fig 4 for the first one grass to bare g2b the starting point will be the vegetated box box 1 weightings for any given time interval between two successive weightings the sm evolution is used in determining the total percolated volume employing brooks corey formula brooks corey formula 1964 following the mass conservation principle subtracting this volume to the weightings difference provides the vegetated box et the main assumption here is that the evapotranspiration rate is the same in both box 1 and zone 1 and also for box 2 and zone 2 using the same et rate for zone 1 provides residually from the lysimeter weightings difference the et for zone 2 which in turn can be associated to box 2 this value can also be independently computed by subtracting its percolation volume from the weightings difference the comparison between these two box 2 ets ideally equal can be used as an estimate of the scaling process error the second approach bare to grass b2g is composed of the same exact equations but arranged in reverse order starting from box 2 et upscaling to zone 2 et then residually computing zone 1 et and finally downgrading back to box 1 et to be compared with the same value obtained by box weightings difference it should be noted that while box 2 et could safely be assumed equal to a pure evaporation box 1 et can never be considered a pure transpiration as a contribution from the underlying soil will always be present thus the results from box 2 will necessarily be more unreliable in the early crop growth stages and will progressively be closer and closer to a pure transpiration as vegetation density increases in time 4 results in the following section the experiment and modelling results are outlined in section 4 1 the pre processing required to correctly employ the experimental data is detailed in section 4 2 the calibration and validation of the hydrological models is performed section 4 3 and 4 4 delve into model mechanics in terms of soil moisture and energy partition finally section 4 5 compares the disaggregated e and t fluxes from the lysimeter with the modelling results 4 1 experiment data pre processing 4 1 1 thermal camera data and spatial resolution a total of 13 proximal sensing acquisitions have been completed during the monitoring period with a thermal camera each acquisition provided both rgb and thermal infrared data at different resolutions at the camera height above lysimeter level 1 20 m these spatial resolutions amount to 0 39 mm and 1 2 mm respectively with the experimental configuration the area covered by one image is roughly 1200 cm2 around 5 of the whole lysimeter surface this means that a minimum of 19 images are required to fully cover the whole lysimeter however for georeferentiation and mutual correction purposes some overlapping areas had to be maintained among all images the final acquisition scheme has involved four distinct stripes each made up of 5 6 acquisitions for a total of 20 24 acquisitions for each global lysimeter image in fig 5 a and 5b two examples of thermal and visible data are shown it is possible to distinguish the different images that make up the global lysimeter map which have been mosaicked together by using some control points over the lysimeter surface vegetation information fig 5c has been obtained by following the algorithm detailed in appendix a all distributed data have been resampled through simple spatial averages to a 10 cm resolution from their native scale before being fed to the model this allows to achieve various levels of vegetation soil mixing within each pixel thus creating optimal heterogeneity conditions the upscaling for thermal imagery has been performed with simple averages instead of a more accurate radiation inversion method mccabe et al 2008 since in our specific laboratory conditions the two approaches yielded close results on average the absolute difference between the two approaches was 0 22 c with only 1 of the pixels across all images above 1 c in fig 5d an example of final pre processed vegetation map is provided for the example date of july 7th the darker pixels are those that result better aligned with the main vegetated row fig 3 while the lighter ones cover mostly bare soil generally at this resolution no pixel has a definite 0 or 1 vegetation fraction with a good portion roughly one fifth falling close 10 of the 50 mark that represents ideal heterogeneity conditions for the models comparison finally some measures had to be taken to accurately model irrigation distribution their development is characterised in full in appendix b from a posteriori checks irrigation distribution shows some inconsistencies with the one expected from the disposition of the drip line some factors e g the position of the irrigation outlets the unevenness of the lysimeter surface and horizontal soil water transmission contributed to spread out the water distribution to account for these issues modelled irrigation was organized around three main categories figure b 4 1 2 evaporation and transpiration disaggregation a total of 16 weightings were performed during the observation period 3rd june 15th july 2021 42 days marking start and endings of 15 monitoring intervals mis in the first part of the experiment the weightings were performed twice a week with mis lasting 3 4 days in the last part a denser data collection schedule was enforced and the average mi duration decreased to 1 2 days overall the global average interval is 2 78 days all the information about the performed weightings is detailed in table 3 some mis for each box had to be discarded from the analysis as they lacked sm data needed to compute percolation because of sm probes malfunction for all valid mis the weight difference was contrasted to the contemporary percolation and irrigation when present to determine the box et by enforcing a simple mass balance at box level wend wstart δw irrigation percolation et over these mass balances two controls have been performed firstly data about water losses have been contrasted from independent measurements from the successive weightings at beginning and end of each mi and from the sm probes outputs the results have shown low differences between the two most of the time within 0 5 mm d the two data sources seem to be more in agreement for box 1 with an absolute error of 0 57 mm d against the 0 91 mm d of box 2 the second control concerns the relative partition of the water loss between percolation and et as in some instances the modelled percolation values were so high that residual et resulted negative a non feasible scenario in these conditions the saturated conductivity of each box was slightly adjusted to avoid such scenarios finally the results of the disaggregation approaches detailed in section 3 4 are shown in fig 6 dashed black lines highlight the global measurement error propagated to the final water loss error from the measurement uncertainties shown in table 2 and as a result of the disaggregation algorithm 0 12 mm d this propagated error represents an underlying or baseline error that might be expected from the approaches and is presented to highlight how much of each error point can be attributed to measurement errors from the equipment and how much is instead originated in the approach itself as a consequence of imperfect hypotheses both disaggregation approaches seem to provide non negligible uncertainties although the mean absolute errors were contained with 0 56 mm d for the grass to bare g2b approach 0 20 mm d average error and 1 16 mm d for the bare to grass b2g approach 0 42 mm d their variability was quite large with instances in which both approaches surpassed the 1 mm d threshold and peak errors worse than 3 mm d b2g in most cases these uncertainties exceeded the measurement error propagation within the algorithms meaning that some external uncertainties does play a role 4 2 fest ewb and fest 2 ewb calibration on lst both fest ewb and fest 2 ewb models are run for the lysimeter the optimization of the model error function section 2 1 was used for the calibration of both the results are detailed in fig 7 both in form of day by day lumped bias and of average error distribution the overall model errors are quite similar across both models both in terms of average error 1 80 1 9 c for fest ewb and 1 76 1 9 c for fest 2 ewb and pixel wise rmse 2 87 c for both fest ewb and fest 2 ewb in the comparison against the measured lst both models shared a similar slope of the linear interpolation 1 33 for fest ewb and 1 38 for fest 2 ewb and a similar regression coefficient r2 0 71 for fest ewb and 0 70 for fest 2 ewb in terms of spatial distribution some inconsistencies seem to emerge with the radiation distribution as a quasi radial symmetry can be detected with a temperature underestimation in the central part of the image however this estimation errors again seem similar for both models in particular the underestimation errors in the middle of the lysimeter bare a striking resemblance to the shape of the radiometer which is located in that exact point although the pixels directly covering the radiometer were removed during pre processing the resulting data quality may have been negatively affected nonetheless 4 3 soil moisture modelling one of the distinctive features of the fest ewb model structure is that soil moisture is continuously modelled starting from an initial condition by maintaining the energy and water mass balances closure this allows to preserve in the long term the sm dynamics providing physical consistence to the different et estimations in table 4 error descriptors about the modelled and estimated sm data are shown overall both fest ewb and fest 2 ewb seem to positively identify the measured sm dynamics in particular for sm probes 7 bare soil and 6 vegetation in terms of rmse the model performances are also quite good where three probes out of five cluster below 0 04 m3 m 3 a value frequently associated with satellite surface sm accuracy the other two being not far off generally it strikes how the results from the two models are similar which is consistent with the principle of preserving the global status quo among both models in terms of surface temperature global evapotranspiration and soil moisture condition one main concept to retain when looking at these data is that although each sm probe is specifically assigned to one land cover either completely bare or fully vegetated the model pixels with their 10 cm spatial resolution are much more mixed and this means that their values will inevitably be influenced by different land cover types from the one associated to the given sm probe for instance different modelled vegetation degrees from the actual ones relative to the sm probe could cause an excess or lack of transpiration activity causing the soil moisture to deplete more slowly and thus yielding after a few irrigation cycles quite diverging conditions from the initial ones however the low errors allow a positive interpretation of the model results this is consistent with the fact that the amount of sm overestimation is not directly linked to the sm probe land cover with different performances both from the two bare soil probes sm probe 3 registering an average rmse of 0 053 m3 m 3 double that of the other bare soil sm probe no 7 with 0 026 m3 m 3 and the three fully vegetated probes with sm probe 4 scoring the highest rmse at 0 071 m3 m 3 roughly doubling the values from sm probe 6 0 035 m3 m 3 and sm probe 8 0 039 m3 m 3 4 4 relationship between modelled variables in order to provide a further insight into the models functioning a focus on the simulations for midday 1st july 2021 is provided in fig 8 with modelled soil moisture surface temperature and vegetation fraction mapped for all 185 valid lysimeter pixels this instance was within a 5 day period in which no water was provided to the grass and the lights were left on all the time this created stressful conditions for the plant that were aimed at heightening contrast between different areas of the lysimeter three major groups can be identified each clustered around different values of the vegetation fraction these groups correspond to the three main irrigation categories detailed in section 4 1 1 and appendix b the pixels irrigated most frequently dark blue circle are as a result the most vegetated in the light blue circle the pixels receiving lower amounts of water generally show a lower vegetation presence while the pixels to which the least water amount is assigned are enclosed in the yellow circle for each category the most vegetated pixels are oriented towards the lower left edge of the plot towards cooler surface temperatures and lower soil moisture values this means that when any two pixels receive the same water amount a higher vegetation presence because of different sowing distributions determines a higher water consumption through evapotranspiration resulting in lower final sm values as a result the energy demand associated to this water consumption determines the cooler surface temperatures in the analysis of fig 9 a the same modelling time step midday 1st july was chosen to display the differences between the models in terms of relative transpiration t et this was mapped against vegetation fraction together with sm information in the colours for each pixel the distinction between the two models is strongly linked to the vegetation fraction the more extreme the value with fv either nearing one of its limits at 0 or 1 the more the two models tend to converge while the most critical differences appear visible around the intermediate values furthermore the relationship between relative transpiration and vegetation fraction is clear with the former being directly dependent on the latter as the importance of the plant contribution to the total pixel et activity increases with a more consistent vegetation presence in the pixel itself finally in fig 9b the same variables are re arranged to show the relation between relative transpiration and surface temperature the three irrigation categories are again visible with the lower intra category soil moisture contents associated to cooler surface temperatures and higher relative transpirations the different process control from fest 2 ewb provides a different distribution of relative transpiration with lower values than fest ewb as a consequence of the process being powered by tcrop lower than ret for the same reason higher sm values are found in the mid irrigation category with fest 2 ewb as a result of less transpiration and hence water consumption while in the low irrigation category associated with low vegetation fraction values the impact of higher soil temperatures creates drier conditions 4 5 evaporation and transpiration comparison in fig 10 a the total et rate is shown for the nine monitoring intervals mis in which box sm data were available together with measured values corresponding models simulations are shown with both models performing equally good this is consistent with the similar temperature biases shown above in the second panel of fig 10 the lysimeter transpiration rates are detailed the lysimeter values are obtained following g2b approach in section 3 4 and can be higher than the contemporary et values as they refer to rates i e water evaporation intensities per unit area by looking at the model outputs a distinguishable difference now emerges between the two with fest ewb always exceeding fest 2 ewb this is an expected result as the former s transpiration is regulated by ret and the latter s by tcrop which is by construction lower than ret as explained in section 2 2 the important result is that especially in the second part of the experiment from mi 5 onward when vegetation was denser and pixel heterogeneity at its maximum lysimeter data seem to agree more with fest 2 ewb confirming how a two source approach is more suitable in this kind of heterogeneous scenario focusing on the last five mis the mean absolute error with fest 2 ewb is 0 16 mm d while the single source model performs a slightly worse 0 54 mm d in terms of water volumes difference the average fest 2 ewb error amounts to 0 5 lt less than one third of the single source model s 1 8 lt to provide an idea of how much this impacts in the overall water volume economics of our system fest ewb errs daily by roughly 20 of the ordinary irrigation volume fest 2 ewb own error skims 5 5 discussion numerous studies in the literature have successfully employed two source modelling structures in more or less heterogeneous scenarios starting from the two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 and its numerous applications cammalleri et al 2010 2012 colaizzi et al 2012 2014 nieto et al 2019 li kustas et al 2019 the more or less common goal for such modelling structures was the improvement of et estimations khan et al 2021 devised a lai based methodology to develop a two source version of the single source sebs model su 2002 obtaining similar overall evapotranspiration estimations over forests both full and mixed cropland and grassland aguirre garcía et al 2021 and mentioned studies successfully applied two source structures to olive groves in arid environments by exploiting satellite information for vegetation and thermal data input into the model many studies have also focused on the integration of satellite observations in order to obtain more accurate et estimations such as d urso et al 2021 who explored the possible improvements in et estimation in a complex area such as a vineyard by employing a thermal based data fusion approach this article presents a novel version of the well established corbari et al 2011 hybrid source fest ewb model its founding principles are i closure of both water mass and energy balances ii usage of the surface temperature as an internal variable and not as an input iii characterization of the different contributions to the energy balance from different land cover classes within the given pixel all the while maintaining a single energy balance equation these have been preserved when building the novel fest 2 ewb with the aim of further characterizing heterogeneous scenarios and enhancing latent heat and conversely evapotranspiration estimations two additional variables the soil and crop surface temperatures are computed using the same number of inputs as the original fest ewb this has been done by running separate energy balances for the different parts of the given pixel and then identifying a global radiometric type temperature to be representative of the whole pixel this approach labelled as patch uncoupled pu for the energetical independence of the subpixel areas lhomme et al 2012 is opposed to the layered coupled lc one characteristic of other two source schemes such as tseb norman et al 1995 one main driving concept for this adaptation is the fact that using just one global temperature for the computation of the energy fluxes may be seen as an implicit mistake crop temperatures have been found to be generally lower than soil temperatures in heterogeneous scenarios nieto et al 2019 bian et al 2017 and this holds even for more homogeneous crops although with a heavier dependency on the amount of incoming radiation colaizzi et al 2012 if only one representative temperature is used for the computation of the vegetation transpiration this would necessarily be somewhere in between a cooler canopy temperature which powers plant transpiration and a warmer soil temperature which determines water evaporation from the soil as a consequence the transpiration computed based on such a temperature could be overestimated against the actual value for these reasons a full characterization of the sub pixel temperatures would allow a more precise estimation of the irrigation water needs and a curb on irrigation water waste to verify such a claim however it is necessary to employ evaporation and transpiration singled out data in this respect recent years have seen a considerable interest from the scientific community with focus on different variables to extract this information aerodynamic resistances parametrization li gentine et al 2019 mallick et al 2015 isotope tracing or sap flow observations aouade et al 2020 aron et al 2020 employment of co2 concentration observations from ec stations zahn et al 2022 a full overview of similar approaches is available at stoy et al 2019 in this work the necessary data for the validation of the fest 2 ewb modelling framework have been obtained from an experiment conducted at the fantoli laboratory at politecnico di milano using a lysimeter transpiration estimates were obtained by establishing a connection between two control boxes and the whole lysimeter this approach has some limitations and requires a few clarifications the closed quarters of the plastic box hinder both soil heat and lateral soil moisture exchanges for the former separate soil heat flux measurements performed with the soil heat flux plate mentioned in section 3 1 yielded amounts roughly equal to 8 3 w m 2 5 2 of the global net radiation meaning that the absence of such a flux is of light impact to the overall energy balance in terms of lateral soil moisture exchange the small scale and mostly flat scenario of the lysimeter cause this phenomenon to be quite negligible in the water mass balance modelling scheme as both model and box transpiration on which lysimeter transpiration is founded as shown in section 3 4 are associated to negligible lateral soil moisture motion the comparison between the two is actually well founded the accuracies of the et disaggregation approaches was estimated at 0 56 mm d for the g2b approach and 1 16 mm d for the b2g approach in terms of mean absolute error models calibrations results in terms of surface temperature were strong in terms of average model bias 1 80 c for fest ewb and 1 77 c for fest 2 ewb equally for both models an improvement in performances was detected with time and vegetation development potentially something could be perfected in the representation of mostly bare areas while the model accuracy in modelling surface temperatures in complex soil vegetation systems is quite high absolute errors close to 0 c the final comparison of the models was carried out in terms of global lysimeter et and partitioned local transpiration using estimates obtained through a merge of lysimeter and scale weightings and soil moisture retrievals the accuracy of these estimates was quite variable across the different monitoring intervals with an average absolute error of 0 56 mm d these uncertainties stem from the underlying assumptions of the used approaches which have been discussed earlier the better model performances at later monitoring intervals and the more unstable transpiration data in the early period fig 10b could be attributed to the effect of soil evaporation within the vegetated box as plant growth was still incomplete what was considered as pure transpiration was in fact noticeably affected by the soil contribution thus overestimating the water fluxes mediated by plant activity this effect fades off with time as vegetation density increases and consequently t becomes dominant to the global box et output estimated et and t values were compared to their modelling counterparts from both fest ewb and fest 2 ewb provided similar surface temperature outputs both models et errors are small within 0 25 mm d but differ when extracting the transpiration component fest ewb in line with the theoretical expectations produces transpiration estimates higher average absolute error of 0 54 mm d than those from fest 2 ewb which are much more in line with the disaggregated estimates from the lysimeter average absolute error of 0 16 mm d formulating these errors in practical terms the daily transpiration error for fest ewb amounts to 20 of the ordinary irrigation volume whereas fest 2 ewb own daily t error barely skims the 5 by contrasting these results with the ones shown in fig 9 it is evident how such differences increase with the spatial heterogeneity the more inter mixed the pixel vegetation fractions around the peak value of 0 5 cause the models to diverge the most as the assumption of one single temperature representing a diverse pixel is at its weakest the strength of fest 2 ewb is that such considerations involve the inner pixel dynamics not affecting the overall pixel response to the outside inputs e g et lst as shown in fig 10a improvements in model accuracy could be obtained with a separation of the pixel sub areas also in terms of water mass balance which could reproduce more closely the actual in field dynamics however provided the complexity of retrieving disaggregated transpiration data in most model performance studies the model results and the experimental set up are especially valuable as they demonstrate the need for distinguishing intra pixel heterogeneity when dealing with mixed land covers these results are especially valuable for future remote sensing applications fest ewb has already been successfully tested in similar scenarios corbari and mancini 2014b corbari et al 2020 and it shares the main founding scheme with fest 2 ewb distributed structure use of proximal remote sensing data of vegetation and temperature this link allows fest 2 ewb to be intrinsically ready for external environment applications from drone airborne sensing to satellite observations agricultural applications in particular focusing on medium range resolutions 5 100 m in low urbanized soil vegetation systems provide the perfect testing ground in particular for row crops and fruit trees scenarios paciolla et al 2021a another possible field of expansion for fest 2 ewb is the possibility to acknowledge different intra pixel sources for example diverse in terms of phenology e g leaf density growth stage senescence ongoing studies are focusing on this aspect in order to successfully cover more real life conditions e g grass cover crops used in the inter rows of major tree crops the founding aim of fest 2 ewb was to develop more accurate transpiration estimate the added value of our final result was a model that joined the ability to work continuously with easy to retrieve data from the fest ewb scheme and the increased accuracy in plant transpiration of two source approaches in terms of modelling accuracy the enhanced t estimates over those from fest ewb represent a consistent gain in necessary irrigation volumes 15 less in this specific application on the other hand many two source models norman et al 1995 aguirre garcia et al 2021 employ lst data as input and are thus able to work only when these are available or need otherwise to enforce hypotheses to cover the rest of the time like the constant evaporative fraction hypothesis brutsaert and sugita 1992 the time continuous seamless simulation provided by the underlying fest ewb scheme corbari ravazzani and mancini 2011 allows fest 2 ewb to be independent of satellite lst availability extending the advantages of two source schemes to distributed remote sensing driven large scale applications 6 conclusions the necessity of improving the accuracy of hydrological models employed in agricultural management is paramount to the optimization of the water resource the energetical scheme proposed by two source approaches is much closer to reality than that of single source ones in heterogeneous agricultural scenarios in this work a two source version of a well established distributed water energy balance model has been developed its findings in terms of composition of the evapotranspiration flux and its components have been validated employing the data from an experimental activity designed for the purpose using a laboratory lysimeter the transpiration has been found overestimated with respect to the data when modelled using a single source model while the modelling was much more accurate when employing its two source counterpart two source modelling can help provide a more precise estimation of the crop irrigation water needs in particular in heterogeneous agricultural areas with consistent savings in terms of irrigation furthermore the use of continuous modelling water and energy balance models allows to recreate the entire seasonal dynamic of crop growth allowing an accurate representation of the major water and energy fluxes over large areas and without requiring lst

that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix appendix a thermal camera data the thermal information gathered by the camera is in form of upwelling long wave radiation from the lysimeter surface the camera software automatically converts this data in land surface temperature by inverting stefan boltzmann law and employing as surface emissivity an a priori user defined value 0 95 was used for these samplings the single images obtained from the camera were then patched together to obtain a full lysimeter matrix such as the one shown in fig 5 the rgb data on the other hand require a further processing step as the final aim is determining the fractional vegetation cover the following algorithm has been used over each pixel rgb triplet 1 if the green digital number dn is higher than both the red and the blue ones the pixel is classified as vegetated 2 if the highest dn is in the red band the pixel is classified as vegetated only if the green dn is not much smaller than the red one a threshold green red ratio of 0 75 has been chosen after some comparative analyses 3 in all other cases the pixel is classified as non vegetated this follows in the steps of other works which employed vegetation data from rgb images marcial pablo et al 2019 based on similarly constructed indexes like exg woebbecke et al 1995 vig gitelson et al 2002 and cive kataoka et al 2003 the developed algorithm was favoured over others after some inter comparison with some of the above algorithms because of its simplicity and the sufficient accuracy for a relatively coarse resolution 10 cm application such as the one we had designed this work is performed at the high resolution of rgb images 0 39 mm so that the assumption of obtaining only fully vegetated and completely bare pixels can be considered safe as this spatial resolution is comparable with the reference scale of the final object an example of vegetation distribution is visible in fig 5c appendix b irrigation distribution modelling irrigation distribution should have been quite straightforward to model starting from the geometrical outline of the seeded zone 1 and unseeded zone 2 areas as described in the experimental outline in section 3 2 however a combination of factors complicated the final pattern firstly the structural pattern of the drip irrigation line was so that not all outlets were positioned within zone 1 areas blocking with tape the outlets located in zone 2 was only partially effective as some water reached zone 2 nonetheless clearly visible in the focus in fig 3b another cause for zone 2 pixels receiving some irrigation water was the partial unevenness of the lysimeter surface small roughness patches caused some of the water accumulated during irrigation to flow towards zone 2 pixels also visible in fig 3b finally even for drip outlets located within zone 1 horizontal soil water transmission caused the actual irrigated footprint to reach in particular for the heavier irrigations areas within zone 2 in order to account for all these issues the irrigation map has been extracted a posteriori from the last vegetation data attributing more water to the highly vegetated areas fig b1 appendix c soil moisture probes calibration the data from the soil moisture probes has been calibrated using the following procedure firstly with the soil in very dry conditions one undisturbed soil sample was collected in the vicinity of each soil moisture probe using metallic cylinders the sensor output so values from the sm probes during the sampling were also recorded and the cylinders were weighted both at that moment wwet and after 24 h in an oven at 100 c wdry this assured that all the moisture was removed and the weight difference awa allowed to determine the actual water content awc at sampling following equations c 1 c 2 c 1 awa w wet w dry c 2 awc ρ w a w a ρ s w dry where awa is the actual water amount g in the soil sample wwet g and wdry g are the sample weights before and after oven desiccation respectively and ρw and ρs represent the water and soil densities respectively equal to 1 g cm 3 and 1 3 g cm 3 this value being obtained in precedent tests mantovani 2016 a second sampling was taken after heavy irrigation obtaining for each probe another so awc couple the result of this data collection is detailed in fig c1 sm as perceived from the probes results weakly perceptive of extreme either very dry or very wet water contents thus a linear correction quite similar in parameters across all soil moisture probes with the exception of sm probe 5 was enforced for the successive steps in fig c1 b the final soil moisture profiles are displayed the peaks corresponding to the irrigation events also detailed in the figure are quite visible together with different decreasing curves with the steeper ones associated to lights on periods and the milder ones mainly to the weekends appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2023 129265

basu editor in chief with the assistance of vimal mishra associate editor connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts cmhds have changed due to increasingly intensified human activities understanding such changes from an anthropogenic perspective is therefore of critical importance for drought monitoring early warning and adaptation as the second longest river system in china the yellow river basin yrb has been seriously impacted by humans and has a high risk of drought due to its dry climate dense population and massive water demand however the effects of human activities on cmhds in the yrb are still unclear we thus used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized streamflow index ssi to indicate meteorological drought md and hydrological drought hd respectively and analysed cmhds with multiple indicators including trends correlation difference and drought propagation characteristics our results highlighted the heterogeneity of cmhds in terms of subregions and indicators and showed that this heterogeneity was impacted by humans by quantifying the effects of human activities mainly referring to water abstraction and regulation on cmhds in each subregion we found that 1 human activities aggravated the disconnections between md and hd by sharpening the downward trend in the ssi and weakening the correlation amplifying the difference between the spei and ssi and 2 human activities reduced the drought propagation rate from md to hd manifested by a decreased number of hd but a lengthening of the hd duration in addition to the abovementioned effects that were consistent for most of the yrb there were also some effects for example on hd intensity and drought propagation time that differed among subregions and these kinds of diverse responses of cmhds might be related to the various human activities in terms of intensities types and regions by analysing human effects on cmhds this study may be helpful in understanding drought and drought propagation in the anthropocene which is beneficial to watershed management keywords drought propagation meteorological drought hydrological drought human activities the yellow river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is defined as a lack of water compared with normal conditions and can be classified into multiple categories according to its impacts on water related variables or water dependent activities such as meteorological drought stemming from precipitation shortages agricultural drought stemming from soil moisture shortages and hydrological drought stemming from streamflow shortages aghakouchak et al 2021 ault 2020 haile et al 2020 because drought propagates from precipitation deficit to soil moisture and then streamflow through the water cycle hydrological droughts are closely associated with meteorological droughts in multiple aspects such as drought onset duration intensity recovery and termination guo et al 2020 haile et al 2020 with increasing human modifications to hydrometeorological processes and drought propagation connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts cmhds however may be weakened or strengthened compared to those in natural conditions ashraf et al 2019 cheng et al 2019 haile et al 2020 liu et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to quantify these changes in drought relationships while considering human activities the concept of anthropogenic drought has been proposed to highlight the great significance of human modification to drought formation in a coupled human water system and it was defined as a compound water deficit phenomenon that is governed by the combination of both natural and human induced changes aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2016a this is a better framework in which to describe and understand drought as a complex and interrelated process with real world considerations rather than the traditional mainstream view of drought as a product of natural variabilities and out of control of stakeholders thus bringing insight from anthropogenic drought into the cmhds is meaningful to drought forecasting and water management in a human modified world human influences on drought drought propagation and cmhds have been noticed in recent studies at first climate variability and catchment characteristics were the two major drivers of cmhds in research on drought propagation barker et al 2016 yang et al 2017 human activity however has emerged in recent years as another key driver due to its increasing intensity of disturbance in climate land use cover and streamflow aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2016a for example as a consequence of population growth and socioeconomic development an increase in greenhouse gas emissions has led to global warming and regional precipitation variability fischer and knutti 2015 papalexiou and montanari 2019 previous studies proved that these human induced climate changes contributed partly to the changes in droughts in terms of intensity and frequency dai et al 2018 fahimirad and shahkarami 2021 gudmundsson and seneviratne 2016 sun et al 2019 land use cover change is another type of human activity and it influences drought propagation by altering surface properties and eco hydrological processes usually regions transformed from grassland to forest have longer propagation times from meteorological drought md to hydrological drought hd due to the higher water storage capacity of forest compared to grassland xu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 there are also many anthropogenic activities acting directly on streamflow and it affects cmhds by water abstraction and regulation for example irrigation has seasonal effects on streamflow downstream and weakens cmhds by aggravating hd especially in the growth stage of crops traylor and zlotnik 2016 yin et al 2021 dams reservoirs and other human made infrastructure enhance the human capacity for water storage and regulation and thus contribute to meeting the increasing water demand required for socioeconomic development so these structures may alleviate or exacerbate hd and further alter cmhds depending on the specific intentions of relevant stakeholders vicente serrano et al 2017 wang et al 2021a water management policies such as water rights systems water saving measures and water diversion projects also have direct effects on the streamflow and hd of both local and remote basins and alter cmhds through water redistribution in these regions harou et al 2010 liu et al 2015 michelsen and young 1993 wang et al 2019a wen et al 2011 in general there are various human activities affecting hydrological processes reshaping spatiotemporal patterns of water resources and hence influencing streamflow hd and cmhds in direct or indirect ways the yellow river basin yrb located mostly in arid and semiarid regions of northern china and supports a population of 114 million faces great challenge from human and water shortage especially during drought feng et al 2016 wang et al 2018 over the past decades increasing human water demand has put much pressure on the river while the growing capacity of water storage and regulation may relieve this stress by increasing the efficiency of water resource utilization wang et al 2019b however this balance is difficult to maintain under drought conditions for instance although the lower yr dried up intermittently in the 1990 s due to human water consumption upstream this situation was exacerbated by a severe meteorological drought in 1997 that resulted in approximately 90 of the downstream area being without water for a period of 226 days liu and zhang 2002 this was an unmitigated disaster with both natural and human causes and given its huge negative impact on the social ecological environment in the lower reaches it s necessary to carry out extensive research on drought propagation under human intervention and focus on the concrete effects of human on cmhds in the yrb to better understand the importance of human activities on drought propagation two issues need be considered one is how to define cmhds during drought propagation and the other is how to separate the effects of humans from those of nature for the first issue various indicators have been used for cmhds in previous studies fang et al 2020 investigated drought propagation from md to hd using linear and nonlinear correlation between their respective drought indices zhou et al 2021 established the relationship between drought duration severity of md and hd to predict thresholds of drought propagation occurrence and wu et al 2018 compared hd with md in terms of trend drought duration maximum correlation and propagation time these indicators however describe one or two aspects of cmhds and we wondered whether they were comparable and consistent with each other for instance the smaller the difference in trends between md and hd the higher the correlation between them to solve it an integrated analysis framework including indicators such as trends correlation difference drought events and drought propagation is developed in this study to comprehensively assess cmhds and discuss their consistencies in various indicators see methods 3 2 for another common method to quantify human effects on cmhds is making a comparison between natural and human impacted conditions the difficulty of this method lies in defining natural conditions without the influence of human activities and obtaining hydrological data corresponding to such conditions there are several approaches to solve this problem and they can be classified into three categories apurv and cai 2020 guo et al 2021 wang et al 2021b xu et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 paired catchments experiment pre post disturbance and observation modelling for example wang et al 2021b proposed a natural and human impacted catchment comparison approach to distinguish the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation in the laohahe basin and found that climate change shortened the propagation time from md to hd while human activities delayed it guo et al 2021 compared drought characteristics before and after reservoir construction and proved the positive effect of reservoirs on drought tolerance roodari et al 2021 developed a process based distributed hydrological model and considered reservoir operation in the model to simulate the daily discharge of the helmand river basin they found that downstream drought amplification was associated with intensified agricultural activity namely increasing irrigation water demand in this study human intervention has been gradually expanding in most of the yrb since the 1950 s and intensities of human intervention varies in sub regions with different climate and topography so common comparison analyses such as paired catchments experiment or pre post disturbance are not suitable we hence adopt an observation modelling method combined with qualitative and quantitative analyses qualitative analysis is based on a rough comparison among subregions of the yrb to highlight the spatial heterogeneity of cmhds and to prove the existence of human effects while quantitative analysis is through a water balance model which reconstructs streamflow in nature based conditions and compares it with observation to quantify the effects of human activities on cmhds see methods 3 3 altogether aim of this study is to understand cmhds in the yrb with an anthropogenic insight that highlights the role of human activities on water deficit process this is critical for water management and drought adaptation in a human water coupling system in order to better define and assess cmhds with human intervention we develop a comprehensive assessment framework including multifaceted indicators and adopt a comparison method combined with qualitative and quantitative analyses as fig 1 shows we first calculated md and hd based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized streamflow index ssi respectively then assessed and compared cmhds in the yrb and its seven subregions using the comprehensive analysis framework and finally separated the effects of human activities from other effects via a comparison in cmhds between the observed and nature based conditions 2 study area and data the yellow river basin yrb and its seven subregions were the focus of this research fig 2 it is situated in north central china with a total area of 7 52 105 km2 because of the typical monsoon climate strong seasonal differentiation in precipitation and temperature exists in most of the yrb rainy and hot in summer but dry and cold in winter therefore approximately 60 70 of the precipitation falls between june and september in namely the flood season zhu et al 2019 based on the aridity index ai huang et al 2016 the climate in this region ranges from the arid zone 0 05 ai 0 2 in the northwest to the humid zone ai 0 65 in the south and approximately 67 5 of the yrb lies in the semiarid zone 0 2 ai 0 5 accordingly the average annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 1000 mm while pan evaporation varies from 700 to 1800 mm chang et al 2015 the area is divided into seven subregions based on the secondary basin boundary in china https www geodata cn and information on the subregions can be found in table 1 the yrb is well known for its water shortages according to the yellow river water resources bulletin 2020 human water consumption was 435 35 108 km3 in that year accounting for nearly 53 of the total water resources of the region specifically agricultural industrial domestic and ecological surface water consumption accounted for approximately 65 3 10 1 11 1 and 13 5 of the total water consumption respectively there are 37 large 187 medium and many small sized reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 587 108 km3 supporting approximately 84 3 thousand km2 of irrigated land yrcc 2013 the locations of the main reservoirs and irrigated land are shown in fig 2 daily meteorological data including precipitation pre maximum and minimum temperatures atmospheric pressure sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity were collected from 141 meteorological stations in and around the yrb from 1958 to 2016 https data cma cn based on these data we calculated the potential evapotranspiration pet of each station based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 we then used the anusplin interpolation tool to produce 0 1 gridded pre and pet datasets and used the arcgis spatial analyst tools to obtain monthly records of pre and pet of each subregion in this process a digital elevation model of the basin provided by the international scientific data service platform was used and more details are available in wang et al 2021c given the lag effects of md on hd meteorological data should begin two years earlier than the hydrological one so monthly streamflow from gauging stations from 1960 to 2016 was obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission https www yrcc gov cn these stations were located at the entrance and outlet of seven subregions and we defined the streamflow of each subregion as the difference in streamflow between the entrance and outlet yearly human water consumption and partial medium to large sized reservoir water storage data of each subregion were collected from the yellow river water resources bulletin https www yrcc gov cn zwzc gzgb gb szygb and previous research hou et al 2015 hou et al 2013 ran et al 2013 wang et al 2019b xu 2005 one km gridded farmland images were downloaded from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn default aspx liu et al 2014 and an irrigated land dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 083 was provided by siebert et al 2013 3 methods 3 1 drought index and drought event standardized indices were used to identify meteorological md and hydrological hd drought events in order to ensure comparability here we chose the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized streamflow index ssi to represent md and hd respectively beguería et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 vicente serrano et al 2012 we calculated them using the sci package https rdrr io cran sci man sci package html in r 4 0 3 given that a time lag exists between water deficit and drought and that this lag differs by region we set the time scale from 1 to 24 months for the candidate probability distributions of drought indices we evaluated their goodness of fit in the yrb by kolmogorov smirnov anderson darling and shapiro wilk tests details can be found in table s1 and ultimately chose pearson type iii for the spei and generalized logistic for the ssi reasons for the use of the spei and ssi as drought indices as well as the details of their calculation can also be found in wang et al 2021c we defined a drought event as a consecutive period in which drought indices were below a given threshold and we described the drought events in terms of number duration intensity and frequency he et al 2020 wang et al 2018 it is simple to calculate the drought number but if the interval between two drought events is less than or equal to one month we regard them as a single event guo et al 2020 duration is the length of a drought event while intensity is an average of drought indices during the event frequency is defined as the ratio of duration of all drought events to the length of the study period based on these definitions md and hd were identified using the spei and ssi respectively with a threshold of 0 5 guo et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 we also summarized the characteristics of mds and hds including their number average duration and intensity and frequency in each region 3 2 assessment framework for cmhds we assessed three aspects of cmhds trends in the spei and ssi maximum correlation and minimum difference between the spei and the ssi and the similarity in drought characteristics between md and hd trends in the spei and ssi were tested by sen s slope method gocic and trajkovic 2013 sen 1968 while the significance of the trends was assessed by the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 the maximum correlation between the spei and ssi was estimated following a three step procedure 1 calculating pearson s correlation coefficients of the ssi with the spei from a 1 to 24 month lag 2 choosing the maximum from the 24 coefficients and 3 repeating the first two steps to obtain the maximum coefficient of each time scale of the ssi with its corresponding spei the procedure for estimating the minimum difference was similar to that of the maximum coefficient we first calculated the averages of the absolute values of the differences between the time series of a certain time scale of the ssi and the 1 24 month spei selected the minimum from the 24 average values and repeated the first two steps to obtain the minimum difference of each time scale of ssi with its corresponding spei similarities in drought characteristics between mds and hds were assessed by calculating the ratio of the difference between their measures to that of mds these characteristics include not only the abovementioned number average duration average intensity and frequency but also the rate and time of drought propagation from md to hd guo et al 2020 sattar et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 the drought propagation rate was defined as the ratio of the number of mds triggering hds to the total number of mds while the drought propagation time was estimated by the interval between the onset of each md and the corresponding hd it triggered actually the occurrence of drought propagation namely the process of triggering a hd was complicated and we simplified it with two basic criteria 1 there was overlap between the md and hd and 2 the onset of the hd was later than that of the md zhu et al 2019 3 3 reconstruction of streamflow in nature based conditions natural streamflow was reconstructed to quantify human effects on cmhds by comparing cmhds in nature based conditions with those in observed conditions here we calculated natural streamflow by adding human water consumption and reservoir storage change to the observed streamflow eq 1 1 streamflow natural streamflow observed h u m a n w a t e r c o n s u m p r i o n c h a n g e i n r e s e r v o i r s t o r a g e human water consumption comprised agricultural industrial and domestic water consumption while reservoir storage change included storage change in most of the medium to large sized reservoirs regrettably these statistics were available only on a yearly scale therefore we repeated parts 3 1 and 3 2 with streamflow in both nature based and observed conditions because human water consumption and reservoir storage change were associated with water abstraction and regulation which acted on streamflow directly we refer to them collectively as direct human activities hereafter to distinguish them from indirect human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions and afforestation which affected streamflow indirectly through climate or catchment properties therefore the effects of direct human activities on cmhds were quantified based on streamflow in nature based and observed conditions 4 results 4 1 connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts cmhds 4 1 1 trends of the spei and ssi during 1960 2016 both the spei and ssi decreased in the yrb and the rate of decline of the ssi was 5 10 times higher than that of the spei fig 3 for example the spei decreased at a rate of 2 37 10 4 yr 1 at the 1 month lag while the ssi declined at 2 42 10 3 yr 1 p 0 01 at the same time lag as the lag time increased the rates of decline of the spei and ssi rose to 3 90 10 4 yr 1 p 0 05 and 2 86 10 3 yr 1 p 0 01 at the 3 month lag respectively and to 7 47 10 4 yr 1 p 0 01 and 3 43 10 3 yr 1 p 0 01 at the 12 month lag respectively spatially the spei decreased more sharply in the west and south of the yrb than in the north and east while the ssi had a more pronounced downward trend in the east than in the west fig 4 regions iv vi and vii exhibited larger differences in the rates of change between the spei and ssi while regions i and ii exhibited smaller differences unlike the ssi which exhibited a downtrend in all subregions the spei increased in region vi at the 1 and 12 month lags and in region vii at the 1 3 and 12 month lags moreover the regions that exhibited significant trends in the ssi were larger than those that exhibited significant trends in the spei and the number of regions with significant trends increased with increases in the lag time for both the spei and ssi 4 1 2 correlations and differences between the spei and ssi the maximum correlation max cor between the spei and 1 month lag of ssi ranged from 0 10 in region iii to 0 74 in region i fig 5 a while the minimum difference min diff between them ranged from 0 58 in region i to 1 06 in region iii fig 5c in descending order region i had the greatest average max cor 0 81 for a 1 12 month lag followed by regions v 0 65 vi 0 51 ii 0 41 iv 0 40 vii 0 32 and iii 0 21 the average min diff for a 1 12 month lag followed the opposite pattern with the greatest value observed in region iii 1 02 followed by regions vii 0 88 iv 0 85 ii 0 83 vi 0 77 v 0 64 and i 0 49 regarding lag time max cor increased and min diff generally decreased with increasing lag time of the ssi fig 5a and 5c and lag time of the spei with max cor and min diff also roughly increased with increasing lag time of the ssi in all regions fig 5b and 5d 4 1 3 characteristics of drought propagation based on the spei and ssi we further defined meteorological and hydrological drought events md and hd respectively and investigated their characteristics in terms of number duration intensity frequency and propagation compared with md the number average intensity and frequency of hd decreased by 45 92 5 25 and 2 15 respectively while the average duration increased by 61 46 a total of 42 86 of droughts propagated from md to hd and the average propagation time was 0 4 months the above statistics were based on md and hd with a 1 month lag in the entire yrb fig 6 a the number of hds decreased and the average duration increased in all the subregions of the yrb which was consistent with the pattern in the overall yrb but the average intensity and frequency of hds increased or decreased depending on the subregion moreover the longer the lag time was the greater the change observed in almost all drought characteristics fig 6b and 6c 4 2 direct human effects on cmhds for the yrb direct human activities amplified the downward trend in the ssi by 110 53 weakened the correlation between the spei and ssi by 30 38 and exacerbated their difference by 42 86 specifically the rate of decline of the ssi changed from 0 019 yr 1 under nature based conditions to 0 04 yr 1 under observed conditions fig 7 a the correlation coefficient decreased from 0 79 to 0 55 fig 7c and 7d and the average absolute difference increased from 0 49 to 0 70 fig 7e and 7f in subregions the effects of humans on cmhds were generally similar to those on the entire yrb in terms of trend fig 8 a correlation fig 8b and difference fig 8c with the exceptions of regions i and iii in region i there were few changes in the ssi hd and cmhds between nature based and observed conditions due to subtle direct human activities in region iii however the correlation coefficient increased and the difference decreased with the effect of humans while the downward trend of the ssi intensified for drought propagation direct human activities influenced cmhds by avoiding aggravating or alleviating the severity of hd over different periods and regions fig 7b these effects of human activities on hd were specifically characterized by decreasing hd number lengthening hd duration reducing hd frequency and declining drought propagation rate in most of the yrb fig 9 changes in hd intensity and drought propagation time however varied among subregions region i again showed tiny changes in drought characteristics 5 discussion 5 1 multifaceted discrepancies in cmhds controlled by human activities in this study connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts cmhds have been analysed in terms of trend correlation difference and drought propagation but these indicators showed inconsistency with the same region which thus proved the necessity for such multifaceted analyses for cmhds specifically we ranked the seven subregions in order of relevance based on each indicator of cmhds and found that rankings of the same region varied based on different indicators fig 10 a for example among the seven subregions hd in region i had the strongest associations with md with respect to trends correlation difference and propagation rate but their association became looser in terms of drought number duration and other indicators this phenomenon might be a result of the divergent responses of regions to different indicators namely the different aspects of cmhds therefore the analysis of cmhds from multiple perspectives helped us to better understand the relationship between md and hd regional climate catchment properties human activities and their complex interactions work together to shape cmhds the impact of anthropogenic factors is too significant to be ignored aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2016b in this study we distinguished the effects of direct human activities from the others by recalculating cmhds in natural conditions and comparing them with those in observed conditions our results showed that direct human activities decoupled hd from md and weakened their connections in many ways moreover the degrees of the human effects on cmhds varied in the subregions and based on different indicators for instance direct human activities had the smallest influence in region i according to almost all indicators but had greater influence in region vii based only on some indicators such as trend and correlation fig 10b this kind of comparable and multifaceted analysis would be beneficial for stakeholders considering action to improve watershed management 5 2 spatial variety of human effects on cmhds the spatial variety of human activities in intensity and type caused these various and multifaceted effects on cmhds region i for example was the source region of the yrb and suffered the least intensity of human disturbance such as little damming and irrigation with a smaller residential population compared with other regions therefore it ranked last among the seven subregions in fig 10b and exhibited the smallest difference between nature based and observed conditions in with respect to all indicators of cmhds other regions however have been highly affected by human activities and have shown diverse responses to water abstraction and regulation for example region vii which featured the greatest increase in water usage was the worst affected by humans in the drought trend fig 10b and the trend of the ssi in this subregion changed from 0 016 yr 1 in nature based conditions to 0 031 yr 1 in observed conditions fig 8a region ii is characterized by the largest reservoir in the yrb e g longyangxia reservoir with an effective storage capacity of 193 5 108 m3 and therefore has a great capacity to store and regulate water resources according to local hydrological conditions and actual needs guo et al 2021 wang et al 2019b compared with water abstraction which aggravates the downward trend in the ssi this kind of regulation often weakens the correlation and broadens the difference between the spei and ssi so these two indicators in region ii were the most altered by humans among the seven subregions fig 10b overall these regions were all affected by human activities to varying degrees indicated by decreasing ssi smaller correlation and larger difference between the spei and ssi with the exception of region iii fig 8b and 8c region iii exhibited a larger correlation and smaller difference in observed conditions than in nature based conditions and this abnormal phenomenon may be caused by its special landscape pattern where the yellow river flows through the hetao plain with a small catchment area but a large extent of desert oasis and many irrigation channels so ssi in nature based conditions mainly determined by climate only in catchment area had a lower correlation and greater difference with spei than that in observed conditions determined also by climate in a large area of desert and irrigation the response of drought propagation to human disturbance was more complicated than that of trend correlation and difference due to the high sensitivity of drought events to intervention guo et al 2021 van oel et al 2017 wu et al 2019 specifically surface water abstraction for irrigation intensifies or even causes hd in spring when crops grow but reservoir regulation can mitigate or avoid hd by discharging summer floods downstream of the reservoir in autumn wan et al 2017 the influence of this contrasting behaviour of humans on hd may be associated with the ratio of water abstraction regulation to water balance roodari et al 2021 yang et al 2020 that is water management can help alleviate droughts when the fraction of water abstraction is small but if the proportion is too large to be regulated through reservoirs droughts will be intensified this was consistent with our findings in the yrb i e that mild hd could be avoided or alleviated by human activities given its great capacity for water storage and the unified regulation from the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources wang et al 2019b but the severer hd was difficult to avert and always intensified especially in terms of drought duration fig 9 and table s2 this kind of trade off was also modified by and benefited from cross basin water regulation programs such as the south to north water diversion project and the han to wei water transfer project long et al 2020 yang et al 2022 overall cmhds are often weakened by human activities compared to under nature based conditions although the effect of human activities on indicators of cmhds vary 5 3 effects of climate and surface properties of catchments on cmhds climatic condition and surface properties of catchments are two other key driving factors for cmhds barker et al 2016 bhardwaj et al 2020 konapala and mishra 2020 veettil 2020 their influences can be partly inferred from our results for example the ssi had a greater association with the spei in semihumid areas south of the yrb than in semiarid regions northwest of the yrb under nature based conditions fig 8b this is in agreement with results from previous study that focused on drought propagation in different climate regions and attributed this phenomenon to the interaction between precipitation and evapotranspiration ding et al 2021a ding et al 2021b specifically a larger proportion of precipitation was partitioned into evapotranspiration rather than streamflow in drier regions due to the lower soil moisture and higher potential evapotranspiration streamflow therefore came from groundwater for most of the year and ssi responded slowly to spei in actual fact effects of climatic condition are more complicated due to the interaction of wetness or dryness with precipitation seasonality they all work together to determine the groundwater recharge cycle and then the cmhds apurv and cai 2020 apurv et al 2017 surface properties of catchment such as land use cover change causing by large scale ecological restoration and rapid urbanization influence cmhds by altering eco hydrological processes van loon and laaha 2015 wu et al 2018 in general afforestation improves water retention and reduces water yield runoff by reinforced interception and transpiration and thus weakens the relationship between precipitation and streamflow wang et al 2019b urbanization has opposite effects on the relationship because of an increasing impervious surface area comparing with soils and plants impervious surface lacks capacity of water holding which promotes conversion from precipitation to runoff especially in flood periods li et al 2018 sillanpaa and koivusalo 2015 for the yrb both vegetation and building lands have been increased since 1980 s and afforestation plays a more important role in runoff generation due to its larger area ji et al 2022 this effects can be indicated by the decreasing trend of ssi and the weakened cmhds even in natural condition in most of the yrb fig 7a fig 8a fig s1 furthermore we analysed the relationship between ecological restoration measures such as check dam building and afforestation and cmhds in small catchments of the yrb with little human water abstraction and found that they were significantly related with each other or to be more specific correlation between md and hd decreased with a larger area of check dams and a better vegetation condition caused by afforestation fig s2 in short the role of ecological restoration on cmhds is very important for us to fully understand drought propagation in anthropocene and more quantity research should be conducted in future 5 4 implication limitation and future research by quantifying the role of humans in drought and drought propagation this paper sheds light on the features of anthropogenic drought that can help stakeholders or the government make decisions regarding water management in the yrb at different times and in different regions for example the source region of the yrb region i was mostly covered by permafrost alpine meadows and wetlands with an extremely fragile ecological environment as a result it would be very difficult to rehabilitate this region after being destroyed thus only mild intensity human disturbance can be tolerated to preserve downstream water security tang et al 2019 yao et al 2019 other regions of the yrb however are characterized by both ecological e g soil erosion and socioeconomic pressures and hence severe water shortages due to extensive water demand and significant warming but unchanged or even decreasing precipitation wang et al 2021c the balance between socioeconomic development and ecological restoration is therefore of great importance for sustainable development chen et al 2022 feng et al 2016 although efficient water management may be helpful in maintaining this balance its effects on cmhds and other eco hydrological processes deserve more attention especially in the context of global warming with more frequent weather extremes cook et al 2020 on the other hand this study has some limitations and needs more improvements in future research first drought identification methods including drought indices and the definition of drought events have effects on the results tijdeman et al 2018 for example both spei and spi are common for md but we selected spei here considering its advantage that additional information on energy are included energy can be used to indicate atmospheric water demand and this is critical to drought propagation especially in the context of global warming future research can adopt or develop other drought indices or drought identification methods to find a more suitable and simple way to represent drought propagation in the anthropocene which is useful for understanding the diverse responses of droughts to human activities second in addition to direct human activities indirect human activities such as ecological restoration programmes and urban expansion also influence cmhds wu et al 2018 although we have conducted some analyses of their relationship in section 5 3 further quantitative analysis is required to elaborate the role of indirect human activities in cmhds through eco hydrological modelling or the paired watershed method finally changes in cmhds have multifaceted environmental consequences such as the deteriorated water shortage downstream the shrinkage of lakes and wetlands and the health of the aquatic ecosystem aghakouchak et al 2021 haile et al 2020 van dijk et al 2013 so the effects of drought propagation change need to be fully understood in future studies 6 conclusions drought propagation has been influenced by human in the yrb for the past decades but effects of water abstraction and regulation direct human activities on cmhds are unclear in order to solve it we assessed multiple aspects of cmhds such as trend correlation difference and propagation characteristics based on drought indices spei and ssi spanning from 1960 to 2016 and quantified the effects of direct human activities on changes in cmhds by comparing nature based condition with the observed we found that 1 water abstraction and regulation aggravated disconnections between md and hd in most of the yrb except for region i namely the source regions and 2 the effects of direct human activities on cmhds were manifested by sharpening the downward trend in ssi weakening the correlation amplifying the difference between spei and ssi and reducing the drought propagation rate from md to hd although number of hd was decreased average drought duration and intensity have been strengthened in some regions of the yrb this indicates a higher risk of severity drought so better contingency plans and adaptation measures should be developed to combat the rising extreme events with a consideration of the heterogeneity complexity and interaction among subregions moreover these findings contribute to providing anthropogenic insight into cmhds which is vital to drought mitigation and watershed management in a complicated human modified basin credit authorship contribution statement yaping wang methodology

basu editor in chief with the assistance of vimal mishra associate editor connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts cmhds have changed due to increasingly intensified human activities understanding such changes from an anthropogenic perspective is therefore of critical importance for drought monitoring early warning and adaptation as the second longest river system in china the yellow river basin yrb has been seriously impacted by humans and has a high risk of drought due to its dry climate dense population and massive water demand however the effects of human activities on cmhds in the yrb are still unclear we thus used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized streamflow index ssi to indicate meteorological drought md and hydrological drought hd respectively and analysed cmhds with multiple indicators including trends correlation difference and drought propagation characteristics our results highlighted the heterogeneity of cmhds in terms of subregions and indicators and showed that this heterogeneity was impacted by humans by quantifying the effects of human activities mainly referring to water abstraction and regulation on cmhds in each subregion we found that 1 human activities aggravated the disconnections between md and hd by sharpening the downward trend in the ssi and weakening the correlation amplifying the difference between the spei and ssi and 2 human activities reduced the drought propagation rate from md to hd manifested by a decreased number of hd but a lengthening of the hd duration in addition to the abovementioned effects that were consistent for most of the yrb there were also some effects for example on hd intensity and drought propagation time that differed among subregions and these kinds of diverse responses of cmhds might be related to the various human activities in terms of intensities types and regions by analysing human effects on cmhds this study may be helpful in understanding drought and drought propagation in the anthropocene which is beneficial to watershed management keywords drought propagation meteorological drought hydrological drought human activities the yellow river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is defined as a lack of water compared with normal conditions and can be classified into multiple categories according to its impacts on water related variables or water dependent activities such as meteorological drought stemming from precipitation shortages agricultural drought stemming from soil moisture shortages and hydrological drought stemming from streamflow shortages aghakouchak et al 2021 ault 2020 haile et al 2020 because drought propagates from precipitation deficit to soil moisture and then streamflow through the water cycle hydrological droughts are closely associated with meteorological droughts in multiple aspects such as drought onset duration intensity recovery and termination guo et al 2020 haile et al 2020 with increasing human modifications to hydrometeorological processes and drought propagation connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts cmhds however may be weakened or strengthened compared to those in natural conditions ashraf et al 2019 cheng et al 2019 haile et al 2020 liu et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to quantify these changes in drought relationships while considering human activities the concept of anthropogenic drought has been proposed to highlight the great significance of human modification to drought formation in a coupled human water system and it was defined as a compound water deficit phenomenon that is governed by the combination of both natural and human induced changes aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2016a this is a better framework in which to describe and understand drought as a complex and interrelated process with real world considerations rather than the traditional mainstream view of drought as a product of natural variabilities and out of control of stakeholders thus bringing insight from anthropogenic drought into the cmhds is meaningful to drought forecasting and water management in a human modified world human influences on drought drought propagation and cmhds have been noticed in recent studies at first climate variability and catchment characteristics were the two major drivers of cmhds in research on drought propagation barker et al 2016 yang et al 2017 human activity however has emerged in recent years as another key driver due to its increasing intensity of disturbance in climate land use cover and streamflow aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2016a for example as a consequence of population growth and socioeconomic development an increase in greenhouse gas emissions has led to global warming and regional precipitation variability fischer and knutti 2015 papalexiou and montanari 2019 previous studies proved that these human induced climate changes contributed partly to the changes in droughts in terms of intensity and frequency dai et al 2018 fahimirad and shahkarami 2021 gudmundsson and seneviratne 2016 sun et al 2019 land use cover change is another type of human activity and it influences drought propagation by altering surface properties and eco hydrological processes usually regions transformed from grassland to forest have longer propagation times from meteorological drought md to hydrological drought hd due to the higher water storage capacity of forest compared to grassland xu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 there are also many anthropogenic activities acting directly on streamflow and it affects cmhds by water abstraction and regulation for example irrigation has seasonal effects on streamflow downstream and weakens cmhds by aggravating hd especially in the growth stage of crops traylor and zlotnik 2016 yin et al 2021 dams reservoirs and other human made infrastructure enhance the human capacity for water storage and regulation and thus contribute to meeting the increasing water demand required for socioeconomic development so these structures may alleviate or exacerbate hd and further alter cmhds depending on the specific intentions of relevant stakeholders vicente serrano et al 2017 wang et al 2021a water management policies such as water rights systems water saving measures and water diversion projects also have direct effects on the streamflow and hd of both local and remote basins and alter cmhds through water redistribution in these regions harou et al 2010 liu et al 2015 michelsen and young 1993 wang et al 2019a wen et al 2011 in general there are various human activities affecting hydrological processes reshaping spatiotemporal patterns of water resources and hence influencing streamflow hd and cmhds in direct or indirect ways the yellow river basin yrb located mostly in arid and semiarid regions of northern china and supports a population of 114 million faces great challenge from human and water shortage especially during drought feng et al 2016 wang et al 2018 over the past decades increasing human water demand has put much pressure on the river while the growing capacity of water storage and regulation may relieve this stress by increasing the efficiency of water resource utilization wang et al 2019b however this balance is difficult to maintain under drought conditions for instance although the lower yr dried up intermittently in the 1990 s due to human water consumption upstream this situation was exacerbated by a severe meteorological drought in 1997 that resulted in approximately 90 of the downstream area being without water for a period of 226 days liu and zhang 2002 this was an unmitigated disaster with both natural and human causes and given its huge negative impact on the social ecological environment in the lower reaches it s necessary to carry out extensive research on drought propagation under human intervention and focus on the concrete effects of human on cmhds in the yrb to better understand the importance of human activities on drought propagation two issues need be considered one is how to define cmhds during drought propagation and the other is how to separate the effects of humans from those of nature for the first issue various indicators have been used for cmhds in previous studies fang et al 2020 investigated drought propagation from md to hd using linear and nonlinear correlation between their respective drought indices zhou et al 2021 established the relationship between drought duration severity of md and hd to predict thresholds of drought propagation occurrence and wu et al 2018 compared hd with md in terms of trend drought duration maximum correlation and propagation time these indicators however describe one or two aspects of cmhds and we wondered whether they were comparable and consistent with each other for instance the smaller the difference in trends between md and hd the higher the correlation between them to solve it an integrated analysis framework including indicators such as trends correlation difference drought events and drought propagation is developed in this study to comprehensively assess cmhds and discuss their consistencies in various indicators see methods 3 2 for another common method to quantify human effects on cmhds is making a comparison between natural and human impacted conditions the difficulty of this method lies in defining natural conditions without the influence of human activities and obtaining hydrological data corresponding to such conditions there are several approaches to solve this problem and they can be classified into three categories apurv and cai 2020 guo et al 2021 wang et al 2021b xu et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 paired catchments experiment pre post disturbance and observation modelling for example wang et al 2021b proposed a natural and human impacted catchment comparison approach to distinguish the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation in the laohahe basin and found that climate change shortened the propagation time from md to hd while human activities delayed it guo et al 2021 compared drought characteristics before and after reservoir construction and proved the positive effect of reservoirs on drought tolerance roodari et al 2021 developed a process based distributed hydrological model and considered reservoir operation in the model to simulate the daily discharge of the helmand river basin they found that downstream drought amplification was associated with intensified agricultural activity namely increasing irrigation water demand in this study human intervention has been gradually expanding in most of the yrb since the 1950 s and intensities of human intervention varies in sub regions with different climate and topography so common comparison analyses such as paired catchments experiment or pre post disturbance are not suitable we hence adopt an observation modelling method combined with qualitative and quantitative analyses qualitative analysis is based on a rough comparison among subregions of the yrb to highlight the spatial heterogeneity of cmhds and to prove the existence of human effects while quantitative analysis is through a water balance model which reconstructs streamflow in nature based conditions and compares it with observation to quantify the effects of human activities on cmhds see methods 3 3 altogether aim of this study is to understand cmhds in the yrb with an anthropogenic insight that highlights the role of human activities on water deficit process this is critical for water management and drought adaptation in a human water coupling system in order to better define and assess cmhds with human intervention we develop a comprehensive assessment framework including multifaceted indicators and adopt a comparison method combined with qualitative and quantitative analyses as fig 1 shows we first calculated md and hd based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized streamflow index ssi respectively then assessed and compared cmhds in the yrb and its seven subregions using the comprehensive analysis framework and finally separated the effects of human activities from other effects via a comparison in cmhds between the observed and nature based conditions 2 study area and data the yellow river basin yrb and its seven subregions were the focus of this research fig 2 it is situated in north central china with a total area of 7 52 105 km2 because of the typical monsoon climate strong seasonal differentiation in precipitation and temperature exists in most of the yrb rainy and hot in summer but dry and cold in winter therefore approximately 60 70 of the precipitation falls between june and september in namely the flood season zhu et al 2019 based on the aridity index ai huang et al 2016 the climate in this region ranges from the arid zone 0 05 ai 0 2 in the northwest to the humid zone ai 0 65 in the south and approximately 67 5 of the yrb lies in the semiarid zone 0 2 ai 0 5 accordingly the average annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 1000 mm while pan evaporation varies from 700 to 1800 mm chang et al 2015 the area is divided into seven subregions based on the secondary basin boundary in china https www geodata cn and information on the subregions can be found in table 1 the yrb is well known for its water shortages according to the yellow river water resources bulletin 2020 human water consumption was 435 35 108 km3 in that year accounting for nearly 53 of the total water resources of the region specifically agricultural industrial domestic and ecological surface water consumption accounted for approximately 65 3 10 1 11 1 and 13 5 of the total water consumption respectively there are 37 large 187 medium and many small sized reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 587 108 km3 supporting approximately 84 3 thousand km2 of irrigated land yrcc 2013 the locations of the main reservoirs and irrigated land are shown in fig 2 daily meteorological data including precipitation pre maximum and minimum temperatures atmospheric pressure sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity were collected from 141 meteorological stations in and around the yrb from 1958 to 2016 https data cma cn based on these data we calculated the potential evapotranspiration pet of each station based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 we then used the anusplin interpolation tool to produce 0 1 gridded pre and pet datasets and used the arcgis spatial analyst tools to obtain monthly records of pre and pet of each subregion in this process a digital elevation model of the basin provided by the international scientific data service platform was used and more details are available in wang et al 2021c given the lag effects of md on hd meteorological data should begin two years earlier than the hydrological one so monthly streamflow from gauging stations from 1960 to 2016 was obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission https www yrcc gov cn these stations were located at the entrance and outlet of seven subregions and we defined the streamflow of each subregion as the difference in streamflow between the entrance and outlet yearly human water consumption and partial medium to large sized reservoir water storage data of each subregion were collected from the yellow river water resources bulletin https www yrcc gov cn zwzc gzgb gb szygb and previous research hou et al 2015 hou et al 2013 ran et al 2013 wang et al 2019b xu 2005 one km gridded farmland images were downloaded from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn default aspx liu et al 2014 and an irrigated land dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 083 was provided by siebert et al 2013 3 methods 3 1 drought index and drought event standardized indices were used to identify meteorological md and hydrological hd drought events in order to ensure comparability here we chose the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized streamflow index ssi to represent md and hd respectively beguería et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 vicente serrano et al 2012 we calculated them using the sci package https rdrr io cran sci man sci package html in r 4 0 3 given that a time lag exists between water deficit and drought and that this lag differs by region we set the time scale from 1 to 24 months for the candidate probability distributions of drought indices we evaluated their goodness of fit in the yrb by kolmogorov smirnov anderson darling and shapiro wilk tests details can be found in table s1 and ultimately chose pearson type iii for the spei and generalized logistic for the ssi reasons for the use of the spei and ssi as drought indices as well as the details of their calculation can also be found in wang et al 2021c we defined a drought event as a consecutive period in which drought indices were below a given threshold and we described the drought events in terms of number duration intensity and frequency he et al 2020 wang et al 2018 it is simple to calculate the drought number but if the interval between two drought events is less than or equal to one month we regard them as a single event guo et al 2020 duration is the length of a drought event while intensity is an average of drought indices during the event frequency is defined as the ratio of duration of all drought events to the length of the study period based on these definitions md and hd were identified using the spei and ssi respectively with a threshold of 0 5 guo et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 we also summarized the characteristics of mds and hds including their number average duration and intensity and frequency in each region 3 2 assessment framework for cmhds we assessed three aspects of cmhds trends in the spei and ssi maximum correlation and minimum difference between the spei and the ssi and the similarity in drought characteristics between md and hd trends in the spei and ssi were tested by sen s slope method gocic and trajkovic 2013 sen 1968 while the significance of the trends was assessed by the nonparametric mann kendall test mann 1945 the maximum correlation between the spei and ssi was estimated following a three step procedure 1 calculating pearson s correlation coefficients of the ssi with the spei from a 1 to 24 month lag 2 choosing the maximum from the 24 coefficients and 3 repeating the first two steps to obtain the maximum coefficient of each time scale of the ssi with its corresponding spei the procedure for estimating the minimum difference was similar to that of the maximum coefficient we first calculated the averages of the absolute values of the differences between the time series of a certain time scale of the ssi and the 1 24 month spei selected the minimum from the 24 average values and repeated the first two steps to obtain the minimum difference of each time scale of ssi with its corresponding spei similarities in drought characteristics between mds and hds were assessed by calculating the ratio of the difference between their measures to that of mds these characteristics include not only the abovementioned number average duration average intensity and frequency but also the rate and time of drought propagation from md to hd guo et al 2020 sattar et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 the drought propagation rate was defined as the ratio of the number of mds triggering hds to the total number of mds while the drought propagation time was estimated by the interval between the onset of each md and the corresponding hd it triggered actually the occurrence of drought propagation namely the process of triggering a hd was complicated and we simplified it with two basic criteria 1 there was overlap between the md and hd and 2 the onset of the hd was later than that of the md zhu et al 2019 3 3 reconstruction of streamflow in nature based conditions natural streamflow was reconstructed to quantify human effects on cmhds by comparing cmhds in nature based conditions with those in observed conditions here we calculated natural streamflow by adding human water consumption and reservoir storage change to the observed streamflow eq 1 1 streamflow natural streamflow observed h u m a n w a t e r c o n s u m p r i o n c h a n g e i n r e s e r v o i r s t o r a g e human water consumption comprised agricultural industrial and domestic water consumption while reservoir storage change included storage change in most of the medium to large sized reservoirs regrettably these statistics were available only on a yearly scale therefore we repeated parts 3 1 and 3 2 with streamflow in both nature based and observed conditions because human water consumption and reservoir storage change were associated with water abstraction and regulation which acted on streamflow directly we refer to them collectively as direct human activities hereafter to distinguish them from indirect human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions and afforestation which affected streamflow indirectly through climate or catchment properties therefore the effects of direct human activities on cmhds were quantified based on streamflow in nature based and observed conditions 4 results 4 1 connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts cmhds 4 1 1 trends of the spei and ssi during 1960 2016 both the spei and ssi decreased in the yrb and the rate of decline of the ssi was 5 10 times higher than that of the spei fig 3 for example the spei decreased at a rate of 2 37 10 4 yr 1 at the 1 month lag while the ssi declined at 2 42 10 3 yr 1 p 0 01 at the same time lag as the lag time increased the rates of decline of the spei and ssi rose to 3 90 10 4 yr 1 p 0 05 and 2 86 10 3 yr 1 p 0 01 at the 3 month lag respectively and to 7 47 10 4 yr 1 p 0 01 and 3 43 10 3 yr 1 p 0 01 at the 12 month lag respectively spatially the spei decreased more sharply in the west and south of the yrb than in the north and east while the ssi had a more pronounced downward trend in the east than in the west fig 4 regions iv vi and vii exhibited larger differences in the rates of change between the spei and ssi while regions i and ii exhibited smaller differences unlike the ssi which exhibited a downtrend in all subregions the spei increased in region vi at the 1 and 12 month lags and in region vii at the 1 3 and 12 month lags moreover the regions that exhibited significant trends in the ssi were larger than those that exhibited significant trends in the spei and the number of regions with significant trends increased with increases in the lag time for both the spei and ssi 4 1 2 correlations and differences between the spei and ssi the maximum correlation max cor between the spei and 1 month lag of ssi ranged from 0 10 in region iii to 0 74 in region i fig 5 a while the minimum difference min diff between them ranged from 0 58 in region i to 1 06 in region iii fig 5c in descending order region i had the greatest average max cor 0 81 for a 1 12 month lag followed by regions v 0 65 vi 0 51 ii 0 41 iv 0 40 vii 0 32 and iii 0 21 the average min diff for a 1 12 month lag followed the opposite pattern with the greatest value observed in region iii 1 02 followed by regions vii 0 88 iv 0 85 ii 0 83 vi 0 77 v 0 64 and i 0 49 regarding lag time max cor increased and min diff generally decreased with increasing lag time of the ssi fig 5a and 5c and lag time of the spei with max cor and min diff also roughly increased with increasing lag time of the ssi in all regions fig 5b and 5d 4 1 3 characteristics of drought propagation based on the spei and ssi we further defined meteorological and hydrological drought events md and hd respectively and investigated their characteristics in terms of number duration intensity frequency and propagation compared with md the number average intensity and frequency of hd decreased by 45 92 5 25 and 2 15 respectively while the average duration increased by 61 46 a total of 42 86 of droughts propagated from md to hd and the average propagation time was 0 4 months the above statistics were based on md and hd with a 1 month lag in the entire yrb fig 6 a the number of hds decreased and the average duration increased in all the subregions of the yrb which was consistent with the pattern in the overall yrb but the average intensity and frequency of hds increased or decreased depending on the subregion moreover the longer the lag time was the greater the change observed in almost all drought characteristics fig 6b and 6c 4 2 direct human effects on cmhds for the yrb direct human activities amplified the downward trend in the ssi by 110 53 weakened the correlation between the spei and ssi by 30 38 and exacerbated their difference by 42 86 specifically the rate of decline of the ssi changed from 0 019 yr 1 under nature based conditions to 0 04 yr 1 under observed conditions fig 7 a the correlation coefficient decreased from 0 79 to 0 55 fig 7c and 7d and the average absolute difference increased from 0 49 to 0 70 fig 7e and 7f in subregions the effects of humans on cmhds were generally similar to those on the entire yrb in terms of trend fig 8 a correlation fig 8b and difference fig 8c with the exceptions of regions i and iii in region i there were few changes in the ssi hd and cmhds between nature based and observed conditions due to subtle direct human activities in region iii however the correlation coefficient increased and the difference decreased with the effect of humans while the downward trend of the ssi intensified for drought propagation direct human activities influenced cmhds by avoiding aggravating or alleviating the severity of hd over different periods and regions fig 7b these effects of human activities on hd were specifically characterized by decreasing hd number lengthening hd duration reducing hd frequency and declining drought propagation rate in most of the yrb fig 9 changes in hd intensity and drought propagation time however varied among subregions region i again showed tiny changes in drought characteristics 5 discussion 5 1 multifaceted discrepancies in cmhds controlled by human activities in this study connections between meteorological and hydrological droughts cmhds have been analysed in terms of trend correlation difference and drought propagation but these indicators showed inconsistency with the same region which thus proved the necessity for such multifaceted analyses for cmhds specifically we ranked the seven subregions in order of relevance based on each indicator of cmhds and found that rankings of the same region varied based on different indicators fig 10 a for example among the seven subregions hd in region i had the strongest associations with md with respect to trends correlation difference and propagation rate but their association became looser in terms of drought number duration and other indicators this phenomenon might be a result of the divergent responses of regions to different indicators namely the different aspects of cmhds therefore the analysis of cmhds from multiple perspectives helped us to better understand the relationship between md and hd regional climate catchment properties human activities and their complex interactions work together to shape cmhds the impact of anthropogenic factors is too significant to be ignored aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2016b in this study we distinguished the effects of direct human activities from the others by recalculating cmhds in natural conditions and comparing them with those in observed conditions our results showed that direct human activities decoupled hd from md and weakened their connections in many ways moreover the degrees of the human effects on cmhds varied in the subregions and based on different indicators for instance direct human activities had the smallest influence in region i according to almost all indicators but had greater influence in region vii based only on some indicators such as trend and correlation fig 10b this kind of comparable and multifaceted analysis would be beneficial for stakeholders considering action to improve watershed management 5 2 spatial variety of human effects on cmhds the spatial variety of human activities in intensity and type caused these various and multifaceted effects on cmhds region i for example was the source region of the yrb and suffered the least intensity of human disturbance such as little damming and irrigation with a smaller residential population compared with other regions therefore it ranked last among the seven subregions in fig 10b and exhibited the smallest difference between nature based and observed conditions in with respect to all indicators of cmhds other regions however have been highly affected by human activities and have shown diverse responses to water abstraction and regulation for example region vii which featured the greatest increase in water usage was the worst affected by humans in the drought trend fig 10b and the trend of the ssi in this subregion changed from 0 016 yr 1 in nature based conditions to 0 031 yr 1 in observed conditions fig 8a region ii is characterized by the largest reservoir in the yrb e g longyangxia reservoir with an effective storage capacity of 193 5 108 m3 and therefore has a great capacity to store and regulate water resources according to local hydrological conditions and actual needs guo et al 2021 wang et al 2019b compared with water abstraction which aggravates the downward trend in the ssi this kind of regulation often weakens the correlation and broadens the difference between the spei and ssi so these two indicators in region ii were the most altered by humans among the seven subregions fig 10b overall these regions were all affected by human activities to varying degrees indicated by decreasing ssi smaller correlation and larger difference between the spei and ssi with the exception of region iii fig 8b and 8c region iii exhibited a larger correlation and smaller difference in observed conditions than in nature based conditions and this abnormal phenomenon may be caused by its special landscape pattern where the yellow river flows through the hetao plain with a small catchment area but a large extent of desert oasis and many irrigation channels so ssi in nature based conditions mainly determined by climate only in catchment area had a lower correlation and greater difference with spei than that in observed conditions determined also by climate in a large area of desert and irrigation the response of drought propagation to human disturbance was more complicated than that of trend correlation and difference due to the high sensitivity of drought events to intervention guo et al 2021 van oel et al 2017 wu et al 2019 specifically surface water abstraction for irrigation intensifies or even causes hd in spring when crops grow but reservoir regulation can mitigate or avoid hd by discharging summer floods downstream of the reservoir in autumn wan et al 2017 the influence of this contrasting behaviour of humans on hd may be associated with the ratio of water abstraction regulation to water balance roodari et al 2021 yang et al 2020 that is water management can help alleviate droughts when the fraction of water abstraction is small but if the proportion is too large to be regulated through reservoirs droughts will be intensified this was consistent with our findings in the yrb i e that mild hd could be avoided or alleviated by human activities given its great capacity for water storage and the unified regulation from the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources wang et al 2019b but the severer hd was difficult to avert and always intensified especially in terms of drought duration fig 9 and table s2 this kind of trade off was also modified by and benefited from cross basin water regulation programs such as the south to north water diversion project and the han to wei water transfer project long et al 2020 yang et al 2022 overall cmhds are often weakened by human activities compared to under nature based conditions although the effect of human activities on indicators of cmhds vary 5 3 effects of climate and surface properties of catchments on cmhds climatic condition and surface properties of catchments are two other key driving factors for cmhds barker et al 2016 bhardwaj et al 2020 konapala and mishra 2020 veettil 2020 their influences can be partly inferred from our results for example the ssi had a greater association with the spei in semihumid areas south of the yrb than in semiarid regions northwest of the yrb under nature based conditions fig 8b this is in agreement with results from previous study that focused on drought propagation in different climate regions and attributed this phenomenon to the interaction between precipitation and evapotranspiration ding et al 2021a ding et al 2021b specifically a larger proportion of precipitation was partitioned into evapotranspiration rather than streamflow in drier regions due to the lower soil moisture and higher potential evapotranspiration streamflow therefore came from groundwater for most of the year and ssi responded slowly to spei in actual fact effects of climatic condition are more complicated due to the interaction of wetness or dryness with precipitation seasonality they all work together to determine the groundwater recharge cycle and then the cmhds apurv and cai 2020 apurv et al 2017 surface properties of catchment such as land use cover change causing by large scale ecological restoration and rapid urbanization influence cmhds by altering eco hydrological processes van loon and laaha 2015 wu et al 2018 in general afforestation improves water retention and reduces water yield runoff by reinforced interception and transpiration and thus weakens the relationship between precipitation and streamflow wang et al 2019b urbanization has opposite effects on the relationship because of an increasing impervious surface area comparing with soils and plants impervious surface lacks capacity of water holding which promotes conversion from precipitation to runoff especially in flood periods li et al 2018 sillanpaa and koivusalo 2015 for the yrb both vegetation and building lands have been increased since 1980 s and afforestation plays a more important role in runoff generation due to its larger area ji et al 2022 this effects can be indicated by the decreasing trend of ssi and the weakened cmhds even in natural condition in most of the yrb fig 7a fig 8a fig s1 furthermore we analysed the relationship between ecological restoration measures such as check dam building and afforestation and cmhds in small catchments of the yrb with little human water abstraction and found that they were significantly related with each other or to be more specific correlation between md and hd decreased with a larger area of check dams and a better vegetation condition caused by afforestation fig s2 in short the role of ecological restoration on cmhds is very important for us to fully understand drought propagation in anthropocene and more quantity research should be conducted in future 5 4 implication limitation and future research by quantifying the role of humans in drought and drought propagation this paper sheds light on the features of anthropogenic drought that can help stakeholders or the government make decisions regarding water management in the yrb at different times and in different regions for example the source region of the yrb region i was mostly covered by permafrost alpine meadows and wetlands with an extremely fragile ecological environment as a result it would be very difficult to rehabilitate this region after being destroyed thus only mild intensity human disturbance can be tolerated to preserve downstream water security tang et al 2019 yao et al 2019 other regions of the yrb however are characterized by both ecological e g soil erosion and socioeconomic pressures and hence severe water shortages due to extensive water demand and significant warming but unchanged or even decreasing precipitation wang et al 2021c the balance between socioeconomic development and ecological restoration is therefore of great importance for sustainable development chen et al 2022 feng et al 2016 although efficient water management may be helpful in maintaining this balance its effects on cmhds and other eco hydrological processes deserve more attention especially in the context of global warming with more frequent weather extremes cook et al 2020 on the other hand this study has some limitations and needs more improvements in future research first drought identification methods including drought indices and the definition of drought events have effects on the results tijdeman et al 2018 for example both spei and spi are common for md but we selected spei here considering its advantage that additional information on energy are included energy can be used to indicate atmospheric water demand and this is critical to drought propagation especially in the context of global warming future research can adopt or develop other drought indices or drought identification methods to find a more suitable and simple way to represent drought propagation in the anthropocene which is useful for understanding the diverse responses of droughts to human activities second in addition to direct human activities indirect human activities such as ecological restoration programmes and urban expansion also influence cmhds wu et al 2018 although we have conducted some analyses of their relationship in section 5 3 further quantitative analysis is required to elaborate the role of indirect human activities in cmhds through eco hydrological modelling or the paired watershed method finally changes in cmhds have multifaceted environmental consequences such as the deteriorated water shortage downstream the shrinkage of lakes and wetlands and the health of the aquatic ecosystem aghakouchak et al 2021 haile et al 2020 van dijk et al 2013 so the effects of drought propagation change need to be fully understood in future studies 6 conclusions drought propagation has been influenced by human in the yrb for the past decades but effects of water abstraction and regulation direct human activities on cmhds are unclear in order to solve it we assessed multiple aspects of cmhds such as trend correlation difference and propagation characteristics based on drought indices spei and ssi spanning from 1960 to 2016 and quantified the effects of direct human activities on changes in cmhds by comparing nature based condition with the observed we found that 1 water abstraction and regulation aggravated disconnections between md and hd in most of the yrb except for region i namely the source regions and 2 the effects of direct human activities on cmhds were manifested by sharpening the downward trend in ssi weakening the correlation amplifying the difference between spei and ssi and reducing the drought propagation rate from md to hd although number of hd was decreased average drought duration and intensity have been strengthened in some regions of the yrb this indicates a higher risk of severity drought so better contingency plans and adaptation measures should be developed to combat the rising extreme events with a consideration of the heterogeneity complexity and interaction among subregions moreover these findings contribute to providing anthropogenic insight into cmhds which is vital to drought mitigation and watershed management in a complicated human modified basin credit authorship contribution statement yaping wang methodology

2088,estimating urban evapotranspiration et is of great significance for urban water resource allocation and assessing the urban heat island effect however most current urban et models are based on the energy balance theory to estimate urban et these models lead to significant errors in urban et simulation due to the surface heterogeneity and the existence of anthropogenic heat fluxes in urban areas to solve this issue this study proposes a modified machine learning based urban et method that can estimate urban et at the site and regional scales to better characterize the heterogeneity of urban surfaces the flux footprint of in situ et and physical mechanism of et process are integrated into the convolutional neural network cnn model the modified cnn model is tested in a fast developing city shenzhen china based on two eddy correlation ec observations the verification results indicated that coupling flux footprint and physical mechanism into the cnn model could effectively improve the accuracy of urban et simulation at the site scale the modified cnn model significantly reduced the root mean square error rmse of 25 8 w m2 and increased the determination coefficient r2 of 0 17 compared to the cnn o model the cnn o model is defined as the cnn model do not integrate flux footprint and physical mechanism of et further analyses suggested that fusing flux footprint data into a machine learning model helps enhance et estimation in regions with high heterogeneity and highly variable wind directions moreover the integration of physical mechanisms significantly enhanced the model capability to simulate extreme et events the modified cnn model is further applied to map the spatial distribution of urban et and reconstruct long term urban et changes the spatial pattern of urban et exhibited large spatial variability where the urban et in water bodies mean λet larger than 480 w m2 and vegetation covered areas mean λet larger than 260 w m2 are substantially higher than the impervious surfaces mean λet less than 30 w m2 long term trend analyses demonstrated that urbanization resulted in decline in urban et the average decreasing rate of urban et is 1 61 mm yr p 0 05 with a 18 decrease relative to the long term et average the leading causes for the decline of urban et are the increased impervious surfaces and the decreased radiation this study improved the simulation accuracy of urban et and revealed the response of urban et to urbanization keywords urban evapotranspiration flux footprint convolutional neural network eddy correlation urbanization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction more than half of the world population lives in cities and will reach approximately 70 by 2050 li et al 2019 vulova et al 2021 chen et al 2022a b rapid urbanization has significantly changed the regional energy balance hydrological cycle atmospheric thermodynamics and kinetic processes sterling et al 2013 saadi et al 2020 duarte rocha et al 2022 the urban heat island effect uhi defined as the temperature difference between urban and suburban areas is one of the most important issues in maintaining urban sustainability li et al 2019 vulova et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 peng et al 2020 numerous studies have reported that increased urban vegetation soil and water body areas will intensify evapotranspiration et and latent heat flux le which in turn will reduce urban sensible heat flux h and temperature and eventually alleviate uhi e g arnfield 2003 grimmond 2007 li et al 2019 vulova et al 2021 mazrooei et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 chen et al 2022b therefore accurately determining urban et is essential for assessing the regulation function of the et to urban microclimate and thermal environment thus providing scientific advisory for decision makers such as building green infrastructure he et al 2019 liu and jensen 2018 mazrooei et al 2021 furthermore as a vital component of the urban hydrological cycle accurate estimation of urban et is significant for promoting urban water resources allocation and conservation sterling et al 2013 qiu et al 2017a b unfortunately previous et research projects mainly focused on natural ecosystems and cultivated lands only a few studies developed et models for urban areas e g liu et al 2010 qiu et al 2017a faridatul et al 2020 chen et al 2022a b terrestrial et models can be broadly classified as physical mechanism based models pbms e g bastiaanssen et al 1998 norman et al 1995 cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 tian et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 and statistical mechanism based models sbms e g jung et al 2010 tramontana et al 2016 feng et al 2017 karbasi et al 2022 malik et al 2022 jamei et al 2022 the pbms are typically based on energy and water balance conceptualizations or using surface resistance to characterize the et turbulence diffusion process chen et al 2021a b tian et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 while the sbms usually establish the linear nonlinear relationships between the in situ et and various meteorology soil and vegetation variables alemohammad et al 2017 tang et al 2018 karbasi et al 2022 malik et al 2022 jamei et al 2022 for urban et simulation most of the current et models are based on the pbms where the urban et is estimated using the surface energy balance theory e g liu et al 2010 qiu et al 2017a faridatul et al 2020 chen et al 2022a b for example liu et al 2010 proposed a method to estimate urban et using the energy balance equation combined with urban land use and land cover data the model was simplified by qiu et al 2017a b where the urban et is calculated by three temperature 3t conceptualization and thermal infrared remote sensing imagery recently faridatul et al 2020 developed a modified energy balance method for urban et the model is essentially based on the classic surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 to realize the distinguishing of urban et components chen et al 2022a conducted a three source remote sensing model tru for urban area and a four source energy balance fsu model chen et al 2022b although these customized urban models are widely used in et estimation for various urban areas their performances are rather mediocre the rigorous ground validation indicated that the root mean square error rmse for current urban et models are larger than 40 w m2 e g liu et al 2010 chen et al 2022a b a key reason is that the surface energy balance process is perturbed by anthropogenic activities in urban areas including human respiration vehicle exhausts and industrial emissions ichinose et al 1999 pigeon et al 2010 chen et al 2022 the different surface energy balance processes with natural ecosystems cause significant uncertainty in urban et simulation when the conventional energy balance equation is directly applied in urban areas in addition part of the key parameters such as surface resistance involved in the energy balance equation are more challenging to accurately determine as the complex turbulent exchange processes in urban areas holland et al 2008 abdolrahim et al 2017 to this end the sbms seem to be a better alternative in urban et simulation since the pioneering work by jung et al 2010 a large number of researchers applied machine learning models to predict et in natural ecosystems and cultivated lands e g feng et al 2017 tang et al 2018 granata et al 2019 yu et al 2020 yama 2021 these studies usually divided the in situ et and various meteorological soil and vegetation data sets into a training set and a test set jung et al 2010 vulova et al 2021 the nonlinear relationship between the in situ et and various meteorological soil and vegetation variables was established based on the training set and the test set was used to verify the model accuracy under the premise of high quality and large quantity training samples this model conceptualization obtained satisfactory accuracy in et simulation for natural ecosystems and cultivated lands e g jung et al 2010 tsang and jim 2016 nourani et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 however to our best knowledge only vulova et al 2021 used convolutional neural networks cnns and random forest rf to simulate et in berlin germany rarely machine learning based urban et research has been reported such machine learning et models cannot be directly applied in urban areas due to the following limitations 1 the heterogeneity and complexity of the urban surface is significantly higher than that of natural ecosystems and cultivated lands vulova et al 2021 chen et al 2022a b the flux footprints from site scale eddy correlation ec observations in urban areas usually contain flux sources from multiple land uses e g vegetation soil water body and impervious surface holl et al 2020 järvi et al 2012 kordowski and kuttler 2010 vulova et al 2021 therefore site scale et observations can only represent local characteristics of urban et but cannot be generalized to the entire urban area nouri et al 2013 holl et al 2020 järvi et al 2012 furthermore the high heterogeneity of urban surface leads to the in situ et flux footprints varying widely under different wind directions nouri et al 2013 consequently significant errors and uncertainties will occur if the machine learning model is trained directly using site scale et measurements for an urban area 2 the conventional machine learning et models take the best fitting between in situ et and various meteorological soil and vegetation data as the model optimization target however the physical constraints of et such as energy balance and turbulent diffusion are largely ignored previous studies indicated that the machine learning et models could not accurately predict et outside its training regime tramontana et al 2016 nourani et al 2018 moreover these models fail in capturing high and low et values under extreme conditions such as et in extreme cold or hot weather zhao et al 2019 therefore the conventional machine learning et models cannot be directly applied in urban area where the energy transmission and atmospheric turbulence processes are pretty complex considering the limitations of existing machine learning models integrating flux footprints and physical mechanisms into machine learning architecture are highly expect for enhanced urban et simulations urbanization causes natural surfaces to be replaced by impervious surfaces therefore the regional et is anticipated to be reduced under urbanization a recent study suggested that urbanization increased et in arid regions but a decrease in wet regions mazrooei et al 2021 however most other studies have shown that urbanizations have led to a decline in urban et in wet and arid regions carlson and arthur 2000 zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2022 therefore it remains unclear whether urbanization will increase or decrease regional et if the response of urban et to urbanization cannot be accurately identified it will bring greater obstacles to devising various policies and initiatives to mitigate the uhi effect and conserve urban water shenzhen is a coastal city in southern china that has experienced rapid development since the 1990 s xie 2002 ng et al 2011 the impervious surface coverage in shenzhen increased from 2 62 in 1985 to 39 14 in 2020 which raised approximately 15 times within 36 years therefore shenzhen is an ideal region to evaluate the impact of urbanization on urban et however no identified studies have assessed the urban et variations in the setting of a rapidly developing city like shenzhen in order to reduce the uncertainty of urban et simulation and more accurately characterize the responses of urban et to urbanization this study presents the following research objectives 1 to propose a hybrid urban et approach that integrates flux footprint and physical mechanism to the conventional machine learning model 2 to test the performance of the proposed model for urban et simulation based on the ground ec observations in shenzhen china 3 to map the spatial distribution of urban et using the trained machine learning model 4 to reconstruct historical urban et variations and assess the impact of urbanization on urban et 2 methodology 2 1 introduce of convolutional neural network cnn as a variant of the deep learning dl framework cnn is widely used in image processing speech recognition and regression problems e g moen et al 2019 silver et al 2016 aires et al 2021 the specificity of the cnn is that the number of layers in multi layered perceptron mlp is significantly larger than the conventional artificial neural network ann lecun and bengio 1995 therefore the cnn has stronger fitting and regression capabilities compared with the ann but it requires more computing resources than the ann srab et al 2019 wieland et al 2019 moreover the cnn can automatically select relevant variables from a large amount of training data and the contribution of different input variables to the model results can also be differentiated kabir et al 2020 khosravi et al 2020 however the large number of layers involved in a cnn architecture brings great challenges to model optimization for example over thousands of parameters are required to be optimized at the model training stage song 2022 salloom et al 2021 it is well known that the neural network based machine learning models are prone to overfitting problems and convergence of local minima therefore introducing additional knowledge and constraints into the cnn architecture is necessary lecun and bengio 1995 in this study the flux footprint meteorology soil and vegetation variables are fed into the cnn architecture and the final output is the predicted et features are extracted through the convolutional filter kernel and each unit in the convolution layer is linked to the final et outputs pullanagari et al 2021 to improve computing efficiency and prevent overfitting the max pooling technique is applied to reduce the dimensions of the input features after performing the convolution operation pullanagari et al 2021 moreover the relu function is selected as the non linear activation function due to its low computational cost and fast convergence characteristics in learning complex information kabir et al 2020 khosravi et al 2020 cui and tom 2018 pullanagari et al 2021 the mathematical expression of relu function is shown as eq 1 1 r x max 0 x i f x 0 r x 0 x 0 r x x the connect layer of the cnn architecture is presented in eq 2 2 y i i w ij x i b j in eqs 1 and 2 yi represents the output of the jth node wij represents the weight between the ith feature and the jth node xi represents the ith feature bj represents the bias value the stochastic gradient descent sgd algorithm is applied to optimize the cnn architecture where the wij and bj are updated through the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 pullanagari et al 2021 to improve the optimization efficiency the bayesian optimization approach is used to tune the standard hyper parameters such as learning rate η early stopping es weight decay μ momentum υ and dropout δ bergstra et al 2013 srivastava et al 2014 the following introduce the specific operation procedure of bayesian hyper parameters optimization snoek et al 2012 1 setting the variation range of various hyper parameters by trial function and generating 10 000 hyper parameters combinations within the setting interval of hyper parameters 2 setting the probabilistic surrogate model to approximate the objective function and setting the acquisition function to estimate the most likely position of the optimal point the acquisition function represents the posterior distribution of the observed data 3 maximizing the acquisition function and obtaining the next evaluation point 4 evaluating the objective function and updating the probabilistic surrogate model by gaussian process 5 terminating the hyper parameters optimization when the probabilistic surrogate function reaches the maximum value the corresponding hyper parameters combination in this case is selected as the final optimization result the testing results suggest that setting the learning rate as 0 0012 early stopping as a maximum of 150 and the patience as 10 epochs yield to the best et simulation performance finally the cnn ended with a loss layer which is used to quantify errors between analog and real values kording and wolpert 2004 in the present study the ultimate objective is to predict a specific variable i e the urban et consequence the cnn architecture is asked to solve a regression problem therefore the rmse is selected as the loss function to undertake the regression task and quantify the prediction errors 2 2 integration of et physical process to cnn architecture the cnn model only takes the optimal fitting of in situ and predicted et as the model optimization target however as mentioned before this purely data driven model conceptualization fails to capture higher lower et values under extreme conditions zhao et al 2019 furthermore these models perform poorly in urban regions where the surface condition is highly heterogeneity and the atmospheric condition is highly complex vulova et al 2021 to solve this issue the modified penman monteith p m formula is integrated into the cnn model to realize the hybridization of the data driven model and the physical mechanism model the selection of modified p m formula to estimate urban et is based on the following considerations 1 p m formula has a solid physical description of et as the most classic terrestrial et model the p m formula adopt the combined constraints of the energy balance and the conductance process between the ground surface and the atmosphere on land surface et monteith 1965 penman 1948 2 compared with other physical based et models with complex parametric scheme p m formula is easy to apply in urban areas the expression of the p m formula is simple and the model is calibration free so it is convenient and efficient to implement in urban areas with a high degree of heterogeneity 3 the p m formula avoids the use of surface temperature data as model input therefore it can be applied in a wider range of satellites without thermal infrared observations the p m formula has been successfully applied in et simulations under various vegetation types climates irmak et al 2006 and its variants has been widely coupled in various land surface models liang et al 1994 climate models bae et al 2011 and satellite et models mu et al 2011 chen et al 2022 previous studies showed that the most uncertain and sensitive parameter in the p m formula is the surface conductance gsurface which effectively reflect the resistance of water vapor and energy diffusing from the land surface to the reference height schulze et al 1994 stewart 1988 dolman et al 1991 raupach 1995 the value of gsurface is controlled by the meteorological factors soil water content and vegetation property variables a larger gsurface will result a higher et and vice versa previously great efforts have been made to estimate gsurface using different parameterization schemes such as scaling down the potential gsurface to actual gsurface jarvi et al 2011 and estimating gsurface through vegetation photosynthesis models leuning et al 2008 however the complexity and uncertainty of the current gsurface methods are considerable result these gsurface methods cannot be used in urban areas with a high degree of heterogeneity in the proposed hybrid urban et model the flux footprint meteorological soil and vegetation variables are fed into the cnn architecture to predict gsurface then the predicted gsurface is imported into the revised p m formula to compute et further the simulated et is verified with the in situ et and the loss value is obtained through the loss function the loss value gradually reduced through continuous optimization in cnn architecture once the loss value attends the minimum the corresponding et is selected as the final model output otherwise the weight value wij and the bias value bj in the cnn architecture are changed to a revised gsurface value this new hybrid urban et model integrates the p m formula into the loss function of the cnn architecture thus the predicted et is constrained by the energy balance and turbulent diffusion process the expression of p m formula is shown in eq 3 monteith 1965 penman 1948 3 λ e t δ r n g ρ c p e s e a g a δ γ 1 g a g surface where

atmospheric water vapor pressure at the reference height above the et surface hpa ga is the aerodynamic conductance from surface to reference height m s the heat transfer and absorption processes vary widely in different urban land scenarios therefore enhanced parametric schemes of rn and g for urban area are proposed the parametric scheme of rn is shown in eqs 4 and 5 chen et al 2022 4 r n 1 α r s

eq 5 ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index unitless to enhance g simulations in the urban area the urban surface is divided into vegetation coverage and non vegetation coverage areas the specific parametric scheme of urban g is shown in eq 6 where the new method accounts for the different heat transfer capabilities for the two types of urban surfaces bastiaanssen et al 1998 kato and

modified cnn model is given as eq 8 it is pointed out that the eq 8 is nominally identical to the conventional rmse expression however the λetp in eq 8 is estimated by the p m formula combined with the cnn architecture other than the pure cnn architecture that predicts λet based on the optimal fitting conceptualization 8 l o s s λ e t p λ e t 1 n i 1 n λ e t p λ e t 2 where λetp and λet are the

shenzhen which is a coastal city in southern china with the longitude ranged from 113 43 to 114 38 and latitude ranged from 22 24 to 22 52 the total area of shenzhen is 1 997 47 km2 and the total permanent population is 13 43 million shenzhen has a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 22 4 c maximum temperature of 38 7 c july and minimum temperature of 0 2 c february the annual precipitation is 1933 3 mm maximum precipitation record is 2662 mm 1957 and the minimum precipitation record is 913 mm 1963 more than 80 of the precipitation is observed from april to september shenzhen is chosen as the study region due to the following considerations 1 shenzhen has two ec stations which can provide ground et observation data for model training and validation 2 shenzhen has experienced rapid expansion and development in past several decades the impervious surface coverage has increased approximately 15 times over the past 36 years 2 4 data sources and field observation generally the training and validation data of the modified cnn model can be classified into three types these data spans from the field monitoring data to various satellite products 1 in situ urban et and heat flux data 2 the meteorological vegetation and soil data 3 the ec flux footprint data table 2 summarize the various input data sets involved in the training and validation processes of the modified cnn model the following introduces the three types of data sources with detail 2 4 1 flux observation and data processing there are two ec towers within the study area namely yangmeikeng station ymk and chiao station ca the field observations of the two ec stations started from 01 jan 2018 there are approximately 50 000 time step is half hour in situ et flux data points that ensure the machine learning model has large quantity training and validation samples to improve its accuracy ymk is situated in the suburban woodland of shenzhen 22 32 n 114 35 e altitude 115 m height 15 m the surrounding land use is covered by 57 6 artificial secondary forest fv 2 3 impervious surface fi and 40 1 water bodies fw ca is installed in southeast shenzhen 22 39 n 114 22 e altitude 110 m height 20 m its surrounding has mixed reservoirs shrubs and built up areas the land use around ca is characterized by 50 4 fv 27 8 fi and 21 8 fw the geographical location of the two ec stations and the shenzhen land use distribution is indicated in fig 2 the ec systems at ymk and ca stations uses open circuit laser analyzers to observe water vapour and co2 concentration ec150 for co2 and h2o and the three dimensional 3d sonic anemometer is used to simultaneously measure the orthogonal wind components irgason campbell scientific the eddypro software version 5 is applied to calculate the et flux from 10 hz raw water vapour concentration and 3d wind speed data in a time step of 30 min intervals vickers and mahrt 1997 foken and thomas 2016 specifically the pre processing procedures for the original observation data consist of spike removal for high frequency raw concentration data coordinate rotation for tilt correction of raw 3d wind speed data block average for et and heat fluxes at 30 min ultrasound virtual temperature correction air density correction and friction velocity filtering correction moncrieff et al 1997 eichelmann et al 2018 knox et al 2014 furthermore we retained raw data with signal strengths less than 0 8 and instrument diagnostic flags less than 0 we also set a threshold to remove the anomalous et observations i e the et flux data above below 10 times of the mean in situ et flux xenakis 2016 vulova et al 2021 in addition to water vapor and heat flux observations the two ec towers also provided in situ measurements of rn and g with a time step of half hour 2 4 2 meteorological vegetation and soil data collection the various meteorological variables at the ymk and ca stations are continuously observed using an automated meteorological instrument these meteorological elements include rs rl ta u ea relative humidity rh and precipitation p moreover the in situ measurements of soil water content swc and vegetation height hv are also conducted at the two stations the observation frequency of various meteorological factors and swc are half hour and the observation frequency of hv is once every half month the vegetation leaf area index lai is closely related to the vegetation density structure biological characteristics which can well reflect the vegetation photosynthetic and respiration processes knyazikhin et al 1998 unfortunately the two ec sites do not have a long term continuous observation of lai as an alternative lai is extracted from the landsat operational land imager landsat oli at the spatial resolution of 30 m turner et al 1999 the band 3 green band 0 525 0 600 µm band 4 red band 0 630 0 680 µm and band 5 near infrared band 0 845 0 885 µm are pre processed from the raw oli image and the lai is calculated using the spectral statistical analysis ssa method deng 2006 quan et al 2005 furthermore the ndvi at the two stations is also calculated through the landsat oli imagery band 3 and band 4 carlson and ripley 1997 it is pointed that the period of field observation for these meteorological soil and vegetation factors are consistent with the in situ et which started from 1 jan 2018 to the present to reconstruct the long term urban et changes we downloaded and pre processed the historical meteorological vegetation and soil data from several datasets specifically the six meteorological variables from 1990 to 2020 are taken from the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 dataset gelaro and mccarty 2017 and era5 dataset chen et al 2021a b the swc is obtained from a passive microwave remote sensing product soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2009 o neill et al 2010 the lai and ndvi during the period 1990 2020 are downloaded and calculated from the long term landsat observations these satellite sensors span from landsat 5 8 all geographic datasets are resampled and projected to 30 m spatial resolution to distinguish the et spatial distribution for different urban land uses these massive data sets processing and computing are completed on the google earth engine gee platform 2 4 3 flux footprint data the flux footprint at the ymk and ca stations is computed using an analytical footprint model afm for non neutral stratification kormann and meixner 2001 previous studies demonstrated that the afm model could provide more reliable flux footprint estimates than several other flux footprint models based on extensive comparative experiments kumari et al 2020 kong et al 2022 the afm model uses the near surface wind speed profile turbulent diffusion coefficient profile and near surface similarity theory to derive the analytical solution of the flux footprint the specific about the afm model is shown as follows kormann and meixner 2001 it is assumed that the u and turbulent diffusion coefficient k above the ground surface can be approximated in the form of power index shown as eqs 9 and 10 9

60 70 80 and 90 footprint contours are mapped using the afm model it should be noted that the 90 flux footprint line indicates that 90 of the flux contribution comes from the marked area for a specific day kormann and meixner 2001 to better reflect flux footprint exponential decay beyond 50 we calculated multiple flux footprint contours i e 60 70 80 and 90 chu et al 2021 suggested setting the 80 flux footprint contour as the flux footprint threshold due to the area beyond the 80 flux footprint contour having little effect on the et observation results in this study considering the high heterogeneity of the urban surfaces we set this flux footprint threshold value to 90 furthermore to improve the reliability of the flux footprint contour the aerodynamic canopy height is also calculated which has been proved to successfully capture the changes in vegetation status around the two stations pennypacker and baldocchi 2015 2 5 model operation and verification the in situ et and various input data sets at the ymk and ca stations are mixed according to the different observation times where 75 of the dataset is selected to train the model and 25 of the dataset is used for model verification to improve the learning efficiency of the model we normalized 13 input variables according to their mean and standard deviation sd values the cross validation method is applied to verify the model performance to avoid the over fitting problem of the cnn model we used different initial weights to train the model specifically the different initial weights are used to train the model 1500 times and the sd of the 1500 times predictions is determined as the model uncertainty 3 results and analysis 3 1 determination of flux footprint contours figs 3 and 4 displays the spatial patterns of the flux footprint contours estimated using afm model at the ca and ymk stations generally the 60 70 80 and 90 flux footprint contours exhibit approximate an ellipse and symmetry shape centered on the two ec towers for four selected days 18 apr 2020 11 jun 2020 10 aug 2020 and 22 oct 2020 the elliptical and symmetric shaped flux footprint has also been widely reported in other studies e g kong et al 2022 chu et al 2021 furthermore the flux footprint source areas varies widely among the four test days the flux footprint extent ffe defined as the maximum distance from the ec system to the 90 flux footprints contour ranges from 240 390 m during the four days for the ca station 230 400 m for ymk station the flux footprint area ffa defined as the total area from the ec system to the 90 flux footprints contour ranges from 67800 226000 m2 during the four days for the ca station 65000 141000 m2 for ymk station moreover a large discrepancy is also observed for urban land use cover within the 90 flux footprint contour across the selected four days for example the land use coverage within the 90 flux footprint contour at ca station consist of 40 1 fv 56 7 fi and 3 2 fw for 18 apr 2020 while the corresponding values are 55 8 fv 37 7 fi and 6 5 fw for 10 aug 2020 a similar phenomenon also appeared at the ymk station where the 90 flux footprints contour cover 90 0 fv 1 1 fi and 8 9 fw for 18 apr 2020 100 fv 0 fi and 0 fw for 10 aug 2020 the average land use cover within the 90 flux footprint contour across the four test days are 42 7 fv 38 3 fi and 19 0 fw at ca station 71 8 fv 1 6 fi and 26 6 fw at ymk station the high fluctuation in flux footprint contour indicates that the in situ urban et flux contains complex et information from multiple land uses therefore coupling the flux footprint data to the machine learning model can better characterize the in situ urban et flux source and open up the opportunity to improve the urban et simulation accuracy 3 2 model performance evaluation and parameter importance four simulation scenarios are selected to run the modified cnn model to distinguish the effectiveness of coupling flux footprint and the physical mechanism to urban et simulation these four simulation scenarios are 1 the original cnn model without coupling flux footprint and the physical mechanism cnn o 2 the cnn model coupled flux footprint but not coupled physical mechanism cnn f 3 the cnn model coupled physical mechanism but not coupled flux footprint cnn p 4 the cnn model coupled both of the physical mechanism and flux footprint cnn pf the validation results shown in the following context represent the performance of urban et prediction at the site scale the series of in situ and predicted daily λet through the four simulation scenarios during the validation period are presented in fig 5 a fig 5 b shows the taylor plot of statistics for the four simulation scenarios the validation results indicate that all of four simulation scenarios exhibit good skills in capturing the urban λet variations however large performance difference is observed for urban λet prediction when intercomparing the statistics of the four simulation scenarios see fig 5b specifically the cnn pf gets the lowest rmse value and the highest determination of coefficient r2 over the four simulation scenarios which is selected as the champion model the r2 rmse and bias for cnn pf are 0 85 29 4 w m2 and 3 7 w m2 respectively refer to table 3 the cnn f that coupled flux footprint but not coupled physical mechanism exhibit slightly inferior performance to the cnn pf the corresponding statistics are 0 81 37 7 w m2 and 11 8 w m2 for cnn f which ranked the second among four simulation scenarios the cnn p that coupled physical mechanism but not coupled flux footprint ranked the third the cnn p obtain r2 rmse and bias of 0 79 39 2 w m2 and 12 4 w m2 respectively this result confirms that coupling flux footprints exert a more practical function for improving urban et simulations compared with coupling physical mechanism not surprising the cnn o without integrating any modifications performs the worst among the four simulation scenarios r2 rmse and bias are 0 68 55 2 w m2 and 17 3 w m2 respectively to comprehensively evaluate the reproduced urban et accuracy of the cnn pf model we further compare the cnn pf model with four classic machine learning models and two energy balance based physics process models the four classic machine learning models include feed forward neural networks ffnn svozil et al 1997 huang et al 2005 support vector regression svr chen et al 2020 extreme learning machine elm tang et al 2015 and random forest rf mariana and lucian 2016 the two energy balance based urban et models are urban surface energy balance algorithm for land usebal faridatul et al 2020 and three source urban energy balance model tru chen et al 2022 the four classic machine learning models and proposed cnn pf model are driven by the same input datasets moreover the same datasets are also used as the inputs of two physics process based urban et models fig 6 shows the statistics distributions of seven models for λet prediction generally cnn pf provides the most reliable λet estimation among the seven models followed by rf ffnn tru elm svr and usebal the r2 rmse and bias for usebal model are 0 62 70 1 w m2 and 27 7 w m2 respectively which performs worst among the seven models the above model comparison results confirm the advantage and efficiency of cnn pf model over classic machine learning models and physics process based models in urban λet simulation the relative importance of various input variables for urban λet simulates are shown in fig 7 as it can be interpolated from fig 7 the most critical variable for urban λet simulation is rs which explained 85 of urban λet variations the second third and fourth important predictors are lai ndvi and swc with the relative contribution of 82 80 and 76 respectively the lai and ndvi are closely related to the vegetation stomatal impedance thus influencing vegetation transpiration also the swc is linked to the soil surface impedance therefore it governs soil evaporation these three variables present a significant positive relationship with surface conductance gsurface and urban λet for the flux footprint variables the relative importance of fi fv and fw are 72 72 and 70 respectively which ranked at the fifth to the seventh among the 13 input variables the relatively higher importance of the flux footprint parameters well explains the significant enhanced urban λet simulation performance when coupling the fi fv and fw to cnn model however the atmospheric demand parameters exhibit the least influence on urban λet simulations the relative importance of ta for urban λet simulation is 66 with the importance deceases in the order of rl 60 u 55 hv 52 ea 45 and rh 40 the dominant role of ra lai ndvi and swc in natural ecosystems and farmland λet simulations have been widely reported e g zhang et al 2021 anwar 2021 wang et al 2012 cavanaugh et al 2011 which is consistent with the findings presented here for urban areas a notable difference is that some studies suggested that hv is one of the important factors dominating the global λet simulations e g zhao et al 2019 but the higher importance of hv is not observed in the urban λet simulation one possible reason could be that the hv determines the momentum and thermal roughness length parameters thus influencing the water vapour and energy turbulent diffusion process in the natural ecosystems and cultivated lands joffre 1982 molder 1999 demuzere et al 2008 however this vapour and energy turbulent diffusion process in the urban area is not only affected by the vegetation height but also controlled by the building height kanda and moriizumi 2009 to this end coupling urban building height data in the cnn model provides the opportunity to further enhance the urban λet simulation accuracy overall from the above analysis it is concluded that the rs lai ndvi and swc are the most important variables for urban λet simulation followed by flux footprint variables fi fv and fw while the atmospheric demand parameters show the less effect 3 3 comparing with the previous studies advantages and limitations of cnn pf model the rmse of cnn pf model is 29 4 w m2 for urban λet simulation which is lower than most previous urban energy flux studies for example järvi et al 2011 proposed surface urban energy and water balance scheme suews to estimate urban energy balance components the rmse of the suews model for urban λet simulation was 56 w m2 in los angeles and vancouver chen et al 2022a used a three source remote sensing model tru to estimate urban et in tianjin china the ground ec validation results suggested that the rmse was 40 2 w m2 for daily λet simulation rios ramamurthy 2022 developed a new energy balance model to map sensible heat flux h in urban areas based on remote sensing data the rmse was 47 32 w m2 for h simulation in new york city chen et al 2022 conducted a four source energy balance model the rmse for urban λet simulation reached 41 1 w m2 the relatively better performance of the cnn pf model can be attributed to the following advantages 1 the pure data driven model cnn is constrained by the physical mechanism of et the hybrid model framework significantly enhance the generalization potential of pure data driven model which avoid erroneous et estimation under extreme conditions 2 the cnn pf model can automatically learn the in situ flux contributions from multiple surface types by integrating the flux footprint information this enables the cnn pf model to distinguish the different et information from multiple urban surface conditions thereby enhancing the urban et simulation performance 3 compared to the various physics processes based urban et models the cnn pf model has fewer empirical parameters within the model framework this characteristic of the cnn pf significantly reduce the model uncertainty caused by the determination of empirical parameters 4 cnn pf adopt different parameterization schemes of rn and g according to the characteristics of multiple urban surfaces refer to eqs 4 6 which significantly enhance the estimations of rn and g in urban areas 5 the cnn pf model successfully integrates 13 drivers of urban et thus ensuring that the model has a complete physics descriptions of soil vegetation and meteorological processes 6 the cnn pf model can be used for urban et simulation at both site scale and regional scale in case of a high spatial resolution remote sensing image available cnn pf can map the urban et distribution with a spatial resolution higher than 10 m therefore the cnn pf model has the ability to guide urban water resources management and allocation at a smaller spatial scale however the cnn pf model still has some limitations which can be summarized as follows 1 the accuracy of the cnn pf model in urban et simulation largely depends on the quantity of training data sets the et simulation accuracy will decline significantly when there are fewer samples of in situ urban et available 2 although cnn pf model avoids complex parameter calculation to a largest extent the determination of part of atmospheric boundary layer parameters within the model framework still has large uncertainties such as the estimation of momentum and heat roughness length in eq 7 3 the cnn pf requires 13 categories of vegetation soil and meteorology variables as model inputs which may limit the model application in areas lacking field observations 3 4 spatial distribution of urban λet the trained cnn model is further used to map the urban λet distribution based on the various meteorological soil and vegetation datasets it should be pointed out that since there are no flux footprint data available in the urban regions other than the two ec sites hence the urban λet is mapped using the cnn p fig 8 displays the spatial patterns of urban λet in shenzhen for the select six days from different seasons clearly the summer urban λet is significantly higher than other seasons due to higher vegetation cover temperature and radiation which is consistent to the temporal λet patterns in the natural ecosystems and cultivated lands e g cleugh et al 2007 leuning et a 2008 jung et al 2010 seen fig 8 the λet in 10 aug 2020 is higher than the other five days furthermore the urban λet values vary widely for different urban regions the variation range of urban λet are 15 8 499 7 w m2 22 6 488 4 w m2 24 9 502 7 w m2 30 2 531 1 w m2 27 0 522 1 w m2 and 19 3 491 8 w m2 for 04 feb 2020 18 apr 2020 11 jun 2020 10 aug 2020 22 oct 2020 and 04 dec 2020 respectively the large variation range of urban λet could be attributed to the high heterogeneity of the urban surface that contains multiple λet dynamics chen et al 2022a b fig 9 presents the results of urban λet mapping in three typical urban regions of shenzhen 9a large reservoir 9b urban forest area 9c main urban area the urban λet distributions in these typical urban areas can well characterize its large spatial variability generally the higher urban λet value appeared in the urban water body areas and vegetation coverage areas while the lower λet value is mainly distributed in the impervious areas for instance the highest λet is observed in several reservoirs tiegang and xili reservoirs in the west of the city see fig 9a where the λet values in these water body areas are generally greater than 480 w m2 moreover the vegetated areas also exhibit higher λet than the other regions such as the malianshan forest park in the east of the city seen fig 9b the mean λet value in the two forest parks reaches 264 6 w m2 the lowest urban λet is mainly distributed in the central urban areas with a large proportion of impervious surfaces i e buildings roads and traffic areas see fig 9c the λet values in the impervious surface are very low less than 30 w m2 as the impervious surface does not have water detention capacity resulting in no available water for evaporation previous studies also reported the λet in impervious areas tends to be zero or close to zero e g wong et al 2015 kato and yamaguchi 2007 wong et al 2015 demonstrated that λet in impervious areas is below 10 w m2 and the road surface has the lowest λet value kato and yamaguchi 2007 indicated λet in impervious areas to be zero in short the spatial distribution of urban λet illustrates greater spatial variability the water body and vegetated areas have relatively higher λet values than impervious areas where the λet values are close to zero 3 5 impact of urbanization on urban et the long term urban et is reconstructed using the landsat observations and various datasets with cnn p fig 10 a presents the time sequence of monthly et variation during 1990 2020 the mann kendall m k trend analysis method is applied to test the significance of the et temporal trend at the 95 confidence level hamed and rao 1998 gocic and trajkovic 2013 over the past 31 years urban et showed a significant downward trend with rapid urbanization the average downward rate is 1 61 mm yr p less than 0 05 with an 18 decrease relative to the long term et average for 31 years the water unit of et mm is obtained by dividing the energy unit w m2 with the latent heat of vaporization kj kg to investigate the factors responsible for the decline of urban et a correlation analysis is conducted between urban et and fi and rs the scatter plots of the urban et with fi and rs are envisaged in fig 10 b and c generally urban et presents a strong negative correlation with fi correlation coefficient r of 0 76 and a positive correlation with rs r of 0 43 when fi and rs are removed from the original et temporal series the downward trend of the urban et is no longer significant decreasing rate of 0 14 mm yr p 0 05 this indicates that the decline in urban et is caused by the combined effect of increasing in impervious surface areas and the decreasing in radiation furthermore the increased impervious surface area s contribution to the urban et decline is more significant than the decreased radiation in essence the decline in urban et can be explained by the following aspects 1 a large number of natural vegetation and soil covered areas are replaced by impervious surfaces resulting in a decline in regional water holding capacity thus reducing regional et 2 urban cycling exhaust and industrial emissions increase aerosol and particulate matter concentrations result in the reduced atmospheric transmittance and net radiative flux rn the decrease of rn leads to the reduced available energy for evaporation which in turn causes the decline of urban et overall it is found that urbanization led to a decline in regional et the et decline is caused by the joint effect of an increase in impervious surfaces and a decrease in radiation 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness of coupled flux footprints and physical mechanisms for urban et simulations the integration of flux footprints leads to considerable accuracy improvement in the site scale urban et simulations which is even more effective than coupling physical mechanisms in the cnn model this is a remarkable finding since it implies that the uncertainty caused by the model conceptualization is smaller than the uncertainty associated with the spatial mismatch between the in situ flux footprints and estimated et for heterogeneity urban areas previous satellite based et studies in natural ecosystems and cultivated lands emphasized the importance of spatial matching between flux footprints and satellite image pixels when conducting ground validations e g kong et al 2022 chen et al 2022 a b chu et al 2021 kormann and meixner 2001 however these studies only used the flux footprint to enhance the reliability of ground validation rather than coupling the flux footprint to the model conceptualization to improve the et simulation accuracy this research incorporates flux footprints into the machine learning architecture to estimate et which provides a new dimension and solution in machine learning based et estimation approaches the fusion of flux footprint into the cnn architecture is very useful in urban areas due to the high heterogeneity surface and changeable wind direction this implies that the coupling flux footprint will also improve the et simulation accuracy in homogeneous areas such as natural ecosystems and cultivated lands but the magnitude of the improved et accuracy in these areas will be smaller than that in urban areas to further gain insight about the effective of flux footprint on et simulation improvements for different heterogeneous conditions a correlation analysis is performed between δrmse represent the rmse value obtained by cnn o minus the rmse value obtained by cnn f and h index describe the degree of heterogeneity generally a larger h index value means a higher degree of surface heterogeneity and vice versa huang et al 2016 during the 313 test days these 313 test days are selected from the different seasons that have different heterogeneity degrees fig 11 a shows a significant linear and positive correlation between the δrmse and h index r 0 55 this is concrete evidence that fused flux footprint is more effective in the underlying surface with a higher degree of heterogeneity and less effective in the surface with a lower degree of heterogeneity hence seasonality can also impact the effectiveness of the fusion flux footprint to the et simulation accuracy improvement for example the spring and summer with a higher degree of surface heterogeneity will further increase the performance gap between the two methods on the contrary autumn and winter with lower surface heterogeneity will further reduce the performance gap between the two methods in addition to the degree of surface heterogeneity the changeable wind direction is another reason that causes et accuracy improvement when fused flux footprint data to learn the contribution of different wind direction on the model performance improvement a total of 466 test days are randomly selected in which the prevailing wind direction for the 112 test days are 46 e set to case 1 red line marked in fig 11 b and the prevailing wind direction for the remaining 354 test days are range between 0 360 random wind direction set to case 2 blue lines marked in fig 11 b fig 11 b shows the boxplot of the δrmse value distribution for the two simulation cases the average δrmse during the 112 test days for case 1 is 6 7 w m2 range between 4 7 8 6 w m2 and the average δrmse during the 354 test days for case 2 is 24 8 w m2 range between 18 5 30 9 w m2 clearly the δrmse obtained from case 2 is significantly higher than case 1 indicating that the amplitude of model performance improvement under the random wind direction condition is higher than that of a single wind direction condition the coupling flux footprints are more effective for urban areas is mainly because the variation range of wind direction is wider than that in natural ecosystems and cultivated lands as the building shading effect exist in urban areas although the magnitude of the performance improvement for the coupling physical mechanism is slightly smaller than the coupling flux footprint the coupling physics mechanism still significantly improved the accuracy of the original cnn model cnn o according to the verification results in section 3 2 the cnn p effectively reduces the rmse value of 16 0 w m2 and improves the r2 value of 0 11 compared with the cnn o to understand the effectiveness of coupling physical mechanisms for simulation of extreme et events six datasets are selected from the original datasets 1 0 to 1st percentile of ta extreme cold weather 2 45 to 55th percentile of ta normal weather condition 3 99 to 100th percentile of ta extreme hot weather 4 0 to 1st percentile of rs extreme low radiation 5 45 to 55th percentile of rs normal radiation condition 6 99 to 100th percentile of rs extreme high radiation the six datasets are fed into the cnn o cnn p and cnn f and the same measured et data set is used to evaluate three simulation scenarios performance fig 12 displays the heat map of statistical parameters r2 rmse and bias for the three simulation scenarios under the six datasets generally the cnn p outperforms cnn o and cnn f under the four extreme et events the cnn o and cnn f significantly overestimate et in cold weather and low radiation conditions bias of 95 8 w m2 and 88 4 w m2 for cnn o the bias of 93 1 w m2 and 96 7 w m2 for cnn f but significantly underestimate et in hot weather and high radiation conditions bias of 85 4 w m2 and 80 2 w m2 for cnn o bias of 74 6 w m2 and 82 7 w m2 for cnn f as a comparison cnn p successfully predicts et under these four extreme conditions the specific statistics refer to fig 12 nevertheless the three simulation scenarios do not exhibit significant over underestimation behavior under the two regular datasets 45 to 55th percentile of ta normal weather condition and 45 to 55th percentile of rs normal radiation condition seen from fig 12 the bias values for the three simulation scenarios are relatively close under these two regular data sets this indicates that the improvement of model accuracy by coupling physical mechanism is mainly accomplished in predicting extreme et values rather than regular et values in essence the cnn p can well predict urban et under extreme conditions due to the addition of physics process constraints to the model architecture thereby avoiding unreasonable speculation under extreme et conditions however the two simulation scenarios without adding physical constraints cnn f and cnn o simply set the optimal fit of the in situ and predicted et as the model optimization target leading to the model did not learn enough prior knowledge about extreme et events and resulted significant over underestimation to summarize according to the above discussion coupling flux footprint and physical mechanism to the machine learning model is very effective for improving the et simulation accuracy in urban areas however the internal mechanism of these two modifications on urban et simulation performance improvements is completely different the coupling flux footprint is more effective in areas with high heterogeneity and variable wind direction while the accuracy improvement of urban et simulation by the coupling physical mechanism is mainly because the hybrid model can better capture the et variation under extreme conditions 4 2 implications of decline in urban et with urbanization past urban et research also demonstrated that urbanization leads to a decline in urban et for instance carlson and arthur 2000 assessed the impact of urbanization on regional et using the avhrr and landsat tm data reported the et rn decreased approximately 10 in chester county pa from 1986 to 1995 zheng et al 2020 used the mike she model to estimate et in the qinhuai river basin china suggesting that the regional et decreased 7 from 2000 to 2013 due to urbanization recently chen et al 2022b evaluated the urban et variations based on a novel four source energy balance model demonstrating the et in a mega city tianjin china decreased 13 from 1986 to 2021 as a comparison urban et decreased 18 relative to the long term mean et from 1990 to 2020 in shenzhen for the present study the magnitude of the urban et decline in shenzhen is higher than that of the previous studies carlson and arthur 2000 zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2022b an important reason is that shenzhen has been developing faster than these cities in the past several decades as mentioned earlier the impervious surface area of shenzhen has increased approximately 15 times from 1985 to 2020 resulting in a more rapid decline rate in urban vegetation coverage and et values in addition the different start and end years selected for the trend analysis and different model conceptualizations are also reasons for the discrepancies in the decline rate of urban et the decline in urban et has significant impacts on urban water resources management climate and environment first assuming the urban precipitation remain the same a decrease in urban et will cause an increase in urban runoff and infiltration according to the water balance theory nicholson et al 2010 the increased runoff and infiltration in urban areas will put forward a higher standard for the infrastructure design of urban water supply and drainage systems to prevent regional flooding however whether the existing urban drainage infrastructure has the ability to deal with the additional increase in urban runoff and infiltration warrants further investigation second a decrease in the urban et lead to a rise in the urban sensible heat and ta resulting in the uhi effect li et al 2019 mazrooei et al 2021 previous studies have shown that urbanization induce an increase in the et difference between the suburbs and the main urban area which in turn causes the difference in surface cooling effect between the main urban and suburbs areas li et al 2019 chen et al 2022b this difference evaporative cooling effect is thought to be responsible for the urban heat island effect therefore increasing the et of the main urban area can effectively alleviate the urban heat island effect e g arnfield 2003 grimmond 2007 li et al 2019 vulova et al 2021 feasible options for increasing urban et include planting green landscapes and building green roofs to increase vegetation transpiration or constructing landscape water bodies to increase water surface evaporation vulova et al 2021 furthermore the construction of cisterns or rainwater harvesting systems reclaimed water had obtained satisfactory cooling effect after being implemented in some cities furumai 2008 ibrahim 2009 thomas et al 2014 these are all practical measures to increase et in the main urban area and mitigate the urban heat island effect however more irrigation water is required for green landscapes and green roofs bringing new sustainability challenges in urban water resources lastly the reduction of urban vegetation cover and the decline in urban et will alter the vegetation water carbon coupling process in urban areas the decreased urban vegetation cover reduces carbon sequestration capacity leading to higher carbon dioxide co2 concentrations and exacerbating urban warming xie et al 2016 4 3 limitations of the study primary uncertainties and ways forward due to the heterogeneity of the urban surface and the impact of human activities on the regional energy balance it is complicated and challenging to estimate the urban et accurately this study coupled the flux footprint and the physical mechanism to the machine learning model thus providing a promising way in urban et estimation and mapping however large uncertainties still exist in the model conceptualization input data sources and ground ec observations as presented in the following context 1 the big leaf assumption in the p m formula causes uncertainty in the urban et estimates the p m formula considers the soil layer and vegetation layer as a big leaf the et processes in the p m formula is described as the water vapor diffusing from the big leaf to the reference height monteith 1965 penman 1948 however previous studies have shown that the p m formula performs better in areas where the vegetation is evenly and densely distributed but the error is larger in areas where the vegetation is uneven and sparsely distributed stannard 1993 utset et al 2004 although the modified cnn model adopts improved rn and g algorithms in the p m formula the uncertainty still exists when applying the p m formula to highly heterogeneous urban areas to evaluate the effects of rn and g to the et simulation uncertainty the rn and g are multiplied by 1 1 times of their original values and imported into the cnn pf model to simulate λet the results show that when rn and g increased by 1 1 times the simulated λet increased to 108 8 and decreased to 96 6 compared with the original λet estimates the rmse for λet simulation increased from 29 4 w m2 to 32 0 w m2 and 30 4 w m2 respectively to alleviate the et prediction uncertainty caused by rn and g estimates subsequent research can further integrate multi source et physical algorithms into machine learning models to better characterize the complex urban surfaces i e shuttleworth wallace model gong et al 2019 2 uncertainty associated with the aerodynamic conductance ga determination in the proposed urban et model the cnn architecture is applied to estimate the surface conductance gsurface which is considered as the most uncertain parameter in the p m formula however the uncertainty for another conductance parameter in the p m formula ga cannot be ignored to gain the insight of the determination of ga to the et simulation uncertainty the ga are multiplied by 1 1 times of the original value and imported into the cnn pf model sensitivity analysis show that when ga increased to 110 of the original value the simulated et increased to 107 8 and rmse increased from 29 4 w m2 to 31 7 w m2 therefore ga plays an important role in the accurate simulation of et the hybrid urban et model uses a relatively conventional method to estimate ga where the ga is parameterized as a function of wind speed and various thermodynamic and momentum roughness length parameters refer to eq 7 li et al 2005 however due to the presence of tall buildings bridges and traffic areas in urban regions the kinetic process of the water vapor and energy diffusing from the urban surface to the reference height may be different from the natural environment and cultivated lands kusaka et al 2001 kondo et al 2005 the uncertainty may be large that the conventional ga parameterization scheme is applied to urban areas to this end it is necessary and urgent to improve the existing ra parameterization scheme according to the features of the urban surfaces for example the building height and the wind speed at the top building could be integrated into the ga algorithm 3 uncertainties come from training and validation datasets it is well known that the cnn model requires a large number of training samples to improve model accuracy however this characteristic of the cnn model may lead to a large challenge in accurate urban et simulation due to the limited ec observation sites in urban areas when the quantity of training and validation data sets are reduced to 70 of the whole data sets the rmse for λet simulation increased considerable from 29 4 w m2 to 52 1 w m2 this is a solid evidence that the model error caused by the quantity of training data set is even larger than that caused by the determinations of model parameters which confirm the dominance of training data set quantity in accurate et simulation although there are more than 600 flux stations worldwide flux observatories in urban areas are still very rare e g holl et al 2020 järvi et al 2012 kordowski and kuttler 2010 vulva et al 2021 only two ec systems are applied to monitor urban et variation as limited by budget in this study note that shenzhen is one of the few cities with ground ec observations we found less than 75 of the data is available for model training and validation after implementing quality control for the raw ec data therefore the accuracy of the modified cnn model could be further improved if the number of urban ec stations is increased or the observation period is extended to address this issue follow up studies are required to conduct more extensive urban et observations to gain insight into the performance of the modified cnn model 4 uncertainty involved in the various input data sets and ec measurements the modified cnn model fused 13 categories of meteorology soil vegetation and flux footprint data sources however these input data sources have large errors themselves for example dorigo et al 2010 suggested the error of soil moisture active passive swc products ranged 0 017 m3 m3 to 0 019 m3 m3 in a global scale to quantify the impact of different swc data sources to et simulation uncertainties three classic swc datasets are selected to to train and validate the cnn pf model these classic swc datasets include era5 chen et al 2021a b smap entekhabi et al 2009 and japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 dataset chen et al 2014 the validation results show that the et simulation errors range between 32 1 36 8 w m2 among the three swc data sets the smap provide the most accurate et simulation followed by era5 and jra55 these results indicate that different swc data sources have a significant impact on et simulation performance moreover the lai in the study region is estimated using the spectral statistical analysis ssa method and landsat visible light bands deng 2006 quan et al 2005 the uncertainty of the ssa method and landsat observations will result in inevitable errors in the lai estimates the errors associated with the meteorology soil vegetation datasets will lead to large uncertainties in the final et predictions through error propagation besides it shall be reminded that the ec system will also bring significant errors for in situ et due to the non closed energy balance vickers and mahrt 1997 foken and thomas 2016 in the urban region with complex turbulent conditions this energy non closure problem will be more significant than the natural ecosystems and cultivated lands more importantly although coupled flux footprints can significantly improve urban et simulations at site scale such flux footprint information cannot be applied to map urban et distributions since it is unavailable at a regional scale this indicates that the errors in the spatial mapping of urban et may be larger than the site scale urban et estimates for the present study subsequent research is expected to propose a novel statistical method that can amplify the site scale flux footprint to the regional scale based on the spatially wind speed direction which will further improve the reliability of the regional scale et mapping 5 conclusions this study integrated flux footprint and physical mechanism into the convolutional neural network cnn model for simulation of urban evapotranspiration et the daily flux footprint is calculated using the analytical footprint model afm for two ec stations the estimated flux footprint is further fed into the cnn model for urban et prediction moreover the modified penman monteith p m formula is coupled into the rmse loss function of the cnn architecture and it has been realized that the estimated urban et is constrained by the energy balance and turbulent diffusion process the proposed modified cnn model is tested in a fast developing city shenzhen china based on the two ec ground observations long term urban et changes are reconstructed and the response of urban et to urbanization is identified the main findings of the present study are the following 1 the flux footprint in urban areas varies widely on different days due to heterogeneous surfaces and variable wind direction the flux footprint extent ffe ranges from 240 390 m during the four days for the ca station 230 400 m for ymk station the flux footprint area ffa ranges from 67800 226000 m2 during the four days for ca station 65000 141000 m2 for ymk station 2 the integration of flux footprints into the cnn model can significantly improve the accuracy of urban λet simulations at site scale the rmse r2 and bias in urban λet simulation by cnn f are 37 7 w m2 0 81 and 11 8 w m2 respectively the rmse by cnn f reduced 17 5 w m2 and the r2 increased 0 13 compared with cnn o further analyses indicate that the coupled flux footprint is more effective in regions with high heterogeneity and variable wind direction the performance gap between the cnn f and cnn o is positively related to h index and wind direction variation range 3 the integration of physical mechanisms into the cnn model can significantly improve the accuracy of urban λet simulations at both site and regional scales the rmse r2 and bias in urban λet simulation by cnn p are 39 2 w m2 0 79 and 12 4 w m2 respectively the rmse by cnn p reduced 16 0 w m2 and the r2 increased 0 11 compared with the cnn o the accuracy improvement of urban λet simulation by the coupled physical mechanism is mainly because the hybrid model can better capture the λet variation under extreme conditions 4 the rmse r2 and bias in urban λet simulation by cnn pf are 29 4 w m2 0 85 and 3 7 w m2 respectively the rmse by cnn pf reduced 25 8 w m2 and the r2 increased 0 17 compared with the cnn o the simulation accuracy of cnn pf for urban et is better than the several classic machine learning models e g ffnn svr elm and rf models these validation results proves the effectiveness of coupling physical mechanism and flux footprint in urban et simulation 5 the spatial distribution of urban λet exhibits sizeable spatial variability urban λet values are higher in the water body mean λet larger than 480 w m2 and vegetation coverage areas mean λet larger than 260 w m2 in contrast the λet value in the impervious surface is close to zero mean λet less than 30 w m2 due to the limited available water 6 long term trend analysis shows that urbanization led to a decline in urban et the average decreasing rate of urban et is 1 61 mm yr p less than 0 05 with an 18 decrease relative to the long term et average during 1990 2020 the main reasons for the decline of urban et are the increased urban impervious surfaces and the decreased radiation due to cycling exhaust and industrial emissions in addition the decline in urban et is the leading cause of the increase in urban temperature and uhi to effectively reduce the urban temperature and alleviate the uhi

2088,estimating urban evapotranspiration et is of great significance for urban water resource allocation and assessing the urban heat island effect however most current urban et models are based on the energy balance theory to estimate urban et these models lead to significant errors in urban et simulation due to the surface heterogeneity and the existence of anthropogenic heat fluxes in urban areas to solve this issue this study proposes a modified machine learning based urban et method that can estimate urban et at the site and regional scales to better characterize the heterogeneity of urban surfaces the flux footprint of in situ et and physical mechanism of et process are integrated into the convolutional neural network cnn model the modified cnn model is tested in a fast developing city shenzhen china based on two eddy correlation ec observations the verification results indicated that coupling flux footprint and physical mechanism into the cnn model could effectively improve the accuracy of urban et simulation at the site scale the modified cnn model significantly reduced the root mean square error rmse of 25 8 w m2 and increased the determination coefficient r2 of 0 17 compared to the cnn o model the cnn o model is defined as the cnn model do not integrate flux footprint and physical mechanism of et further analyses suggested that fusing flux footprint data into a machine learning model helps enhance et estimation in regions with high heterogeneity and highly variable wind directions moreover the integration of physical mechanisms significantly enhanced the model capability to simulate extreme et events the modified cnn model is further applied to map the spatial distribution of urban et and reconstruct long term urban et changes the spatial pattern of urban et exhibited large spatial variability where the urban et in water bodies mean λet larger than 480 w m2 and vegetation covered areas mean λet larger than 260 w m2 are substantially higher than the impervious surfaces mean λet less than 30 w m2 long term trend analyses demonstrated that urbanization resulted in decline in urban et the average decreasing rate of urban et is 1 61 mm yr p 0 05 with a 18 decrease relative to the long term et average the leading causes for the decline of urban et are the increased impervious surfaces and the decreased radiation this study improved the simulation accuracy of urban et and revealed the response of urban et to urbanization keywords urban evapotranspiration flux footprint convolutional neural network eddy correlation urbanization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction more than half of the world population lives in cities and will reach approximately 70 by 2050 li et al 2019 vulova et al 2021 chen et al 2022a b rapid urbanization has significantly changed the regional energy balance hydrological cycle atmospheric thermodynamics and kinetic processes sterling et al 2013 saadi et al 2020 duarte rocha et al 2022 the urban heat island effect uhi defined as the temperature difference between urban and suburban areas is one of the most important issues in maintaining urban sustainability li et al 2019 vulova et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 peng et al 2020 numerous studies have reported that increased urban vegetation soil and water body areas will intensify evapotranspiration et and latent heat flux le which in turn will reduce urban sensible heat flux h and temperature and eventually alleviate uhi e g arnfield 2003 grimmond 2007 li et al 2019 vulova et al 2021 mazrooei et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 chen et al 2022b therefore accurately determining urban et is essential for assessing the regulation function of the et to urban microclimate and thermal environment thus providing scientific advisory for decision makers such as building green infrastructure he et al 2019 liu and jensen 2018 mazrooei et al 2021 furthermore as a vital component of the urban hydrological cycle accurate estimation of urban et is significant for promoting urban water resources allocation and conservation sterling et al 2013 qiu et al 2017a b unfortunately previous et research projects mainly focused on natural ecosystems and cultivated lands only a few studies developed et models for urban areas e g liu et al 2010 qiu et al 2017a faridatul et al 2020 chen et al 2022a b terrestrial et models can be broadly classified as physical mechanism based models pbms e g bastiaanssen et al 1998 norman et al 1995 cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 tian et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 and statistical mechanism based models sbms e g jung et al 2010 tramontana et al 2016 feng et al 2017 karbasi et al 2022 malik et al 2022 jamei et al 2022 the pbms are typically based on energy and water balance conceptualizations or using surface resistance to characterize the et turbulence diffusion process chen et al 2021a b tian et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 while the sbms usually establish the linear nonlinear relationships between the in situ et and various meteorology soil and vegetation variables alemohammad et al 2017 tang et al 2018 karbasi et al 2022 malik et al 2022 jamei et al 2022 for urban et simulation most of the current et models are based on the pbms where the urban et is estimated using the surface energy balance theory e g liu et al 2010 qiu et al 2017a faridatul et al 2020 chen et al 2022a b for example liu et al 2010 proposed a method to estimate urban et using the energy balance equation combined with urban land use and land cover data the model was simplified by qiu et al 2017a b where the urban et is calculated by three temperature 3t conceptualization and thermal infrared remote sensing imagery recently faridatul et al 2020 developed a modified energy balance method for urban et the model is essentially based on the classic surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 to realize the distinguishing of urban et components chen et al 2022a conducted a three source remote sensing model tru for urban area and a four source energy balance fsu model chen et al 2022b although these customized urban models are widely used in et estimation for various urban areas their performances are rather mediocre the rigorous ground validation indicated that the root mean square error rmse for current urban et models are larger than 40 w m2 e g liu et al 2010 chen et al 2022a b a key reason is that the surface energy balance process is perturbed by anthropogenic activities in urban areas including human respiration vehicle exhausts and industrial emissions ichinose et al 1999 pigeon et al 2010 chen et al 2022 the different surface energy balance processes with natural ecosystems cause significant uncertainty in urban et simulation when the conventional energy balance equation is directly applied in urban areas in addition part of the key parameters such as surface resistance involved in the energy balance equation are more challenging to accurately determine as the complex turbulent exchange processes in urban areas holland et al 2008 abdolrahim et al 2017 to this end the sbms seem to be a better alternative in urban et simulation since the pioneering work by jung et al 2010 a large number of researchers applied machine learning models to predict et in natural ecosystems and cultivated lands e g feng et al 2017 tang et al 2018 granata et al 2019 yu et al 2020 yama 2021 these studies usually divided the in situ et and various meteorological soil and vegetation data sets into a training set and a test set jung et al 2010 vulova et al 2021 the nonlinear relationship between the in situ et and various meteorological soil and vegetation variables was established based on the training set and the test set was used to verify the model accuracy under the premise of high quality and large quantity training samples this model conceptualization obtained satisfactory accuracy in et simulation for natural ecosystems and cultivated lands e g jung et al 2010 tsang and jim 2016 nourani et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 however to our best knowledge only vulova et al 2021 used convolutional neural networks cnns and random forest rf to simulate et in berlin germany rarely machine learning based urban et research has been reported such machine learning et models cannot be directly applied in urban areas due to the following limitations 1 the heterogeneity and complexity of the urban surface is significantly higher than that of natural ecosystems and cultivated lands vulova et al 2021 chen et al 2022a b the flux footprints from site scale eddy correlation ec observations in urban areas usually contain flux sources from multiple land uses e g vegetation soil water body and impervious surface holl et al 2020 järvi et al 2012 kordowski and kuttler 2010 vulova et al 2021 therefore site scale et observations can only represent local characteristics of urban et but cannot be generalized to the entire urban area nouri et al 2013 holl et al 2020 järvi et al 2012 furthermore the high heterogeneity of urban surface leads to the in situ et flux footprints varying widely under different wind directions nouri et al 2013 consequently significant errors and uncertainties will occur if the machine learning model is trained directly using site scale et measurements for an urban area 2 the conventional machine learning et models take the best fitting between in situ et and various meteorological soil and vegetation data as the model optimization target however the physical constraints of et such as energy balance and turbulent diffusion are largely ignored previous studies indicated that the machine learning et models could not accurately predict et outside its training regime tramontana et al 2016 nourani et al 2018 moreover these models fail in capturing high and low et values under extreme conditions such as et in extreme cold or hot weather zhao et al 2019 therefore the conventional machine learning et models cannot be directly applied in urban area where the energy transmission and atmospheric turbulence processes are pretty complex considering the limitations of existing machine learning models integrating flux footprints and physical mechanisms into machine learning architecture are highly expect for enhanced urban et simulations urbanization causes natural surfaces to be replaced by impervious surfaces therefore the regional et is anticipated to be reduced under urbanization a recent study suggested that urbanization increased et in arid regions but a decrease in wet regions mazrooei et al 2021 however most other studies have shown that urbanizations have led to a decline in urban et in wet and arid regions carlson and arthur 2000 zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2022 therefore it remains unclear whether urbanization will increase or decrease regional et if the response of urban et to urbanization cannot be accurately identified it will bring greater obstacles to devising various policies and initiatives to mitigate the uhi effect and conserve urban water shenzhen is a coastal city in southern china that has experienced rapid development since the 1990 s xie 2002 ng et al 2011 the impervious surface coverage in shenzhen increased from 2 62 in 1985 to 39 14 in 2020 which raised approximately 15 times within 36 years therefore shenzhen is an ideal region to evaluate the impact of urbanization on urban et however no identified studies have assessed the urban et variations in the setting of a rapidly developing city like shenzhen in order to reduce the uncertainty of urban et simulation and more accurately characterize the responses of urban et to urbanization this study presents the following research objectives 1 to propose a hybrid urban et approach that integrates flux footprint and physical mechanism to the conventional machine learning model 2 to test the performance of the proposed model for urban et simulation based on the ground ec observations in shenzhen china 3 to map the spatial distribution of urban et using the trained machine learning model 4 to reconstruct historical urban et variations and assess the impact of urbanization on urban et 2 methodology 2 1 introduce of convolutional neural network cnn as a variant of the deep learning dl framework cnn is widely used in image processing speech recognition and regression problems e g moen et al 2019 silver et al 2016 aires et al 2021 the specificity of the cnn is that the number of layers in multi layered perceptron mlp is significantly larger than the conventional artificial neural network ann lecun and bengio 1995 therefore the cnn has stronger fitting and regression capabilities compared with the ann but it requires more computing resources than the ann srab et al 2019 wieland et al 2019 moreover the cnn can automatically select relevant variables from a large amount of training data and the contribution of different input variables to the model results can also be differentiated kabir et al 2020 khosravi et al 2020 however the large number of layers involved in a cnn architecture brings great challenges to model optimization for example over thousands of parameters are required to be optimized at the model training stage song 2022 salloom et al 2021 it is well known that the neural network based machine learning models are prone to overfitting problems and convergence of local minima therefore introducing additional knowledge and constraints into the cnn architecture is necessary lecun and bengio 1995 in this study the flux footprint meteorology soil and vegetation variables are fed into the cnn architecture and the final output is the predicted et features are extracted through the convolutional filter kernel and each unit in the convolution layer is linked to the final et outputs pullanagari et al 2021 to improve computing efficiency and prevent overfitting the max pooling technique is applied to reduce the dimensions of the input features after performing the convolution operation pullanagari et al 2021 moreover the relu function is selected as the non linear activation function due to its low computational cost and fast convergence characteristics in learning complex information kabir et al 2020 khosravi et al 2020 cui and tom 2018 pullanagari et al 2021 the mathematical expression of relu function is shown as eq 1 1 r x max 0 x i f x 0 r x 0 x 0 r x x the connect layer of the cnn architecture is presented in eq 2 2 y i i w ij x i b j in eqs 1 and 2 yi represents the output of the jth node wij represents the weight between the ith feature and the jth node xi represents the ith feature bj represents the bias value the stochastic gradient descent sgd algorithm is applied to optimize the cnn architecture where the wij and bj are updated through the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 pullanagari et al 2021 to improve the optimization efficiency the bayesian optimization approach is used to tune the standard hyper parameters such as learning rate η early stopping es weight decay μ momentum υ and dropout δ bergstra et al 2013 srivastava et al 2014 the following introduce the specific operation procedure of bayesian hyper parameters optimization snoek et al 2012 1 setting the variation range of various hyper parameters by trial function and generating 10 000 hyper parameters combinations within the setting interval of hyper parameters 2 setting the probabilistic surrogate model to approximate the objective function and setting the acquisition function to estimate the most likely position of the optimal point the acquisition function represents the posterior distribution of the observed data 3 maximizing the acquisition function and obtaining the next evaluation point 4 evaluating the objective function and updating the probabilistic surrogate model by gaussian process 5 terminating the hyper parameters optimization when the probabilistic surrogate function reaches the maximum value the corresponding hyper parameters combination in this case is selected as the final optimization result the testing results suggest that setting the learning rate as 0 0012 early stopping as a maximum of 150 and the patience as 10 epochs yield to the best et simulation performance finally the cnn ended with a loss layer which is used to quantify errors between analog and real values kording and wolpert 2004 in the present study the ultimate objective is to predict a specific variable i e the urban et consequence the cnn architecture is asked to solve a regression problem therefore the rmse is selected as the loss function to undertake the regression task and quantify the prediction errors 2 2 integration of et physical process to cnn architecture the cnn model only takes the optimal fitting of in situ and predicted et as the model optimization target however as mentioned before this purely data driven model conceptualization fails to capture higher lower et values under extreme conditions zhao et al 2019 furthermore these models perform poorly in urban regions where the surface condition is highly heterogeneity and the atmospheric condition is highly complex vulova et al 2021 to solve this issue the modified penman monteith p m formula is integrated into the cnn model to realize the hybridization of the data driven model and the physical mechanism model the selection of modified p m formula to estimate urban et is based on the following considerations 1 p m formula has a solid physical description of et as the most classic terrestrial et model the p m formula adopt the combined constraints of the energy balance and the conductance process between the ground surface and the atmosphere on land surface et monteith 1965 penman 1948 2 compared with other physical based et models with complex parametric scheme p m formula is easy to apply in urban areas the expression of the p m formula is simple and the model is calibration free so it is convenient and efficient to implement in urban areas with a high degree of heterogeneity 3 the p m formula avoids the use of surface temperature data as model input therefore it can be applied in a wider range of satellites without thermal infrared observations the p m formula has been successfully applied in et simulations under various vegetation types climates irmak et al 2006 and its variants has been widely coupled in various land surface models liang et al 1994 climate models bae et al 2011 and satellite et models mu et al 2011 chen et al 2022 previous studies showed that the most uncertain and sensitive parameter in the p m formula is the surface conductance gsurface which effectively reflect the resistance of water vapor and energy diffusing from the land surface to the reference height schulze et al 1994 stewart 1988 dolman et al 1991 raupach 1995 the value of gsurface is controlled by the meteorological factors soil water content and vegetation property variables a larger gsurface will result a higher et and vice versa previously great efforts have been made to estimate gsurface using different parameterization schemes such as scaling down the potential gsurface to actual gsurface jarvi et al 2011 and estimating gsurface through vegetation photosynthesis models leuning et al 2008 however the complexity and uncertainty of the current gsurface methods are considerable result these gsurface methods cannot be used in urban areas with a high degree of heterogeneity in the proposed hybrid urban et model the flux footprint meteorological soil and vegetation variables are fed into the cnn architecture to predict gsurface then the predicted gsurface is imported into the revised p m formula to compute et further the simulated et is verified with the in situ et and the loss value is obtained through the loss function the loss value gradually reduced through continuous optimization in cnn architecture once the loss value attends the minimum the corresponding et is selected as the final model output otherwise the weight value wij and the bias value bj in the cnn architecture are changed to a revised gsurface value this new hybrid urban et model integrates the p m formula into the loss function of the cnn architecture thus the predicted et is constrained by the energy balance and turbulent diffusion process the expression of p m formula is shown in eq 3 monteith 1965 penman 1948 3 λ e t δ r n g ρ c p e s e a g a δ γ 1 g a g surface where

atmospheric water vapor pressure at the reference height above the et surface hpa ga is the aerodynamic conductance from surface to reference height m s the heat transfer and absorption processes vary widely in different urban land scenarios therefore enhanced parametric schemes of rn and g for urban area are proposed the parametric scheme of rn is shown in eqs 4 and 5 chen et al 2022 4 r n 1 α r s

modified cnn model is given as eq 8 it is pointed out that the eq 8 is nominally identical to the conventional rmse expression however the λetp in eq 8 is estimated by the p m formula combined with

shenzhen which is a coastal city in southern china with the longitude ranged from 113 43 to 114 38 and latitude ranged from 22 24 to 22 52 the total area of shenzhen is 1 997 47 km2 and the total permanent population is 13 43 million shenzhen has a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 22 4 c maximum temperature of 38 7 c july and minimum temperature of 0 2 c february the annual precipitation is 1933 3 mm maximum precipitation record is 2662 mm 1957 and the minimum precipitation record is 913 mm 1963 more than 80 of the precipitation is observed from april to september shenzhen is chosen as the study region due to the following considerations 1 shenzhen has two ec stations which can provide ground et observation data for model training and validation 2 shenzhen has experienced rapid expansion and development in past several decades the impervious surface coverage has increased approximately 15 times over the past 36 years 2 4 data sources and field observation generally the training and validation data of the modified cnn model can be classified into three types these data spans from the field monitoring data to various satellite products 1 in situ urban et and heat flux data 2 the meteorological vegetation and soil data 3 the ec flux footprint data table 2 summarize the various input data sets involved in the training and validation processes of the modified cnn model the following introduces the three types of data sources with detail 2 4 1 flux observation and data processing there are two ec towers within the study area namely yangmeikeng station ymk and chiao station ca the field observations of the two ec stations started from 01 jan 2018 there are approximately 50 000 time step is half hour in situ et flux data points that ensure the machine learning model has large quantity training and validation samples to improve its accuracy ymk is situated in the suburban woodland of shenzhen 22 32 n 114 35 e altitude 115 m height 15 m the surrounding land use is covered by 57 6 artificial secondary forest fv 2 3 impervious surface fi and 40 1 water bodies fw ca is installed in southeast shenzhen 22 39 n 114 22 e altitude 110 m height 20 m its surrounding has mixed reservoirs shrubs and built up areas the land use around ca is characterized by 50 4 fv 27 8 fi and 21 8 fw the geographical location of the two ec stations and the shenzhen land use distribution is indicated in fig 2 the ec systems at ymk and ca stations uses open circuit laser analyzers to observe water vapour and co2 concentration ec150 for co2 and h2o and the three dimensional 3d sonic anemometer is used to simultaneously measure the orthogonal wind components irgason campbell scientific the eddypro software version 5 is applied to calculate the et flux from 10 hz raw water vapour concentration and 3d wind speed data in a time step of 30 min intervals vickers and mahrt 1997 foken and thomas 2016 specifically the pre processing procedures for the original observation data consist of spike removal for high frequency raw concentration data coordinate rotation for tilt correction of raw 3d wind speed data block average for et and heat fluxes at 30 min ultrasound virtual temperature correction air density correction and friction velocity filtering correction moncrieff et al 1997 eichelmann et al 2018 knox et al 2014 furthermore we retained raw data with signal strengths less than 0 8 and instrument diagnostic flags less than 0 we also set a threshold to remove the anomalous et observations i e the et flux data above below 10 times of the mean in situ et flux xenakis 2016 vulova et al 2021 in addition to water vapor and heat flux observations the two ec towers also provided in situ measurements of rn and g with a time step of half hour 2 4 2 meteorological vegetation and soil data collection the various meteorological variables at the ymk and ca stations are continuously observed using an automated meteorological instrument these meteorological elements include rs rl ta u ea relative humidity rh and precipitation p moreover the in situ measurements of soil water content swc and vegetation height hv are also conducted at the two stations the observation frequency of various meteorological factors and swc are half hour and the observation frequency of hv is once every half month the vegetation leaf area index lai is closely related to the vegetation density structure biological characteristics which can well reflect the vegetation photosynthetic and respiration processes knyazikhin et al 1998 unfortunately the two ec sites do not have a long term continuous observation of lai as an alternative lai is extracted from the landsat operational land imager landsat oli at the spatial resolution of 30 m turner et al 1999 the band 3 green band 0 525 0 600 µm band 4 red band 0 630 0 680 µm and band 5 near infrared band 0 845 0 885 µm are pre processed from the raw oli image and the lai is calculated using the spectral statistical analysis ssa method deng 2006 quan et al 2005 furthermore the ndvi at the two stations is also calculated through the landsat oli imagery band 3 and band 4 carlson and ripley 1997 it is pointed that the period of field observation for these meteorological soil and vegetation factors are consistent with the in situ et which started from 1 jan 2018 to the present to reconstruct the long term urban et changes we downloaded and pre processed the historical meteorological vegetation and soil data from several datasets specifically the six meteorological variables from 1990 to 2020 are taken from the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 dataset gelaro and mccarty 2017 and era5 dataset chen et al 2021a b the swc is obtained from a passive microwave remote sensing product soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2009 o neill et al 2010 the lai and ndvi during the period 1990 2020 are downloaded and calculated from the long term landsat observations these satellite sensors span from landsat 5 8 all geographic datasets are resampled and projected to 30 m spatial resolution to distinguish the et spatial distribution for different urban land uses these massive data sets processing and computing are completed on the google earth engine gee platform 2 4 3 flux footprint data the flux footprint at the ymk and ca stations is computed using an analytical footprint model afm for non neutral stratification kormann and meixner 2001 previous studies demonstrated that the afm model could provide more reliable flux footprint estimates than several other flux footprint models based on extensive comparative experiments kumari et al 2020 kong et al 2022 the afm model uses the near surface wind speed profile turbulent diffusion coefficient profile and near surface similarity theory to derive the analytical solution of the flux footprint the specific about the afm model is shown as follows kormann and meixner 2001 it is assumed that the u and turbulent diffusion coefficient k above the ground surface can be approximated in the form of power index shown as eqs 9 and 10 9 u z z u z m 10 k z k 0 z n where uz z and k z represents the vertical functions of u and eddy diffusivity respectively u and k0 represents the two constants of u and eddy diffusivity respectively z represents the vertical height m m and n can be obtained by eqs 11 and 12 11 m z u z u z z u k φ m u z 12 n z k k z where k represents the von karman constant u represents the friction u m s and φm represents the momentum function the u and k0 can be solved through combining eqs 9 12 then the expression of the lateral flux integral function can be obtained shown as eq 13 13 f y x s z m 1 γ μ ξ μ x s 1 μ exp ξ x s in eq 13 μ can be estimated as μ 1 m r r can be estimated as r 2 m n and ξ can be estimated as ξ u z r r 2 k 0 γ μ represents the function of μ xs represents the average flux source length m zm represents the observation heights of u m the flux footprint is calculated at every half hour for each experiment day then it is aggregated to the daily flux footprint chu et al 2021 the 60 70 80 and 90 footprint contours are mapped using the afm model it should be noted that the 90 flux footprint line indicates that 90 of the flux contribution comes from the marked area for a specific day kormann and meixner 2001 to better reflect flux footprint exponential decay beyond 50 we calculated multiple flux footprint contours i e 60 70 80 and 90 chu et al 2021 suggested setting the 80 flux footprint contour as the flux footprint threshold due to the area beyond the 80 flux footprint contour having little effect on the et observation results in this study considering the high heterogeneity of the urban surfaces we set this flux footprint threshold value to 90 furthermore to improve the reliability of the flux footprint contour the aerodynamic canopy height is also calculated which has been proved to successfully capture the changes in vegetation status around the two stations pennypacker and baldocchi 2015 2 5 model operation and verification the in situ et and various input data sets at the ymk and ca stations are mixed according to the different observation times where 75 of the dataset is selected to train the model and 25 of the dataset is used for model verification to improve the learning efficiency of the model we normalized 13 input variables according to their mean and standard deviation sd values the cross validation method is applied to verify the model performance to avoid the over fitting problem of the cnn model we used different initial weights to train the model specifically the different initial weights are used to train the model 1500 times and the sd of the 1500 times predictions is determined as the model uncertainty 3 results and analysis 3 1 determination of flux footprint contours figs 3 and 4 displays the spatial patterns of the flux footprint contours estimated using afm model at the ca and ymk stations generally the 60 70 80 and 90 flux footprint contours exhibit approximate an ellipse and symmetry shape centered on the two ec towers for four selected days 18 apr 2020 11 jun 2020 10 aug 2020 and 22 oct 2020 the elliptical and symmetric shaped flux footprint has also been widely reported in other studies e g kong et al 2022 chu et al 2021 furthermore the flux footprint source areas varies widely among the four test days the flux footprint extent ffe defined as the maximum distance from the ec system to the 90 flux footprints contour ranges from 240 390 m during the four days for the ca station 230 400 m for ymk station the flux footprint area ffa defined as the total area from the ec system to the 90 flux footprints contour ranges from 67800 226000 m2 during the four days for the ca station 65000 141000 m2 for ymk station moreover a large discrepancy is also observed for urban land use cover within the 90 flux footprint contour across the selected four days for example the land use coverage within the 90 flux footprint contour at ca station consist of 40 1 fv 56 7 fi and 3 2 fw for 18 apr 2020 while the corresponding values are 55 8 fv 37 7 fi and 6 5 fw for 10 aug 2020 a similar phenomenon also appeared at the ymk station where the 90 flux footprints contour cover 90 0 fv 1 1 fi and 8 9 fw for 18 apr 2020 100 fv 0 fi and 0 fw for 10 aug 2020 the average land use cover within the 90 flux footprint contour across the four test days are 42 7 fv 38 3 fi and 19 0 fw at ca station 71 8 fv 1 6 fi and 26 6 fw at ymk station the high fluctuation in flux footprint contour indicates that the in situ urban et flux contains complex et information from multiple land uses therefore coupling the flux footprint data to the machine learning model can better characterize the in situ urban et flux source and open up the opportunity to improve the urban et simulation accuracy 3 2 model performance evaluation and parameter importance four simulation scenarios are selected to run the modified cnn model to distinguish the effectiveness of coupling flux footprint and the physical mechanism to urban et simulation these four simulation scenarios are 1 the original cnn model without coupling flux footprint and the physical mechanism cnn o 2 the cnn model coupled flux footprint but not coupled physical mechanism cnn f 3 the cnn model coupled physical mechanism but not coupled flux footprint cnn p 4 the cnn model coupled both of the physical mechanism and flux footprint cnn pf the validation results shown in the following context represent the performance of urban et prediction at the site scale the series of in situ and predicted daily λet through the four simulation scenarios during the validation period are presented in fig 5 a fig 5 b shows the taylor plot of statistics for the four simulation scenarios the validation results indicate that all of four simulation scenarios exhibit good skills in capturing the urban λet variations however large performance difference is observed for urban λet prediction when intercomparing the statistics of the four simulation scenarios see fig 5b specifically the cnn pf gets the lowest rmse value and the highest determination of coefficient r2 over the four simulation scenarios which is selected as the champion model the r2 rmse and bias for cnn pf are 0 85 29 4 w m2 and 3 7 w m2 respectively refer to table 3 the cnn f that coupled flux footprint but not coupled physical mechanism exhibit slightly inferior performance to the cnn pf the corresponding statistics are 0 81 37 7 w m2 and 11 8 w m2 for cnn f which ranked the second among four simulation scenarios the cnn p that coupled physical mechanism but not coupled flux footprint ranked the third the cnn p obtain r2 rmse and bias of 0 79 39 2 w m2 and 12 4 w m2 respectively this result confirms that coupling flux footprints exert a more practical function for improving urban et simulations compared with coupling physical mechanism not surprising the cnn o without integrating any modifications performs the worst among the four simulation scenarios r2 rmse and bias are 0 68 55 2 w m2 and 17 3 w m2 respectively to comprehensively evaluate the reproduced urban et accuracy of the cnn pf model we further compare the cnn pf model with four classic machine learning models and two energy balance based physics process models the four classic machine learning models include feed forward neural networks ffnn svozil et al 1997 huang et al 2005 support vector regression svr chen et al 2020 extreme learning machine elm tang et al 2015 and random forest rf mariana and lucian 2016 the two energy balance based urban et models are urban surface energy balance algorithm for land usebal faridatul et al 2020 and three source urban energy balance model tru chen et al 2022 the four classic machine learning models and proposed cnn pf model are driven by the same input datasets moreover the same datasets are also used as the inputs of two physics process based urban et models fig 6 shows the statistics distributions of seven models for λet prediction generally cnn pf provides the most reliable λet estimation among the seven models followed by rf ffnn tru elm svr and usebal the r2 rmse and bias for usebal model are 0 62 70 1 w m2 and 27 7 w m2 respectively which performs worst among the seven models the above model comparison results confirm the advantage and efficiency of cnn pf model over classic machine learning models and physics process based models in urban λet simulation the relative importance of various input variables for urban λet simulates are shown in fig 7 as it can be interpolated from fig 7 the most critical variable for urban λet simulation is rs which explained 85 of urban λet variations the second third and fourth important predictors are lai ndvi and swc with the relative contribution of 82 80 and 76 respectively the lai and ndvi are closely related to the vegetation stomatal impedance thus influencing vegetation transpiration also the swc is linked to the soil surface impedance therefore it governs soil evaporation these three variables present a significant positive relationship with surface conductance gsurface and urban λet for the flux footprint variables the relative importance of fi fv and fw are 72 72 and 70 respectively which ranked at the fifth to the seventh among the 13 input variables the relatively higher importance of the flux footprint parameters well explains the significant enhanced urban λet simulation performance when coupling the fi fv and fw to cnn model however the atmospheric demand parameters exhibit the least influence on urban λet simulations the relative importance of ta for urban λet simulation is 66 with the importance deceases in the order of rl 60 u 55 hv 52 ea 45 and rh 40 the dominant role of ra lai ndvi and swc in natural ecosystems and farmland λet simulations have been widely reported e g zhang et al 2021 anwar 2021 wang et al 2012 cavanaugh et al 2011 which is consistent with the findings presented here for urban areas a notable difference is that some studies suggested that hv is one of the important factors dominating the global λet simulations e g zhao et al 2019 but the higher importance of hv is not observed in the urban λet simulation one possible reason could be that the hv determines the momentum and thermal roughness length parameters thus influencing the water vapour and energy turbulent diffusion process in the natural ecosystems and cultivated lands joffre 1982 molder 1999 demuzere et al 2008 however this vapour and energy turbulent diffusion process in the urban area is not only affected by the vegetation height but also controlled by the building height kanda and moriizumi 2009 to this end coupling urban building height data in the cnn model provides the opportunity to further enhance the urban λet simulation accuracy overall from the above analysis it is concluded that the rs lai ndvi and swc are the most important variables for urban λet simulation followed by flux footprint variables fi fv and fw while the atmospheric demand parameters show the less effect 3 3 comparing with the previous studies advantages and limitations of cnn pf model the rmse of cnn pf model is 29 4 w m2 for urban λet simulation which is lower than most previous urban energy flux studies for example järvi et al 2011 proposed surface urban energy and water balance scheme suews to estimate urban energy balance components the rmse of the suews model for urban λet simulation was 56 w m2 in los angeles and vancouver chen et al 2022a used a three source remote sensing model tru to estimate urban et in tianjin china the ground ec validation results suggested that the rmse was 40 2 w m2 for daily λet simulation rios ramamurthy 2022 developed a new energy balance model to map sensible heat flux h in urban areas based on remote sensing data the rmse was 47 32 w m2 for h simulation in new york city chen et al 2022 conducted a four source energy balance model the rmse for urban λet simulation reached 41 1 w m2 the relatively better performance of the cnn pf model can be attributed to the following advantages 1 the pure data driven model cnn is constrained by the physical mechanism of et the hybrid model framework significantly enhance the generalization potential of pure data driven model which avoid erroneous et estimation under extreme conditions 2 the cnn pf model can automatically learn the in situ flux contributions from multiple surface types by integrating the flux footprint information this enables the cnn pf model to distinguish the different et information from multiple urban surface conditions thereby enhancing the urban et simulation performance 3 compared to the various physics processes based urban et models the cnn pf model has fewer empirical parameters within the model framework this characteristic of the cnn pf significantly reduce the model uncertainty caused by the determination of empirical parameters 4 cnn pf adopt different parameterization schemes of rn and g according to the characteristics of multiple urban surfaces refer to eqs 4 6 which significantly enhance the estimations of rn and g in urban areas 5 the cnn pf model successfully integrates 13 drivers of urban et thus ensuring that the model has a complete physics descriptions of soil vegetation and meteorological processes 6 the cnn pf model can be used for urban et simulation at both site scale and regional scale in case of a high spatial resolution remote sensing image available cnn pf can map the urban et distribution with a spatial resolution higher than 10 m therefore the cnn pf model has the ability to guide urban water resources management and allocation at a smaller spatial scale however the cnn pf model still has some limitations which can be summarized as follows 1 the accuracy of the cnn pf model in urban et simulation largely depends on the quantity of training data sets the et simulation accuracy will decline significantly when there are fewer samples of in situ urban et available 2 although cnn pf model avoids complex parameter calculation to a largest extent the determination of part of atmospheric boundary layer parameters within the model framework still has large uncertainties such as the estimation of momentum and heat roughness length in eq 7 3 the cnn pf requires 13 categories of vegetation soil and meteorology variables as model inputs which may limit the model application in areas lacking field observations 3 4 spatial distribution of urban λet the trained cnn model is further used to map the urban λet distribution based on the various meteorological soil and vegetation datasets it should be pointed out that since there are no flux footprint data available in the urban regions other than the two ec sites hence the urban λet is mapped using the cnn p fig 8 displays the spatial patterns of urban λet in shenzhen for the select six days from different seasons clearly the summer urban λet is significantly higher than other seasons due to higher vegetation cover temperature and radiation which is consistent to the temporal λet patterns in the natural ecosystems and cultivated lands e g cleugh et al 2007 leuning et a 2008 jung et al 2010 seen fig 8 the λet in 10 aug 2020 is higher than the other five days furthermore the urban λet values vary widely for different urban regions the variation range of urban λet are 15 8 499 7 w m2 22 6 488 4 w m2 24 9 502 7 w m2 30 2 531 1 w m2 27 0 522 1 w m2 and 19 3 491 8 w m2 for 04 feb 2020 18 apr 2020 11 jun 2020 10 aug 2020 22 oct 2020 and 04 dec 2020 respectively the large variation range of urban λet could be attributed to the high heterogeneity of the urban surface that contains multiple λet dynamics chen et al 2022a b fig 9 presents the results of urban λet mapping in three typical urban regions of shenzhen 9a large reservoir 9b urban forest area 9c main urban area the urban λet distributions in these typical urban areas can well characterize its large spatial variability generally the higher urban λet value appeared in the urban water body areas and vegetation coverage areas while the lower λet value is mainly distributed in the impervious areas for instance the highest λet is observed in several reservoirs tiegang and xili reservoirs in the west of the city see fig 9a where the λet values in these water body areas are generally greater than 480 w m2 moreover the vegetated areas also exhibit higher λet than the other regions such as the malianshan forest park in the east of the city seen fig 9b the mean λet value in the two forest parks reaches 264 6 w m2 the lowest urban λet is mainly distributed in the central urban areas with a large proportion of impervious surfaces i e buildings roads and traffic areas see fig 9c the λet values in the impervious surface are very low less than 30 w m2 as the impervious surface does not have water detention capacity resulting in no available water for evaporation previous studies also reported the λet in impervious areas tends to be zero or close to zero e g wong et al 2015 kato and yamaguchi 2007 wong et al 2015 demonstrated that λet in impervious areas is below 10 w m2 and the road surface has the lowest λet value kato and yamaguchi 2007 indicated λet in impervious areas to be zero in short the spatial distribution of urban λet illustrates greater spatial variability the water body and vegetated areas have relatively higher λet values than impervious areas where the λet values are close to zero 3 5 impact of urbanization on urban et the long term urban et is reconstructed using the landsat observations and various datasets with cnn p fig 10 a presents the time sequence of monthly et variation during 1990 2020 the mann kendall m k trend analysis method is applied to test the significance of the et temporal trend at the 95 confidence level hamed and rao 1998 gocic and trajkovic 2013 over the past 31 years urban et showed a significant downward trend with rapid urbanization the average downward rate is 1 61 mm yr p less than 0 05 with an 18 decrease relative to the long term et average for 31 years the water unit of et mm is obtained by dividing the energy unit w m2 with the latent heat of vaporization kj kg to investigate the factors responsible for the decline of urban et a correlation analysis is conducted between urban et and fi and rs the scatter plots of the urban et with fi and rs are envisaged in fig 10 b and c generally urban et presents a strong negative correlation with fi correlation coefficient r of 0 76 and a positive correlation with rs r of 0 43 when fi and rs are removed from the original et temporal series the downward trend of the urban et is no longer significant decreasing rate of 0 14 mm yr p 0 05 this indicates that the decline in urban et is caused by the combined effect of increasing in impervious surface areas and the decreasing in radiation furthermore the increased impervious surface area s contribution to the urban et decline is more significant than the decreased radiation in essence the decline in urban et can be explained by the following aspects 1 a large number of natural vegetation and soil covered areas are replaced by impervious surfaces resulting in a decline in regional water holding capacity thus reducing regional et 2 urban cycling exhaust and industrial emissions increase aerosol and particulate matter concentrations result in the reduced atmospheric transmittance and net radiative flux rn the decrease of rn leads to the reduced available energy for evaporation which in turn causes the decline of urban et overall it is found that urbanization led to a decline in regional et the et decline is caused by the joint effect of an increase in impervious surfaces and a decrease in radiation 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness of coupled flux footprints and physical mechanisms for urban et simulations the integration of flux footprints leads to considerable accuracy improvement in the site scale urban et simulations which is even more effective than coupling physical mechanisms in the cnn model this is a remarkable finding since it implies that the uncertainty caused by the model conceptualization is smaller than the uncertainty associated with the spatial mismatch between the in situ flux footprints and estimated et for heterogeneity urban areas previous satellite based et studies in natural ecosystems and cultivated lands emphasized the importance of spatial matching between flux footprints and satellite image pixels when conducting ground validations e g kong et al 2022 chen et al 2022 a b chu et al 2021 kormann and meixner 2001 however these studies only used the flux footprint to enhance the reliability of ground validation rather than coupling the flux footprint to the model conceptualization to improve the et simulation accuracy this research incorporates flux footprints into the machine learning architecture to estimate et which provides a new dimension and solution in machine learning based et estimation approaches the fusion of flux footprint into the cnn architecture is very useful in urban areas due to the high heterogeneity surface and changeable wind direction this implies that the coupling flux footprint will also improve the et simulation accuracy in homogeneous areas such as natural ecosystems and cultivated lands but the magnitude of the improved et accuracy in these areas will be smaller than that in urban areas to further gain insight about the effective of flux footprint on et simulation improvements for different heterogeneous conditions a correlation analysis is performed between δrmse represent the rmse value obtained by cnn o minus the rmse value obtained by cnn f and h index describe the degree of heterogeneity generally a larger h index value means a higher degree of surface heterogeneity and vice versa huang et al 2016 during the 313 test days these 313 test days are selected from the different seasons that have different heterogeneity degrees fig 11 a shows a significant linear and positive correlation between the δrmse and h index r 0 55 this is concrete evidence that fused flux footprint is more effective in the underlying surface with a higher degree of heterogeneity and less effective in the surface with a lower degree of heterogeneity hence seasonality can also impact the effectiveness of the fusion flux footprint to the et simulation accuracy improvement for example the spring and summer with a higher degree of surface heterogeneity will further increase the performance gap between the two methods on the contrary autumn and winter with lower surface heterogeneity will further reduce the performance gap between the two methods in addition to the degree of surface heterogeneity the changeable wind direction is another reason that causes et accuracy improvement when fused flux footprint data to learn the contribution of different wind direction on the model performance improvement a total of 466 test days are randomly selected in which the prevailing wind direction for the 112 test days are 46 e set to case 1 red line marked in fig 11 b and the prevailing wind direction for the remaining 354 test days are range between 0 360 random wind direction set to case 2 blue lines marked in fig 11 b fig 11 b shows the boxplot of the δrmse value distribution for the two simulation cases the average δrmse during the 112 test days for case 1 is 6 7 w m2 range between 4 7 8 6 w m2 and the average δrmse during the 354 test days for case 2 is 24 8 w m2 range between 18 5 30 9 w m2 clearly the δrmse obtained from case 2 is significantly higher than case 1 indicating that the amplitude of model performance improvement under the random wind direction condition is higher than that of a single wind direction condition the coupling flux footprints are more effective for urban areas is mainly because the variation range of wind direction is wider than that in natural ecosystems and cultivated lands as the building shading effect exist in urban areas although the magnitude of the performance improvement for the coupling physical mechanism is slightly smaller than the coupling flux footprint the coupling physics mechanism still significantly improved the accuracy of the original cnn model cnn o according to the verification results in section 3 2 the cnn p effectively reduces the rmse value of 16 0 w m2 and improves the r2 value of 0 11 compared with the cnn o to understand the effectiveness of coupling physical mechanisms for simulation of extreme et events six datasets are selected from the original datasets 1 0 to 1st percentile of ta extreme cold weather 2 45 to 55th percentile of ta normal weather condition 3 99 to 100th percentile of ta extreme hot weather 4 0 to 1st percentile of rs extreme low radiation 5 45 to 55th percentile of rs normal radiation condition 6 99 to 100th percentile of rs extreme high radiation the six datasets are fed into the cnn o cnn p and cnn f and the same measured et data set is used to evaluate three simulation scenarios performance fig 12 displays the heat map of statistical parameters r2 rmse and bias for the three simulation scenarios under the six datasets generally the cnn p outperforms cnn o and cnn f under the four extreme et events the cnn o and cnn f significantly overestimate et in cold weather and low radiation conditions bias of 95 8 w m2 and 88 4 w m2 for cnn o the bias of 93 1 w m2 and 96 7 w m2 for cnn f but significantly underestimate et in hot weather and high radiation conditions bias of 85 4 w m2 and 80 2 w m2 for cnn o bias of 74 6 w m2 and 82 7 w m2 for cnn f as a comparison cnn p successfully predicts et under these four extreme conditions the specific statistics refer to fig 12 nevertheless the three simulation scenarios do not exhibit significant over underestimation behavior under the two regular datasets 45 to 55th percentile of ta normal weather condition and 45 to 55th percentile of rs normal radiation condition seen from fig 12 the bias values for the three simulation scenarios are relatively close under these two regular data sets this indicates that the improvement of model accuracy by coupling physical mechanism is mainly accomplished in predicting extreme et values rather than regular et values in essence the cnn p can well predict urban et under extreme conditions due to the addition of physics process constraints to the model architecture thereby avoiding unreasonable speculation under extreme et conditions however the two simulation scenarios without adding physical constraints cnn f and cnn o simply set the optimal fit of the in situ and predicted et as the model optimization target leading to the model did not learn enough prior knowledge about extreme et events and resulted significant over underestimation to summarize according to the above discussion coupling flux footprint and physical mechanism to the machine learning model is very effective for improving the et simulation accuracy in urban areas however the internal mechanism of these two modifications on urban et simulation performance improvements is completely different the coupling flux footprint is more effective in areas with high heterogeneity and variable wind direction while the accuracy improvement of urban et simulation by the coupling physical mechanism is mainly because the hybrid model can better capture the et variation under extreme conditions 4 2 implications of decline in urban et with urbanization past urban et research also demonstrated that urbanization leads to a decline in urban et for instance carlson and arthur 2000 assessed the impact of urbanization on regional et using the avhrr and landsat tm data reported the et rn decreased approximately 10 in chester county pa from 1986 to 1995 zheng et al 2020 used the mike she model to estimate et in the qinhuai river basin china suggesting that the regional et decreased 7 from 2000 to 2013 due to urbanization recently chen et al 2022b evaluated the urban et variations based on a novel four source energy balance model demonstrating the et in a mega city tianjin china decreased 13 from 1986 to 2021 as a comparison urban et decreased 18 relative to the long term mean et from 1990 to 2020 in shenzhen for the present study the magnitude of the urban et decline in shenzhen is higher than that of the previous studies carlson and arthur 2000 zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2022b an important reason is that shenzhen has been developing faster than these cities in the past several decades as mentioned earlier the impervious surface area of shenzhen has increased approximately 15 times from 1985 to 2020 resulting in a more rapid decline rate in urban vegetation coverage and et values in addition the different start and end years selected for the trend analysis and different model conceptualizations are also reasons for the discrepancies in the decline rate of urban et the decline in urban et has significant impacts on urban water resources management climate and environment first assuming the urban precipitation remain the same a decrease in urban et will cause an increase in urban runoff and infiltration according to the water balance theory nicholson et al 2010 the increased runoff and infiltration in urban areas will put forward a higher standard for the infrastructure design of urban water supply and drainage systems to prevent regional flooding however whether the existing urban drainage infrastructure has the ability to deal with the additional increase in urban runoff and infiltration warrants further investigation second a decrease in the urban et lead to a rise in the urban sensible heat and ta resulting in the uhi effect li et al 2019 mazrooei et al 2021 previous studies have shown that urbanization induce an increase in the et difference between the suburbs and the main urban area which in turn causes the difference in surface cooling effect between the main urban and suburbs areas li et al 2019 chen et al 2022b this difference evaporative cooling effect is thought to be responsible for the urban heat island effect therefore increasing the et of the main urban area can effectively alleviate the urban heat island effect e g arnfield 2003 grimmond 2007 li et al 2019 vulova et al 2021 feasible options for increasing urban et include planting green landscapes and building green roofs to increase vegetation transpiration or constructing landscape water bodies to increase water surface evaporation vulova et al 2021 furthermore the construction of cisterns or rainwater harvesting systems reclaimed water had obtained satisfactory cooling effect after being implemented in some cities furumai 2008 ibrahim 2009 thomas et al 2014 these are all practical measures to increase et in the main urban area and mitigate the urban heat island effect however more irrigation water is required for green landscapes and green roofs bringing new sustainability challenges in urban water resources lastly the reduction of urban vegetation cover and the decline in urban et will alter the vegetation water carbon coupling process in urban areas the decreased urban vegetation cover reduces carbon sequestration capacity leading to higher carbon dioxide co2 concentrations and exacerbating urban warming xie et al 2016 4 3 limitations of the study primary uncertainties and ways forward due to the heterogeneity of the urban surface and the impact of human activities on the regional energy balance it is complicated and challenging to estimate the urban et accurately this study coupled the flux footprint and the physical mechanism to the machine learning model thus providing a promising way in urban et estimation and mapping however large uncertainties still exist in the model conceptualization input data sources and ground ec observations as presented in the following context 1 the big leaf assumption in the p m formula causes uncertainty in the urban et estimates the p m formula considers the soil layer and vegetation layer as a big leaf the et processes in the p m formula is described as the water vapor diffusing from the big leaf to the reference height monteith 1965 penman 1948 however previous studies have shown that the p m formula performs better in areas where the vegetation is evenly and densely distributed but the error is larger in areas where the vegetation is uneven and sparsely distributed stannard 1993 utset et al 2004 although the modified cnn model adopts improved rn and g algorithms in the p m formula the uncertainty still exists when applying the p m formula to highly heterogeneous urban areas to evaluate the effects of rn and g to the et simulation uncertainty the rn and g are multiplied by 1 1 times of their original values and imported into the cnn pf model to simulate λet the results show that when rn and g increased by 1 1 times the simulated λet increased to 108 8 and decreased to 96 6 compared with the original λet estimates the rmse for λet simulation increased from 29 4 w m2 to 32 0 w m2 and 30 4 w m2 respectively to alleviate the et prediction uncertainty caused by rn and g estimates subsequent research can further integrate multi source et physical algorithms into machine learning models to better characterize the complex urban surfaces i e shuttleworth wallace model gong et al 2019 2 uncertainty associated with the aerodynamic conductance ga determination in the proposed urban et model the cnn architecture is applied to estimate the surface conductance gsurface which is considered as the most uncertain parameter in the p m formula however the uncertainty for another conductance parameter in the p m formula ga cannot be ignored to gain the insight of the determination of ga to the et simulation uncertainty the ga are multiplied by 1 1 times of the original value and imported into the cnn pf model sensitivity analysis show that when ga increased to 110 of the original value the simulated et increased to 107 8 and rmse increased from 29 4 w m2 to 31 7 w m2 therefore ga plays an important role in the accurate simulation of et the hybrid urban et model uses a relatively conventional method to estimate ga where the ga is parameterized as a function of wind speed and various thermodynamic and momentum roughness length parameters refer to eq 7 li et al 2005 however due to the presence of tall buildings bridges and traffic areas in urban regions the kinetic process of the water vapor and energy diffusing from the urban surface to the reference height may be different from the natural environment and cultivated lands kusaka et al 2001 kondo et al 2005 the uncertainty may be large that the conventional ga parameterization scheme is applied to urban areas to this end it is necessary and urgent to improve the existing ra parameterization scheme according to the features of the urban surfaces for example the building height and the wind speed at the top building could be integrated into the ga algorithm 3 uncertainties come from training and validation datasets it is well known that the cnn model requires a large number of training samples to improve model accuracy however this characteristic of the cnn model may lead to a large challenge in accurate urban et simulation due to the limited ec observation sites in urban areas when the quantity of training and validation data sets are reduced to 70 of the whole data sets the rmse for λet simulation increased considerable from 29 4 w m2 to 52 1 w m2 this is a solid evidence that the model error caused by the quantity of training data set is even larger than that caused by the determinations of model parameters which confirm the dominance of training data set quantity in accurate et simulation although there are more than 600 flux stations worldwide flux observatories in urban areas are still very rare e g holl et al 2020 järvi et al 2012 kordowski and kuttler 2010 vulva et al 2021 only two ec systems are applied to monitor urban et variation as limited by budget in this study note that shenzhen is one of the few cities with ground ec observations we found less than 75 of the data is available for model training and validation after implementing quality control for the raw ec data therefore the accuracy of the modified cnn model could be further improved if the number of urban ec stations is increased or the observation period is extended to address this issue follow up studies are required to conduct more extensive urban et observations to gain insight into the performance of the modified cnn model 4 uncertainty involved in the various input data sets and ec measurements the modified cnn model fused 13 categories of meteorology soil vegetation and flux footprint data sources however these input data sources have large errors themselves for example dorigo et al 2010 suggested the error of soil moisture active passive swc products ranged 0 017 m3 m3 to 0 019 m3 m3 in a global scale to quantify the impact of different swc data sources to et simulation uncertainties three classic swc datasets are selected to to train and validate the cnn pf model these classic swc datasets include era5 chen et al 2021a b smap entekhabi et al 2009 and japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 dataset chen et al 2014 the validation results show that the et simulation errors range between 32 1 36 8 w m2 among the three swc data sets the smap provide the most accurate et simulation followed by era5 and jra55 these results indicate that different swc data sources have a significant impact on et simulation performance moreover the lai in the study region is estimated using the spectral statistical analysis ssa method and landsat visible light bands deng 2006 quan et al 2005 the uncertainty of the ssa method and landsat observations will result in inevitable errors in the lai estimates the errors associated with the meteorology soil vegetation datasets will lead to large uncertainties in the final et predictions through error propagation besides it shall be reminded that the ec system will also bring significant errors for in situ et due to the non closed energy balance vickers and mahrt 1997 foken and thomas 2016 in the urban region with complex turbulent conditions this energy non closure problem will be more significant than the natural ecosystems and cultivated lands more importantly although coupled flux footprints can significantly improve urban et simulations at site scale such flux footprint information cannot be applied to map urban et distributions since it is unavailable at a regional scale this indicates that the errors in the spatial mapping of urban et may be larger than the site scale urban et estimates for the present study subsequent research is expected to propose a novel statistical method that can amplify the site scale flux footprint to the regional scale based on the spatially wind speed direction which will further improve the reliability of the regional scale et mapping 5 conclusions this study integrated flux footprint and physical mechanism into the convolutional neural network cnn model for simulation of urban evapotranspiration et the daily flux footprint is calculated using the analytical footprint model afm for two ec stations the estimated flux footprint is further fed into the cnn model for urban et prediction moreover the modified penman monteith p m formula is coupled into the rmse loss function of the cnn architecture and it has been realized that the estimated urban et is constrained by the energy balance and turbulent diffusion process the proposed modified cnn model is tested in a fast developing city shenzhen china based on the two ec ground observations long term urban et changes are reconstructed and the response of urban et to urbanization is identified the main findings of the present study are the following 1 the flux footprint in urban areas varies widely on different days due to heterogeneous surfaces and variable wind direction the flux footprint extent ffe ranges from 240 390 m during the four days for the ca station 230 400 m for ymk station the flux footprint area ffa ranges from 67800 226000 m2 during the four days for ca station 65000 141000 m2 for ymk station 2 the integration of flux footprints into the cnn model can significantly improve the accuracy of urban λet simulations at site scale the rmse r2 and bias in urban λet simulation by cnn f are 37 7 w m2 0 81 and 11 8 w m2 respectively the rmse by cnn f reduced 17 5 w m2 and the r2 increased 0 13 compared with cnn o further analyses indicate that the coupled flux footprint is more effective in regions with high heterogeneity and variable wind direction the performance gap between the cnn f and cnn o is positively related to h index and wind direction variation range 3 the integration of physical mechanisms into the cnn model can significantly improve the accuracy of urban λet simulations at both site and regional scales the rmse r2 and bias in urban λet simulation by cnn p are 39 2 w m2 0 79 and 12 4 w m2 respectively the rmse by cnn p reduced 16 0 w m2 and the r2 increased 0 11 compared with the cnn o the accuracy improvement of urban λet simulation by the coupled physical mechanism is mainly because the hybrid model can better capture the λet variation under extreme conditions 4 the rmse r2 and bias in urban λet simulation by cnn pf are 29 4 w m2 0 85 and 3 7 w m2 respectively the rmse by cnn pf reduced 25 8 w m2 and the r2 increased 0 17 compared with the cnn o the simulation accuracy of cnn pf for urban et is better than the several classic machine learning models e g ffnn svr elm and rf models these validation results proves the effectiveness of coupling physical mechanism and flux footprint in urban et simulation 5 the spatial distribution of urban λet exhibits sizeable spatial variability urban λet values are higher in the water body mean λet larger than 480 w m2 and vegetation coverage areas mean λet larger than 260 w m2 in contrast the λet value in the impervious surface is close to zero mean λet less than 30 w m2 due to the limited available water 6 long term trend analysis shows that urbanization led to a decline in urban et the average decreasing rate of urban et is 1 61 mm yr p less than 0 05 with an 18 decrease relative to the long term et average during 1990 2020 the main reasons for the decline of urban et are the increased urban impervious surfaces and the decreased radiation due to cycling exhaust and industrial emissions in addition the decline in urban et is the leading cause of the increase in urban temperature and uhi to effectively reduce the urban temperature and alleviate the uhi

2089,biochar colloids bcs have received considerable attention in recent years due to the unique environmental behavior and potential risks in this work a real time visualization system to reveal the transport and retention mechanisms of biochar colliods in two dimensional 2 d porous media under the ionic strength is ph and media grain size was developed the system consists of charge coupled device ccd microscope camera and flow cell connected to a pump and sample collector the breakthrough curve of flow cell effluent concentration was used to quantitatively analyze the migration behavior of bcs bcs transport in 2 d porous media was simulated with a simplified double monod model the results show that bcs had a strong migration capacity in 2 d porous media electronegativity of bcs and quartz sand increases with the decrease of is and the increase of ph and the electrostatic repulsion between them then increases resulting in the reduction of the adhesion of bcs on the sand surface which promotes the migration and reduces the retention of bcs in the 2 d porous media in addition the reduction of media grain size had an inhibitory effluence on the transport of bcs and the finer sand could provide more deposition sites for bcs meanwhile the double monod model also fitted the transport behavior nicely r2 0 94 the visualization method in this study properly explains the migration behavior of bcs in 2 d porous media which provides reasonable support for more comprehensive evaluation environmental risk keywords biochar colloids two dimensional migration porous media visualization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biochar is a highly aromatic charcoal like substance produced from pyrolysis of biomass and agricultural litter with no or limited oxygen at certain temperatures lehmann 2007 it is widely used for improving soil quality increasing crop yields and the remediation of contaminated sites due to its superior physicochemical properties good stability and carbon fixation capability dai et al 2021 lian and xing 2017 xu et al 2021 once biochar is applied to environment it undergoes physical chemical and biological decomposition forming small sized biochar particles spokas et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zimmerman 2010 these small biochar particles can form water dispersible biochar colloids bcs and migrate in soil and aquifers causing potential carbon loss fang et al 2020 as different from large particles of biochar bcs have a stronger adsorption and migration capacity as active components involved in geochemical processes song et al 2019 in addition bcs also may serve as a vehicle to promote the migration of various environmental contaminant thus posing potential environmental risks hofmann and von der kammer 2009 hofmann and wendelborn 2007 yang et al 2017b therefore comprehending the transport behavior of bcs is essential to optimize the use and risk control of biochar in agriculture and environmental remediation several studies have indicated that transport and retention of bcs is dominated by the inherent attributes of biochar pyrolysis temperature and particle size and the physicochemical properties of surrounding environment e g ph ionic strength is ionic valency and natural organic matter wang et al 2013a yang et al 2019b yang et al 2017a studies have indicated that mobility for colloid transport generally decreases with the increasing is ionic valency particle size and temperature chen et al 2017 guggenberger et al 2008 leifeld et al 2007 skjemstad et al 1999 zhang et al 2010 however bcs fluidity also could be strengthened with increasing ph and media grain size fang et al 2020 lian and xing 2017 transport of bcs was significantly enhanced by humic and fulvic at salt concentration and ph conditions while biochar mobility was inhibited by both bull serum albumin and cytochrome in the low salt solution yang et al 2019a on the other hand aging effect also influence the migration of bcs which the aged bcsshowed higher mobility than the pristinebcs meng et al 2020 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 additionally the different adsorption sites of pollutants on biochar cannot be ignored in the migration of bcs yang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 to date most of the previous studies were all limited in one dimensional 1 d porous media demonstrating that transport and retention of bcs in porous media are controlled by the inherent attributes of biochar and several subsurface environmental factors wang et al 2013a yang et al 2019b yang et al 2017a however 1 d analysis may not represent the dimensional and structural complexities of real soil and groundwater systems well from 1 d column to 2 d tank experiment the physical and hydrological conditions are more realistic and approaching natural conditions dong et al 2019 phenrat et al 2010 it is an essential step toward understanding bcs fate in the field meanwhile to make up for the shortcomings of the black box this paper focus on the transport behavior of bcs in 2 d sand tank via light transmission visualization ltv method ltv method is a nondestructive noninvasive method that has been adopted to study the transport behavior of contaminants nanoparticles in 2 d sand tank bob et al 2008 niemet and selker 2001 phenrat et al 2010 x ray measurement gamma ray radiation and magnetic resonance imaging are also non invasive laboratory techniques due to limitations that are associated with using these three methods such as slow measurements hazards posed by working with high energy sources and high costs bird et al 2005 hopmans and dane 1986 liu et al 1993 the ltv technique has recently become popular ltv technology provides valuable insights into a variety of complex systems and processes such as the in situ measurement of tracer and pollutant concentrations using filled columns or etching micro models chrysikopoulos et al 2011 thomas and chrysikopoulos 2010 and the evaluation of fuel removal effects loukopoulos kousis and chrysikopoulos 2020 in this paper ltv method is first intended for monitor the transport and retention of bcs in 2 d sand tank under different conditions is ph and particle size of porous media are considered as influence factors to test their effect on bcs transport the main goals of this study were to 1 visualize and explore the combined effects of is ph particle size on the transport and retention of bcs in 2 d sand tank 2 reveal transport and retention regulation mechanisms of bcs in 2 d sand tank 3 establish a mathematical model for bcs transport behavior in 2 d sand tank 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar the raw material for biochar preparation was corn stover which were washed and dried for 24 h in a 50 c oven besides the corn stover was crushed through a pulverizes and then penetrate the screen 100 mesh the corn stover powder was then loaded into a crucible and charred by pyrolysis in a tube furnace the tube furnace was ramped up to a target temperature of 500 c at 5 c min under an oxygen limited atmosphere via flowing nitrogen by flowing n2 for 2 h when the temperature drops to room temperature biochar powder was collected in a desiccator 2 2 extraction and characterization of biochar colloids in preparing bcs biochar 6 g was added to deionized water 500 ml stirred and sonicated 30 min subsequently suspension was allowed to stand for 24 h to obtain an biochar micrometer particle mp suspension 2 μm based on stokes law wang et al 2013a afterward the mp suspension through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and the retained solid particles on the filter were used as the bcs 0 45 2 μm submicron particles for this experiment finally the filter membranes containing bcs were oven dried as subsequent experimental materials fang et al 2020 the concentration of bcs was determined with a uv visible spectrophotometer tu 1810 persee china at 674 nm wavelength a standard curve

washed by 0 25 m naoh hno3 and deionized water to remove the impurities and then dried 105 following previous studies li et al 2022 zeta potentials of quartz sands table s1 under different experiment conditions were determined using the zeta potential analyzer nano zs90 malvern uk johnson et al 1996 the detailed method for measuring the zeta potential of the quartz sands was included in appendix a supplementary data s2 2 4 experimental system a light transmission system was built up to reveal the transport law of bcs the experimental system is consisted with a 2 d sand tank light source dark chamber and ccd camera fig 1 sand tank 30 20 1 5 cm 3 comprised two pieces of tempered glass aluminum frames and top cap in this study dong et al 2019 six wells were installed at 5 cm horizontal intervals on both sides of the sand tank to allow flow of fluids these wells were sealed with stainless steel mesh 150 mesh to distribute flow evenly the sand tank was also designed with a dismountable sealed top lid to enable pressurized aquifer experiments an injection hole and sample injection needle were on the top cover 5 cm from inlet port quartz sand different sizes were used to build the saturated porous medium in the process of dry filling quartz sand of the same size gently compact every 2 cm to minimize delamination after filling the bcs injection source was fixed at 8 cm from the top light source was provided by lamp group which was installed at a position 50 cm away from the sand tank to insulate heat between lamp group and sand tank the ccd camera dhyana 400d china was installed at 1 5 m away from the sand tank sand tank was embedded inside the darkroom to ensure that the ccd camera captures only the light transmitted through the sand tank three series of sand tank experiments were conducted which consist of different sand particle size coarse sand medium sand and fine sand is 1 mm 10 mm 50 mm and ph value 4 7 10 the detail set of the experimental is shown in table1 before each experiment these sand packed tank was flushed with flow from the inlet on the left using deionized water and background solution about 48 h to reach hydrochemical equilibrium and the flow rate was controlled by longer pump bt100 2 j hebei china chemical conditions ph is of background solution were revised by using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide for the breakthrough experiments bcs 100 ml was accessed to the sand tank at 0 5 ml min the horizontally flowing background solution was then sequentially flushed from inlet boundary it would be stopped until no free bcs in the porewater to plot bcs breakthrough curve btcs effluent bcs were gathered by fraction collector bs 100a shanghai china during the experiment light transmission gray level images fig s2 of transport bcs were photographed by the ccd camera at 1 min sheet the gray level images were calculated and transformed to colored contour figures according to the beer lambert law dong et al 2019 the experimental parameters of the sand tank are shown in table 1 2 5 mathematical modeling mathematical models have been prevalently used to study the mobility behavior of bcs in a one dimensional form bradford et al 2003 wang et al 2013b in this study to simulate the migration of bcs in a two dimensional porous medium a simplified double monod model eq 1 and eq 2 were applied following the procedures of dong et al dong et al 2019 which was realized by computer software gms the model parameters are summarized in table 2 1 c t x i d ij c x j x i v i c ρ θ s t i j 1 2 2 ρ θ s t k c where c

3 1 effect of different is visualization of transport and retention behaviors and breakthrough curves btcs of bcs in 2 d sand tank with different is conditions 1 mm 10 mm 50 mm are shown in fig 2 ltv images fig 2 a b c and btcs fig 2d show that the retention capacity of bcs increases with increasing is indicating that is significantly affects the transport of bcs the ltv images also show that the bcs plume tends to increase and then decrease after injection as the water gradually reaches the right boundary fig 2a b c this is consistent with the biochar transport pattern in response to the btcs fig 2d the btcs of bcs in 2 d porous media started from the background level c c0 0 reaches a peak and then decreases to the background level after flushing with deionized water the breakthrough time of bcs in the 2 d sand tank is 112 min 128 min and 132 min when the is is 1 mm 10 mm and 50 mm respectively as is increases breakthrough of bcs shows a lag and the peak outflow shows a significant difference when the is augments from 1 mm to 50 mm the maximum outflow relative concentration ratio cmax c0 of the bcs decreases from 6 03 to 1 12 and the total outflow rate decreases from 29 6 to 7 4 with the increase of is the thickness of the double electric layer of colloidal particles is compressed which reduces the repulsive force between colloidal particles this leads to the formation of large agglomerates of colloids which is detrimental to the migration of colloids in porous media zhang et al 2010 the zeta potentials of both bcs and quartz sand are negative thus creating a repulsive force table s1 straining is another important mechanism of bcs retention which occurs when bcs are trapped in pore throats that are too small to allow passage bradford et al 2002 shen et al 2008 in addition the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek interaction energy barrier between the identically charged bc and surfaces of the collector grains in the porous media decreases with increasing is indicating that colloidal particles favor the deposition on the surface of quartz sand thus reducing its transport capacity liu et al 2013 the 2 d visualization results of this study support the conclusions obtained in the 1 d column experiments and show that is make a great difference to transport and retention of bcs 3 2 effect of different ph visualization of transport and retention behaviors and btcs of bcs in 2 d sand tank with different ph conditions 4 7 10 are shown in fig 3 ltv images fig 3 a b c and btcs fig 3d show that the retention capacity of bcs decreases with increasing ph indicating ph significantly affected the transport of bcs after the injection the bcs moves to the right with the water flow and is the first to break through to reach the right boundary at ph 10 as observed the movement trend of the bcs plume matches that of btcs bcs has the lowest mobility under acidic conditions while the transport capacity increased with increasing ph a finding consistent with previous 1 d column studies yang et al 2017b zhang et al 2010 the ph value increased from 4 to 10 the maximum outflow relative concentration ratio c max c 0 of bc increased from 5 5 to 15 1 and the total outflow rate increased from 28 8 to 78 2 it indicates that alkaline ph has a stronger effect on the transport of bc in homogeneous porous media while neutral and acidic conditions have a weaker ability to migrate bc when ph decreases from 10 to 4 the h content of solution increases and the surface electronegativity of bcs would decrease table s1 which make the colloidal particles more prone to agglomeration and thus unfavorable to the migration of colloids in addition the solution ph also has a significant effect on the migration behavior of other carbon nanomaterials fullerene carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide that the retention rate of carbon nanomaterials in the sediment decreases with increasing ph ghosh et al 2022 li et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 3 3 effect of different quartz sand particle size visualization of transport and retention behaviors and btcs of bcs in 2 d sand tank with three quartz sand particle size 120 180 μ m 180 380 μ m 380 830 μ m are shown in fig 4 ltv images fig 4 a b c and btcs fig 4d show that the retention capacity of bcs decreases with increasing quartz sand particle size indicating sand grain size significantly affected the transport of bcs and straining played a significant role in retention of bcs ltv images show that bcs held in porous media by straining were mostly found near the porous medium s intake where the retention concentration of fine sand was the greatest this is consistent with the large number of bcs retained at the inlet of the 1d filled column wang et al 2013a the tmr increases from 17 1 to 39 5 with increasing quartz sand particle size this hysteresis mechanism can be explained by subminimal minimum hahn and o melia 2004 colloidal aggregation wang et al 2011 straining tufenkji et al 2004 and surface charge inhomogeneity chatterjee et al 2010 on the whole fluidity of bcs increases with increasing sand particle size at a given initial concentration c0 in the vertical direction the migration of the bcs plume may be controlled by dispersion effects dong et al 2019 and in the lateral direction the water flow drive is the key factor affecting the transport of bcs fig 4 the penetration concentration in 2 d porous media is highest in coarse sand followed by medium sand and the second highest in fine sand zeta potentials of bcs and quartz sand of three particle sizes are negative and the absolute value of zeta potentials decreased from 45 9 mv to 39 97 mv owing to the compressed double electric layer which improves the deposition of bcs furthermore the porous medium containing fine sand has more fissures and narrower pore throats and the finer sand s greater specific surface area provides more deposition sites for the bcs under this deposition state the fine sand can also block pores and thus inhibit the transport of biochar colloids 3 4 numerical simulation previous studies have shown that the simplified double mono model could well description the migration and retention of engineered nanoparticles in a two dimensional porous medium dong et al 2019 the double monod model uses in this study not only reproduces the transport behavior of bcs fig s6 s7 s8 but also well describes the btcs of bcs r 2 0 94 in 2 d sand tank fig 2d 3d 4d as is increases from 1 mm to 50 mm the fitted k values increase from 0 0028 to 0 0046 indicating an increase in the deposition of bcs in porous media meanwhile when the ph reduces from 10 to 4 the k value for the medium sand fitness increase from 0 0014 to 0 0034 which is consistent with the experimental data the model also shows that particle size has an important effect on the migration of bcs in homogeneous sand tank for example the fitted k value decreases from 0 0047 to 0 0023 with the particle size increases the above simulation results shows that solution chemistry conditions and particle size have significant effects on the migration of bcs in 2 d sand tank 4 conclusion this study attempts to explore the transport and retention behaviors of bcs in 2 d porous media by a visualization system and the btcs of flow cell effluent concentration is used to quantitatively analyze employing this approach can capture transport and retention regulation of bcs this work shows that the transport ability of bcs gradually decreases with the increase of is in 2 d porous media under alkaline conditions the migration of bcs is stronger while under neutral and acidic conditions the surface electronegativity of bcs particles decreases making the colloid particles more likely to self collect which is not conducive to the migration of bcs in addition the mobility of bcs increases with the increase of sand grain size considering the vertical diffusion process the simplified double monod model can be well used to describe the migration and retention behavior of bcs in 2 d porous media this study visually provides a new perspective to explore the transport regulation of bcs in 2 d porous media which provide theoretical support for better assessment and prediction of its environmental risk credit authorship contribution statement ying zhao supervision methodology writing review

for 24 h in a 50 c oven besides the corn stover was crushed through a pulverizes and then penetrate the screen 100 mesh the corn stover powder was then loaded into a crucible and charred by pyrolysis in a tube furnace the tube furnace was ramped up to a target temperature of 500 c at 5 c min under an oxygen limited atmosphere via flowing nitrogen by flowing n2 for 2 h when the temperature drops to room temperature biochar powder was collected in a desiccator 2 2 extraction and characterization of biochar colloids in preparing bcs biochar 6 g was added to deionized water 500 ml stirred and sonicated 30 min subsequently suspension was allowed to stand for 24 h to obtain an biochar micrometer particle mp suspension 2 μm based on stokes law wang et al 2013a afterward the mp suspension through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and the retained solid particles on the filter were used as the bcs 0 45 2 μm submicron particles for this experiment finally the filter membranes containing bcs were

supplementary data s2 2 4 experimental system a light transmission system was built up to reveal the transport law of bcs the experimental system is consisted with a 2 d sand tank light source dark chamber and ccd camera fig 1 sand tank 30 20 1 5 cm 3 comprised two pieces of tempered glass aluminum frames and top cap in this study dong et al 2019 six wells were installed at 5 cm horizontal intervals on both sides of the sand tank to allow flow of fluids these wells were sealed with stainless steel mesh 150 mesh to distribute flow evenly the sand tank was also designed with a dismountable sealed top lid to enable pressurized aquifer experiments an injection hole and sample injection needle were on the top cover 5 cm from inlet port quartz sand different sizes were used to build the saturated porous medium in the process of dry filling quartz sand of the same size gently compact every 2 cm to minimize delamination after filling the bcs injection source was fixed at 8 cm from the top light source was provided by lamp group which was installed at a position 50 cm away from the sand tank to insulate heat between lamp group and sand tank the ccd camera dhyana 400d china was installed at 1 5 m away from the sand tank sand tank was embedded inside the darkroom to ensure that the ccd camera captures only the light transmitted through the sand tank three series of sand tank experiments were conducted which consist of different sand particle size coarse sand medium sand and fine sand is 1 mm 10 mm 50 mm and ph value 4 7 10 the detail set of the experimental is shown in table1 before each experiment these sand packed tank was flushed with flow from the inlet on the left using deionized water and background solution about 48 h to reach hydrochemical equilibrium and the flow rate was controlled by longer pump bt100 2 j hebei china chemical conditions ph is of background solution were revised by using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide for the breakthrough experiments bcs 100 ml was accessed to the sand tank at 0 5 ml min the horizontally flowing background solution was then sequentially flushed from inlet boundary it would be stopped until no free bcs in the porewater to plot bcs breakthrough curve btcs effluent bcs were gathered by fraction collector bs 100a shanghai china during the experiment light transmission gray level images fig s2 of transport bcs were photographed by the ccd camera at 1 min sheet the gray level images were calculated and transformed to colored contour figures according to the beer lambert law dong et al 2019 the experimental parameters of the sand tank are shown in table 1 2 5 mathematical modeling mathematical models have been prevalently used to study the mobility behavior of bcs in a one dimensional form bradford et al 2003 wang et al 2013b in this study to simulate the migration of bcs in a two dimensional porous medium a simplified double monod model eq 1 and eq 2 were applied following the procedures of dong et al dong et al 2019 which was realized by computer software gms the model parameters are summarized in table 2 1 c t x i d ij c x j x i v i c ρ θ s t i j 1 2 2 ρ θ s t k c where c

3 1 effect of different is visualization of transport and retention behaviors and breakthrough curves btcs of bcs in 2 d sand tank with different is conditions 1 mm 10 mm 50 mm are shown in fig 2 ltv images fig 2 a b c and btcs fig 2d show that the retention capacity of bcs increases with increasing is indicating that is significantly affects the transport of bcs the ltv images also show that the bcs plume tends to increase and then decrease after injection as the water gradually reaches the right boundary fig 2a b c this is consistent with the biochar transport pattern in response to the btcs fig 2d the btcs of bcs in 2 d porous media started from the background level c c0 0 reaches a peak and then decreases to the background level after flushing with deionized water the breakthrough time of bcs in the 2 d sand tank is 112 min 128 min and 132 min when the is is 1 mm 10 mm and 50 mm respectively as is increases breakthrough of bcs shows a lag and the peak outflow shows a significant difference when the is augments from 1 mm to 50 mm the maximum outflow relative concentration ratio cmax c0 of the bcs decreases from 6 03 to 1 12 and the total outflow rate decreases from 29 6 to 7 4 with the increase of is the thickness of the double electric layer of colloidal particles is compressed which reduces the repulsive force between colloidal particles this leads to the formation of large agglomerates of colloids which is detrimental to the migration of colloids in porous media zhang et al 2010 the zeta potentials of both bcs and quartz sand are negative thus creating a repulsive force table s1 straining is another important mechanism of bcs retention which occurs when bcs are trapped in pore throats that are too small to allow passage bradford et al 2002 shen et al 2008 in addition the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek interaction energy barrier between the identically charged bc and surfaces of the collector grains in the porous media decreases with increasing is indicating that colloidal particles favor the deposition on the surface of quartz sand thus reducing its transport capacity liu et al 2013 the 2 d visualization results of this study support the conclusions obtained in the 1 d column experiments and show that is make a great difference to transport and retention of bcs 3 2 effect of different ph visualization of transport and retention behaviors and btcs of bcs in 2 d sand tank with different ph conditions 4 7 10 are shown in fig 3 ltv images fig 3 a b c and btcs fig 3d show that the retention capacity of bcs decreases with increasing ph indicating ph significantly affected the transport of bcs after the injection the bcs moves to the right with the water flow and is the first to break through to reach the right boundary at ph 10 as observed the movement trend of the bcs plume matches that of btcs bcs has the lowest mobility under acidic conditions while the transport capacity increased with increasing ph a finding consistent with previous 1 d column studies yang et al 2017b zhang et al 2010 the ph value increased from 4 to 10 the maximum outflow relative concentration ratio c max c 0 of bc increased from 5 5 to 15 1 and the total outflow rate increased from 28 8 to 78 2 it indicates that alkaline ph has a stronger effect on the transport of bc in homogeneous porous media while neutral and acidic conditions have a weaker ability to migrate bc when ph decreases from 10 to 4 the h content of solution increases and the surface electronegativity of bcs would decrease table s1 which make the colloidal particles more prone to agglomeration and thus unfavorable to the migration of colloids in addition the solution ph also has a significant effect on the migration behavior of other carbon nanomaterials fullerene carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide that the retention rate of carbon nanomaterials in the sediment decreases with increasing ph ghosh et al 2022 li et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 3 3 effect of different quartz sand particle size visualization of transport and retention behaviors and btcs of bcs in 2 d sand tank with three quartz sand particle size 120 180 μ m 180 380 μ m 380 830 μ m are shown in fig 4 ltv images fig 4 a b c and btcs fig 4d show that the retention capacity of bcs decreases with increasing quartz sand particle size indicating sand grain size significantly affected the transport of bcs and straining played a significant role in retention of bcs ltv images show that bcs held in porous media by straining were mostly found near the porous medium s intake where the retention concentration of fine sand was the greatest this is consistent with the large number of bcs retained at the inlet of the 1d filled column wang et al 2013a the tmr increases from 17 1 to 39 5 with increasing quartz sand particle size this hysteresis mechanism can be explained by subminimal minimum hahn and o melia 2004 colloidal aggregation wang et al 2011 straining tufenkji et al 2004 and surface charge inhomogeneity chatterjee et al 2010 on the whole fluidity of bcs increases with increasing sand particle size at a given initial concentration c0 in the vertical direction the migration of the bcs plume may be controlled by dispersion effects dong et al 2019 and in the lateral direction the water flow drive is the key factor affecting the transport of bcs fig 4 the penetration concentration in 2 d porous media is highest in coarse sand followed by medium sand and the second highest in fine sand zeta potentials of bcs and quartz sand of three particle sizes are negative and the absolute value of zeta potentials decreased from 45 9 mv to 39 97 mv owing to the compressed double electric layer which improves the deposition of bcs furthermore the porous medium containing fine sand has more fissures and narrower pore throats and the finer sand s greater specific surface area provides more deposition sites for the bcs under this deposition state the fine sand can also block pores and thus inhibit the transport of biochar colloids 3 4 numerical simulation previous studies have shown that the simplified double mono model could well description the migration and retention of engineered nanoparticles in a two dimensional porous medium dong et al 2019 the double monod model uses in this study not only reproduces the transport behavior of bcs fig s6 s7 s8 but also well describes the btcs of bcs r 2 0 94 in 2 d sand tank fig 2d 3d 4d as is increases from 1 mm to 50 mm the fitted k values increase from 0 0028 to 0 0046 indicating an increase in the deposition of bcs in porous media meanwhile when the ph reduces from 10 to 4 the k value for the medium sand fitness increase from 0 0014 to 0 0034 which is consistent with the experimental data the model also shows that particle size has an important effect on the migration of bcs in homogeneous sand tank for example the fitted k value decreases from 0 0047 to 0 0023 with the particle size increases the above simulation results shows that solution chemistry conditions and particle size have significant effects on the migration of bcs in 2 d sand tank 4 conclusion this study attempts to explore the transport and retention behaviors of bcs in 2 d porous media by a visualization system and the btcs of flow cell effluent concentration is used to quantitatively analyze employing this approach can capture transport and retention regulation of bcs this work shows that the transport ability of bcs gradually decreases with the increase of is in 2 d porous media under alkaline conditions the migration of bcs is stronger while under neutral and acidic conditions the surface electronegativity of bcs particles decreases making the colloid particles more likely to self collect which is not conducive to the migration of bcs in addition the mobility of bcs increases with the increase of sand grain size considering the vertical diffusion process the simplified double monod model can be well used to describe the migration and retention behavior of bcs in 2 d porous media this study visually provides a new perspective to explore the transport regulation of bcs in 2 d porous media which provide theoretical support for better assessment and prediction of its environmental risk credit authorship contribution statement ying zhao supervision methodology writing review
