analyzed the results about inception cavitation number noise level velocity and pressure distributions leroux leroux et al 2004 experimentally researched the unsteadiness of cavitation around a naca66 hydrofoil by pressure sensor and the results showed that when the cavity length was less than half of foil chord the cavitation was nearly stable but when it extended 0 7 0 8 times of foil chord the cavity shed due to the re entrant jet further researches have been carried out to obtain an in depth understanding of flow fields dular dular et al 2005 experimentally investigated the cavitating flow

pressure were determined a significant re entrant jet was observed near the hydrofoil surface and it might be the inducement for the cavity shedding huang huang and wang 2011 employed a high speed video camera and piv to study the unsteady cavitation flow around a clark y hydrofoil the time averaged and instantaneous vorticity distributions the flow structures and the oscillatory characteristics of cavitation were revealed besides the experimental measurement computational fluid dynamics cfd also plays an important role in the investigation of cavitation mechanism for cfd research of cavitation the fundamental technique is the effective cavitation model which can describe the interphase mass transfer between the liquid and vapor phases kubota kubota et al 1992 proposed a bubbly two phase flow cavitation model to connect the density of liquid vapor mixture with bubble clusters kubota s model assumed that the bubbles were spherical and remained dispersed and distant enough from each other the bubble density was supposed to be constant among the computational domains recent years serial other transport equation models had been developed by solving the mass transport between two phases with the vaporization and condensation source terms such as kunz kunz et al 2000 schnerr sauer and schnerr 2000 singhal singhal et al 2002 senocak senocak and shyy 2002 owis owis and nayfeh 2004 and zwart zwart et al 2004 the mutual interaction between cavitation bubbles had been investigated to obtain a better understanding of the behavior of cavitation in consideration of the effect of dual frequency acoustic excitation zhang et al 2016b 2017 and liquid compressibility zhang et al 2016c another fundamental technique for cfd research of cavitation is the turbulence model which has critical effect on the computational accuracy of cavitating flow the widely used solution for three dimensional turbulent flows is the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in which the instantaneous quantity is decomposed into time averaged and fluctuating quantities the rans has difficulty in obtaining accurate instantaneous flow pattern such as the vortex while the large eddy simulation les can solve the vortex structure by low pass filtering of the navier stokes equations and obtain the instantaneous flow field to compare the above two numerical methods rodi 1997 employed rans method with different turbulence models to simulate the flow fields around a bluff body and compared the results with the les method and experiments comparison of results showed that the turbulent fluctuations predicted by the rans methods were underestimated whereas the les method obtained the data in coincidence with the experiments thus the les methods are more and more widely used in the simulation of cavitating flows to guarantee the capture of complex cavitation phenomenon wang and zhu 2010 liu et al 2009 recent years various researches focus on the unsteady characteristics of cavitation around hydrofoil cavitation can affect the characteristics of vortices zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2018 and lead to severe vibration wu et al 2015 2017 and it is validated that the dynamic behavior of cavity is significantly related to the vortex structure ji ji et al 2013a numerically investigated the shedding characteristics of cavity on a twisted u shape hydrofoil numerical simulations showed that the primary shedding was induced by the collision between a radially diverging re entrant jet and an attached cavity and the secondary shedding was related to the collision between side entrant jet and radially diverging re entrant jet chen chen et al 2016 studied the sheet cloud cavitation around a naca0012 hydrofoil on analysis of velocity filed evolution it was found that the adverse pressure gradient close to the cavity leads to vortex production and re entrant jet which was the main cause of the cloud cavitation shedding cavitation and vortex are interacting in flow field and their function mechanism can be revealed by the vorticity transport equation ji et al 2014 2015 despite various experimental and numerical researches on cavitation around hydrofoils the mechanism of cavitating flow still deserves further investigation in the present study les is employed to simulate the cavitating flow around a three dimensional hydrofoil ale 15 with the accuracy validation by experimental data of dular dular et al 2005 this study aims to elucidate the transient flow pattern cavitation vortex interaction and pressure fluctuation of hydrofoil ale 15 2 mathematical model the fluid in the cavitating flow field is considered as a homogeneous mixture of liquid and vapor and they have the same velocity and pressure the continuity and momentum equations in the cartesian coordinates are as follows 1 ρ m t ρ m u j x j 0 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j τ i j x j where ρ and μ are the density and dynamic viscosity calculated by weighted average of each phase volume fraction α ρ m ρ l α l ρ v α v μ m μ l α l μ v α v subscripts l v m denote the liquid phase vapor phase and the mixture phase respectively u is the velocity p is the pressure subscripts i j k denote the axes directions τ ij is the subgrid scale turbulent stress defined as follows 3 τ i j ρ u i u j u i u j 4 τ i j 2 μ t s i j 1 3 δ i j τ k k where s i j is the rate of strain tensor for the resolved scale μ t is the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity for the wale model in les in the present work it is defined as follows 5 μ

length for subgrid scales k is the von karman constant d is the distance to the closest wall v is the volume of the computational cell c s is the wale constant with value of 0 5 according to calibrations by the freely decaying isotropic homogeneous turbulence nicoud and ducros 1999 the cavitation model proposed by zwart zwart et al 2004 is employed to simulate the cavitation flow in this model a transport equation with source terms based on the homogeneous flow is used to solve the interphase mass transfer between liquid and vapor phases which is governed as follows 9 ρ v α v t ρ v α v u j x j m m the mass transfer for vaporization rate m and condensation rate m are modeled as follows 10 m c v a p 3 α n u c 1 α v ρ v r b 2 3 max p v p 0 ρ l 11 m c c o n 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 max p p v 0 ρ l where c vap and c con are the empirical calibration coefficients for vaporization and condensation rates and their values are 50 and 0 01 respectively r b is the bubble radius p v is the vapor pressure α nuc is the nucleation site volume fraction 3 numerical method and setting the three dimensional hydrofoil ale 15 is chosen as the research objective in the present work and its geometry is 50 mm wide 107 9 mm long and 16 mm thick asymmetric hydrofoil with circular leading edge according to the work of dular dular et al 2005 a slant angle of 15 is made at the leading edge along the spanwise direction to make a three dimensional geometry for the asymmetric hydrofoil as shown in fig 1 a the computation domain is set as 1000 mm long 100 mm high and 50 mm wide as shown in fig 1 b the inlet is set as 3 times of chord length from the leading edge and the outlet is set as 6 times of chord length from the trailing edge the attack angle is 5 and the cavitation number σ is 2 3 according to the experiment of dular dular et al 2005 and the cavitation number σ is defined as follows 12 σ p p v 0 5 ρ l v 2 where p is the static pressure at inlet v is the inflow velocity the boundary conditions are an imposed velocity of 13 m s at inlet and a static pressure of 197200 pa at outlet according to the cavitation number the free slip wall conditions are set at the upper and lower walls and the no slip wall conditions are set on the hydrofoil surfaces different boundary conditions have been employed on side walls in the spanwise direction including wall condition dular et al 2005 periodic condition ji et al 2015 and symmetry condition wu et al 2015 considering the geometrical condition the symmetry condition is selected in the present work which assumes that the normal velocity component at the symmetry plane boundary and the scalar variable gradients normal to the boundary are set as zero the commercial computational fluid dynamics codes ansys cfx 14 5 is employed to solve the turbulent flow the central difference scheme is used for the advection term and the second order backward euler scheme is employed in the transient term the steady cavitating flow simulation starts from a steady non cavitating flow field and the transient cavitating flow simulation starts from the obtained steady cavitating flow the transient time step is set as 2 10 5 according to the work of dular dular et al 2005 in transient simulation the convergence criterion is set to be the point when the root mean square residual is below 5 10 4 in ansys cfx 14 5 the parameter of maximum density ratio r lv ρ l ρ v has significant influence on the simulation results ji et al 2013b because the vapor density used in ansys cfx 14 5 is calculated by ρ l r lv rather than the given value in previous setting therefore if default value of 1000 is used in the simulation the vapor density will be overestimated and the cavitation will be underestimated because the true value should be 1801 44 998 2 0 554 4 numerical test and validation 4 1 independence test of mesh size totally four sets of computational meshes are used to check the influence of mesh size in numerical simulation in the independence test the mesh distribution in the mid plane remains the same while the number of nodes in the spanwise direction varies from 20 to 80 as shown in fig 2 the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are monitored to evaluate the effect of mesh size and they are defined as follows 13 c l f l 0 5 ρ l v 2 c l s 14 c d f d 0 5 ρ l v 2 c l s where f l and f d are the lift and drag forces c is the hydrofoil length with value of 101 2 mm and l s is the hydrofoil width with value of 50 mm table 1 lists the independence test of mesh size when the mesh size reaches 2000000 40 nodes in spanwise direction the lift and drag coefficients nearly remain the same thus the structured mesh with elements of 237446 is used in the present work and the corresponding y value is below 4 4 2 simulation accuracy validation in order to validate the accuracy of numerical simulations the simulation results are compared with the experimental data of dular dular et al 2005 fig 3 shows five monitor positions x 0 13 26 39 52 mm at the plane 5 mm from the wall where the hydrofoil is the shortest 50 sequential data are used to obtain the mean velocity profiles in x direction with an interval of 0 6 ms between two sequential data according to numerical analysis of dular tan et al 2017b the uncertainty of the mean velocity is within 1 when more than 40 monitored data are averaged therefore 50 sequential data in the present work is sufficient to obtain a stable solution which covers almost 10 typical cycles fig 3 shows the comparison of experimental and numerical mean velocities as shown in fig 4 the numerical results of velocity profiles are in good agreement with the experimental data especially the variation tendency in the vicinity of hydrofoil surface for the lines x 0 13 26 39 52 mm the velocity profiles at the top of the monitoring line are nearly the same because they are located in the main flow where the flow pattern is nearly stable the variations of velocity profile near the hydrofoil surface for different x positions are different for the line x 0 mm the velocity variation is not obvious except for the first point from the suction surface because it is situated in the head of attached cavitation the velocities close to the hydrofoil surface at lines x 13 26 mm are negative and the reason is the re entrant jet which causes back flow in this region the velocities near the hydrofoil surface at lines x 39 52 mm gradually decline towards the hydrofoil surface the shedding and collapse of the cloud cavitation which induces the perturbation and vortex may be the reason of this phenomenon 5 result and discussion 5 1 transient flow pattern fig 5 shows the time evolution of cavitation on hydrofoil from 58 ms to 61 ms with time interval of 0 6 ms between two sequential moments isosurfaces of 10 vapor volume fraction are illustrated the cavity shape tan et al 2015 from t 58 ms to t 58 6 ms the cavitation gradually grows separates and sheds mainly in the region where the hydrofoil is the shortest whereas the cavitation remains nearly stable in the region where the hydrofoil is the longest this unique phenomenon results from the velocity distribution due to the slant leading edge with an angle of 15 for hydrofoil ale 15 fig 6 shows the velocity vectors on the plane of 1 mm above the suction surface the arrow depicts the flow direction downstream the leading edge and the jets towards the shortest side will promote the cavitation separation an attached cavitation can be observed near the shortest side of hydrofoil which adheres to the suction surface all the time from the leading edge when the cavity length increases to the maximum the attached cavitation begins to break off at the 1 3 chord length from the leading edge where an interstice appears and grows up as shown in fig 5 e f finally the rear part of attached cavitation is separated from the hydrofoil surface the separated part expands its volume as soon as it breaks away from the hydrofoil surface and then falls into the main flow towards downstream subsequently it shrinks its body and splits into several tiny cavities and finally collapses and disappears the attached cavitation at the leading edge of hydrofoil grows again and a new cycle of cloud cavitation starts this is the process of inception a development a c separation c e shedding e f and collapse for the cloud cavitation fig 7 shows velocity vectors at the plane 5 mm from the wall where the hydrofoil is the shortest the velocity in the region of main flow nearly remains stable while the velocity vectors inside the cavity are extremely complex in fig 7 a b the sheet cavitation gradually grows from the hydrofoil leading edge with an obvious vortex structure inside the cavity of low pressure the vortex continues to grow up and moves away from the hydrofoil surface as shown in fig 7 c d a re entrant jet with clockwise rotation at the cavitation rear appears and then the re entrant jet shocks into the attached cavitation and promotes the cavitation shedding as soon as the vortex structure reaches its maximum strength the rear part of attached cavitation is separated from the hydrofoil surface as shown in fig 7 e strong vortex can promote the shedding process of cavity and the detailed mechanism will be discussed in the following chapter of cavitation vortex interaction finally in fig 7 f the vortex splits into two small scale vortices and the one inside the sheet cavitation near the leading edge grows again and will develop for the next cycle and the other one flows downstream 5 2 cavitation vortex interaction as shown in figs 5 and 7 there is significant relationship between the evolution of cavitation and vortex in order to reveal the mechanism of cavitation vortex interaction the transport equation of vorticity is employed as follows 15 d ω d t ω u ω u ρ m p ρ m 2 ν 2 ω where ω u is the vorticity vector ν is kinematic viscosity in eq 15 each term on the right hand side represents different generation sources of vorticity the first term ω u is the vortex stretching term which describes the stretching and tilting of a vortex the second term ω u is the vortex dilatation term due to the effect of fluid compressibility the third term ρ m p ρ m 2 is the baroclinic torque term the last term ν 2 ω is the viscos diffusion term previous researches ji et al 2013a huang et al 2014 show that the influence of viscos diffusion term is much smaller than the other three terms for flow of high reynolds number in the present research the reynolds number is as high as 1 4 106 so the research on cavitation vortex interaction mainly focuses on the first three terms vortex stretching term vortex dilatation term and baroclinic torque term fig 8 shows the distribution of vapor volume fraction vortex stretching term vortex dilatation term and baroclinic torque term at the plane 5 mm from the shortest side significant differences can be observed between the distributions of the three terms for all the moments the range and magnitude of vortex stretching term are larger than those of vortex dilatation term and the latter are even larger than those of baroclinic torque term the variations of vortex stretching and vortex dilatation occur not only in the region of cavitation but also in boundary layers near the hydrofoil surface and in wakes downstream the trailing edge the shape of vortex dilatation term is consistent with that of vapor volume fraction because it is directly related to volumetric expansion of fluid in the phase transition however the baroclinic torque term mainly appears at the leading edge of hydrofoil and the rear of cavitation where the pressure gradient reaches its maximum for t 58 ms and t 58 6 ms the sheet cavitation near hydrofoil surface splits into two parts gradually evolution of vorticity shows that the splitting surface of cavitation involves high values of vortex stretching term and vortex dilatation term corresponding to the drastic stretching and expansion of vortex following the splitting progress for t 59 2 ms and t 59 8 ms the upper separated part continues to expand and then it is rolled up into a large vortex as shown in fig 8 c and d distribution of vortex stretching term around the liquid vapor interface of cloud cavitation shows a stretching region near the main flow and a tilting region near the hydrofoil surface for t 60 4 ms and t 61 ms the cloud cavitation flows downstream with rotational movement in clockwise direction combined with the analysis of vectors in fig 7 e and 7 f the results reveal a significant relationship between the vortex structure and the cavitation shape and the conclusion is that the vortex stretching term of high level appears around the liquid vapor interface and the vortex dilatation of high level appears inside the cloud cavitation those two terms have main function on the cavitation vortex interaction the liquid vapor interface at the rear part of attached cavitation can be captured by the baroclinic torque term the baroclinic torque term is sensitive to the variation of density according to its definition thus the magnitude of baroclinic torque term is significant near the liquid vapor interface but it is negligible inside the cavitation see fig 9 5 3 pressure fluctuations on hydrofoil surface due to the unsteady shedding behavior of cavity remarkable pressure fluctuations occur on the hydrofoil surface 25 monitoring points are set at the suction surface to analyze the characteristics of pressure fluctuations the distance between two adjacent points is 10 mm and the two rows near hydrofoil sides are 5 mm away from the sides an important feature of hydrofoil ale 15 is the asymmetry at leading edge which leads to a relatively stable cavitation at the longest side and an unsteady cavitation at the shortest side the time evolution of pressure fluctuations on monitor points 1 5 shortest side and 21 25 longest side is illustrated in fig 10 for monitor points 1 5 near the shortest side a pressure pulse shifts by sequent and gradually decays continuous red lines in fig 10 due to cavitation oscillation with an average frequency of 111 98 hz in the rear part of attached cavitation and region of cloud cavitation monitor points 3 5 another pressure pulse appears at the same instant because of cavitation shedding dashed red lines in fig 10 with an average frequency of 334 45 hz in contrast for points 21 25 near the longest side the pressure fluctuations are relatively stable especially in the region near the leading edge pressure pulses induced by cavitation shedding can also be observed but they are really slight in comparison with points 1 5 maximum amplitude occurs in the monitoring point 23 which is close to the liquid vapor interface at the rear part of sheet cavitation the fast fourier transform fft is used to analyze the frequency domain of pressure fluctuations fig 11 shows the power spectrum of pressure fluctuations on monitor points 1 5 according to the results of power spectrum density psd the primary frequency of point 5 in the region of cloud cavitation is 307 14 hz which is quite close to the shedding frequency of 302 hz measured by dular dular et al 2005 this frequency is also approximately in coincidence with the pressure pulse of 334 45 hz discussed above the resolved scales of spatial spectrum are asymptotic to f 5 3 scaling which can be obtained according to the taylor s hypothesis these results indicate that the current simulation can capture the isotropy turbulence spectrum within an inertial subrange 6 conclusions numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the cavitating flow around a three dimensional hydrofoil ale 15 by means of large eddy simulation and transport equation cavitation model the numerical results of statistical average velocity are in good agreement with experimental data which validates the accuracy of numerical method the transient flow pattern cavitation vortex interaction and pressure fluctuation of cavitating flow are analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the time evolution of cavity structure around the hydrofoil ale 15 shows that the vortex structure and re entrant jet in the vicinity of hydrofoil surface are the major reasons resulting in cavitation breakage and shedding 2 the vortex stretching term and the vortex dilatation term of vorticity transport equation have main function on the cavitation vortex interaction the baroclinic torque term mainly reacts in liquid vapor interface especially for the rear part of sheet cavitation 3 time evolution of pressure fluctuations shows that near the hydrofoil shortest side a pressure pulse shifts by sequent and gradually decays due to cavitation oscillation the power spectrum of pressure fluctuations on hydrofoil surface shows that the primary frequency of shedding cavitation is 307 14 hz which agrees well with the experimental data of 302 hz acknowledgments this work has been supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51741906 the

according to the work of dular dular et al 2005 in transient simulation the convergence criterion is set to be the point when the root mean square residual is below 5 10 4 in ansys cfx 14 5 the parameter of maximum density ratio r lv ρ l ρ v has significant influence on the simulation results ji et al 2013b because the vapor density used in ansys cfx 14 5 is calculated by ρ l r lv rather than the given value in previous setting therefore if default value of 1000 is used in the simulation the vapor density will be overestimated and the cavitation will be underestimated because the true value should be 1801 44 998 2 0 554 4 numerical test and validation 4 1 independence test of mesh size totally four sets of computational meshes are used to check the influence of mesh size in numerical simulation in the independence test the mesh distribution in the mid plane remains the same while the number of nodes in the spanwise direction varies from 20 to 80 as shown in fig 2 the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are monitored to evaluate the effect of mesh size and they are defined as follows 13 c l f l 0 5 ρ l v 2 c l s 14 c d f d 0 5 ρ l v 2 c l s where f l and f d are the lift and drag forces c is the hydrofoil length with value of 101 2 mm and l s is the hydrofoil width with value of 50 mm table 1 lists the independence test of mesh size when the mesh size reaches 2000000 40 nodes in spanwise direction the lift and drag coefficients nearly remain the same thus the structured mesh with elements of 237446 is used in the present work and the corresponding y value is below 4 4 2 simulation accuracy validation in order to validate the accuracy of numerical simulations the simulation results are compared with the experimental data of dular dular et al 2005 fig 3 shows five monitor positions x 0 13 26 39 52 mm at the plane 5 mm from the wall where the hydrofoil is the shortest 50 sequential data are used to obtain the mean velocity profiles in x direction with an interval of 0 6 ms between two sequential data according to numerical analysis of dular tan et al 2017b the uncertainty of the mean velocity is within 1 when more than 40 monitored data are averaged therefore 50 sequential data in the present work is sufficient to obtain a stable solution which covers almost 10 typical cycles fig 3 shows the comparison of experimental and numerical mean velocities as shown in fig 4 the numerical results of velocity profiles are in good agreement with the experimental data especially the variation tendency in the vicinity of hydrofoil surface for the lines x 0 13 26 39 52 mm the velocity profiles at the top of the monitoring line are nearly the same because they are located in the main flow where the flow pattern is nearly stable the variations of velocity profile near the hydrofoil surface for different x positions are different for the line x 0 mm the velocity variation is not obvious except for the first point from the suction surface because it is situated in the head of attached cavitation the velocities close to the hydrofoil surface at lines x 13 26 mm are negative and the reason is the re entrant jet which causes back flow in this region the velocities near the hydrofoil surface at lines x 39 52 mm gradually decline towards the hydrofoil surface the shedding and collapse of the cloud cavitation which induces the perturbation and vortex may be the reason of this phenomenon 5 result and discussion 5 1 transient flow pattern fig 5 shows the time evolution of cavitation on hydrofoil from 58 ms to 61 ms with time interval of 0 6 ms between two sequential moments isosurfaces of 10 vapor volume fraction are illustrated the cavity shape tan et al 2015 from t 58 ms to t 58 6 ms the cavitation gradually grows separates and sheds mainly in the region where the hydrofoil is the shortest whereas the cavitation remains nearly stable in the region where the hydrofoil is the longest this unique phenomenon results from the velocity distribution due to the slant leading edge with an angle of 15 for hydrofoil ale 15 fig 6 shows the velocity vectors on the plane of 1 mm above the suction surface the arrow depicts the flow direction downstream the leading edge and the jets towards the shortest side will promote the cavitation separation an attached cavitation can be observed near the shortest side of hydrofoil which adheres to the suction surface all the time from the leading edge when the cavity length increases to the maximum the attached cavitation begins to break off at the 1 3 chord length from the leading edge where an interstice appears and grows up as shown in fig 5 e f finally the rear part of attached cavitation is separated from the hydrofoil surface the separated part expands its volume as soon as it breaks away from the hydrofoil surface and then falls into the main flow towards downstream subsequently it shrinks its body and splits into several tiny cavities and finally collapses and disappears the attached cavitation at the leading edge of hydrofoil grows again and a new cycle of cloud cavitation starts this is the process of inception a development a c separation c e shedding e f and collapse for the cloud cavitation fig 7 shows velocity vectors at the plane 5 mm from the wall where the hydrofoil is the shortest the velocity in the region of main flow nearly remains stable while the velocity vectors inside the cavity are extremely complex in fig 7 a b the sheet cavitation gradually grows from the hydrofoil leading edge with an obvious vortex structure inside the cavity of low pressure the vortex continues to grow up and moves away from the hydrofoil surface as shown in fig 7 c d a re entrant jet with clockwise rotation at the cavitation rear appears and then the re entrant jet shocks into the attached cavitation and promotes the cavitation shedding as soon as the vortex structure reaches its maximum strength the rear part of attached cavitation is separated from the hydrofoil surface as shown in fig 7 e strong vortex can promote the shedding process of cavity and the detailed mechanism will be discussed in the following chapter of cavitation vortex interaction finally in fig 7 f the vortex splits into two small scale vortices and the one inside the sheet cavitation near the leading edge grows again and will develop for the next cycle and the other one flows downstream 5 2 cavitation vortex interaction as shown in figs 5 and 7 there is significant relationship between the evolution of cavitation and vortex in order to reveal the mechanism of cavitation vortex interaction the transport equation of vorticity is employed as follows 15 d ω d t ω u ω u ρ m p ρ m 2 ν 2 ω where ω u is the vorticity vector ν is kinematic viscosity in eq 15 each term on the right hand side represents different generation sources of vorticity the first term ω u is the vortex stretching term which describes the stretching and tilting of a vortex the second term ω u is the vortex dilatation term due to the effect of fluid compressibility the third term ρ m p ρ m 2 is the baroclinic torque term the last term ν 2 ω is the viscos diffusion term previous researches ji et al 2013a huang et al 2014 show that the influence of viscos diffusion term is much smaller than the other three terms for flow of high reynolds number in the present research the reynolds number is as high as 1 4 106 so the research on cavitation vortex interaction mainly focuses on the first three terms vortex stretching term vortex dilatation term and baroclinic torque term fig 8 shows the distribution of vapor volume fraction vortex stretching term vortex dilatation term and baroclinic torque term at the plane 5 mm from the shortest side significant differences can be observed between the distributions of the three terms for all the moments the range and magnitude of vortex stretching term are larger than those of vortex dilatation term and the latter are even larger than those of baroclinic torque term the variations of vortex stretching and vortex dilatation occur not only in the region of cavitation but also in boundary layers near the hydrofoil surface and in wakes downstream the trailing edge the shape of vortex dilatation term is consistent with that of vapor volume fraction because it is directly related to volumetric expansion of fluid in the phase transition however the baroclinic torque term mainly appears at the leading edge of hydrofoil and the rear of cavitation where the pressure gradient reaches its maximum for t 58 ms and t 58 6 ms the sheet cavitation near hydrofoil surface splits into two parts gradually evolution of vorticity shows that the splitting surface of cavitation involves high values of vortex stretching term and vortex dilatation term corresponding to the drastic stretching and expansion of vortex following the splitting progress for t 59 2 ms and t 59 8 ms the upper separated part continues to expand and then it is rolled up into a large vortex as shown in fig 8 c and d distribution of vortex stretching term around the liquid vapor interface of cloud cavitation shows a stretching region near the main flow and a tilting region near the hydrofoil surface for t 60 4 ms and t 61 ms the cloud cavitation flows downstream with rotational movement in clockwise direction combined with the analysis of vectors in fig 7 e and 7 f the results reveal a significant relationship between the vortex structure and the cavitation shape and the conclusion is that the vortex stretching term of high level appears around the liquid vapor interface and the vortex dilatation of high level appears inside the cloud cavitation those two terms have main function on the cavitation vortex interaction the liquid vapor interface at the rear part of attached cavitation can be captured by the baroclinic torque term the baroclinic torque term is sensitive to the variation of density according to its definition thus the magnitude of baroclinic torque term is significant near the liquid vapor interface but it is negligible inside the cavitation see fig 9 5 3 pressure fluctuations on hydrofoil surface due to the unsteady shedding behavior of cavity remarkable pressure fluctuations occur on the hydrofoil surface 25 monitoring points are set at the suction surface to analyze the characteristics of pressure fluctuations the distance between two adjacent points is 10 mm and the two rows near hydrofoil sides are 5 mm away from the sides an important feature of hydrofoil ale 15 is the asymmetry at leading edge which leads to a relatively stable cavitation at the longest side and an unsteady cavitation at the shortest side the time evolution of pressure fluctuations on monitor points 1 5 shortest side and 21 25 longest side is illustrated in fig 10 for monitor points 1 5 near the shortest side a pressure pulse shifts by sequent and gradually decays continuous red lines in fig 10 due to cavitation oscillation with an average frequency of 111 98 hz in the rear part of attached cavitation and region of cloud cavitation monitor points 3 5 another pressure pulse appears at the same instant because of cavitation shedding dashed red lines in fig 10 with an average frequency of 334 45 hz in contrast for points 21 25 near the longest side the pressure fluctuations are relatively stable especially in the region near the leading edge pressure pulses induced by cavitation shedding can also be observed but they are really slight in comparison with points 1 5 maximum amplitude occurs in the monitoring point 23 which is close to the liquid vapor interface at the rear part of sheet cavitation the fast fourier transform fft is used to analyze the frequency domain of pressure fluctuations fig 11 shows the power spectrum of pressure fluctuations on monitor points 1 5 according to the results of power spectrum density psd the primary frequency of point 5 in the region of cloud cavitation is 307 14 hz which is quite close to the shedding frequency of 302 hz measured by dular dular et al 2005 this frequency is also approximately in coincidence with the pressure pulse of 334 45 hz discussed above the resolved scales of spatial spectrum are asymptotic to f 5 3 scaling which can be obtained according to the taylor s hypothesis these results indicate that the current simulation can capture the isotropy turbulence spectrum within an inertial subrange 6 conclusions numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the cavitating flow around a three dimensional hydrofoil ale 15 by means of large eddy simulation and transport equation cavitation model the numerical results of statistical average velocity are in good agreement with experimental data which validates the accuracy of numerical method the transient flow pattern cavitation vortex interaction and pressure fluctuation of cavitating flow are analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the time evolution of cavity structure around the hydrofoil ale 15 shows that the vortex structure and re entrant jet in the vicinity of hydrofoil surface are the major reasons resulting in cavitation breakage and shedding 2 the vortex stretching term and the vortex dilatation term of vorticity transport equation have main function on the cavitation vortex interaction the baroclinic torque term mainly reacts in liquid vapor interface especially for the rear part of sheet cavitation 3 time evolution of pressure fluctuations shows that near the hydrofoil shortest side a pressure pulse shifts by sequent and gradually decays due to cavitation oscillation the power spectrum of pressure fluctuations on hydrofoil surface shows that the primary frequency of shedding cavitation is 307 14 hz which agrees well with the experimental data of 302 hz acknowledgments this work has been supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51741906 the

23241,due to the nonlinear dynamics and uncertainties usually present in wave energy conversion systems the efficiency of these devices can be enhanced employing a robust control algorithms wave energy converters are constructed using electric generators of variable velocity like double feed induction generator dfig since they may improve the system efficiency to generate power when compared to fixed speed generators the main reason is that this generators with variable speed may adapt the speed of the turbine in order to maintain the optimal flow coefficient values which improves the efficiency of the wells turbine however a suitable speed controller is required in these systems first in order to avoid the stalling phenomenon and second in order to track the optimal turbine reference velocity that optimizes the power generation in this paper a real time sliding mode control scheme for wave energy conversion systems that incorporate a wells turbine and a dfig is proposed the lyapunov stability theory is used to analyse the stability of this control scheme under parameter uncertainties and system disturbances next the proposed control scheme is validated first by means of some simulation examples using the matlab simulink software and second using a real time experimental platform based on a dspace ds1103 control board keywords wave power wave energy converters sliding mode control real time control dfig doubly fed induction generator 1 introduction renewable energy sources i e wind and solar energy have acquired an increasing interest in the last decade due to the harmful contamination effects caused by the traditional sources of energy recently the international community has also paid special attention to wave energy which could supply a considerable part of the electricity demand of some countries lopez et al 2015 reguero et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 torres et al 2016 when the wind blows on the surface of the ocean it causes the waves in some locations the wind blows consistently and with sufficient force to produce continuous waves along the shoreline since ocean waves contain tremendous energy potential different wave power devices have been designed to extract their energy typically these devices benefit from the surface motion of ocean waves or from pressure fluctuations below the surface ning et al 2016 son and yeung 2017 tom et al 2017 in this study an oscillating water columns owc device mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 rezanejad et al 2017 is employed in order to extract the energy of the ocean waves into mechanical energy using a wells turbine falcão and henriques 2016 halder et al 2016 shehata et al 2017 the mechanical energy harvested in owc s is determined by wave height wave speed wavelength and water density carballo and iglesias 2012 lópez et al 2016 however the energy produced in these systems can be improved by means of the turbine rotational speed control because the turbine speed affects the hydrodynamic process of wave energy absorption henriques et al 2016a 2016b falcão et al 2017 the mechanism of the wave energy conversion systems follows an oscillating movement so the rotor velocity of the coupled electric generator is variable these systems should incorporate an ac ac converter in order to generate an electric power of constant voltage and frequency tsang and chan 2015 however in this configuration the converter should manage all the generated power and this fact present some lacks like the cost of the converters and the power lost in the conversion on the other hand the generation system could incorporate the doubly fed induction generator dfig that is currently used by other power generation plants for example the wind turbine systems because it allows a variable turbine speed operation kahla et al 2015 hamzaoui et al 2016 the stator of the dfig is directly connected to the grid and the rotor of the dfig is connected to the grid using a variable frequency converter vfc the advantage of this configuration is that in order to get the total control of the generator the vfc only have to manage a fraction of the nominal power around 25 30 the vfc incorporates one voltage source located on the side of the grid called grid side converter gsc and another voltage source located on the side of the rotor called rotor side converter rsc these voltage source converters are connected back to back through a capacitor pena et al 1996 song et al 2010 barambones 2012 this kind of systems are habitually controlled using a vector control scheme and cascaded pi current and power loops taveiros et al 2015 however the nonlinear dynamics and the uncertainties presented in these systems suggest the use of a more robust controller in order to improve the system performance in this sense one option is to consider the sliding mode control smc because this kind of controller presents a good performance against unmodeled dynamics insensitivity to parameter variations and an excellent rejection to the external disturbances utkin 1993 moreover the smc has been used in order to control several types of induction machines in the last decade and good results has been obtained barambones and alkorta 2014 soufi et al 2016 farhat et al 2017 this work presents a real time smc scheme in order to improve the power generation of a dfig implemented in a owc wave power plants the proposed control scheme regulates the turbine speed in order to track the desired speed that maximize the power extraction from the wells turbine because it optimizes the wells turbine efficiency this optimization of the wells turbine efficiency is obtained selecting the flow coefficient value that maximizes the power generation moreover this optimization of the wells turbine efficiency that maximizes the power generation also avoids the stalling phenomenon because the proposed control scheme maintains the flow coefficient at the best efficiency point bep below the stalling point there are several works in the literature that regulates the turbine speed in order to avoid the stalling behaviour alberdi et al 2009 garrido et al 2012 2013 however in these works the turbine speed is not regulated in order to follow a reference speed that follows the variation of the airflow speed in order to obtain the best flow coefficient that maintains the system in the bep despite variations of the airflow speed the turbine speed is controlled by means of the rotor current of the dfig using the sliding mode control theory regulating the turbine velocity the proposed control scheme optimizes the flow coefficients in order to obtain the maximum power extraction in the wave power generation plant under system uncertainties and wave power variations in order to confirm that the designed controller meets the proposed goals first this controller for a dfig used in a wave power generation plant is validated using the matlab simulink software in these simulations several operating conditions are tested and satisfactory results are obtained next the real performance of the proposed control scheme is also validated over a real experimental platform based in a dfig the main componentes of this control platform are the dspace ds1103 controller board the commercial induction machine leroy somer of 7 5 kw and the synchronous ac servo motor 190u2 unimotor of 10 6 kw the stator of the dfig is directly connected to the grid and the rotor of the dfig is also connected to the grid through the vfc the shaft of the dfig and the shaft of the synchronous ac servo motor are mechanically connected so the ac servo motor emulates the torque profiles that the wells turbine generates as response to the oscillations of the free surface in the owc chamber in this experimental platform several real tests employing different operating conditions are carried out and the obtained results are satisfying this paper is organized as follows in section 2 is presented a theoretical modeling of the owc wave power plant that incorporates a wells turbine in section 3 the design of the proposed sliding mode controller that optimizes the power generation and avoids the stalling phenomenon is presented section 4 presents the simulation and the experimental results developed in the experimental platform that is also described in this section finally some concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 modeling of the owc plant the hydrodynamic energy of the waves can be transformed to an oscillating air flow using the owc device shown in fig 1 the owc system is composed of a fixed or floating hollow structure open to the sea below the water surface that traps air above the inner free surface wave action alternately compresses and decompresses the trapped air which is forced to flow through a turbine that generates the rotational energy henriques et al 2016b this turbine is connected to a generator by means of a gear box in order to produce the electrical energy jayashankar et al 2000 it should be noted that the airflow in the chamber is bidirectional depending if the wave is hitting or it is reflected in this sense to produce a continuous unidirectional rotation of the electrical generator the wells turbine can be used in order to generate the rotational energy the wells turbine is a low pressure air turbine that independent of the direction of the air flow rotates continuously in one direction prof alan arthur wells of queen s university belfast designed this turbine in the late 1970s the power from the owc available to a turbine is 1 p i n δ p v x a where v x m s is the airflow speed δ p pa is the pressure drop across the turbine ρ kg m3 is the air density and a m2 is the area of the section of the turbine in the owc system considered in this work the turbogenerator module is composed by a wells turbine mechanically connected to an air cooled dfig by means of a gearbox in order to increase the rotational speed and accordingly to reduce the mechanical torque the rotor circuit of the dfig is connected to the grid through a vfc and the active power flow between the rotor circuit and the grid must be controlled both in magnitude and in direction in order to produce electrical active power to the utility grid at constant frequency and voltage moreover in this machine the rotor speed value can operate in an extended range from subsynchronous speed to supersynchronous rotational speed the vfc is composed of two four quadrant igbt pwm converters usually called grid side converter on the side of the grid and rotor side converter on the side of the rotor these converters are back to back connected by means of a dc link capacitor it should be noted that in this configuration the power electronic converters only need to handle a small portion of the nominal power around 25 30 in order to produce the electrical power in the grid because only the rotor power goes to the grid through the vfc the stator power goes directly to the grid therefore the power converters used in this configuration are smaller that the power converters used in other configurations therefore the power losses and the power electronic converters cost are also smaller which is the main advantage of this configuration in the owc systems the turbogenerator may include an inertia wheel drive in order to smooth the output power curve this inertia wheel makes the system particularly appropriate for the implementation of sliding mode control schemes because the undesired chattering that could appear in this kind of controllers will be mechanically absorbed by the inertia of the system as it has been indicated previously a wells turbine have been considered in this work in order to extract the mechanical energy from the airflow the wells turbine presents a robust and simple symmetrical blade design and therefore the wells turbine always turns in the same direction regardless of the direction in which the airflow passes through the turbine the equations used for the modeling of the turbine are given by jayashankar et al 2000 2 δ p c a k 1 a v x 2 r w 2 3 t t c t k r v x 2 r w 2 4 t t c t r a c a d p 5 k ρ b n l 2 6 ϕ v x r w 7 q v x a 8 η t t w q δ p c t c a ϕ where c a is the power coefficient c t is the torque coefficient the generated torque is t t n m ϕ is the flow coefficient k kg m is a turbine constant r m is the turbine radius w rad s is the turbine angular velocity the blade span is b m the blade number is n the blade chord is l m the rate of the flow is q m3 s a m2 is the area of the section of the turbine and the efficiency of the turbine is η the previous equations show that the torque and the power generated by the wells turbine can be calculated based on the torque coefficient and the power coefficient respectively moreover the characteristic curves of the wells turbine are composed by the relationship between the torque coefficient and the power coefficient versus the flow coefficient due to the characteristic dynamics of the wells turbine when the velocity of the airflow surpasses one critical value that is related to the wells turbine rotational velocity the performance of this turbine fall down drastically jayashankar et al 2000 this effect is usually called stalling phenomenon the wells turbine stalls when the relative angle between the tangential speed of the turbine and the axial velocity of the input airflow is greater than a value around 14 in fig 2 can be observed the torque coefficient versus the flow coefficient ϕ v x r w for the wells turbine used in this work this figure shows that the torque coefficient c t of the wells turbine fall down drastically when the stalling phenomenon appears this figure shows the characteristic curve for one particular wells turbine and it depends on the parameters used in the turbine design however the characteristic curves for other wells turbines present the same behaviour fig 2 shows that in the wells turbine employed in the present paper the stalling phenomenon appears when the flow coefficient reaches the value 0 3 this value may be different depending of the wells turbine characteristic curve therefore from this figure it can be also concluded that for this wells turbine a good flux coefficient value is ϕ b e p 0 29 because with this flux coefficient value the stalling behaviour is avoided and the value of the torque coefficient c t presents a local maximum it should be noted that taking into account the oscillatory dynamics of the flow coefficient due to the oscillatory movement of the air flow produced by the ocean waves the flow coefficient value is always oscillating from zero to one positive value so the optimum working zone for the flow coefficient is located between zero and the point of the stalling behaviour additionally from eqn 6 it is deduced that the flux coefficient could be maintained more time at its optimum value by means of the turbine velocity regulation because when the airflow velocity increases decreases we can increase decrease the turbine velocity in order to maintain the flux coefficient constant in the value ϕ b e p 0 29 this turbine speed regulation on the one hand improves the torque coefficient and therefore improves the power generation and on the other hand avoids the stalling behaviour therefore maximum power extraction from the ocean waves is obtained employing the next command value for the turbine velocity 9 w v x r ϕ b e p 3 the design of the sliding mode controller in the owc generation system that incorporates a dfig the objective of the maximum power extraction is achieved by regulating the rotational speed of the wells turbine in order to avoid the stalling behaviour in order to get this objective a smc scheme is proposed in order to regulate the rotor speed of the dfig the speed of the dfig is regulated by means of the quadrature component of the rotor current in the model description it is explained that the shaft speed of the owc turbogenerator should be adjusted so that the flow coefficient ϕ remains bounded in order to extract the maximum power from the sea in this case the maximum stalling free torque coefficient c t can be obtained it should be noted that there is a unique generator speed reference value to satisfy the condition of optimum flow coefficient value to get the maximum wave energy extraction for a given pressure drop input d p this value can be calculated based on the characteristic curve of the wells turbine under consideration provided by the manufacturer however considering that all wells turbines present a similar stalling behaviour this operation may always be extended to other wells turbines in this sense the control objective is similar to that used in other well established dfig applications like wind turbines in which the maximum power point tracking control strategies are defined in these systems a tracking reference for the turbine speed should be followed by the control system in this case the reference depends on the maximum power variation with the rotational speed of the dfig this reference is also different for each wind turbine depending of its aerodynamic design that provides different power coefficient versus tip speed ratio characteristic curve nagai et al 2009 the design of the smc uses the knowledge of the turbogenerator dynamics so the turbogenerator dynamics should be calculated the turbogenerator dynamics incorporate one mechanical part and other electrical part the next equation represents the mechanical part for the dynamic of the turbogenerator 10 j w b w t t γ t e where t t is the torque generated in the turbine by the air flow produced by the waves b is the viscous friction coefficient t e is the generator torque j is the inertia moment w is the angular velocity of the turbine shaft and the gear ratio γ w e w is the relation between the angular velocity of the turbine shaft w and the angular velocity of the generator rotor w e as it is well known the field oriented control referring all expressions to the stator flux reference frame can be used in order to simplify the electrical equations of the dfig in the reference frame oriented in the stator flux the d axis is aligned with the stator flux linkage vector ψ s and then ψ d s ψ s and ψ q s 0 then the next relationships are obtained barambones 2013 11 i q s l m i q r l s 12 i d s l m i m s i d r l s 13 i m s v q s r s i q s w s l m 14 t e 3 p 4 l m 2 i m s i q r l s 15 q s 3 2 w s l m 2 i m s i m s i d

the pole numbers and σ 1 l m 2 l s l r it should be noted that the stator magnetizing current i m s can be considered constant because the influence of the stator resistance is small and the stator is connected to the grid pena et al 1996 accordingly the electromagnetic torque can be calculated as follows 19 t e k t i q r where the torque constant value k t is calculated below 20 k t 3 p 4 l m 2 i m s l s substituting equation 19 in equation 10 the next dynamic equation may be obtained where the uncertainty terms has also been included 21 w c 1 c 1 w f f c 2 c 2 i q s where c 1 b j c 2 γ k t j f t t j and the terms c 1 c 2 and f represent the uncertainties of the terms c 1 c 2 and f respectively then the dynamic equation 21 can be rewritten as 22 w c 1 w f c 2 i q s δ t where the uncertainty terms have been collected in the term δ 23 δ t c 1 w t f t c 2 i q r t now in order to compensate for the above described uncertainties a sliding mode control scheme is proposed the speed tracking error is defined as follows 24 e t w t w t where w is the command for the turbine speed in order to extract the maximum power from the waves the previous equation can be derived with respect to time 25 e t w w c 1 w t f t c 2 i q r t w t δ t next a smc scheme is proposed in order to track the turbine speed command that provides the maximum wave power extraction despite of the system uncertainties the sliding variable s t is defined as 26 s t e t 0 t k e τ d τ where k is a positive constant gain next the proposed sliding surface is 27 s t e t 0 t k e τ d τ 0 finally the speed controller based on the sliding mode is obtained 28 i q r t 1 c 2 k e β sgn s c 1 w w f where β is the switching gain and sgn is the sign function in order to achieve the tracking of the reference velocity the next condition should be fulfilled c 1 the sliding gain β of the controller must be selected greater than the system uncertainties that is β δ t for all time the closed loop stability of the proposed control scheme based on the control law presented in equation 28 for the wave power plant that moves a dfig whose dynamic is given in equation 21 can be proved using the lyapunov stability theory proof the lyapunov function candidate is defined as 29 v t 1 2 s t s t the time derivative of the previous lyapunov function candidate is 30 v t s t s t s e k e s c 1 w f c 2 i q r w δ k e s c 1 w f k e β sgn s c 1 w w f w δ k e s δ β sgn s 31 δ s β s 32 δ s β s 33 0 it should be indicated that eqns 25 26 and 28 and the condition c 1 have been employed in this proof taking into account that v t is clearly positive definite v t is negative definite and v t tends to infinity as s t tends to infinity the lyapunov s direct method can be used to conclude that the equilibrium at the origin s t 0 is globally asymptotically stable therefore s t tends to zero as the time tends to infinity further the trajectories starting off the sliding surface s 0 must reach the sliding surface in finite time and then will remain on it the behaviour of this system on the sliding surface is habitually called sliding mode utkin 1993 it should be noted that when the system reaches the sliding surface eqn 27 then s t s t 0 and accordingly the tracking problem of this system presents an equivalently dynamic behaviour given by the following equation 34 s t 0 e t k a e t then taking into account that k 0 it is clear that the tracking error e t converges to zero exponentially it should be pointed out that the habitual motion in the sliding mode control consists of two phases first reaching phase when the trajectories starting off the sliding surface s 0 move toward it and reach it in finite time second sliding phase when the system motion is confined to the sliding surface and then the system tracking error is equivalently represented by the reduced order model eqn 34 in this phase the tracking error tends to zero as the time tends to infinity accordingly the turbine speed of this wave power generation plant can be regulated using he proposed sliding mode control in order to obtain the maximum ocean wave power extraction by means of the wells turbine considering that there are unmodelled dynamics and system uncertainties this is because the turbine speed tracks the reference speed value to obtain the optimum flow coefficient in order to maximize the power extraction from the wells turbine 4 experimental results the behaviour for sliding mode controller proposed in this paper is analysed in this section fig 3 shows the block diagram for the experimental platform that we have employed to develop the real time experimental validation and in fig 4 it can be observed a photography for this platform the experimental platform has been designed and constructed using industrial components the main componentes of this experimental platform are the real time controller board of dspace model ds1103 that is based on a floating point powerpc processor to 1 ghz the dfig is an industrial electric machine of 7 5 kw 1447 rpm developed by leroy somer whose parameter are indicated in table 1 the stator of this dfig is connected to the grid and the rotor is also connected to the grid but by means of two voltage source inverters developed by montelec s l model nfs 200 10 that are placed in a back to back configuration the proposed control schemes are programed using a pc with the software matlab7 simulink r2007a and dscontrol 3 2 1 in this experimental platform the mechanical torque profiles produced by the wells turbine are calculated using a wells turbine model implemented in simulink the parameters of the wells turbine employed in the simulink model are presented in table 2 the dynamic of the wells turbine can be obtained using the characteristic curves of the turbine under study jayashankar et al 2000 cui and hyun 2016 accordingly the torque the power and the efficiency produced by the wells turbine can be calculated based on the torque coefficient against the flow coefficient fig 2 the power coefficient against the flow coefficient fig 5 and the efficiency against the flow coefficient fig 6 the mechanical torque profiles are obtained from the simulink model of the wells turbine and then generated in the real platform using a synchronous ac servo motor of 10 6 kw model 190u2 of unimotor the shaft of this ac servo motor is mechanically coupled to the shaft of the dfig in order to move the rotor of the dfig the servo motor incremental encoder of 4096 square impulses per revolution are employed in order to measure the rotor velocity using the frequency measurement method in order to protect the machine against over currents the stator and the rotor currents are limited to their nominal values all the sensors to measure the voltages speed and currents are adequately adapted in order to be connected to the ds1103 real time controller board the ds1103 controller board controls both inverters generating the svpwm space vector pulse width modulation pulses the sample period is defined for the svpwm frequency of 7 khz this is 143 μs the dead time for the inverters used in this study is 1 5 μs and is controlled by software and hardware the connection sequence of the dfig to the grid begins with the charging of rotor and grid converters dc bus once this dc bus is charged and if the grid side reference system is oriented with the grid voltage then the grid side converter is connected through contactor k1 and the regulation of dc bus to a fixed value begins the next two steps have to be taken into account before connecting the stator of the dfig to the grid the first step is the encoder offset detection with respect to the stator flux the second step is the stator voltage synchronization with respect to the grid voltage the synchronization of the dfig stator voltage with the grid voltage is realized by measuring the grid side voltage and using a pll phase locked loop then after the realization of these two steps the stator of the dfig can be connected to the grid using the contactor k2 and then the reactive and active power regulation can begin 4 1 simulations and real platform validation in order to avoid undesirable damages in the experimental platform one simulation model for the experimental platform has been designed and implemented in matlab simulink to test the controllers in advance in this sense the new controllers are tested and tuned in advance using the simulation model and then these controllers are implemented and adjusted in the experimental platform in order to show their real performance in order to show that the real system and the simulation model implemented in matlab simulink are very close the next experimental validation using the matlab simulink and the real experimental platform has been carried out in this experimental validation the dfig speed is maintained constant at 1432 rpm with a reactive power of 0 var it is supposed a scenario where the waves produce a typical variation in the pressure drop given by d p 1800 sin 0 3 t as shown in fig 7 during 25 s the turbine flow coefficient obtained in this experimental validation are shown in fig 8 for the simulation case and in fig 9 for the real platform as it can be observed these figures are very similar so this validates the good performance of the model for the owc system that we have designed and implemented in the matlab simulink software it should be noted that for this pressure drop condition the turbine flow coefficient ϕ exceeds the limit value of 0 30 so the undesirable stalling behaviour will appear in the wells turbine system in this sense fig 10 for the simulation case and fig 11 for the real platform show a significant reduction in the torque coefficient due to the turbine stalling behaviour this reduction in the torque coefficient due to the turbine stalling behaviour induces a strong reduction in the output power obtained in the dfig as it can be observed in fig 12 for the simulation case and in fig 13 for the real platform these figures show the rotor power the stator power and the total power obtained in the dfig that is the sum of the rotor power and the stator power it should be noted that the power value is negative because the electric machine is generating power finally fig 14 shows the efficiency of the wells turbine under the flow coefficient show in fig 9 this efficiency value is obtained using the characteristic curve of the wells turbine efficiency presented in fig 6 in order to avoid the problem of the turbine stalling behaviour caused by the high value of the flow coefficient that exceeds the limit value of 0 30 the rotor speed of the dfig can be regulated in order to maintain the flux coefficient below the limit value of 0 30 as it is shown in the next subsection moreover in order to improve the power generated by the wells turbine the rotor speed can also be regulated in order to follow the reference value provided by eqn 9 that optimizes the flow coefficient value and accordingly improves the torque value and therefore increments the power generated finally it can be observed that the results obtained in the simulation case and in the real platform are very similar showing that the simulation model approximates accurately the real platform therefore these results demonstrates that the simulation model will be very useful in order to adjust in advance the controllers that will be implemented in the real platform 4 2 dfig speed control in this section the speed regulation performance for the turbo generator using the proposed sliding mode field oriented control scheme under model uncertainties is tested in the real platform the case of study considers a scenario where the waves produce a typical variation in the pressure drop given by d p 1800 sin 0 3 t as it is shown in fig 7 in this case the rotor speed of the dfig is controlled in order to follow the speed reference given by equation 9 so as to maintain the flux coefficient at its optimum value ϕ b e p 0 29 in order to maximizes the torque value and below the limit value of ϕ 0 30 in order to avoid the stalling in this test the imposed reactive power in the dfig control is 0 var according to the emulated wells turbine parameters and with the given pressure drop the speed reference for the dfig to get the maximum power is shown in fig 15 this figure also shows the real speed obtained using the proposed sliding controller in the real platform in fig 15 it can be observed that the proposed controller provides a good behaviour because a good speed tracking is obtained under system uncertainties the values for the speed sliding controller are β 40 k 31 these parameters are experimentally tuned taking into account the influence of these parameters in the controller performance the β parameter should be selected bigger than the system uncertainties but it should be noted that when β increases the control effort also increases which is undesirable an increase in parameter k gives an increase in the position error convergence when the system reaches the sliding surface s t 0 but this also increases the control effort which is undesirable in this experimental validation the same pressure drop variation given by d p 1800 sin 0 3 t that was employed in the previous test is used however in this test the proposed sliding mode controller is employed in order to regulate the rotor speed of the dfig the flow coefficient obtained in this case is shown in fig 16 in this figure it can be observed that the flow coefficient is maintained most of the time at its optimum value ϕ b e p 0 29 in order to maximizes the torque value and also below the limit value of 0 30 in order to avoid the turbine stalling behaviour moreover in this case the turbine speed regulation allows to maintain the torque coefficient at its maximum value below the stalling point over a wide range of time as it is shown in fig 17 so in this case the maximum wave power generation is obtained fig 18 shows the efficiency of the wells turbine under the flow coefficient show in fig 16 comparing figs 14 and 18 it is observed that the efficiency of the wells turbine is greatly improved using the proposed sliding mode control for the tracking of the optimum turbine reference speed because in this case the optimum value for the flow coefficient and therefore the optimum value for the torque coefficient is maintained during most of the time fig 19 shows the power generated in the dfig this figure shows the rotor power the stator power and the total power obtained in the dfig in this figure it can be observed that the rotor power is changing the polarity according to the dfig speed when the speed is higher than the synchronous speed the value is negative indicating that energy is obtained from the waves and returned to the grid so in that moment the total power is higher than the stator power on the other hand when the machine performs below the synchronous speed the stator power is higher than the total power because the rotor is getting energy from the grid the obtained total average power is 5000 w with peaks of 8000 w figs 20 and 21 shows the rotor and stator currents respectively as it can be observed in these figures the quality of the current injected into the grid is quite good it should be noted that although there are large variations in the power due to the variations in the pressure drop these variations are dynamically slow compared with the current control dynamic of the dfig therefore despite having great variations in power and speed that produce large variations in the current the quality of the wave in the current injected into the grid is good at all times fig 22 shows the rotor stator and total power for two different reactive power references 0 var and 5 kvar that changes at time t 14 5s as it is shown in fig 23 as it can be observed in the transition between both reactive powers the active power has a fast transition due to the controlled speed so a good behaviour between reactive power variations is obtained using this sliding mode controller it should be noted that when a dfig is controlled active and reactive powers are regulated it is important to show that variations in the active power are independent from the reactive power and vice versa figs 22 and 23 show that despite the variations of the active power p and the reactive power q both are correctly regulated without interfering with each other fig 24 and fig 25 show the speed regulation performance for a pi controller and the proposed sliding mode controller respectively if a sudden change in the pressure drop goes from d p 1800 sin 0 3 t to d p 1520 sin 0 3 t when the dfig speed is at its maximum value the sliding mode controller response shown in fig 25 gives a better behaviour compared with the pi controller response shown in fig 24 because the smc controller presents a better reference tracking obviously the overshoot presented in the pi control case can be reduced but at the cost of a slower response next the ability of the method to control a real power plant is tested using jonswap joint north sea wave project spectra penalba et al 2017 that defines the distribution of wave energy density among different wave frequencies on the north sea this spectra is shown in fig 26 fig 27 shows the mechanical torque produced for the wells turbine under presume drop of fig 26 and the torque in the dfig that is reduced due to the gear ratio between the turbine and the dfig fig 28 shows the reference and the real dfig speed that is obtained using the proposed smc control in order to improve the flow coefficient and also in order to avoid the stalling the flow coefficient for this spectra is presented in fig 29 in this figure it can be observed that the flow coefficient is maintained at the optimum value of ϕ b e p 0 29 a lot of the time and also that the stalling is avoided fig 30 shows the wells turbine efficiency and as it can be observed thanks to the flow coefficient optimization the wells turbine efficiency is improved because the efficiency value is maintained in the maximum point during more time finally fig 31 shows the power generated in the dfig this figure shows the rotor power the stator power the total power and the average power 5 conclusions this paper proposes a smc scheme for wave power generation plants as it is well known the sliding mode control is robust under uncertainties caused by system disturbances and modeling errors the proposed control method maximizes the power extraction for wave power plants using a wells turbine because the controller regulates the wells turbine velocity in order to operate in the maximum power efficiency in this sense the control of the turbine velocity provides an optimum flow coefficient value for the wells turbine that produces an optimum torque coefficient and accordingly the maximum wave energy extraction is obtained on the other hand this speed regulation is also used to avoid the stalling behaviour in the wells turbine dynamics because the flow coefficient can be maintained below the critical value in this work the lyapunov stability theory is employed in order to demonstrate the closed loop stability of the proposed design then this control scheme has been successfully validated by means of some simulation examples the simulation results show that the proposed smc strategy presents a good regulation of the turbine speed and thanks to this control scheme the optimum value for the flow coefficient is achieved as a result of this optimum value for the flow coefficient the wells turbine can extract the maximum mechanical power from the waves and therefore the maximum electrical power can be also generated finally some real tests in a new control platform that has been designed and constructed have been carried out these tests have been shown that the proposed control scheme presents a good performance in the real system because a good tracking for the reference velocity is obtained under system uncertainties

23241,due to the nonlinear dynamics and uncertainties usually present in wave energy conversion systems the efficiency of these devices can be enhanced employing a robust control algorithms wave energy converters are constructed using electric generators of variable velocity like double feed induction generator dfig since they may improve the system efficiency to generate power when compared to fixed speed generators the main reason is that this generators with variable speed may adapt the speed of the turbine in order to maintain the optimal flow coefficient values which improves the efficiency of the wells turbine however a suitable speed controller is required in these systems first in order to avoid the stalling phenomenon and second in order to track the optimal turbine reference velocity that optimizes the power generation in this paper a real time sliding mode control scheme for wave energy conversion systems that incorporate a wells turbine and a dfig is proposed the lyapunov stability theory is used to analyse the stability of this control scheme under parameter uncertainties and system disturbances next the proposed control scheme is validated first by means of some simulation examples using the matlab simulink software and second using a real time experimental platform based on a dspace ds1103 control board keywords wave power wave energy converters sliding mode control real time control dfig doubly fed induction generator 1 introduction renewable energy sources i e wind and solar energy have acquired an increasing interest in the last decade due to the harmful contamination effects caused by the traditional sources of energy recently the international community has also paid special attention to wave energy which could supply a considerable part of the electricity demand of some countries lopez et al 2015 reguero et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 torres et al 2016 when the wind blows on the surface of the ocean it causes the waves in some locations the wind blows consistently and with sufficient force to produce continuous waves along the shoreline since ocean waves contain tremendous energy potential different wave power devices have been designed to extract their energy typically these devices benefit from the surface motion of ocean waves or from pressure fluctuations below the surface ning et al 2016 son and yeung 2017 tom et al 2017 in this study an oscillating water columns owc device mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 rezanejad et al 2017 is employed in order to extract the energy of the ocean waves into mechanical energy using a wells turbine falcão and henriques 2016 halder et al 2016 shehata et al 2017 the mechanical energy harvested in owc s is determined by wave height wave speed wavelength and water density carballo and iglesias 2012 lópez et al 2016 however the energy produced in these systems can be improved by means of the turbine rotational speed control because the turbine speed affects the hydrodynamic process of wave energy absorption henriques et al 2016a 2016b falcão et al 2017 the mechanism of the wave energy conversion systems follows an oscillating movement so the rotor velocity of the coupled electric generator is variable these systems should incorporate an ac ac converter in order to generate an electric power of constant voltage and frequency tsang and chan 2015 however in this configuration the converter should manage all the generated power and this fact present some lacks like the cost of the converters and the power lost in the conversion on the other hand the generation system could incorporate the doubly fed induction generator dfig that is currently used by other power generation plants for example the wind turbine systems because it allows a variable turbine speed operation kahla et al 2015 hamzaoui et al 2016 the stator of the dfig is directly connected to the grid and the rotor of the dfig is connected to the grid using a variable frequency converter vfc the advantage of this configuration is that in order to get the total control of the generator the vfc only have to manage a fraction of the nominal power around 25 30 the vfc incorporates one voltage source located on the side of the grid called grid side converter gsc and another voltage source located on the side of the rotor called rotor side converter rsc these voltage source converters are connected back to back through a capacitor pena et al 1996 song et al 2010 barambones 2012 this kind of systems are habitually controlled using a vector control scheme and cascaded pi current and power loops taveiros et al 2015 however the nonlinear dynamics and the uncertainties presented in these systems suggest the use of a more robust controller in order to improve the system performance in this sense one option is to consider the sliding mode control smc because this kind of controller presents a good performance against unmodeled dynamics insensitivity to parameter variations and an excellent rejection to the external disturbances utkin 1993 moreover the smc has been used in order to control several types of induction machines in the last decade and good results has been obtained barambones and alkorta 2014 soufi et al 2016 farhat et al 2017 this work presents a real time smc scheme in order to improve the power generation of a dfig implemented in a owc wave power plants the proposed control scheme regulates the turbine speed in order to track the desired speed that maximize the power extraction from the wells turbine because it optimizes the wells turbine efficiency this optimization of the wells turbine efficiency is obtained selecting the flow coefficient value that maximizes the power generation moreover this optimization of the wells turbine efficiency that maximizes the power generation also avoids the stalling phenomenon because the proposed control scheme maintains the flow coefficient at the best efficiency point bep below the stalling point there are several works in the literature that regulates the turbine speed in order to avoid the stalling behaviour alberdi et al 2009 garrido et al 2012 2013 however in these works the turbine speed is not regulated in order to follow a reference speed that follows the variation of the airflow speed in order to obtain the best flow coefficient that maintains the system in the bep despite variations of the airflow speed the turbine speed is controlled by means of the rotor current of the dfig using the sliding mode control theory regulating the turbine velocity the proposed control scheme optimizes the flow coefficients in order to obtain the maximum power extraction in the wave power generation plant under system uncertainties and wave power variations in order to confirm that the designed controller meets the proposed goals first this controller for a dfig used in a wave power generation plant is validated using the matlab simulink software in these simulations several operating conditions are tested and satisfactory results are obtained next the real performance of the proposed control scheme is also validated over a real experimental platform based in a dfig the main componentes of this control platform are the dspace ds1103 controller board the commercial induction machine leroy somer of 7 5 kw and the synchronous ac servo motor 190u2 unimotor of 10 6 kw the stator of the dfig is directly connected to the grid and the rotor of the dfig is also connected to the grid through the vfc the shaft of the dfig and the shaft of the synchronous ac servo motor are mechanically connected so the ac servo motor emulates the torque profiles that the wells turbine generates as response to the oscillations of the free surface in the owc chamber in this experimental platform several real tests employing different operating conditions are carried out and the obtained results are satisfying this paper is organized as follows in section 2 is presented a theoretical modeling of the owc wave power plant that incorporates a wells turbine in section 3 the design of the proposed sliding mode controller that optimizes the power generation and avoids the stalling phenomenon is presented section 4 presents the simulation and the experimental results developed in the experimental platform that is also described in this section finally some concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 modeling of the owc plant the hydrodynamic energy of the waves can be transformed to an oscillating air flow using the owc device shown in fig 1 the owc system is composed of a fixed or floating hollow structure open to the sea below the water surface that traps air above the inner free surface wave action alternately compresses and decompresses the trapped air which is forced to flow through a turbine that generates the rotational energy henriques et al 2016b this turbine is connected to a generator by means of a gear box in order to produce the electrical energy jayashankar et al 2000 it should be noted that the airflow in the chamber is bidirectional depending if the wave is hitting or it is reflected in this sense to produce a continuous unidirectional rotation of the electrical generator the wells turbine can be used in order to generate the rotational energy the wells turbine is a low pressure air turbine that independent of the direction of the air flow rotates continuously in one direction prof alan arthur wells of queen s university belfast designed this turbine in the late 1970s the power from the owc available to a turbine is 1 p i n δ p v x a where v x m s is the airflow speed δ p pa is the pressure drop across the turbine ρ kg m3 is the air density and a m2 is the area of the section of the turbine in the owc system considered in this work the turbogenerator module is composed by a wells turbine mechanically connected to an air cooled dfig by means of a gearbox in order to increase the rotational speed and accordingly to reduce the mechanical torque the rotor circuit of the dfig is connected to the grid through a vfc and the active power flow between the rotor circuit and the grid must be controlled both in magnitude and in direction in order to produce electrical active power to the utility grid at constant frequency and voltage moreover in this machine the rotor speed value can operate in an extended range from subsynchronous speed to supersynchronous rotational speed the vfc is composed of two four quadrant igbt pwm converters usually called grid side converter on the side of the grid and rotor side converter on the side of the rotor these converters are back to back connected by means of a dc link capacitor it should be noted that in this configuration the power electronic converters only need to handle a small portion of the nominal power around 25 30 in order to produce the electrical power in the grid because only the rotor power goes to the grid through the vfc the stator power goes directly to the grid therefore the power converters used in this configuration are smaller that the power converters used in other configurations therefore the power losses and the power electronic converters cost are also smaller which is the main advantage of this configuration in the owc systems the turbogenerator may include an inertia wheel drive in order to smooth the output power curve this inertia wheel makes the system particularly appropriate for the implementation of sliding mode control schemes because the undesired chattering that could appear in this kind of controllers will be mechanically absorbed by the inertia of the system as it has been indicated previously a wells turbine have been considered in this work in order to extract the mechanical energy from the airflow the wells turbine presents a robust and simple symmetrical blade design and therefore the wells turbine always turns in the same direction regardless of the direction in which the airflow passes through the turbine the equations used for the modeling of the turbine are given by jayashankar et al 2000 2 δ p c a k 1 a v x 2 r w 2 3 t t c t k r v x 2 r w 2 4 t t c t r a c a d p 5 k ρ b n l 2 6 ϕ v x r w 7 q v x a 8 η t t w q δ p c t c a ϕ where c a is the power coefficient c t is the torque coefficient the generated torque is t t n m ϕ is the flow coefficient k kg m is a turbine constant r m is the turbine radius w rad s is the turbine angular velocity the blade span is b m the blade number is n the blade chord is l m the rate of the flow is q m3 s a m2 is the area of the section of the turbine and the efficiency of the turbine is η the previous equations show that the torque and the power generated by the wells turbine can be calculated based on the torque coefficient and the power coefficient respectively moreover the characteristic curves of the wells turbine are composed by the relationship between the torque coefficient and the power coefficient versus the flow coefficient due to the characteristic dynamics of the wells turbine when the velocity of the airflow surpasses one critical value that is related to the wells turbine rotational velocity the performance of this turbine fall down drastically jayashankar et al 2000 this effect is usually called stalling phenomenon the wells turbine stalls when the relative angle between the tangential speed of the turbine and the axial velocity of the input airflow is greater than a value around 14 in fig 2 can be observed the torque coefficient versus the flow coefficient ϕ v x r w for the wells turbine used in this work this figure shows that the torque coefficient c t of the wells turbine fall down drastically when the stalling phenomenon appears this figure shows the characteristic curve for one particular wells turbine and it depends on the parameters used in the turbine design however the characteristic curves for other wells turbines present the same behaviour fig 2 shows that in the wells turbine employed in the present paper the stalling phenomenon appears when the flow coefficient reaches the value 0 3 this value may be different depending of the wells turbine characteristic curve therefore from this figure it can be also concluded that for this wells turbine a good flux coefficient value is ϕ b e p 0 29 because with this flux coefficient value the stalling behaviour is avoided and the value of the torque coefficient c t presents a local maximum it should be noted that taking into account the oscillatory dynamics of the flow coefficient due to the oscillatory movement of the air flow produced by the ocean waves the flow coefficient value is always oscillating from zero to one positive value so the optimum working zone for the flow coefficient is located between zero and the point of the stalling behaviour additionally from eqn 6 it is deduced that the flux coefficient could be maintained more time at its optimum value by means of the turbine velocity regulation because when the airflow velocity increases decreases we can increase decrease the turbine velocity in order to maintain the flux coefficient constant in the value ϕ b e p 0 29 this turbine speed regulation on the one hand improves the torque coefficient and therefore improves the power generation and on the other hand avoids the stalling behaviour therefore maximum power extraction from the ocean waves is obtained employing the next command value for the turbine velocity 9 w v x r ϕ b e p 3 the design of the sliding mode controller in the owc generation system that incorporates a dfig the objective of the maximum power extraction is achieved by regulating the rotational speed of the wells turbine in order to avoid the stalling behaviour in order to get this objective a smc scheme is proposed in order to regulate the rotor speed of the dfig the speed of the dfig is regulated by means of the quadrature component of the rotor current in the model description it is explained that the shaft speed of the owc turbogenerator should be adjusted so that the flow coefficient ϕ remains bounded in order to extract the maximum power from the sea in this case the maximum stalling free torque coefficient c t can be obtained it should be noted that there is a unique generator speed reference value to satisfy the condition of optimum flow coefficient value to get the maximum wave energy extraction for a given pressure drop input d p this value can be calculated based on the characteristic curve of the wells turbine under consideration provided by the manufacturer however considering that all wells turbines present a similar stalling behaviour this operation may always be extended to other wells turbines in this sense the control objective is similar to that used in other well established dfig applications like wind turbines in which the maximum power point tracking control strategies are defined in these systems a tracking reference for the turbine speed should be followed by the control system in this case the reference depends on the maximum power variation with the rotational speed of the dfig this reference is also different for each wind turbine depending of its aerodynamic design that provides different power coefficient versus tip speed ratio characteristic curve nagai et al 2009 the design of the smc uses the knowledge of the turbogenerator dynamics so the turbogenerator dynamics should be calculated the turbogenerator dynamics incorporate one mechanical part and other electrical part the next equation represents the mechanical part for the dynamic of the turbogenerator 10 j w b w t t γ t e where t t is the torque generated in the turbine by the air flow produced by the waves b is the viscous friction coefficient t e is the generator torque j is the inertia moment w is the angular velocity of the turbine shaft and the gear ratio γ w e w is the relation between the angular velocity of the turbine shaft w and the angular velocity of the generator rotor w e as it is well known the field oriented control referring all expressions to the stator flux reference frame can be used in order to simplify the electrical equations of the dfig in the reference frame oriented in the stator flux the d axis is aligned with the stator flux linkage vector ψ s and then ψ d s ψ s and ψ q s 0 then the next relationships are obtained barambones 2013 11 i q s l m i q r l s 12 i d s l m i m s i d r l s 13 i m s v q s r s i q s w s l m 14 t e 3 p 4 l m 2 i m s i q r l s 15 q s 3 2 w s l m 2 i m s i m s i d

the pole numbers and σ 1 l m 2 l s l r it should be noted that the stator magnetizing current i m s can be considered constant because the influence of the stator resistance is small and the stator is connected to the grid pena et al 1996 accordingly the electromagnetic torque can be calculated as follows 19 t e k t i q r where the torque constant value k t is calculated below 20 k t 3 p 4 l m 2 i m s l s substituting equation 19 in equation 10 the next dynamic equation may be obtained where the uncertainty terms has also been included 21 w c 1 c 1 w f f c 2 c 2 i q s where c 1 b j c 2 γ k t j f t t j and the terms c 1 c 2 and f represent the uncertainties of the terms c 1 c 2 and f respectively then the dynamic equation 21 can be rewritten as 22 w c 1 w f c 2 i q s δ t where the uncertainty terms have been collected in the term δ 23 δ t c 1 w t f t c 2 i q r t now in order to compensate for the above described uncertainties a sliding mode control scheme is proposed the speed tracking error is defined as follows 24 e t w t w t where w is the command for the turbine speed in order to extract the maximum power from the waves the previous equation can be derived with respect to time 25 e t w w c 1 w t f t c 2 i q r t w t δ t next a smc scheme is proposed in order to track the turbine speed command that provides the maximum wave power extraction despite of the system uncertainties the sliding variable s t is defined as 26 s t e t 0 t k e τ d τ where k is a positive constant gain next the proposed sliding surface is 27 s t e t 0 t k e τ d τ 0 finally the speed controller based on the sliding mode is obtained 28 i q r t 1 c 2 k e β sgn s c 1 w w f where β is the switching gain and sgn is the sign function in order to achieve the tracking of the reference velocity the next condition should be fulfilled c 1 the sliding gain β of the controller must be selected greater than the system uncertainties that is β δ t for all time the closed loop stability of the proposed control scheme based on the control law presented in equation 28 for the wave power plant that moves a dfig whose dynamic is given in equation 21 can be proved using the lyapunov stability theory proof the lyapunov function candidate is defined as 29 v t 1 2 s t s t the time derivative of the previous lyapunov function candidate is 30 v t s t s t s e k e s c 1 w f c 2 i q r w δ k e s c 1 w f k e β sgn s c 1 w w f w δ k e s δ β sgn s 31 δ s β s 32 δ s β s 33 0 it should be indicated that eqns 25 26 and 28 and the condition c 1 have been employed in this proof taking into account that v t is clearly positive definite v t is negative definite and v t tends to infinity as s t tends to infinity the lyapunov s direct method can be used to conclude that the equilibrium at the origin s t 0 is globally asymptotically stable therefore s t tends to zero as the time tends to infinity further the trajectories starting off the sliding surface s 0 must reach the sliding surface in finite time and then will remain on it the behaviour of this system on the sliding surface is habitually called sliding mode utkin 1993 it should be noted that when the system reaches the sliding surface eqn 27 then s t s t 0 and accordingly the tracking problem of this system presents an equivalently dynamic behaviour given by the following equation 34 s t 0 e t k a e t then taking into account that k 0 it is clear that the tracking error e t converges to zero exponentially it should be pointed out that the habitual motion in the sliding mode control consists of two phases first reaching phase when the trajectories starting off the sliding surface s 0 move toward it and reach it in finite time second sliding phase when the system motion is confined to the sliding surface and then the system tracking error is equivalently represented by the reduced order model eqn 34 in this phase the tracking error tends to zero as the time tends to infinity accordingly the turbine speed of this wave power generation plant can be regulated using he proposed sliding mode control in order to obtain the maximum ocean wave power extraction by means of the wells turbine considering that there are unmodelled dynamics and system uncertainties this is because the turbine speed tracks the reference speed value to obtain the optimum flow coefficient in order to maximize the power extraction from the wells turbine 4 experimental results the behaviour for sliding mode controller proposed in this paper is analysed in this section fig 3 shows the block diagram for the experimental platform that we have employed to develop the real time experimental validation and in fig 4 it can be observed a photography for this platform the experimental platform has been designed and constructed using industrial components the main componentes of this experimental platform are the real time controller board of dspace model ds1103 that is based on a floating point powerpc processor to 1 ghz the dfig is an industrial electric machine of 7 5 kw 1447 rpm developed by leroy somer whose parameter are indicated in table 1 the stator of this dfig is connected to the grid and the rotor is also connected to the grid but by means of two voltage source inverters developed by montelec s l model nfs 200 10 that are placed in a back to back configuration the proposed control schemes are programed using a pc with the software matlab7 simulink r2007a and dscontrol 3 2 1 in this experimental platform the mechanical torque profiles produced by the wells turbine are calculated using a wells turbine model implemented in simulink the parameters of the wells turbine employed in the simulink model are presented in table 2 the dynamic of the wells turbine can be obtained using the characteristic curves of the turbine under study jayashankar et al 2000 cui and hyun 2016 accordingly the torque the power and the efficiency produced by the wells turbine can be calculated based on the torque coefficient against the flow coefficient fig 2 the power coefficient against the flow coefficient fig 5 and the efficiency against the flow coefficient fig 6 the mechanical torque profiles are obtained from the simulink model of the wells turbine and then generated in the real platform using a synchronous ac servo motor of 10 6 kw model 190u2 of unimotor the shaft of this ac servo motor is mechanically coupled to the shaft of the dfig in order to move the rotor of the dfig the servo motor incremental encoder of 4096 square impulses per revolution are employed in order to measure the rotor velocity using the frequency measurement method in order to protect the machine against over currents the stator and the rotor currents are limited to their nominal values all the sensors to measure the voltages speed and currents are adequately adapted in order to be connected to the ds1103 real time controller board the ds1103 controller board controls both inverters generating the svpwm space vector pulse width modulation pulses the sample period is defined for the svpwm frequency of 7 khz this is 143 μs the dead time for the inverters used in this study is 1 5 μs and is controlled by software and hardware the connection sequence of the dfig to the grid begins with the charging of rotor and grid converters dc bus once this dc bus is charged and if the grid side reference system is oriented with the grid voltage then the grid side converter is connected through contactor k1 and the regulation of dc bus to a fixed value begins the next two steps have to be taken into account before connecting the stator of the dfig to the grid the first step is the encoder offset detection with respect to the stator flux the second step is the stator voltage synchronization with respect to the grid voltage the synchronization of the dfig stator voltage with the grid voltage is realized by measuring the grid side voltage and using a pll phase locked loop then after the realization of these two steps the stator of the dfig can be connected to the grid using the contactor k2 and then the reactive and active power regulation can begin 4 1 simulations and real platform validation in order to avoid undesirable damages in the experimental platform one simulation model for the experimental platform has been designed and implemented in matlab simulink to test the controllers in advance in this sense the new controllers are tested and tuned in advance using the simulation model and then these controllers are implemented and adjusted in the experimental platform in order to show their real performance in order to show that the real system and the simulation model implemented in matlab simulink are very close the next experimental validation using the matlab simulink and the real experimental platform has been carried out in this experimental validation the dfig speed is maintained constant at 1432 rpm with a reactive power of 0 var it is supposed a scenario where the waves produce a typical variation in the pressure drop given by d p 1800 sin 0 3 t as shown in fig 7 during 25 s the turbine flow coefficient obtained in this experimental validation are shown in fig 8 for the simulation case and in fig 9 for the real platform as it can be observed these figures are very similar so this validates the good performance of the model for the owc system that we have designed and implemented in the matlab simulink software it should be noted that for this pressure drop condition the turbine flow coefficient ϕ exceeds the limit value of 0 30 so the undesirable stalling behaviour will appear in the wells turbine system in this sense fig 10 for the simulation case and fig 11 for the real platform show a significant reduction in the torque coefficient due to the turbine stalling behaviour this reduction in the torque coefficient due to the turbine stalling behaviour induces a strong reduction in the output power obtained in the dfig as it can be observed in fig 12 for the simulation case and in fig 13 for the real platform these figures show the rotor power the stator power and the total power obtained in the dfig that is the sum of the rotor power and the stator power it should be noted that the power value is negative because the electric machine is generating power finally fig 14 shows the efficiency of the wells turbine under the flow coefficient show in fig 9 this efficiency value is obtained using the characteristic curve of the wells turbine efficiency presented in fig 6 in order to avoid the problem of the turbine stalling behaviour caused by the high value of the flow coefficient that exceeds the limit value of 0 30 the rotor speed of the dfig can be regulated in order to maintain the flux coefficient below the limit value of 0 30 as it is shown in the next subsection moreover in order to improve the power generated by the wells turbine the rotor speed can also be regulated in order to follow the reference value provided by eqn 9 that optimizes the flow coefficient value and accordingly improves the torque value and therefore increments the power generated finally it can be observed that the results obtained in the simulation case and in the real platform are very similar showing that the simulation model approximates accurately the real platform therefore these results demonstrates that the simulation model will be very useful in order to adjust in advance the controllers that will be implemented in the real platform 4 2 dfig speed control in this section the speed regulation performance for the turbo generator using the proposed sliding mode field oriented control scheme under model uncertainties is tested in the real platform the case of study considers a scenario where the waves produce a typical variation in the pressure drop given by d p 1800 sin 0 3 t as it is shown in fig 7 in this case the rotor speed of the dfig is controlled in order to follow the speed reference given by equation 9 so as to maintain the flux coefficient at its optimum value ϕ b e p 0 29 in order to maximizes the torque value and below the limit value of ϕ 0 30 in order to avoid the stalling in this test the imposed reactive power in the dfig control is 0 var according to the emulated wells turbine parameters and with the given pressure drop the speed reference for the dfig to get the maximum power is shown in fig 15 this figure also shows the real speed obtained using the proposed sliding controller in the real platform in fig 15 it can be observed that the proposed controller provides a good behaviour because a good speed tracking is obtained under system uncertainties the values for the speed sliding controller are β 40 k 31 these parameters are experimentally tuned taking into account the influence of these parameters in the controller performance the β parameter should be selected bigger than the system uncertainties but it should be noted that when β increases the control effort also increases which is undesirable an increase in parameter k gives an increase in the position error convergence when the system reaches the sliding surface s t 0 but this also increases the control effort which is undesirable in this experimental validation the same pressure drop variation given by d p 1800 sin 0 3 t that was employed in the previous test is used however in this test the proposed sliding mode controller is employed in order to regulate the rotor speed of the dfig the flow coefficient obtained in this case is shown in fig 16 in this figure it can be observed that the flow coefficient is maintained most of the time at its optimum value ϕ b e p 0 29 in order to maximizes the torque value and also below the limit value of 0 30 in order to avoid the turbine stalling behaviour moreover in this case the turbine speed regulation allows to maintain the torque coefficient at its maximum value below the stalling point over a wide range of time as it is shown in fig 17 so in this case the maximum wave power generation is obtained fig 18 shows the efficiency of the wells turbine under the flow coefficient show in fig 16 comparing figs 14 and 18 it is observed that the efficiency of the wells turbine is greatly improved using the proposed sliding mode control for the tracking of the optimum turbine reference speed because in this case the optimum value for the flow coefficient and therefore the optimum value for the torque coefficient is maintained during most of the time fig 19 shows the power generated in the dfig this figure shows the rotor power the stator power and the total power obtained in the dfig in this figure it can be observed that the rotor power is changing the polarity according to the dfig speed when the speed is higher than the synchronous speed the value is negative indicating that energy is obtained from the waves and returned to the grid so in that moment the total power is higher than the stator power on the other hand when the machine performs below the synchronous speed the stator power is higher than the total power because the rotor is getting energy from the grid the obtained total average power is 5000 w with peaks of 8000 w figs 20 and 21 shows the rotor and stator currents respectively as it can be observed in these figures the quality of the current injected into the grid is quite good it should be noted that although there are large variations in the power due to the variations in the pressure drop these variations are dynamically slow compared with the current control dynamic of the dfig therefore despite having great variations in power and speed that produce large variations in the current the quality of the wave in the current injected into the grid is good at all times fig 22 shows the rotor stator and total power for two different reactive power references 0 var and 5 kvar that changes at time t 14 5s as it is shown in fig 23 as it can be observed in the transition between both reactive powers the active power has a fast transition due to the controlled speed so a good behaviour between reactive power variations is obtained using this sliding mode controller it should be noted that when a dfig is controlled active and reactive powers are regulated it is important to show that variations in the active power are independent from the reactive power and vice versa figs 22 and 23 show that despite the variations of the active power p and the reactive power q both are correctly regulated without interfering with each other fig 24 and fig 25 show the speed regulation performance for a pi controller and the proposed sliding mode controller respectively if a sudden change in the pressure drop goes from d p 1800 sin 0 3 t to d p 1520 sin 0 3 t when the dfig speed is at its maximum value the sliding mode controller response shown in fig 25 gives a better behaviour compared with the pi controller response shown in fig 24 because the smc controller presents a better reference tracking obviously the overshoot presented in the pi control case can be reduced but at the cost of a slower response next the ability of the method to control a real power plant is tested using jonswap joint north sea wave project spectra penalba et al 2017 that defines the distribution of wave energy density among different wave frequencies on the north sea this spectra is shown in fig 26 fig 27 shows the mechanical torque produced for the wells turbine under presume drop of fig 26 and the torque in the dfig that is reduced due to the gear ratio between the turbine and the dfig fig 28 shows the reference and the real dfig speed that is obtained using the proposed smc control in order to improve the flow coefficient and also in order to avoid the stalling the flow coefficient for this spectra is presented in fig 29 in this figure it can be observed that the flow coefficient is maintained at the optimum value of ϕ b e p 0 29 a lot of the time and also that the stalling is avoided fig 30 shows the wells turbine efficiency and as it can be observed thanks to the flow coefficient optimization the wells turbine efficiency is improved because the efficiency value is maintained in the maximum point during more time finally fig 31 shows the power generated in the dfig this figure shows the rotor power the stator power the total power and the average power 5 conclusions this paper proposes a smc scheme for wave power generation plants as it is well known the sliding mode control is robust under uncertainties caused by system disturbances and modeling errors the proposed control method maximizes the power extraction for wave power plants using a wells turbine because the controller regulates the wells turbine velocity in order to operate in the maximum power efficiency in this sense the control of the turbine velocity provides an optimum flow coefficient value for the wells turbine that produces an optimum torque coefficient and accordingly the maximum wave energy extraction is obtained on the other hand this speed regulation is also used to avoid the stalling behaviour in the wells turbine dynamics because the flow coefficient can be maintained below the critical value in this work the lyapunov stability theory is employed in order to demonstrate the closed loop stability of the proposed design then this control scheme has been successfully validated by means of some simulation examples the simulation results show that the proposed smc strategy presents a good regulation of the turbine speed and thanks to this control scheme the optimum value for the flow coefficient is achieved as a result of this optimum value for the flow coefficient the wells turbine can extract the maximum mechanical power from the waves and therefore the maximum electrical power can be also generated finally some real tests in a new control platform that has been designed and constructed have been carried out these tests have been shown that the proposed control scheme presents a good performance in the real system because a good tracking for the reference velocity is obtained under system uncertainties

23242,this paper aims to solve the problem of how to quantify the impact of mitigation strategies on carbon emissions from port operations and shipping inside container terminals without real energy consumption data in order to cope with complex stochastic processes in container terminals the problem is carried out by establishing a carbon emission quantification simulation model firstly the carbon emission formulation and mitigation strategies are introduced then a container terminal operation simulation model is constructed considering four kinds of mitigation strategies as inputs reduced speed in waterway channels reduced auxiliary time at berth on shore power supply and alternative fuels and increased working efficiency of port equipment finally based on a real container terminal this paper carried out a variety of simulation experiments and discovered that 1 reduced speed from 24 to 8 knots can achieve a 48 4 reduction of carbon emissions from ships in waterway channels and 32 9 from the whole container terminal 2 compared with diesel in waterway channels and at berth the use of lng can reduce carbon emissions by about 11 for the emissions from ships and 8 for the total emissions keywords green port container terminal green approach low carbon port carbon emissions simulation 1 introduction climate change and environmental pollution are one of the most pressing issues that need to be faced and resolved green port referring to the one characterized by healthy ecological environment reasonable utilization of resources low energy consumption and pollution is officially proposed in 2009 wan et al 2017 reducing carbon emissions and efficient use of port equipment in container terminals are vital to achieving the climate and environmental goal of green port construction peng et al 2016 emission mitigation strategies have been implemented in many container terminals such as the port of long beach sydney ports and tokyo harbor etc for example a shore power supply system was equipped in venetial harbor leading to about 30 reduction of carbon emissions cai 2010 operation methods such as reduced speed in waterway channels and reduced lay time at berth anchor etc were analyzed in the port of gothenburg on the promise that ghg emissions would be 10 lower than the business as usual level to 2030 winnes et al 2015 with a change from marine fuel to lng the carbon emission is reduced by 25 bengtsson et al 2011 however since the reduction of carbon emissions were calculated based on real operation data it is hard to estimate how the green port approach influence emissions green port construction is a long comprehensive systematic and complex task and is a matter concerning the overall situation and long term strategic perspective baily and solomon 2004 therefore considerable attention is generated on how to quantify the impact of mitigation strategies on the carbon emissions from port operations and shipping inside container terminals without real energy consumption data which is the problem we aim to solve in this paper efforts to reduce the environmental impact from ports mainly focus on visiting ships inside the ports since almost half of emissions were attributed to ship movement villalba and gemechu 2011 the existing literature provides different approaches to reduce carbon emissions from port vessels as summarized by the technologies and measures presented by bouman et al 2017 most of works related to the mitigation strategies focus on on shore power supply ops alternative fuels reduced speed in waterway channels and reduced turnaround time at berth ops also known as shore side electricity technology or cold ironing replaces the auxiliary diesel engines ae with electricity power supplied from shore when a ship connects to ops at berth the air quality and noise in port cities can be improved and reduced styhre et al 2017 results showed that the total potential external health cost benefit of 60 of ships applying ops while 40 use ae generated power would amount to approx 2 8 million annually a figure that excludes the benefit of reduced co2 emissions ballini and bozzo 2015 alternative fuels cover all aspects related to replacing marine fuel oils with alternative energy such as lng biofuels and methanol nox and so2 emissions are reduced significantly when a shift from marine fuel to lng happens and the co2 emissions are reduced by 25 however the total emissions of co2 equivalents may not necessarily be decreased due to the leakage bengtsson et al 2011 adopting biofuels can cut down co2 emissions highest from the perspective of life cycle but considering the systemic effects such as land use change it will produce more co2 emissions bouman et al 2017 methanol is another alternative fuel which is just introduced to the market from a life cycle perspective adopting methanol is almost similar to that of usual marine fuels for the reducing global warming brynolf et al 2014 reduced speed in waterway channels relates to the operational speed of vessels in sailing period as well as its design speed a minor speed reduction can have a large impact on fuel consumption due to the cubic function between the speed and energy consumption generally reduced speed is expected as the highest potential in carbon emission reduction buhaug et al 2009 du et al 2011 and wang et al 2013 proposed optimization approaches to minimize fuel consumption by adjusting vessel speed in waterway then du et al 2011 calculated the emissions from ships when travelling in waterway based on the widely used emission factors later an activity based model is used to calculate fuel consumption and emissions of ships entering kaohsiung port and results show that co2 emissions can be reduced by about 40 after decreasing the speed to 12 knots chang and jhang 2016 reduced turnaround time at berth is another means of reducing emissions reducing lay time at berth and still carrying out the same amount of transport work only few studies focus on this issue for instance winnes et al 2015 analyzed and forecast ship emissions in the port of gothenburg for 2030 showing that the emissions at berth are most efficiently decreased with the reduction of ships berthing time johnson and styhre 2015 concluded that fuel consumption would be saved by 2 8 by reducing unproductive waiting times and the impact is calculated based on quantitative operational data from voyage reports etc the literature mentioned above shows that on shore power supply reduced speed in waterway channels and reduced berthing time can help reduce co2 equivalents while it s hard to say for the alternative fuels due to the leakage from the engine and incomplete burning etc only few studies calculate the reduction in co2 emissions caused by green approaches nonetheless since the reduction of carbon emissions is calculated based on real operation data of many years it is hard to estimate how the green port approach influence emissions with the change of parameters among mitigation strategies without real data the emissions from port equipment have been regarded as a problem recently and corresponding research has been studied at present the mitigation strategies for port equipment can be summarized in two aspects equipment retrofit and working efficiency improvement the studies on approaches of reducing carbon emissions through equipment retrofit are mainly focused on utilization of automatic guided vehicles agvs and energy replacement of diesel to electricity for yard cranes comparing the energy savings and co2 reduction of rubber tired gantries rtgs and electric rubber tired gantries ertgs it showed that ertgs could save about 87 of energy and reduce co2 emissions by 68 yang and chang 2013 besides geerlings and duin 2010 indicated that the replacement of diesel cargo stevedoring equipment with electric equipment can reduce co2 emissions by 20 xiao and lu 2012 proposed and analyzed a formula for calculating the energy consumption of quay cranes in container terminals based on a long term real data and developed an energy saving device used in cranes on the other hand the studies on reducing carbon emissions through improving working efficiency of equipment are mainly focused on scheduling optimization scheduling of handling equipment in container terminal has been studied i e quay cranes internal trucks and yard cranes the results showed that the optimal tradeoff between time saving and energy saving can be achieved by reasonable scheduling of handling equipment numerous approaches have been proposed to reduce carbon emissions in coastal areas and ports davarzani et al 2015 but significant reduction in carbon emissions can be reached only by the replacement with renewable fuels styhre et al 2017 renewable energy plays an increasingly greater role within ports as the ports are usually situated in the place that are particularly suitable for generating power from winds rotterdam kitakyushu tide differentials dover the port of digby waves port kembla mutriku and in some cases geothermal energy hamburg furthermore the ports often have available wide flat surfaces such as storage areas and warehouses that can be used for installation of solar panels e g the tokyo ohi terminal or in the port of san diego administration buildings although such infrastructure might not always be suitable for large scale solar energy exploitation the port authority of genoa has developed a port energy environmental plan to improve the use of renewable energy and boost the efficiency of energy in port areas allowing to one save around 197 000t of co2 by 2020 based on an estimation of co2 reduction for the year 2011 acciaro et al 2014 the largest terminal operator hamburger hafen und logistik ag operates a fleet of electric cars and uses heat generated by burning biogas produced in the neighboring sewage handling plant in köhlbr and höft which accounts for a reduction of 1000t of co2 per year the company aims to decrease the emission by 30 before the year of 2030 compared with that in 2008 and by 2012 had already achieved a reduction of 24 pietsch 2013 besides studies have been focused on green port policies related to mitigation strategies which are currently adopted in advanced ports worldwide such as using on shore power transitioning to alternative fuels replacement of older diesel equipment and switching to renewable energy for example hong kong port has introduced the fair winds charter program for the use of low sulfur oil in ships since 2011 and has implemented ertg replacement project reducing 70 fuel cost and 80 maintenance cost kim and kim 2014 the port of long beach clean trucks program implemented a progressive ban on older heavy polluting diesel drayage trucks when the program was fully implemented in 2012 emissions from trucks were cut down by over 90 percentages another challenge in quantifying the impact of mitigation strategies on carbon emissions is how to estimate the emissions emitted inside the container terminal based on an activity based methodology meyer et al 2008 estimated the atmospheric emissions from four belgian seaports which accounted a total of 1880 kton of co2 from the port for the period 2003 2004 besides jiang et al 2012 calculated the carbon emissions from three types of multimodal transport in ports of china based on the calculation model provided by ipcc villalba and gemechu 2011 monitored emission prevention measures according to the carbon emission indicators obtained from practical engineering based on a dedicated investigation zamboni et al 2015 estimated emissions and fuel consumption of heavy vehicles in urban and port areas liao et al 2010 used the activity based emission model to calculate carbon emissions after investigating the real emission data from the port of taipei the above mentioned emissions are all calculated based on real operation data obtained from port companies however a container terminal operation system is very complicated and stochastic including many sub systems such as ships arriving leaving through waterway subsystem ships berthing at berth and being handled subsystem containers assignment and being carried transported subsystem and the subsystem of containers being handled by yard cranes or other equipment etc at yard or gate the components of the container terminal operation system are queuing systems that are interconnected it s very hard to formulate how each subsystem interact with each other not to mention how carbon emission mitigation strategies influence the emissions from a container terminal operation system as to deal with the high uncertainties and dense connection of each subsystem a simulation based model is always established to resolve such kind of problems for example guo et al 2016 combined simulation technology and real data from ultrasonic metal welding to develop a method for effective monitoring of multi sensor data based on simulation tang et al 2017 carried out a decision support system to integrate berths and channels wang et al 2017 figured out how to improve the capacity of waterway based on a ship operation simulation model therefore a simulation model will be established in this paper to discuss how to quantify the impact of mitigation strategies on the carbon emissions inside container terminals the contribution of this paper is to provide a method for calculating the carbon emissions inside container terminals without real energy consumption data and quantifying the impact of mitigation strategies the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 focuses on problem description including formulations of carbon emissions and introduction of carbon emission mitigation strategies section 3 describes the proposed simulation model then section 4 carries out experiments to analyze the impact of each emission mitigation strategy followed by conclusions and future discussions in section 5 2 problem description 2 1 carbon emission formulation in container terminals carbon emissions inside container terminals consist of direct and indirect carbon emissions based on whether fuel or electricity is applied the fuel driven equipment such as trucks and yard cranes consume fuel energy during operation process resulting in direct carbon emissions the electricity driven equipment such as opss will cause indirect carbon emissions which means the emissions are produced outside port area the direct or indirect carbon emissions emitted by each equipment fig 1 can be calculated according to iso14064 1 2006 and ipcc 2006 which are determined by energy consumptions and carbon emission coefficient of the energy as given follows 1 w f c e n e r g y where w represents the carbon emissions f represents the energy consumption which can be diesel kg lng kg or electric kwh c e n e r g y is the carbon emission coefficient of the energy which can be obtained from ipcc 2006 and the energy statistics department in corresponding region therefore once the energy consumptions are formulated the carbon emissions can be obtained 2 1 1 energy consumptions from ships the energy consumptions from ships include three parts the consumption for the ships sailing in waterway the consumption for ships waiting at anchorage and the consumption for ships berthing at berth 2 1 1 1 for ships sailing in waterway when ships are travelling in waterway the energy consumptions of main engines follows cubic law of the design speed and operational speed jj corbett et al 2009 which are given by eq 2 2 f j i s h i p s a i l p i m r j m l m v i 0 v i d 3 n p i a r j a l a d v i 0 where j represents two kinds of energy

3 for ships berthing at berth when ships are berthing at berth the energy consumptions of ships with three kinds of energy diesel lng and electric power can be denoted as eqs 4 and 5 4 f j i s h i p b

container terminals the mitigation strategies are introduced and summarized below from the above literature and actual engineering projects then the impact of the following mitigation strategies will be discussed individually in section 4 2 2 1 reduced speed in waterway channels considering emissions from other strategies in ports an extensive adoption and implementation of reduced speed in fairway channels has been shown to potentially accomplish large reductions winnes et al 2015 but there is a technical limitation a slow speed only decreases the consumption of fuel down to a certain extend below this speed the fuel consumption will go up which is contrary to the previous variation trend so the speed is called the most energy efficient speed cariou 2011 thus this paper enlarges the scope the speed of ships in waterway to see whether and how the reduced speed can decrease the carbon emissions 2 2 2 reduced auxiliary time at berth the auxiliary time including the ships mooring time joint inspection time the ready time for ships leaving and the unmooring time etc can influence the time of ships working inside the terminal thereby the carbon emissions from ships and the total carbon emissions inside container terminals will be affected therefore this paper will analyze whether and how the carbon emissions can be decreased by reduced auxiliary time at berth 2 2 3 ops and alternative fuels when ops is applied the direct carbon emission from ship auxiliary engines are reduced significantly for local areas however it s hard to say whether the total emissions are decreased from the point of life cycle which means the emission issue has been transferred how the electricity power is generated for example the use of ops applying coal power may produce more emissions than those from ship auxiliary engines styhre et al 2017 therefore a simulation model will be introduced to analyze whether ops can save carbon emissions according to the literature mentioned above liquefied natural gas lng and diesel oil for ships are chosen as two representative fuels which will be compared in this study 2 2 4 increased working efficiency of port equipment another important mitigation strategy that can reduce carbon emissions is the increased working efficiency of port equipment such as the handling efficiency of quay cranes yard cranes and the speed of trucks with the rise of work efficiency of port equipment it takes less time for ships being handled then the carbon emissions emitted by ships will be decreased therefore this paper will see whether and how the carbon emissions emitted by ships and other equipment will be affected by the working efficiency 3 simulation model an object oriented carbon emission quantification simulation model is presented by using arena 10 0 software to represent the whole operation process in a container terminal the import process for a container terminal is given as an example to describe the established model since the export process is almost the opposite then the working time for each equipment in the terminal can be obtained by running the simulation model after embedding carbon emission formulations inside the simulation model the carbon emissions from ships quay cranes yard cranes and trucks etc can be calculated directly 3 1 model assumptions in order to estimate how the mitigation strategies impact the carbon emissions inside container terminals the simulation model is established based on the following assumptions a the equipment is taken fully use of and in this case the leaking and incomplete combustion of fuel are not considered b all equipment works well under good conditions without regard to the maintenance repair and renewal work c no accidents happen during a simulation run 3 2 model establishment before model establishment a logic model is firstly proposed based on the real operation process for the whole operations in a container terminal system as shown in fig 2 3 3 model establishment the simulation model is constructed based on the logic model which includes four sub models ship arrival and berth assignment sub model ship going through waterway sub model ship handling operation sub model and external truck operation sub model 3 3 1 ship arrival and berth assignment sub model a ship arrives at the container terminal following a kind of probability distribution which can be defined when the ship is created by the create ships module as shown in fig 3 then the ship is assigned with attributes by the assign ship attributes module such as the tonnage the travelling and design speed engine parameters and container capacity etc then a berth will be assigned to the ship once the berth is idle according to the predefined selection sequence at this time a seize berth module is used to seize berth resources and the berth number can be rocorded if the assigned berth is busy the ship has to wait for berthing at anchorage the time of arriving anchorages will be recorded 3 3 2 ship going through waterway sub model once a berth is assigned for the ship the ship will go through waterway in the ship going through waterway sub model fig 4 the weather navigation condition and safe distance are firstly judged the ship can only go through the waterway once all the conditions are meet at this time the time of ship leaving anchorages can be recorded the carbon emissions for ships at anchorage are calculated then a delay sail time module is given to record the process of ship sailing in waterway and the carbon emissions from ships in waterway channels can be obtained 3 3 3 ship handling operation sub model from the perspective of practical operation process in container terminals most of containers discharged from ships will be stored in the yard then transported out of ports through collection and distribution system thus this paper only considers ship yard truck process without regard of ship truck process once the ship arrives at berth after mooring operation the handling operation begins the arriving berth time is recorded in order to caculate the emissions from ships at berth meanwhile the entity is changed from a ship to a container by using create containers module as shown in fig 5 a service qc module is applied to occupy the quay crane resources the working time of quay cranes for each container and the number of containers for each quay crane can be recorded after changing the handling efficiency the carbon emissions from quay cranes can be obtained the release module is used once the handling work of quay cranes for a container is finished trucks will wait under quay cranes if they are empty the container calls for the empty truck by using allocate truck module and then it will be transported to assigned yard blocks by transport to yard module the attributes for each truck are assigned such as the travelling speed and the fuel used which can be defined by users trucks follow the shortest path rule then the truck carrying containers waits in queue at yard for yard crane handling when the yard crane is free it will be seized and then the truck will be free and go back to berth to pick up containers the working time of each yard crane the number of containers for each quay crane and the travelling time and distance of each truck can be recorded when a container is located at a yard block the number of containers at the block will plus one the number of containers at yard is 0 at the start of each simulation run the output parameters of the simulation model will only be recorded after running the model for a year when the model is steady after all the handling work of quay cranes finished the ship will prepare to leave the berth and wait for the waterway at berth after the navigation conditions in waterway are satisfied the ship will start going throuth waterway and the ship berthing time will be recorded by a record ship berthing time module the process of ships leaving the berth is the opposite of that of ships arriving the berth which is not decribed in detail 3 3 4 external truck operation sub model an external truck entity is created by a create external trucks module as shown in fig 6 then it will wait at the gate for being checked the truck will go the assigned yard block and wait for a yard crane picking up containers after handling work the truck will leave the truck and go the gate for leaving the port the carbon emissions from external trucks are not recorded in the model due to the organizational boundary of container terminals 3 4 model parameters 3 4 1 input parameters the model has a lot of user defined input parameters some of them remain constant for an entire simulation run such as the number of berths and equipment the size and the number of container blocks at yard the tonnage of berths and waterway and the dimensions and location of waterway and anchorages etc other user defined inputs are stochastic like the natural conditions the arrival time of ships the attribute travelling speed tonnage type and navigation rules of ships the working time of equipment the attribute of trucks the storage time and the arrival departure time of external trucks etc the mitigation strategies for green container terminals are presented as the input parameters in the simulation model such as the speed of ships in waterway channels the auxiliary time at berth the working efficiency of equipment which will be discussed more in detail in section 4 1 3 4 2 output parameters the output parameters from the simulation model are the emissions from ships at anchorage at berth and in waterway channels the emissions from trucks yard cranes and quay cranes then the total carbon emissions from ships and the total emissions inside a container terminal can be obtained by adding the emissions together the impact of emission reduction measures can be analyzed by changing the input parameters for example by changing the speed of ships in waterway channels every simulation run the emissions from ships inside container terminals can be collected after that the impact of reduced speed in waterway can be figured out 4 experiments and results 4 1 parameter settings the experiments consider a container terminal in algeria with ten container berths as the simulation case as shown in fig 7 one object of this paper is to obtain how much the carbon emission is influenced by working efficiency of port equipment thus it s assumed that the number of equipment for handling operation in container terminals is a constant the tonnage of berths and the number of qcs of each berth are presented in table 1 each berth is assigned with 8 blocks and 2 yard cranes are working inside the blocks each qc is equipped with 7 internal trucks besides the two way traffic waterway channel is 20 nm long the default values of the input parameters are selected according to the data obtained from port companies in 2015 4 1 1 ships 4 1 1 1 ships arrival distribution the ships arrival distribution is proved to follow poisson distribution based on the hypothesis testing of one year real data while the inter arrival time of arrival ships obeys negative exponential distributions 4 1 1 2 type of ships the proportion and attribute of each kind of container ships are shown in table 2 besides to quality carbon emissions of ships the diesel and lng consumption rates for main engines are set as 0 206 kg kwh and 0 17 kg kwh and 0 211 kg kwh and 0 17 kg kwh for auxiliary engines respectively 4 1 1 3 speed of ships in waterway channels according to the port standard the speed of ships going through the waterway should not be too high which is mostly between 8 and 12 knots this paper focuses on the impact of ships speed therefore the scope of the speed parameter is enlarged to 24 knots we set all the ships travelling in waterway follow the same speed during one simulation run which is 8 24 knots increased by 2 knots every simulation run 4 1 1 4 auxiliary working time at berth as to study the influence of auxiliary working time the auxiliary working time for each ship is set as 2 5 5 h increased by half hour every simulation run 4 1 1 5 the energy applied by ships ops which permits ships at berth to utilize shore power instead of depending on electricity generated by aes is a novel technology applied to ships at berth taking into account of ships fuel type and on shore power supply simultaneously this study sets up four scenarios as shown in table 3 4 1 1 6 the berthing rule for each ship the waiting time of ships for berths at anchorage is directly affected by the berthing rule between ships and berths how the ships choose berths is based on the tonnage of them according to terminal operators as shown in table 4 4 1 2 the working efficiency of port equipment the average working efficiency of port equipment is shown in table 5 for example when the impact of handling efficiency of quay cranes is analyzed the efficiency changes from 20 to 48 teu h increased by 4 teu h every simulation run meanwhile other input parameters keep the same besides to quality carbon emissions of port equipment the power consumption rate of qcs and the diesel consumption rate of ycs and trucks are set as 5 23 kwh teu 3 02kg teu and 0 75 kg km respectively 4 2 results and analysis all the results in this paper are obtained after running the simulation model 20 times the total carbon emissions from the container terminal are about 85 067 17 tons annually the most significant part comes from ships which accounts for 81 68 besides carbon emissions from ships in the waterway channels account for the largest 67 27 of emissions from ships inside container terminals which needs to be reduced by mitigation strategies urgently the second is followed by port equipment such as quay cranes qcs trucks and yard cranes ycs contributing to 8 02 4 79 and 5 51 of total emissions correspondingly as shown in fig 8 4 2 1 impact of the speed of ships in waterway channels in order to analyze the influence of reduced speed in fairway channels on carbon emissions several simulation experiments are designed and results are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that with the speed decreased from 24 to 8 knots the carbon emissions are reduced by 48 4 for the emissions from ships in waterway channels 37 5 for the total emissions from ships inside container terminal and 32 9 for the total emissions from the whole container terminal however for the emissions from ships at anchorage and berth the speed of ships in waterway has little impact therefore when the speed is faster than 10 knots reduced speed in waterway channels can obviously cut down the carbon emissions from ships and total emissions inside container terminals when the speed from 8 to 12 knots is analyzed the carbon emissions will firstly be reduced with the speed of 10 knots and will go up with the speed of 12 knots according to cariou 2011 10 knots can be called the most energy efficient speed in this case 4 2 2 impact of auxiliary time at berth to analyze the influence of reduced auxiliary time several simulation experiments are designed and results are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 it can be seen that decreasing auxiliary operation time from 6 h to 2 h the carbon emissions are reduced by 22 1 for the emissions from ships at berth and 6 0 for the total emissions from container terminals 4 2 3 impact of ops and alternative fuels to analyze the impact of alternative fuels on carbon emissions a serious of simulation experiments are designed corresponding to the four scenarios as defined above in section 4 1 1 then the carbon emissions from the container terminal under four scenarios can be obtained as shown in fig 12 after analyzing the emissions in sce 1 sce 2 and sce 3 and sce 4 it can be drawn that the emissions of applying on shore power is higher than that of using lng or diesel at berth which is about 6 43 lng and 12 81 diesel for ships inside container terminals and 5 08 and 11 48 for the total emissions respectively in this case applying on shore power cannot save carbon emissions which seems to contradict our common sense it is because the indirect carbon emissions produced by applying ops is calculated based on the whole lifecycle of electricity though the direct emissions of ops are much lower than using lng or diesel the indirect emissions by using coal power is higher therefore it s hard to surely tell which one is better for reducing carbon emissions due to the source and transmission distance of electric power besides compared with diesel in waterway channels and at berth the use of lng reduces carbon emissions by 10 96 for the emissions from ships inside container terminals and 7 94 for the total emissions 4 2 4 impact of working efficiency of port equipment to analyze the impact of handling efficiency on carbon emissions which can influence the time of ships waiting at berth a number of simulation experiments are designed and results are shown in figs 13 15 in fig 13 as the handling efficiency of quay cranes increases from 20 to 52 teu h the reduction of carbon emissions is 10 41 for the emissions from ships at berth and 1 55 for total emissions with the speed of trucks increasing from 15 to 30 km h the reduction of carbon emissions is 21 17 and 1 46 for the emissions from trucks at berth and total emissions from container terminals fig 14 similarly for yard cranes when the handling efficiency rises from 30 to 50 teu h the carbon emissions fall down by 14 37 and 3 62 separately as shown in fig 15 the increasing of working efficiency for port equipment can have a certain effect on the carbon emissions from ships at berth however the total carbon emissions from container terminals almost keep the same with the rise of work efficiency due to the small proportion of the emissions from cranes and trucks 5 conclusions and discussions the main contribution is to quantify the impact of mitigation strategies on the carbon emissions from port operations and shipping inside container terminals without real energy consumption data in order to cope with complex stochastic processes in container terminals a simulation model is established considering four kinds of mitigation strategies as inputs reduced speed in waterway channels reduced auxiliary time at berth ops and alternative fuels and increased working efficiency of port equipment finally a number of simulation experiments based on a real container terminal are carried out results are represented as follows 1 the most significant part of the total carbon emissions inside container terminals comes from ships accounting for 81 7 followed by quay cranes 8 0 yard cranes 5 5 and trucks 4 8 for the total emissions from ships the emission from ships in waterway accounts for the largest which is about 68 2 when the speed is faster than 10 knots reduced speed in waterway channels can obviously cut down the carbon emissions from ships and total emissions inside container terminals but it has little impact on the emissions from ships at anchorage and at berth for the speed equal to or slower than 10 knots reduced speed cannot reduce the carbon emissions oppositely reduced speed will increase emissions by just a small quantity 3 reduced auxiliary time at berth can help decrease the emissions from ships at berth significantly but for the total emissions inside a container terminal it has little impact 4 in the case applying on shore power cannot save carbon emissions due to the source of electricity which is generated by coal power compared with diesel in waterway channels and at berth the use of lng can reduce carbon emissions by about 11 for the emissions from ships and 8 for the total emissions 5 the increasing of working efficiency for port equipment can have a certain effect on the carbon emissions from ships at berth however it has little impact on the total carbon emissions from container terminals the results and proposed method can help developing a greener container terminal which can also serve for similar problems in other kinds of ports however only the impact of mitigation strategies is analyzed in this paper without considering the cost future study should focus on the tradeoff between green effect and cost besides since trucks emissions contribute to 4 79 it should take measures to reduce carbon emissions of trucks like the energy replacement thus how the carbon emissions of trucks will be decreased by changing fuel driven trucks to agvs has already been discussed in another paper which is now under review acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the support of national natural science foundation of china no 51709037 and 51779037 in addition we acknowledge the research centre for port development at dalian university of technology for partial funding and devices 
23242,this paper aims to solve the problem of how to quantify the impact of mitigation strategies on carbon emissions from port operations and shipping inside container terminals without real energy consumption data in order to cope with complex stochastic processes in container terminals the problem is carried out by establishing a carbon emission quantification simulation model firstly the carbon emission formulation and mitigation strategies are introduced then a container terminal operation simulation model is constructed considering four kinds of mitigation strategies as inputs reduced speed in waterway channels reduced auxiliary time at berth on shore power supply and alternative fuels and increased working efficiency of port equipment finally based on a real container terminal this paper carried out a variety of simulation experiments and discovered that 1 reduced speed from 24 to 8 knots can achieve a 48 4 reduction of carbon emissions from ships in waterway channels and 32 9 from the whole container terminal 2 compared with diesel in waterway channels and at berth the use of lng can reduce carbon emissions by about 11 for the emissions from ships and 8 for the total emissions keywords green port container terminal green approach low carbon port carbon emissions simulation 1 introduction climate change and environmental pollution are one of the most pressing issues that need to be faced and resolved green port referring to the one characterized by healthy ecological environment reasonable utilization of resources low energy consumption and pollution is officially proposed in 2009 wan et al 2017 reducing carbon emissions and efficient use of port equipment in container terminals are vital to achieving the climate and environmental goal of green port construction peng et al 2016 emission mitigation strategies have been implemented in many container terminals such as the port of long beach sydney ports and tokyo harbor etc for example a shore power supply system was equipped in venetial harbor leading to about 30 reduction of carbon emissions cai 2010 operation methods such as reduced speed in waterway channels and reduced lay time at berth anchor etc were analyzed in the port of gothenburg on the promise that ghg emissions would be 10 lower than the business as usual level to 2030 winnes et al 2015 with a change from marine fuel to lng the carbon emission is reduced by 25 bengtsson et al 2011 however since the reduction of carbon emissions were calculated based on real operation data it is hard to estimate how the green port approach influence emissions green port construction is a long comprehensive systematic and complex task and is a matter concerning the overall situation and long term strategic perspective baily and solomon 2004 therefore considerable attention is generated on how to quantify the impact of mitigation strategies on the carbon emissions from port operations and shipping inside container terminals without real energy consumption data which is the problem we aim to solve in this paper efforts to reduce the environmental impact from ports mainly focus on visiting ships inside the ports since almost half of emissions were attributed to ship movement villalba and gemechu 2011 the existing literature provides different approaches to reduce carbon emissions from port vessels as summarized by the technologies and measures presented by bouman et al 2017 most of works related to the mitigation strategies focus on on shore power supply ops alternative fuels reduced speed in waterway channels and reduced turnaround time at berth ops also known as shore side electricity technology or cold ironing replaces the auxiliary diesel engines ae with electricity power supplied from shore when a ship connects to ops at berth the air quality and noise in port cities can be improved and reduced styhre et al 2017 results showed that the total potential external health cost benefit of 60 of ships applying ops while 40 use ae generated power would amount to approx 2 8 million annually a figure that excludes the benefit of reduced co2 emissions ballini and bozzo 2015 alternative fuels cover all aspects related to replacing marine fuel oils with alternative energy such as lng biofuels and methanol nox and so2 emissions are reduced significantly when a shift from marine fuel to lng happens and the co2 emissions are reduced by 25 however the total emissions of co2 equivalents may not necessarily be decreased due to the leakage bengtsson et al 2011 adopting biofuels can cut down co2 emissions highest from the perspective of life cycle but considering the systemic effects such as land use change it will produce more co2 emissions bouman et al 2017 methanol is another alternative fuel which is just introduced to the market from a life cycle perspective adopting methanol is almost similar to that of usual marine fuels for the reducing global warming brynolf et al 2014 reduced speed in waterway channels relates to the operational speed of vessels in sailing period as well as its design speed a minor speed reduction can have a large impact on fuel consumption due to the cubic function between the speed and energy consumption generally reduced speed is expected as the highest potential in carbon emission reduction buhaug et al 2009 du et al 2011 and wang et al 2013 proposed optimization approaches to minimize fuel consumption by adjusting vessel speed in waterway then du et al 2011 calculated the emissions from ships when travelling in waterway based on the widely used emission factors later an activity based model is used to calculate fuel consumption and emissions of ships entering kaohsiung port and results show that co2 emissions can be reduced by about 40 after decreasing the speed to 12 knots chang and jhang 2016 reduced turnaround time at berth is another means of reducing emissions reducing lay time at berth and still carrying out the same amount of transport work only few studies focus on this issue for instance winnes et al 2015 analyzed and forecast ship emissions in the port of gothenburg for 2030 showing that the emissions at berth are most efficiently decreased with the reduction of ships berthing time johnson and styhre 2015 concluded that fuel consumption would be saved by 2 8 by reducing unproductive waiting times and the impact is calculated based on quantitative operational data from voyage reports etc the literature mentioned above shows that on shore power supply reduced speed in waterway channels and reduced berthing time can help reduce co2 equivalents while it s hard to say for the alternative fuels due to the leakage from the engine and incomplete burning etc only few studies calculate the reduction in co2 emissions caused by green approaches nonetheless since the reduction of carbon emissions is calculated based on real operation data of many years it is hard to estimate how the green port approach influence emissions with the change of parameters among mitigation strategies without real data the emissions from port equipment have been regarded as a problem recently and corresponding research has been studied at present the mitigation strategies for port equipment can be summarized in two aspects equipment retrofit and working efficiency improvement the studies on approaches of reducing carbon emissions through equipment retrofit are mainly focused on utilization of automatic guided vehicles agvs and energy replacement of diesel to electricity for yard cranes comparing the energy savings and co2 reduction of rubber tired gantries rtgs and electric rubber tired gantries ertgs it showed that ertgs could save about 87 of energy and reduce co2 emissions by 68 yang and chang 2013 besides geerlings and duin 2010 indicated that the replacement of diesel cargo stevedoring equipment with electric equipment can reduce co2 emissions by 20 xiao and lu 2012 proposed and analyzed a formula for calculating the energy consumption of quay cranes in container terminals based on a long term real data and developed an energy saving device used in cranes on the other hand the studies on reducing carbon emissions through improving working efficiency of equipment are mainly focused on scheduling optimization scheduling of handling equipment in container terminal has been studied i e quay cranes internal trucks and yard cranes the results showed that the optimal tradeoff between time saving and energy saving can be achieved by reasonable scheduling of handling equipment numerous approaches have been proposed to reduce carbon emissions in coastal areas and ports davarzani et al 2015 but significant reduction in carbon emissions can be reached only by the replacement with renewable fuels styhre et al 2017 renewable energy plays an increasingly greater role within ports as the ports are usually situated in the place that are particularly suitable for generating power from winds rotterdam kitakyushu tide differentials dover the port of digby waves port kembla mutriku and in some cases geothermal energy hamburg furthermore the ports often have available wide flat surfaces such as storage areas and warehouses that can be used for installation of solar panels e g the tokyo ohi terminal or in the port of san diego administration buildings although such infrastructure might not always be suitable for large scale solar energy exploitation the port authority of genoa has developed a port energy environmental plan to improve the use of renewable energy and boost the efficiency of energy in port areas allowing to one save around 197 000t of co2 by 2020 based on an estimation of co2 reduction for the year 2011 acciaro et al 2014 the largest terminal operator hamburger hafen und logistik ag operates a fleet of electric cars and uses heat generated by burning biogas produced in the neighboring sewage handling plant in köhlbr and höft which accounts for a reduction of 1000t of co2 per year the company aims to decrease the emission by 30 before the year of 2030 compared with that in 2008 and by 2012 had already achieved a reduction of 24 pietsch 2013 besides studies have been focused on green port policies related to mitigation strategies which are currently adopted in advanced ports worldwide such as using on shore power transitioning to alternative fuels replacement of older diesel equipment and switching to renewable energy for example hong kong port has introduced the fair winds charter program for the use of low sulfur oil in ships since 2011 and has implemented ertg replacement project reducing 70 fuel cost and 80 maintenance cost kim and kim 2014 the port of long beach clean trucks program implemented a progressive ban on older heavy polluting diesel drayage trucks when the program was fully implemented in 2012 emissions from trucks were cut down by over 90 percentages another challenge in quantifying the impact of mitigation strategies on carbon emissions is how to estimate the emissions emitted inside the container terminal based on an activity based methodology meyer et al 2008 estimated the atmospheric emissions from four belgian seaports which accounted a total of 1880 kton of co2 from the port for the period 2003 2004 besides jiang et al 2012 calculated the carbon emissions from three types of multimodal transport in ports of china based on the calculation model provided by ipcc villalba and gemechu 2011 monitored emission prevention measures according to the carbon emission indicators obtained from practical engineering based on a dedicated investigation zamboni et al 2015 estimated emissions and fuel consumption of heavy vehicles in urban and port areas liao et al 2010 used the activity based emission model to calculate carbon emissions after investigating the real emission data from the port of taipei the above mentioned emissions are all calculated based on real operation data obtained from port companies however a container terminal operation system is very complicated and stochastic including many sub systems such as ships arriving leaving through waterway subsystem ships berthing at berth and being handled subsystem containers assignment and being carried transported subsystem and the subsystem of containers being handled by yard cranes or other equipment etc at yard or gate the components of the container terminal operation system are queuing systems that are interconnected it s very hard to formulate how each subsystem interact with each other not to mention how carbon emission mitigation strategies influence the emissions from a container terminal operation system as to deal with the high uncertainties and dense connection of each subsystem a simulation based model is always established to resolve such kind of problems for example guo et al 2016 combined simulation technology and real data from ultrasonic metal welding to develop a method for effective monitoring of multi sensor data based on simulation tang et al 2017 carried out a decision support system to integrate berths and channels wang et al 2017 figured out how to improve the capacity of waterway based on a ship operation simulation model therefore a simulation model will be established in this paper to discuss how to quantify the impact of mitigation strategies on the carbon emissions inside container terminals the contribution of this paper is to provide a method for calculating the carbon emissions inside container terminals without real energy consumption data and quantifying the impact of mitigation strategies the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 focuses on problem description including formulations of carbon emissions and introduction of carbon emission mitigation strategies section 3 describes the proposed simulation model then section 4 carries out experiments to analyze the impact of each emission mitigation strategy followed by conclusions and future discussions in section 5 2 problem description 2 1 carbon emission formulation in container terminals carbon emissions inside container terminals consist of direct and indirect carbon emissions based on whether fuel or electricity is applied the fuel driven equipment such as trucks and yard cranes consume fuel energy during operation process resulting in direct carbon emissions the electricity driven equipment such as opss will cause indirect carbon emissions which means the emissions are produced outside port area the direct or indirect carbon emissions emitted by each equipment fig 1 can be calculated according to iso14064 1 2006 and ipcc 2006 which are determined by energy consumptions and carbon emission coefficient of the energy as given follows 1 w f c e n e r g y where w represents the carbon emissions f represents the energy consumption which can be diesel kg lng kg or electric kwh c e n e r g y is the carbon emission coefficient of the energy which can be obtained from ipcc 2006 and the energy statistics department in corresponding region therefore once the energy consumptions are formulated the carbon emissions can be obtained 2 1 1 energy consumptions from ships the energy consumptions from ships include three parts the consumption for the ships sailing in waterway the consumption for ships waiting at anchorage and the consumption for ships berthing at berth 2 1 1 1 for ships sailing in waterway when ships are travelling in waterway the energy consumptions of main engines follows cubic law of the design speed and operational speed jj corbett et al 2009 which are given by eq 2 2 f j i s h i p s a i l p i m r j m l m v i 0 v i d 3 n p i a r j a l a d v i 0 where j represents two kinds of energy

3 for ships berthing at berth when ships are berthing at berth the energy consumptions of ships with three kinds of energy diesel lng and electric power can be denoted as eqs 4 and 5 4 f j i s h i p b

container terminals the mitigation strategies are introduced and summarized below from the above literature and actual engineering projects then the impact of the following mitigation strategies will be discussed individually in section 4 2 2 1 reduced speed in waterway channels considering emissions from other strategies in ports an extensive adoption and implementation of reduced speed in fairway channels has been shown to potentially accomplish large reductions winnes et al 2015 but there is a technical limitation a slow speed only decreases the consumption of fuel down to a certain extend below this speed the fuel consumption will go up which is contrary to the previous variation trend so the speed is called the most energy efficient speed cariou 2011 thus this paper enlarges the scope the speed of ships in waterway to see whether and how the reduced speed can decrease the carbon emissions 2 2 2 reduced auxiliary time at berth the auxiliary time including the ships mooring time joint inspection time the ready time for ships leaving and the unmooring time etc can influence the time of ships working inside the terminal thereby the carbon emissions from ships and the total carbon emissions inside container terminals will be affected therefore this paper will analyze whether and how the carbon emissions can be decreased by reduced auxiliary time at berth 2 2 3 ops and alternative fuels when ops is applied the direct carbon emission from ship auxiliary engines are reduced significantly for local areas however it s hard to say whether the total emissions are decreased from the point of life cycle which means the emission issue has been transferred how the electricity power is generated for example the use of ops applying coal power may produce more emissions than those from ship auxiliary engines styhre et al 2017 therefore a simulation model will be introduced to analyze whether ops can save carbon emissions according to the literature mentioned above liquefied natural gas lng and diesel oil for ships are chosen as two representative fuels which will be compared in this study 2 2 4 increased working efficiency of port equipment another important mitigation strategy that can reduce carbon emissions is the increased working efficiency of port equipment such as the handling efficiency of quay cranes yard cranes and the speed of trucks with the rise of work efficiency of port equipment it takes less time for ships being handled then the carbon emissions emitted by ships will be decreased therefore this paper will see whether and how the carbon emissions emitted by ships and other equipment will be affected by the working efficiency 3 simulation model an object oriented carbon emission quantification simulation model is presented by using arena 10 0 software to represent the whole operation process in a container terminal the import process for a container terminal is given as an example to describe the established model since the export process is almost the opposite then the working time for each equipment in the terminal can be obtained by running the simulation model after embedding carbon emission formulations inside the simulation model the carbon emissions from ships quay cranes yard cranes and trucks etc can be calculated directly 3 1 model assumptions in order to estimate how the mitigation strategies impact the carbon emissions inside container terminals the simulation model is established based on the following assumptions a the equipment is taken fully use of and in this case the leaking and incomplete combustion of fuel are not considered b all equipment works well under good conditions without regard to the maintenance repair and renewal work c no accidents happen during a simulation run 3 2 model establishment before model establishment a logic model is firstly proposed based on the real operation process for the whole operations in a container terminal system as shown in fig 2 3 3 model establishment the simulation model is constructed based on the logic model which includes four sub models ship arrival and berth assignment sub model ship going through waterway sub model ship handling operation sub model and external truck operation sub model 3 3 1 ship arrival and berth assignment sub model a ship arrives at the container terminal following a kind of probability distribution which can be defined when the ship is created by the create ships module as shown in fig 3 then the ship is assigned with attributes by the assign ship attributes module such as the tonnage the travelling and design speed engine parameters and container capacity etc then a berth will be assigned to the ship once the berth is idle according to the predefined selection sequence at this time a seize berth module is used to seize berth resources and the berth number can be rocorded if the assigned berth is busy the ship has to wait for berthing at anchorage the time of arriving anchorages will be recorded 3 3 2 ship going through waterway sub model once a berth is assigned for the ship the ship will go through waterway in the ship going through waterway sub model fig 4 the weather navigation condition and safe distance are firstly judged the ship can only go through the waterway once all the conditions are meet at this time the time of ship leaving anchorages can be recorded the carbon emissions for ships at anchorage are calculated then a delay sail time module is given to record the process of ship sailing in waterway and the carbon emissions from ships in waterway channels can be obtained 3 3 3 ship handling operation sub model from the perspective of practical operation process in container terminals most of containers discharged from ships will be stored in the yard then transported out of ports through collection and distribution system thus this paper only considers ship yard truck process without regard of ship truck process once the ship arrives at berth after mooring operation the handling operation begins the arriving berth time is recorded in order to caculate the emissions from ships at berth meanwhile the entity is changed from a ship to a container by using create containers module as shown in fig 5 a service qc module is applied to occupy the quay crane resources the working time of quay cranes for each container and the number of containers for each quay crane can be recorded after changing the handling efficiency the carbon emissions from quay cranes can be obtained the release module is used once the handling work of quay cranes for a container is finished trucks will wait under quay cranes if they are empty the container calls for the empty truck by using allocate truck module and then it will be transported to assigned yard blocks by transport to yard module the attributes for each truck are assigned such as the travelling speed and the fuel used which can be defined by users trucks follow the shortest path rule then the truck carrying containers waits in queue at yard for yard crane handling when the yard crane is free it will be seized and then the truck will be free and go back to berth to pick up containers the working time of each yard crane the number of containers for each quay crane and the travelling time and distance of each truck can be recorded when a container is located at a yard block the number of containers at the block will plus one the number of containers at yard is 0 at the start of each simulation run the output parameters of the simulation model will only be recorded after running the model for a year when the model is steady after all the handling work of quay cranes finished the ship will prepare to leave the berth and wait for the waterway at berth after the navigation conditions in waterway are satisfied the ship will start going throuth waterway and the ship berthing time will be recorded by a record ship berthing time module the process of ships leaving the berth is the opposite of that of ships arriving the berth which is not decribed in detail 3 3 4 external truck operation sub model an external truck entity is created by a create external trucks module as shown in fig 6 then it will wait at the gate for being checked the truck will go the assigned yard block and wait for a yard crane picking up containers after handling work the truck will leave the truck and go the gate for leaving the port the carbon emissions from external trucks are not recorded in the model due to the organizational boundary of container terminals 3 4 model parameters 3 4 1 input parameters the model has a lot of user defined input parameters some of them remain constant for an entire simulation run such as the number of berths and equipment the size and the number of container blocks at yard the tonnage of berths and waterway and the dimensions and location of waterway and anchorages etc other user defined inputs are stochastic like the natural conditions the arrival time of ships the attribute travelling speed tonnage type and navigation rules of ships the working time of equipment the attribute of trucks the storage time and the arrival departure time of external trucks etc the mitigation strategies for green container terminals are presented as the input parameters in the simulation model such as the speed of ships in waterway channels the auxiliary time at berth the working efficiency of equipment which will be discussed more in detail in section 4 1 3 4 2 output parameters the output parameters from the simulation model are the emissions from ships at anchorage at berth and in waterway channels the emissions from trucks yard cranes and quay cranes then the total carbon emissions from ships and the total emissions inside a container terminal can be obtained by adding the emissions together the impact of emission reduction measures can be analyzed by changing the input parameters for example by changing the speed of ships in waterway channels every simulation run the emissions from ships inside container terminals can be collected after that the impact of reduced speed in waterway can be figured out 4 experiments and results 4 1 parameter settings the experiments consider a container terminal in algeria with ten container berths as the simulation case as shown in fig 7 one object of this paper is to obtain how much the carbon emission is influenced by working efficiency of port equipment thus it s assumed that the number of equipment for handling operation in container terminals is a constant the tonnage of berths and the number of qcs of each berth are presented in table 1 each berth is assigned with 8 blocks and 2 yard cranes are working inside the blocks each qc is equipped with 7 internal trucks besides the two way traffic waterway channel is 20 nm long the default values of the input parameters are selected according to the data obtained from port companies in 2015 4 1 1 ships 4 1 1 1 ships arrival distribution the ships arrival distribution is proved to follow poisson distribution based on the hypothesis testing of one year real data while the inter arrival time of arrival ships obeys negative exponential distributions 4 1 1 2 type of ships the proportion and attribute of each kind of container ships are shown in table 2 besides to quality carbon emissions of ships the diesel and lng consumption rates for main engines are set as 0 206 kg kwh and 0 17 kg kwh and 0 211 kg kwh and 0 17 kg kwh for auxiliary engines respectively 4 1 1 3 speed of ships in waterway channels according to the port standard the speed of ships going through the waterway should not be too high which is mostly between 8 and 12 knots this paper focuses on the impact of ships speed therefore the scope of the speed parameter is enlarged to 24 knots we set all the ships travelling in waterway follow the same speed during one simulation run which is 8 24 knots increased by 2 knots every simulation run 4 1 1 4 auxiliary working time at berth as to study the influence of auxiliary working time the auxiliary working time for each ship is set as 2 5 5 h increased by half hour every simulation run 4 1 1 5 the energy applied by ships ops which permits ships at berth to utilize shore power instead of depending on electricity generated by aes is a novel technology applied to ships at berth taking into account of ships fuel type and on shore power supply simultaneously this study sets up four scenarios as shown in table 3 4 1 1 6 the berthing rule for each ship the waiting time of ships for berths at anchorage is directly affected by the berthing rule between ships and berths how the ships choose berths is based on the tonnage of them according to terminal operators as shown in table 4 4 1 2 the working efficiency of port equipment the average working efficiency of port equipment is shown in table 5 for example when the impact of handling efficiency of quay cranes is analyzed the efficiency changes from 20 to 48 teu h increased by 4 teu h every simulation run meanwhile other input parameters keep the same besides to quality carbon emissions of port equipment the power consumption rate of qcs and the diesel consumption rate of ycs and trucks are set as 5 23 kwh teu 3 02kg teu and 0 75 kg km respectively 4 2 results and analysis all the results in this paper are obtained after running the simulation model 20 times the total carbon emissions from the container terminal are about 85 067 17 tons annually the most significant part comes from ships which accounts for 81 68 besides carbon emissions from ships in the waterway channels account for the largest 67 27 of emissions from ships inside container terminals which needs to be reduced by mitigation strategies urgently the second is followed by port equipment such as quay cranes qcs trucks and yard cranes ycs contributing to 8 02 4 79 and 5 51 of total emissions correspondingly as shown in fig 8 4 2 1 impact of the speed of ships in waterway channels in order to analyze the influence of reduced speed in fairway channels on carbon emissions several simulation experiments are designed and results are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that with the speed decreased from 24 to 8 knots the carbon emissions are reduced by 48 4 for the emissions from ships in waterway channels 37 5 for the total emissions from ships inside container terminal and 32 9 for the total emissions from the whole container terminal however for the emissions from ships at anchorage and berth the speed of ships in waterway has little impact therefore when the speed is faster than 10 knots reduced speed in waterway channels can obviously cut down the carbon emissions from ships and total emissions inside container terminals when the speed from 8 to 12 knots is analyzed the carbon emissions will firstly be reduced with the speed of 10 knots and will go up with the speed of 12 knots according to cariou 2011 10 knots can be called the most energy efficient speed in this case 4 2 2 impact of auxiliary time at berth to analyze the influence of reduced auxiliary time several simulation experiments are designed and results are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 it can be seen that decreasing auxiliary operation time from 6 h to 2 h the carbon emissions are reduced by 22 1 for the emissions from ships at berth and 6 0 for the total emissions from container terminals 4 2 3 impact of ops and alternative fuels to analyze the impact of alternative fuels on carbon emissions a serious of simulation experiments are designed corresponding to the four scenarios as defined above in section 4 1 1 then the carbon emissions from the container terminal under four scenarios can be obtained as shown in fig 12 after analyzing the emissions in sce 1 sce 2 and sce 3 and sce 4 it can be drawn that the emissions of applying on shore power is higher than that of using lng or diesel at berth which is about 6 43 lng and 12 81 diesel for ships inside container terminals and 5 08 and 11 48 for the total emissions respectively in this case applying on shore power cannot save carbon emissions which seems to contradict our common sense it is because the indirect carbon emissions produced by applying ops is calculated based on the whole lifecycle of electricity though the direct emissions of ops are much lower than using lng or diesel the indirect emissions by using coal power is higher therefore it s hard to surely tell which one is better for reducing carbon emissions due to the source and transmission distance of electric power besides compared with diesel in waterway channels and at berth the use of lng reduces carbon emissions by 10 96 for the emissions from ships inside container terminals and 7 94 for the total emissions 4 2 4 impact of working efficiency of port equipment to analyze the impact of handling efficiency on carbon emissions which can influence the time of ships waiting at berth a number of simulation experiments are designed and results are shown in figs 13 15 in fig 13 as the handling efficiency of quay cranes increases from 20 to 52 teu h the reduction of carbon emissions is 10 41 for the emissions from ships at berth and 1 55 for total emissions with the speed of trucks increasing from 15 to 30 km h the reduction of carbon emissions is 21 17 and 1 46 for the emissions from trucks at berth and total emissions from container terminals fig 14 similarly for yard cranes when the handling efficiency rises from 30 to 50 teu h the carbon emissions fall down by 14 37 and 3 62 separately as shown in fig 15 the increasing of working efficiency for port equipment can have a certain effect on the carbon emissions from ships at berth however the total carbon emissions from container terminals almost keep the same with the rise of work efficiency due to the small proportion of the emissions from cranes and trucks 5 conclusions and discussions the main contribution is to quantify the impact of mitigation strategies on the carbon emissions from port operations and shipping inside container terminals without real energy consumption data in order to cope with complex stochastic processes in container terminals a simulation model is established considering four kinds of mitigation strategies as inputs reduced speed in waterway channels reduced auxiliary time at berth ops and alternative fuels and increased working efficiency of port equipment finally a number of simulation experiments based on a real container terminal are carried out results are represented as follows 1 the most significant part of the total carbon emissions inside container terminals comes from ships accounting for 81 7 followed by quay cranes 8 0 yard cranes 5 5 and trucks 4 8 for the total emissions from ships the emission from ships in waterway accounts for the largest which is about 68 2 when the speed is faster than 10 knots reduced speed in waterway channels can obviously cut down the carbon emissions from ships and total emissions inside container terminals but it has little impact on the emissions from ships at anchorage and at berth for the speed equal to or slower than 10 knots reduced speed cannot reduce the carbon emissions oppositely reduced speed will increase emissions by just a small quantity 3 reduced auxiliary time at berth can help decrease the emissions from ships at berth significantly but for the total emissions inside a container terminal it has little impact 4 in the case applying on shore power cannot save carbon emissions due to the source of electricity which is generated by coal power compared with diesel in waterway channels and at berth the use of lng can reduce carbon emissions by about 11 for the emissions from ships and 8 for the total emissions 5 the increasing of working efficiency for port equipment can have a certain effect on the carbon emissions from ships at berth however it has little impact on the total carbon emissions from container terminals the results and proposed method can help developing a greener container terminal which can also serve for similar problems in other kinds of ports however only the impact of mitigation strategies is analyzed in this paper without considering the cost future study should focus on the tradeoff between green effect and cost besides since trucks emissions contribute to 4 79 it should take measures to reduce carbon emissions of trucks like the energy replacement thus how the carbon emissions of trucks will be decreased by changing fuel driven trucks to agvs has already been discussed in another paper which is now under review acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the support of national natural science foundation of

av rovisco pais lisboa 1049 001 portugal corresponding author 1 presently at the naval architecture and marine engineering department alexandria university egypt corrosion degradation of ship plates is predicted at different ship locations based on limited information on the local environmental conditions the ship spaces are classified according to their chemical and physical characteristics that affect the corrosion behaviour the parameters of the calibrated models expressing the corrosion degradation from both sides of ship plates are used to derive other parameters for corrosion models expressing the corrosion degradation at each side of the corresponding plates the derived models are then used to develop corrosion models for other ship spaces where no real corrosion measurement data are available keywords corrosion degradation wastage allowance corrosion environments 1 introduction the importance of the studies of marine corrosion increased considerably in the last few decades because there is a strong need to predict better the corrosion degradation especially in oil tankers that have been prone to some remarkable disasters statistics for ship hull damages show that around 90 of ship failures are attributed to corrosion including corrosion fatigue emi et al 1991 at the ship design stage the corrosion additions will increase the required net thickness of structural hull members to compensate for the expected thickness reduction during the assumed ship life after commissioning ships are surveyed regularly to examine their condition and any worn structural members are replaced based on a wastage allowance as defined in iacs this wastage allowance depends on the structural member location and orientation it is a function of the physical and chemical characteristics of the space surrounding each structural member several studies have investigated the corrosion phenomenon through regression and statistical analyses of collected data sets yamamoto and ikegami 1998 guedes soares and garbatov 1999 paik et al 2003 sone et al 2003 wang et al 2003a wang et al 2003b garbatov et al 2007 garbatov and guedes soares 2008 ship owner associations and the classification societies collect thickness measurement data and some databases are already available worldwide as reported in tscf 1992 the present study aims to introduce a simplified method to estimate the corrosion degradation in the different ship spaces based on limited information about the environmental conditions in those spaces the different ship spaces are classified according to their main characteristics which affect the corrosion degradation each space will be assumed to have almost a uniform property through it a specific corrosion model is developed for each space based on the available data as the available corrosion data are thickness measurements taken during the surveying periods so this data as well as its corresponding calibrated models will represent the thickness loss from both sides of the structural components the parameters of the available calibrated models will be used to obtain their corresponding parameters of other corrosion models expressing the corrosion degradation at each side of the structural components these single side models will be used as reference ones in order to develop other corrosion models for the other spaces which have not corrosion data available then the corrosion models corresponding to the spaces surrounding each ship panel will be combined in order to obtain a corrosion model representing the corrosion degradation from both sides the developed models based on the present study can be used as reference ones as defined by guedes soares et al 2008 2009 2013 then these reference models can be corrected in order to obtain the corrosion degradation at any time ship space and environmental conditions while in those references the models consider that both sides of a ship plate are subjected to the same type of corrosion the models proposed in this paper account for the real case that many ship plates have different environmental conditions around them thus the two faces of the same plate are subjected to different corrosion mechanisms and have therefore different corrosion rates 2 classification of ship environments the corrosion degradation process is affected by many factors many uncertainties are involved which increases its randomness and so increases the difficulty of deriving a corrosion model solely based on theory the environments surrounding ship structures are complex the deck plating is aggressively attacked by corrosion activated by green water rain and service water collection besides high humidity and oxygen levels and aggressive marine atmosphere the side shell plating is subjected to three different environments the upper part of it is subjected to a harsh atmospheric environment rich with chloride contents oxygen and other corrosive compounds the relative humidity through this part is high beside the sea water spray rising from the ship motion and wave effects but without a significant splash guedes soares et al 2009 studied the effect of relative humidity chlorides and temperature on the corrosion behaviour of ship steel structures that are subjected to marine atmosphere based on a literature review of the previous studies and the analysis performed in guedes soares et al 2009 the factors that have significant effects on the corrosion under marine atmospheric conditions were identified relative humidity rh influences corrosion through its effect on the duration of wetness duration of wetness determines the duration of the electrochemical process uhlig and revie 1985 chlorides in the salt spray are principally responsible for metal corrosion in ocean environments and various studies have proved that ambler and bain 1955 laque 1975 temperature affects the relative humidity the dew point the duration of wetness and the kinetics of the corrosion process for corrosion under atmospheric conditions the presence of moisture as determined by the duration of wetness is probably the most important factor ailor 1982 the lower part of the side shell of the ship is immersed in sea water water properties such as salinity temperature oxygen content ph level and chemical composition can vary according to the ship location and water depth the flow of water around the vessel through this part contributes to accelerated corrosion action this occurs because the water that flows removes the rust deposits from the surface and exposes the fresh base metal to the corrosive agents resulting in a continued corrosion attack between both of the immersed and the atmospheric part of the ship side the side shell plating is subjected to a more aggressive environment this zone is an aerated area because of the turbulence of the sea surface around the ship hull as a result of the interaction between the ship and the sea waves this action increases the oxygen contents of the sea surface layer besides the wear effects arising from the motion of the sea surface against the side shell and the wet and dry effect make this region highly corroded zone the quay contact region on the ship side is also suffering from aggressive corrosion deterioration the contact between the ship side and the fenders on the quay during the birthing period causes wearing to the ship plates and damage to the protective coating this exposes the base metal to the corrosive environment which accelerates the corrosion degradation rates inside ship tanks different corrosive environments also exist the corrosion in the ballast tanks is much different from that in the cargo tanks and both of them are different from the corrosion behaviour in the void spaces of the double bottom double hull and machinery space even inside the same tank the corrosion in the void space above the liquid level is different from that in the immersed part and both are different from the corrosion behaviour in the tank bottom in the ballast tanks the void space above the water level is highly humid rich with chlorides and is affected by the sloshing of the ballast water which makes the corrosion through that region very severe the immersed side and bottom parts of the ballast tank are attacked by corrosion similar to the corrosion under sea water immersion conditions that happens at the external hull of the vessel however the ballast water remains almost stagnant with respect to the tank boundaries while the relative flow of seawater with respect to the external hull of the vessel increases the corrosion attack significant corrosion of structural components in ballast tanks adjacent to heated cargo tanks or tanks with consumables is also possible in cargo tanks the upper region under deck area and part of the side shell suffers more from corrosive gases evaporated from the cargo such as sulphur compound gases and carbon dioxide which have harsh corrosive effects yasunaga et al 2003 the side shell of cargo tanks is usually immersed in crude oil during loading condition the corrosion attack through this region is so dependent on the chemical and physical characteristics of the crude oil for cargo tanks loaded with heavy crude oils a protective waxy film is formed on the side boundary of the tank protecting it from the corrosive environment the protection of this film decreases as the viscosity of the cargo oil decreases until reaching a minimum value in the product tanks at the bottom of the cargo tanks where a lot of sediments water and other impurities accumulate a very corrosive environment develops beside the wear effects resulting from the motion of these impurities against the tank bottom katoh et al 2003 time in ballast or cargo tank washing and inerting for tankers the effectiveness of the corrosion protection systems and component location and orientation have a great effect on the corrosion behaviour an increased degree of the local structural flexibility has been claimed to increase the corrosion rates as the time progresses because of the continuous scale loss these imply that the corrosion models developed on the basis of the statistical analysis of operational data will usually be different according to the ship type and cargo or structural member location and category hence it is important to classify the different spaces surrounding the ship structure based on their physical and chemical characteristics based on this classification it is necessary to develop a corrosion model and to define the most important factors affecting the corrosion degradation for each ship space 3 corrosion modelling usually the available corrosion data represents thickness reduction measurements taken during periodical surveys at different ship lives this reduction represents the corrosion degradation from both sides of the structural members previous studies reported in garbatov et al 2007 garbatov and guedes soares 2008 2009 already performed regression analyses and fitted several data sets for tankers and bulk carriers to the nonlinear function of time corrosion model guedes soares and garbatov 1999 1 d t d 1 e t τ c τ t t τ c 0 t τ c this model is governed by three parameters and represents the long term description of corrosion deterioration under average environmental conditions τ t is the transition time τ c is the coating life and d is the long term corrosion depth long term corrosion depth d is the maximum steady corrosion depth expected after a long period of time as the corrosion process progresses corrosion products rust are accumulated on the surface of the metal if this layer of rust did not flake out and depending on its porous characteristics it can reach to a thickness enough to isolate the substrate from the corrosive agents and then corrosion process stops d is estimated based on the regression analysis and fitting of corrosion depth measurements taken through the ship life for each ship space that has certain environmental and operational characteristics the corrosion degradation model descriptors that are used in the present study are based on two sets of corrosion data for deck plates of ballast and cargo tanks of tankers these data sets were provided by abs 2002 and are analysed in garbatov et al 2007 the first set includes 1168 measurements of deck plates from ballast tanks with original nominal thicknesses varying from 13 5 mm to 35 mm on ships with lengths between perpendiculars in the range of 163 5 401 m the second set of data includes 4665 measurements of deck plates from cargo tanks with original nominal thicknesses varying from 12 7 mm to 35 mm on ships with lengths between perpendiculars in the range of 163 5 401 m the second corrosion data used here is the one presented in garbatov and guedes soares 2008 the long term corrosion wastage d and the period without corrosion or the time of initiation of corrosion τ c and the transition time τ t are defined based on performing a least squares fit to the data using the quasi newton algorithm which determines the direction of search used at each iteration considering the mean value of corrosion depth taken from the yearly subset of data histograms there was some variability of the yearly mean values of the data around the regressed line which was quantified by r2 draper and smith 2014 being between 0 85 and 0 9 in the present study the parameters of the previous calibrated corrosion models for the spaces which have corrosion data are used to derive other parameters for models expressing the corrosion degradation at each side of the structural elements even for the spaces which have not corrosion data then various pairs of these single side models will be combined in order to derive models expressing the corrosion degradation from both sides of each structural component this accounts for the different corrosion rates of the different environmental conditions within ship spaces each pair of the single side models is defined according to the environments on each side of the structural components 3 1 single side corrosion models two main problems are solved here the first is how the parameters of the calibrated double side corrosion models which represent the corrosion degradation from both sides of ship panels can be used to derive the corresponding parameters of the single side models which represent the corrosion degradation at each side of the same panels the second problem is the scarcity of the corrosion data to cover the different ship spaces usually the available calibrated double side corrosion models and their corresponding single side ones are not enough to express the corrosion degradation at the different ship spaces then it is important to develop corrosion models for the different ship spaces based on what is available on the calibrated single side models considering the first problem the long term corrosion depth of the available double side corrosion models will be divided into two parts expressing the long term corrosion depths at each face of ship plates by multiplying it by margin factors for any ship panel the margin factor f i m is defined as the ratio between the corrosion wastage allowance of side i and the summation of the corrosion wastage allowances on both sides as defined by iacs if d w a s i where i 1 2 are the corrosion wastage allowances on each side of the structural member then 2 f i m d w a s i j 1 2 d w a s j then the long term corrosion depth d i of the side i where i 1 2 of the ship panel will be 3 d i f i m d for ship spaces that do not have corrosion data the second problem another space with similar corrosion characteristics will be selected as a reference one then the long term corrosion depth of this reference space single side corrosion will be scaled in order to obtain the long term corrosion depth of the ship space which does not have corrosion data this scale factor will be taken as the ratio between the corrosion wastage allowance of the considered space which has not corrosion data and the corrosion wastage allowance of the reference space if d was i and dwas r i are the corrosion wastage allowances for the considered ship space which has no corrosion data and its corresponding reference one respectively then a scale factor f i s will be defined as 4 f i s d w a s i d w a s r i if d r i is the long term corrosion depth of the reference space then the long term corrosion depth of the considered space will be 5 d i f i s d r i the long term corrosion depth of any space around the ship hull can be obtained in two simple steps the first step is the splitting of the long term corrosion depths of the ship panels which have corrosion data using eqns 2 and 3 the second is the scaling of the resulting long term corrosion depths to the spaces which have not corrosion data using eqns 4 and 5 both of these two steps are performed based on the corrosion wastage allowances as defined by the common structural rules from a statistical point of view the long term corrosion depth expresses a long term mean value while the corrosion wastage allowance specified by iacs expresses an extreme value with a small probability of exceedance both of them are in a direct relation to each other this justify employing the ratio of corrosion wastage allowances in a dividing the long term corrosion depth of the available double side corrosion models into two parts expressing the long term corrosion depths at each side of ship plates b scaling the long term corrosion depth of the reference space in order to obtain the long term corrosion depth of the ship space which does not have corrosion data however both the transition time τt and coating life τ c are not defined till now for ship spaces which do not have corrosion data a regression analysis on corrosion measurements data taken from many ships and covering several spaces around the ship hull have been performed in garbatov et al 2007 garbatov and guedes soares 2008 2009 2010a these studies calibrated the nonlinear corrosion model as presented in guedes soares and garbatov 1999 to these data and defined the model descriptors the data exhibits a large scatter reflecting the nature of the problem as this is data from many ships that are subjected to various environmental conditions and thus the variability is unavoidable a single exponential smoothing has been employed here the new smoother transition time as a function of the long term corrosion depth is estimated by using the previously estimated as well as the previous actual value with a weighting or smoothing factor α the smoothing factor α can never to be greater than 1 and higher values of α put more weight on the most recent estimates the estimated transition time for the i t h estimation of τ t i is given as easton and mccoll 1997 6 τ t i α a i 1 1 α α a i 2 1 α 2 α a i 3 1 α 3 τ t i 3 where τ t i 1 α a i 2 1 α τ t i 2 is the estimated i 1 value a i 1 is the actual demand for i 1 the standard error or mean square error after smoothing is performed is 5 2 which is the minimum error that can be estimated for the smoothing factor α 0 278 based on the smoothed transition time a regression analysis is performed in order to develop a relationship between the transition time τ t and the long term corrosion depth d according to this analysis the following relationship is obtained fig 1 7 τ t 7 59 ln d 15 29 in this study it will be shown that accounting for the specific environmental conditions is able to reduce the spread significantly since the long term corrosion depth d for any space around the ship hull is now defined then by substitution d in eqn 7 the corresponding transition time can be estimated however in the present study the coating life τ c for any space is assumed to be the same as the corresponding one of the reference space the coating life of the reference space which expresses the coating effectiveness for single side corrosion will be assumed the same as the corresponding one of the double side corrosion model a margin of error can be produced from the assumption that both the target space and its reference one have the same coating life however in order to reduce this error it is important for these spaces to have similar environmental and operational characteristics and so a similar corrosion and coating effectiveness behavior in case of more precise data about the coating effectiveness life is available from the manufacturer this can be used instead of the value of the reference space 3 2 double side corrosion models ship plates act as boundaries between two spaces that can have similar or different corrosion characteristics hence the different ship plates can be classified according to their surrounding environments according to this classification the reduction in the thickness of any ship plate will equal to the summation of the corrosion depths of each side 8 d 12 t d 1 t d 2 t d 1 1 e t τ c 1 τ t 1 d 2 1 e t τ c 2 τ t 2 t τ c 1 τ c 2 d 1 1 e t τ

represents the other side and 12 represents both sides 4 application example this numerical example illustrates how to predict the corrosion degradation models for the different ship panels based on limited corrosion data the ship used for this purpose is a double hull tanker the structural arrangements longitudinal divisions and stiffening are as indicated by the mid ship section in fig 2 left the different ship environments or spaces can be classified according to their physical chemical and operational characteristics that affect the corrosion deterioration ship spaces that have similar environmental characteristics will usually have similar corrosion degradation and will belong to the same class this is similar to what was considered in iacs 2010 for the definition of the corrosion wastage allowances for the structural members in the different ship spaces based on this classification the different environments around the mid ship section will be as demonstrated in fig 2 right where each environment is indicated by an alphabetical letter each ship plate is exposed to two environments one at each side where they can be different or similar hence in the present example two alphabetical letters are used to indicate the environments around each plate as an example deck plates are exposed to the environmental class ad inside crude oil tanks while inside ballast tanks deck plates are exposed to the environmental class af the corrosion model developed in guedes soares and garbatov 1999 was calibrated in garbatov et al 2007 garbatov and guedes soares 2008 2010a b to several corrosion data sets three calibrated models are considered here to represent the double side corrosion models the first is for bottom plates environmental class gi the second is for deck plates of cargo tanks environmental class ad and the third is for deck plates of ballast tanks environmental class af as indicated in table 1 iacs defined corrosion wastage allowances to be added to

av rovisco pais lisboa 1049 001 portugal corresponding author 1 presently at the naval architecture and marine engineering department alexandria university egypt corrosion degradation of ship plates is predicted at different ship locations based on limited information on the local environmental conditions the ship spaces are classified according to their chemical and physical characteristics that affect the corrosion behaviour the parameters of the calibrated models expressing the corrosion degradation from both sides of ship plates are used to derive other parameters for corrosion models expressing the corrosion degradation at each side of the corresponding plates the derived models are then used to develop corrosion models for other ship spaces where no real corrosion measurement data are available keywords corrosion degradation wastage allowance corrosion environments 1 introduction the importance of the studies of marine corrosion increased considerably in the last few decades because there is a strong need to predict better the corrosion degradation especially in oil tankers that have been prone to some remarkable disasters statistics for ship hull damages show that around 90 of ship failures are attributed to corrosion including corrosion fatigue emi et al 1991 at the ship design stage the corrosion additions will increase the required net thickness of structural hull members to compensate for the expected thickness reduction during the assumed ship life after commissioning ships are surveyed regularly to examine their condition and any worn structural members are replaced based on a wastage allowance as defined in iacs this wastage allowance depends on the structural member location and orientation it is a function of the physical and chemical characteristics of the space surrounding each structural member several studies have investigated the corrosion phenomenon through regression and statistical analyses of collected data sets yamamoto and ikegami 1998 guedes soares and garbatov 1999 paik et al 2003 sone et al 2003 wang et al 2003a wang et al 2003b garbatov et al 2007 garbatov and guedes soares 2008 ship owner associations and the classification societies collect thickness measurement data and some databases are already available worldwide as reported in tscf 1992 the present study aims to introduce a simplified method to estimate the corrosion degradation in the different ship spaces based on limited information about the environmental conditions in those spaces the different ship spaces are classified according to their main characteristics which affect the corrosion degradation each space will be assumed to have almost a uniform property through it a specific corrosion model is developed for each space based on the available data as the available corrosion data are thickness measurements taken during the surveying periods so this data as well as its corresponding calibrated models will represent the thickness loss from both sides of the structural components the parameters of the available calibrated models will be used to obtain their corresponding parameters of other corrosion models expressing the corrosion degradation at each side of the structural components these single side models will be used as reference ones in order to develop other corrosion models for the other spaces which have not corrosion data available then the corrosion models corresponding to the spaces surrounding each ship panel will be combined in order to obtain a corrosion model representing the corrosion degradation from both sides the developed models based on the present study can be used as reference ones as defined by guedes soares et al 2008 2009 2013 then these reference models can be corrected in order to obtain the corrosion degradation at any time ship space and environmental conditions while in those references the models consider that both sides of a ship plate are subjected to the same type of corrosion the models proposed in this paper account for the real case that many ship plates have different environmental conditions around them thus the two faces of the same plate are subjected to different corrosion mechanisms and have therefore different corrosion rates 2 classification of ship environments the corrosion degradation process is affected by many factors many uncertainties are involved which increases its randomness and so increases the difficulty of deriving a corrosion model solely based on theory the environments surrounding ship structures are complex the deck plating is aggressively attacked by corrosion activated by green water rain and service water collection besides high humidity and oxygen levels and aggressive marine atmosphere the side shell plating is subjected to three different environments the upper part of it is subjected to a harsh atmospheric environment rich with chloride contents oxygen and other corrosive compounds the relative humidity through this part is high beside the sea water spray rising from the ship motion and wave effects but without a significant splash guedes soares et al 2009 studied the effect of relative humidity chlorides and temperature on the corrosion behaviour of ship steel structures that are subjected to marine atmosphere based on a literature review of the previous studies and the analysis performed in guedes soares et al 2009 the factors that have significant effects on the corrosion under marine atmospheric conditions were identified relative humidity rh influences corrosion through its effect on the duration of wetness duration of wetness determines the duration of the electrochemical process uhlig and revie 1985 chlorides in the salt spray are principally responsible for metal corrosion in ocean environments and various studies have proved that ambler and bain 1955 laque 1975 temperature affects the relative humidity the dew point the duration of wetness and the kinetics of the corrosion process for corrosion under atmospheric conditions the presence of moisture as determined by the duration of wetness is probably the most important factor ailor 1982 the lower part of the side shell of the ship is immersed in sea water water properties such as salinity temperature oxygen content ph level and chemical composition can vary according to the ship location and water depth the flow of water around the vessel through this part contributes to accelerated corrosion action this occurs because the water that flows removes the rust deposits from the surface and exposes the fresh base metal to the corrosive agents resulting in a continued corrosion attack between both of the immersed and the atmospheric part of the ship side the side shell plating is subjected to a more aggressive environment this zone is an aerated area because of the turbulence of the sea surface around the ship hull as a result of the interaction between the ship and the sea waves this action increases the oxygen contents of the sea surface layer besides the wear effects arising from the motion of the sea surface against the side shell and the wet and dry effect make this region highly corroded zone the quay contact region on the ship side is also suffering from aggressive corrosion deterioration the contact between the ship side and the fenders on the quay during the birthing period causes wearing to the ship plates and damage to the protective coating this exposes the base metal to the corrosive environment which accelerates the corrosion degradation rates inside ship tanks different corrosive environments also exist the corrosion in the ballast tanks is much different from that in the cargo tanks and both of them are different from the corrosion behaviour in the void spaces of the double bottom double hull and machinery space even inside the same tank the corrosion in the void space above the liquid level is different from that in the immersed part and both are different from the corrosion behaviour in the tank bottom in the ballast tanks the void space above the water level is highly humid rich with chlorides and is affected by the sloshing of the ballast water which makes the corrosion through that region very severe the immersed side and bottom parts of the ballast tank are attacked by corrosion similar to the corrosion under sea water immersion conditions that happens at the external hull of the vessel however the ballast water remains almost stagnant with respect to the tank boundaries while the relative flow of seawater with respect to the external hull of the vessel increases the corrosion attack significant corrosion of structural components in ballast tanks adjacent to heated cargo tanks or tanks with consumables is also possible in cargo tanks the upper region under deck area and part of the side shell suffers more from corrosive gases evaporated from the cargo such as sulphur compound gases and carbon dioxide which have harsh corrosive effects yasunaga et al 2003 the side shell of cargo tanks is usually immersed in crude oil during loading condition the corrosion attack through this region is so dependent on the chemical and physical characteristics of the crude oil for cargo tanks loaded with heavy crude oils a protective waxy film is formed on the side boundary of the tank protecting it from the corrosive environment the protection of this film decreases as the viscosity of the cargo oil decreases until reaching a minimum value in the product tanks at the bottom of the cargo tanks where a lot of sediments water and other impurities accumulate a very corrosive environment develops beside the wear effects resulting from the motion of these impurities against the tank bottom katoh et al 2003 time in ballast or cargo tank washing and inerting for tankers the effectiveness of the corrosion protection systems and component location and orientation have a great effect on the corrosion behaviour an increased degree of the local structural flexibility has been claimed to increase the corrosion rates as the time progresses because of the continuous scale loss these imply that the corrosion models developed on the basis of the statistical analysis of operational data will usually be different according to the ship type and cargo or structural member location and category hence it is important to classify the different spaces surrounding the ship structure based on their physical and chemical characteristics based on this classification it is necessary to develop a corrosion model and to define the most important factors affecting the corrosion degradation for each ship space 3 corrosion modelling usually the available corrosion data represents thickness reduction measurements taken during periodical surveys at different ship lives this reduction represents the corrosion degradation from both sides of the structural members previous studies reported in garbatov et al 2007 garbatov and guedes soares 2008 2009 already performed regression analyses and fitted several data sets for tankers and bulk carriers to the nonlinear function of time corrosion model guedes soares and garbatov 1999 1 d t d 1 e t τ c τ t t τ c 0 t τ c this model is governed by three parameters and represents the long term description of corrosion deterioration under average environmental conditions τ t is the transition time τ c is the coating life and d is the long term corrosion depth long term corrosion depth d is the maximum steady corrosion depth expected after a long period of time as the corrosion process progresses corrosion products rust are accumulated on the surface of the metal if this layer of rust did not flake out and depending on its porous characteristics it can reach to a thickness enough to isolate the substrate from the corrosive agents and then corrosion process stops d is estimated based on the regression analysis and fitting of corrosion depth measurements taken through the ship life for each ship space that has certain environmental and operational characteristics the corrosion degradation model descriptors that are used in the present study are based on two sets of corrosion data for deck plates of ballast and cargo tanks of tankers these data sets were provided by abs 2002 and are analysed in garbatov et al 2007 the first set includes 1168 measurements of deck plates from ballast tanks with original nominal thicknesses varying from 13 5 mm to 35 mm on ships with lengths between perpendiculars in the range of 163 5 401 m the second set of data includes 4665 measurements of deck plates from cargo tanks with original nominal thicknesses varying from 12 7 mm to 35 mm on ships with lengths between perpendiculars in the range of 163 5 401 m the second corrosion data used here is the one presented in garbatov and guedes soares 2008 the long term corrosion wastage d and the period without corrosion or the time of initiation of corrosion τ c and the transition time τ t are defined based on performing a least squares fit to the data using the quasi newton algorithm which determines the direction of search used at each iteration considering the mean value of corrosion depth taken from the yearly subset of data histograms there was some variability of the yearly mean values of the data around the regressed line which was quantified by r2 draper and smith 2014 being between 0 85 and 0 9 in the present study the parameters of the previous calibrated corrosion models for the spaces which have corrosion data are used to derive other parameters for models expressing the corrosion degradation at each side of the structural elements even for the spaces which have not corrosion data then various pairs of these single side models will be combined in order to derive models expressing the corrosion degradation from both sides of each structural component this accounts for the different corrosion rates of the different environmental conditions within ship spaces each pair of the single side models is defined according to the environments on each side of the structural components 3 1 single side corrosion models two main problems are solved here the first is how the parameters of the calibrated double side corrosion models which represent the corrosion degradation from both sides of ship panels can be used to derive the corresponding parameters of the single side models which represent the corrosion degradation at each side of the same panels the second problem is the scarcity of the corrosion data to cover the different ship spaces usually the available calibrated double side corrosion models and their corresponding single side ones are not enough to express the corrosion degradation at the different ship spaces then it is important to develop corrosion models for the different ship spaces based on what is available on the calibrated single side models considering the first problem the long term corrosion depth of the available double side corrosion models will be divided into two parts expressing the long term corrosion depths at each face of ship plates by multiplying it by margin factors for any ship panel the margin factor f i m is defined as the ratio between the corrosion wastage allowance of side i and the summation of the corrosion wastage allowances on both sides as defined by iacs if d w a s i where i 1 2 are the corrosion wastage allowances on each side of the structural member then 2 f i m d w a s i j 1 2 d w a s j then the long term corrosion depth d i of the side i where i 1 2 of the ship panel will be 3 d i f i m d for ship spaces that do not have corrosion data the second problem another space with similar corrosion characteristics will be selected as a reference one then the long term corrosion depth of this reference space single side corrosion will be scaled in order to obtain the long term corrosion depth of the ship space which does not have corrosion data this scale factor will be taken as the ratio between the corrosion wastage allowance of the considered space which has not corrosion data and the corrosion wastage allowance of the reference space if d was i and dwas r i are the corrosion wastage allowances for the considered ship space which has no corrosion data and its corresponding reference one respectively then a scale factor f i s will be defined as 4 f i s d w a s i d w a s r i if d r i is the long term corrosion depth of the reference space then the long term corrosion depth of the considered space will be 5 d i f i s d r i the long term corrosion depth of any space around the ship hull can be obtained in two simple steps the first step is the splitting of the long term corrosion depths of the ship panels which have corrosion data using eqns 2 and 3 the second is the scaling of the resulting long term corrosion depths to the spaces which have not corrosion data using eqns 4 and 5 both of these two steps are performed based on the corrosion wastage allowances as defined by the common structural rules from a statistical point of view the long term corrosion depth expresses a long term mean value while the corrosion wastage allowance specified by iacs expresses an extreme value with a small probability of exceedance both of them are in a direct relation to each other this justify employing the ratio of corrosion wastage allowances in a dividing the long term corrosion depth of the available double side corrosion models into two parts expressing the long term corrosion depths at each side of ship plates b scaling the long term corrosion depth of the reference space in order to obtain the long term corrosion depth of the ship space which does not have corrosion data however both the transition time τt and coating life τ c are not defined till now for ship spaces which do not have corrosion data a regression analysis on corrosion measurements data taken from many ships and covering several spaces around the ship hull have been performed in garbatov et al 2007 garbatov and guedes soares 2008 2009 2010a these studies calibrated the nonlinear corrosion model as presented in guedes soares and garbatov 1999 to these data and defined the model descriptors the data exhibits a large scatter reflecting the nature of the problem as this is data from many ships that are subjected to various environmental conditions and thus the variability is unavoidable a single exponential smoothing has been employed here the new smoother transition time as a function of the long term corrosion depth is estimated by using the previously estimated as well as the previous actual value with a weighting or smoothing factor α the smoothing factor α can never to be greater than 1 and higher values of α put more weight on the most recent estimates the estimated transition time for the i t h estimation of τ t i is given as easton and mccoll 1997 6 τ t i α a i 1 1 α α a i 2 1 α 2 α a i 3 1 α 3 τ t i 3 where τ t i 1 α a i 2 1 α τ t i 2 is the estimated i 1 value a i 1 is the actual demand for i 1 the standard error or mean square error after smoothing is performed is 5 2 which is the minimum error that can be estimated for the smoothing factor α 0 278 based on the smoothed transition time a regression analysis is performed in order to develop a relationship between the transition time τ t and the long term corrosion depth d according to this analysis the following relationship is obtained fig 1 7 τ t 7 59 ln d 15 29 in this study it will be shown that accounting for the specific environmental conditions is able to reduce the spread significantly since the long term corrosion depth d for any space around the ship hull is now defined then by substitution d in eqn 7 the corresponding transition time can be estimated however in the present study the coating life τ c for any space is assumed to be the same as the corresponding one of the reference space the coating life of the reference space which expresses the coating effectiveness for single side corrosion will be assumed the same as the corresponding one of the double side corrosion model a margin of error can be produced from the assumption that both the target space and its reference one have the same coating life however in order to reduce this error it is important for these spaces to have similar environmental and operational characteristics and so a similar corrosion and coating effectiveness behavior in case of more precise data about the coating effectiveness life is available from the manufacturer this can be used instead of the value of the reference space 3 2 double side corrosion models ship plates act as boundaries between two spaces that can have similar or different corrosion characteristics hence the different ship plates can be classified according to their surrounding environments according to this classification the reduction in the thickness of any ship plate will equal to the summation of the corrosion depths of each side 8 d 12 t d 1 t d 2 t d 1 1 e t τ c 1 τ t 1 d 2 1 e t τ c 2 τ t 2 t τ c 1 τ c 2 d 1 1 e t τ

represents the other side and 12 represents both sides 4 application example this numerical example illustrates how to predict the corrosion degradation models for the different ship panels based on limited corrosion data the ship used for this purpose is a double hull tanker the structural arrangements longitudinal divisions and stiffening are as indicated by the mid ship section in fig 2 left the different ship environments or spaces can be classified according to their physical chemical and operational characteristics that affect the corrosion deterioration ship spaces that have similar environmental characteristics will usually have similar corrosion degradation and will belong to the same class this is similar to what was considered in iacs 2010 for the definition of the corrosion wastage allowances for the structural members in the different ship spaces based on this classification the different environments around the mid ship section will be as demonstrated in fig 2 right where each environment is indicated by an alphabetical letter each ship plate is exposed to two environments one at each side where they can be different or similar hence in the present example two alphabetical letters are used to indicate the environments around each plate as an example deck plates are exposed to the environmental class ad inside crude oil tanks while inside ballast tanks deck plates are exposed to the environmental class af the corrosion model developed in guedes soares and garbatov 1999 was calibrated in garbatov et al 2007 garbatov and guedes soares 2008 2010a b to several corrosion data sets three calibrated models are considered here to represent the double side corrosion models the first is for bottom plates environmental class gi the second is for deck plates of cargo tanks environmental class ad and the third is for deck plates of ballast tanks environmental class af as indicated in table 1 iacs defined corrosion wastage allowances to be added to the structural components at the different ship spaces these corrosion allowances are defined based on the previous corrosion degradation history of the structural component under certain

23244,for the conventional fin stabilizer its practical anti rolling effect is difficult to reach the theoretical design in order to solve this problem the reasons of system error are analyzed and then the uncertain factors of system are discussed a new lift feedback control system is designed and the improved advantage is analyzed for reducing the nonlinear error of feedback a new fin axis mechanism is designed which can directly detect actual lift however lift is difficult to detect which could be transformed into displacement easily measured through deduction of timoshenko beam theory then quantitative relation is established between lift and displacement and the main influencing factors are analyzed the effectiveness of lift feedback control system is verified by fin axis strain simulation and pid control simulation in view of the fin stabilizer system with uncertainties the compensation of system is needed the rbf neural network is applied to estimate the uncertainties lyapunov equation is adopted to satisfy the stability conditions the adaptive law is designed to improve the system accuracy rbf neural network can identify system model error on line which can guarantee the stability of closed loop system the simulations demonstrate the design of control strategy can effectively improve anti rolling effect keywords ship fin stabilizer lift feedback control system roll reduction adaptive control rbf neural network compensation anti rolling effect 1 introduction fin stabilizer is one of the most widely used active ship anti rolling devices through the sensors measuring ship roll and fin angle electro hydraulic servo system drives the fin to rotate in control mode according to feedback of ship s attitude the fin stabilizer is constantly adjusting fin angle which uses control moment produced by hydrodynamic force to resist sea wave disturbance thus ship roll can be reduced t perez and goodwin 2008 lh liang and sun 2015a b w fan et al 2009 the key to anti rolling performance of fin stabilizers depends on its control system and hydrodynamic characteristics of fin on the basis of determining shape structure of fin excellent control system and control strategy are designed to give full play to its hydrodynamic characteristics and improve anti rolling effect the theoretical effect of fin stabilizers can be more than 90 however since many interference factors make system error too large actual effect can not reach the theoretical index w fan et al 2009 w bai et al 2013 there are two main reasons for the errors firstly whether the system feedback is accurate i e whether measuring hydrodynamic force of fin is true or not secondly whether control system structure is reasonable and control strategy is effective therefore aiming at system errors of fin stabilizers the control system with nonlinearity and uncertainty and the disturbance in engineering application should be considered especially there is bigger error in the feedback of conventional fin stabilizers it is mainly because the feedback information is indirectly calculated through fin angle which can not reflect real demand because the control moment is actually generated by lift from dynamic hydrodynamic force however the marine environment is rough and installation problem of sensors is considered in practical engineering it is extremely difficult to detect directly actual lift lh liang and sun 2015a b jg song et al 2015 z liu and jin 2013 as a result fin angle feedback control is generally adopted in conventional fin stabilizers since the simple and reliable measuring device located in the interior of hull is convenient for maintenance and replacement nevertheless in fin angle feedback theoretical value of lift is approximately calculated with fin angle based on ideal constant hydrodynamic force actually the dynamic hydrodynamic force is much more complicated than that of the corresponding static v anantha subramanian et al 2007 lh liang and sun 2017a b c d in addition the relationship is seriously nonlinear and uncertain between fin angle and actual lift due to interaction of fins bilge keels and hull induces mc fang et al 2010 lh liang and sun 2017a b c d therefore there is a big error between theoretical value and actual value of lift it is a difficult problem to be solved how to replace theoretical value with actual value nowadays lift feedback control of fin stabilizers is still an emerging research according to the theory of vibration thin wing the relationship is studied between fin angle and lift moment lh liang and sun 2016a b the dynamic hydrodynamic model is established based on theodorsen theory and fin angle is converted to lift as feedback in ship roll model lh liang and sun 2017a b c d but the effect of vibration is only considered for the specific fin type so there is no universal in hz jin et al 2012 the hydrodynamic model of fin stabilizers is improved however it is only limited at zero speed status the lift feedback control of fin stabilizers at full speed is discussed jg song et al 2014 lift and fin angle integrated control is carried out for lift feedback control system of fin stabilizers lh liang and sun 2017a b c d however it has not put forward a practical method to measure lift directly in essence theoretical calculation of lift is carried out in the above studies which are not a direct measure of the real lift therefore it is difficult to avoid the feedback error the deviation signal can be obtained by measuring lift directly as feedback and dynamic lift required for anti rolling in real time fin is driven by deviation signal until the desired lift is reached which can avoid the error between actual value and theoretical value of lift d shuji et al 2007 l liang and sun 2017a b c d the most direct detection method is given in jg song et al 2014 massive force sensors are installed on fin surface and then lift is obtained by superposition of infinitesimal but sensors are easily damaged in waves and difficult to maintain hence specialized measuring device is designed according to specific characteristics of fin stabilizers japanese mitsubishi proposed to install pressure sensors in hydraulic servo system of driving fin rotation lift is measured with hydrodynamic pressure center of fin the changes are few in this way and maintenance of device is easy d shuji et al 2007 however the required parameters are nonlinear which are related to fin type angle angular velocity and ship speed lh liang and sun 2015a b british rolls royce designed strain gauge in cross shaft of fin stabilizers and loading force of strain gauge is converted to lift the shortcoming is its special position and the vulnerability of strain gauge maintenance is costly since ship must be docking in demand of maintenance the method is not universal which is only suitable for retractable fin stabilizers c ivan f et al 2008 so the further study is needed finally research institute of ship anti rolling and control proposes a measuring lift method using bearing load lh liang and sun 2016a b 2017a b c d the micro install and pressure sensors are installed in the box of fin stabilizers while processing and assembling precisions are very high and special sensors are needed be designed thus implementation was not easy to achieve in practice in addition to the above system feedback the control strategy should also be improved mainly due to the design of conventional fin stabilizers based on conolly linear roll model the serious nonlinear and uncertain factors are neglected m a santos neves et al 2003 to sum up there are two problems firstly real ship model exists serious nonlinearity secondly some parameters are uncertain m taylan 2000 s chakrabarti 2001 these factors can be attributed to the nonlinear and uncertain problems of the damping moment and restoring moment in the rolling motion mc fang and luo 2007 m taylan 2007 in practical engineering application pid controller is usually adopted in the control system of fin stabilizers the structure of pid controller is simple and it is high reliability however its design depends on the exact model while the rolling frequency damping coefficient and loading conditions and other variable parameters can directly affect the control effect mc fang et al 2012 in order to make up these defects some improvement methods are put forward such as using intelligent algorithms to optimize pid parameters designing variable parameter pid controller robust pid and other control algorithms etc these methods are used to solve the problem of system such as time variety parameters and its uncertainty nonlinearity and so on lh liang and sun 2015a b mc fang et al 2010 2012 besides the robust control neural network and fuzzy logic and other intelligent control methods are introduced into the controller design jc yin et al 2013 m a hinostroza et al 2015 in a j koshkouei and nowak 2012 the variable parameter optimal controller is proposed which can effectively improve anti rolling effect at the different speeds wave heights and wave directions in s surendran et al 2007 single neuron control is adopted to improve the overall system performance of fin stabilizers refs gh xia et al 2016a b 2017a b the fuzzy logic adaptive controller for fin stabilizers is designed and good results are obtained in the non specific sea conditions the pid control and sliding mode control are compared under the condition of changing sea conditions in lh liang and sun 2015a 2015b in mc fang et al 2010 2012 the effects of classical pid control optimal pid control and robust control on ship performance are discussed the results show that the pid control is satisfied with the specified speeds and wave directions in j song et al 2014 constrained model predictive control is applied to solve the dynamic stall of fin stabilizers by estimation of effective fin angle and saturation constraint on line in w bai et al 2013 pid control parameters are transformed into three weights of single neuron and the weights are adjusted dynamically in gq xia et al 2015 the neural network supervisory control algorithm is indicated and the complex nonlinear factors of fin stabilizer are distributed in the network weights the weights are adjusted online to improve anti rolling capability of fin stabilizers with multi sea conditions and multi speeds in jg song et al 2015 gq xia et al 2016a b 2017a b xia and luan 2018 the application of self organizing fuzzy controller and self tuning fuzzy controller in fin stabilizer system is presented these studies improve the system performance however they are only aimed at the improvement of control strategy and no attention to the larger error of feedback on this basis a new method is designed to detect the actual lift by improving conventional fin stabilizers it is done as the system feedback which is simple and practical the adaptive controller of lift feedback control system is designed by applying rbf neural network compensation strategy this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the control system and error reasons of fin stabilizers are analyzed and then a new lift feedback control system is developed in section 3 a new lift detection method is applied to solve the system feedback error in section 4 for control system with nonlinearity and uncertainty an adaptive controller based on rbf neural network compensation is designed in section 5 simulation results and discussion are proposed finally conclusions are given 2 analysis and design of system 2 1 roll model according to conolly theory the nonlinear roll model of a ship equipped with the fin stabilizer is approximated to 1 i x δ i x d 2 θ d t 2 n 1 d θ d t n 2 d θ d t d θ d t g 1 θ g 3 θ 3 g 5 θ 5 k ω k c where i x δ i x d 2 θ d t 2 is inertia moment of a ship n 1 d θ d t n 2 d θ d t d θ d t is damping moment of a ship g 1 θ g 3 θ 3 g 5 θ 5 is restoring moment k ω is disturbance moment of waves k c is control moment of the fin stabilizer ideally if the disturbance moment is completely offset by control moment the roll motion of the ship is stopped therefore the accurate control moment is the key of roll reduction while control moment need to be determined according to the disturbance of waves but the motion of waves is a complex irregular random movement and the marine environment is extremely bad thus how to accurately and effectively detect the actual hydrodynamic force is a difficult problem in the dynamic hydrodynamic force of fins lift is the real factor of roll reduction lift line is perpendicular to the relative velocity of current and the axis of fins since the fin arrangement is symmetrical when the lift of one side fin is upward the lift of the other side fin is down so the control moment can be expressed as 2 k c 2 l α l α where l α is the lift on a fin l α is the arm of control moment thus the control problem of fin stabilizers is transformed into how to accurately detect the actual lift the ship equipped with a pair of fin stabilizers is shown in fig 1 2 2 system error analysis 2 2 1 feedback error according to the calculation theory of force coefficient of fin in viscous fluid t perez and goodwin 2008 2010 when fins and water flow into a fixed angle lift approximation is kept constant which is shown as follow 3 l α 1 2 ρ v 2 a c 0 1 a 2 a 0 1 k α where c 0 4 μ a 0 ρ v 2 k tan β α a 0 2 a 0 θ 0 δ 1 θ 0 arctan v cos α 2 a 0 arctan μ 2 a 0 a 2 2 a 0 n π δ 1 n 0 1 2 ρ is fluid density v is fluid velocity a is the projection area of fins c l α is defined as lift coefficient then 4 c l α c 0 1 a 2 a 0 1 k α from eq 2 and eq 4 before the fin stall lift coefficient control moment coefficient and fin angle are linear in practical engineering the system of fin stabilizer is designed according to this kind of linear relation but in fact the dynamic hydrodynamic characteristics of fins are very complex naca0015 fin type is chosen to carry out hydrodynamic experiments model parameters are shown in table 1 the experimental results and experimental status table are shown in fig 2 and table 2 fig 2 shows that the dynamic relationship between lift coefficient control moment coefficient and fin angle is not an ideal linear relationship while it presents a closed curve there is large error between theoretical value and actual value i e the large error exists in the feedback therefore the fin stabilizer is difficult to resist wave disturbance moment which will definitely reduce the anti rolling effect 2 2 1 control error in practical application conolly linear roll model of ship is adopted in pid control but the model is simplified as follows 1 assume that the roll motion of the hull is independent and there are not coupling factors and other degrees of freedom motion 2 assume that ship width is much smaller than wave length 3 internal pressure field of waves is not affected by ship but in fact the motion of a ship in the ocean waves is a complex six degree of freedom movement in which there is a certain degree of coupling among the roll sway and yaw and internal pressure field is not ideal owing to the existence of the ship so ship will have a certain impact on the internal pressure field the rolling period of conolly model 5 t φ 2 π d s h i p h s h i p i x x δ i x x where d s h i p is the displacement of the ship h s h i p is the metacentric height of the ship the dimensionless damping coefficient 6 n μ n μ d s h i p h s h i p i x x δ i x x for different types of ships t φ and n μ are different because of the different design parameters due to the complex shape of ship and the interaction between ship and waves i x and δ i x are empirical or experimental formulas to determine so t φ is uncertain and changeable in addition n μ and n u and also relevant while n u is related to the hull shape loading condition roll frequency roll amplitude flow field around hull water viscosity and so on as a result there is serious nonlinearity and uncertainty in the system of fin stabilizer 2 3 lift feedback control system design 2 3 1 system structure because it is different in the control principle for new lift feedback fin stabilizer and conventional fin angle feedback fin stabilizer there is a difference in the system structure the structure of lift feedback fin stabilizer comprises three parts integrated controller electro hydraulic servo system and ship state feedback part as shown in fig 3 2 3 2 working process when the ship is subjected to the action of wave disturbance moment the sensors of state feedback part can measure roll angle roll velocity and roll acceleration the signals are input to data processor and they are adjusted calculated and amplified and then they are transmitted to integrated controller as input quantity in the integrated controller the signal is calculated by control strategy and the lift that needed for fin stabilizers to counter wave moment in real time is obtained which is used as the control signal input to servo system the lift control signal is converted to the instruction of turning fin by angle amplifier which is transmitted to electro hydraulic servo valve the hydraulic cylinder drives fin to rotate for the corresponding angle due to the effect of fluid dynamics the control moment is generated to resist disturbance moment by fin at the same time the actual lift is measured directly by lift sensor which is transmitted to servo system controller as a feedback signal 2 3 3 improved advantage in control form the lift feedback fin stabilizer is similar to fin angle feedback fin stabilizer but there are essential differences which are mainly reflected in the following aspects 1 the output of controller is lift which is the direct control of the ship s control command instead of indirect fin angle command 2 the effect of speed sensitivity adjuster is different in the fin angle feedback system the speed sensitivity adjustment is generally placed in the output circuit of controller and its function is to ensure the stability in the same roll state and the speed of lift feedback system is as an input signal of controller the output of controller is detected by speed sensitivity adjustment which ensures that the output command is always realized so the system can be guaranteed to work properly 3 the wave sensitivity adjuster can limit the saturation rate of the system to the maximum stable moment which can avoid the wear of mechanical devices 3 design and analysis of lift feedback the feedback error of conventional fin stabilizer leads to the bottleneck of anti rolling performance only control system improved by control algorithm can not eliminate the feedback error therefore from practical engineering point of view the study of fin stabilizers should seek effective lift feedback method based on dynamic hydrodynamic force 3 1 mechanism design of detecting lift during the last decades the conventional fin stabilizer has excellent reliability by verification on various ship types since detecting lift is achieved by improving the conventional fin axis mechanism the new system can inherit the practicality and reliability of conventional fin stabilizers and make up its deficiency the design of new hollow fin axis mechanism is shown in fig 4 1 fin axis is hollow inside with 4 solid axis core the outer of 4 solid axis core and 1 fin axis are fixed and the two rotate together 1 fin axis is mounted in the 3 cabinet and 5 angular contact roller bearing and 12 spherical roller bearing constitute two supports for fin axis 3 cabinet is welded to the hull bilge 1 fin axis located inside the hull portion and 11 rocker arm are fixed and its outer end installs fin with 13 fin sleeve 11 rocker arm connects hydraulic servo system so that 1 fin axis is rotated by the set control mode the inside of 1 fin axis is mounted detachable 7 axis end cover along the normal and tangential 6 9 two non contact displacement sensors are installed inside of 7 axis end cover 8 fin angle sensor is mounted on the 1 fin axis since 7 axis end cover is detachable and located within the hull its installation maintenance and replacement is easy 3 2 fin axis stress analysis since 5 angular contact roller bearing and 12 spherical roller bearing can be simplified into two simple pivots the b c of 1 fin axis can be approximately equivalent to a simply supported beam in the outer part of 12 spherical roller bearing 1 fin axis is vacant so the c e of 1 fin axis can be seen as a cantilever since 4 solid axis core is fixed at point d its a d is a cantilever in 1 fin axis thus the overall structure of mechanism is approximately combination simply supported beam and cantilever the simplified form of fin axis mechanism is shown in fig 5 when fin is rotated in wave fin axis can occur slight bending in the hydrodynamic effect the modification at e point of fin axis will lead d point deformed which will make axis core upward in the fin axis since the space of fin axis is large enough the upward of axis core is not restricted the upward of the a d axis core like a lever which makes the turning angle of d point transform into the displacement h a of a point through the structure relation here section inertia i d at d point is 7 i d π d 4 d 4 64 where d is outer diameter of fin axis d is corresponding inner diameter 3 3 strain analysis withtimoshenko beam theory according to timoshenko beam theory the beam cross section of a differential length d x is analyzed at the initial state assuming the cross section of the beam is flat under the action of shear bending it is no longer perpendicular to the neutral axis rotation terms produced by shear force is β as shown in fig 6 at the point x the total deflection of beam consists of two parts one part is caused by bending deformation and the other part is caused by shear force thus the slope of deflection curve is given by eq 8 8 d v d x φ x β x φ x and β x are the rotations caused by bending moment and shear force respectively assuming that line deflection and angular deflection are small the relationship between bending moment and curvature is 9 m x e i d φ x d x the relationship between shear force and shear strain is given by eq 10 10 v x k s a g β x the shear strain of beam is as follows 11 γ y z d v d x φ according to fig 6 eq 12 and eq 13 can be obtained 12 w d x d v 0 13 σ m 0 v d x d m w x d x d x 2 0 eq 14 can be obtained by eq 8 eq 9 eq 10 eq 12 and eq 13 14 d d x k s a g d v d x φ w it is assumed that the transverse displacement along beam element length is 15 v x a 1 x 3 a 2 x 2 a 3 x a 4 because each node of the beam has a lateral displacement v i and a small turning angle φ i thus the cubic displacement function is represented by 4 degrees of freedom in eq 15 it can satisfy the basic bending theory of beam at the same time the displacement and rotation angle of the joint can also be established the cross cutting strain γ is consistent with the three degree polynomial of v x then 16 γ c eq 17 can be obtained by eq 1 eq 9 eq 10 and eq 13 17 c 6 a 1 g where g e i k s a g k s a is the shear area k s a varies with the shape of the cross section according to eq 15 φ is expressed as a polynomial with x 18 φ a 3 2

32 first factor is structure length of fin axis each part l i second factor is material of fin axis which is determined by modulus of elasticity e third factor is section inertia of fin axis i d which is determined by shape and size of cross section i d is determined by outside diameter d and inside diameter d because section of fin axis is circular h a should be as large as possible in order to reduce resolution requirement and selection difficulty of sensors there are three ways to increase h a as main factors 1 length of fin axis is increased l 2 l 3 and l 4 are related to structural strength if they are changed the intensity should be reconsidered as a result l 2 l 3 and l 4 can t be easily changed however l 1 is the suspended part of axis core l 1 stretches to hull which does not affect structural strength l 1 can be properly increased if the space of cabin is enough 2 modulus of elasticity e is reduced modulus of elasticity e is determined by material material with small modulus of elasticity is selected on the basis of ensuring structural strength 3 section inertia i d is reduced outer diameter d is reduced or inner diameter d is increased on the basis of ensuring structural strength the changes can make smaller section inertia of cross section i d 4 design of adaptive control based on rbf neural network compensation 4 1 system description the uncertain system

is set to model 2 3 alloy structural steel a i s i 5150 of model 1 is replaced with engineering synthetic resins a b s in order to compare obviously its modulus of elasticity e is 2495 9 n m m 2 and the other parameters are unchanged which is set to model 3 4 inner diameter is increased to 200 m m so section inertia of cross section i d is decreased the other parameters are fixed which is set to model 4 5 the fin axis of conventional fin stabilizer is used for reference and its diameter is 150 m m the other parameters are fixed which is set to model 5 the finite element simulation analysis is carried out according to the given quantitative relation and the simulation of the model 1 is shown in fig 7 the simulation results of the displacement at the core axis end in each model as shown in table 4 as can be seen from table 4 the design of the fin axis structure and lift detection method is effective which proves the accuracy of the quantitative relationship between lift and displacement three main factors affecting displacement is structure length l i modulus of elasticity e and section inertia of cross section i d one of them is changed the result is changed correspondingly and the rationality of the analysis is verified in the later stage of engineering application the specific calibration and correction of the theoretical deduction can be made to further reduce the error and make it closer to the actual situation the comparison between model 1 and model 5 can be obtained as follows the advantage of fin axis mechanism designed is that it can directly measure the actual lift which can overcome the error caused by the estimate of fin angle disadvantage is the fin axis is made thicker and it takes up valuable space due to the hollow in order to ensure the strength requirements at the same time the deflection of fin axis becomes larger so the fatigue degree and the sealing property of the material are required higher while the advantage of the conventional fin axis is the processing is easy and the difficulty of sealing is relatively low disadvantage is lift need be estimated by fin angle which causes the feedback error of the control system 5 2 main parameters and comparison steps a fin stabilizer system of a certain ship is as an example the simulation results are verified by simulation here the ittc single parameter spectrum is applied to simulate the wave motion and the model is conolly nonlinear model the main parameters are shown in table 5 as can be seen from table 5 and eq 1 the nominal model of fin stabilizer is 73 d 2 θ d t 2 0

of fin angle feedback control system and lift feedback control system the improved pid controller in practical engineering is adopted 2 for lift feedback control system control strategies are compared and analyzed design of rbf neural network compensation adaptive control and pid control is used to carry out simulation 5 3 comparative analysis of control systems as a comparison the improved pid control strategy is proposed in the simulation which is usually used in practical engineering under the same conditions the simulation of fin angle feedback control system and lift feedback control system is studied here the pid controller of fin angle feedback system is 74 α p i d s k i 1 t i s 1 k d t d 1 s t d 1 s 1 t d 2 s 1 k p φ s according to the fin angle feedback system the pid controller of the lift feedback system is shown in the following 75 l p i d s k i l 1 t i s 1 k d l t d 1 s t d 1 s 1 t d 2 s 1 k p l φ s in the fin angle feedback control the constraint condition is α 22 d e g since the hydrodynamic characteristics of fin and the power of servo system are considered in lift feedback control in the high sea conditions when the speed is low the fin angle will appear saturation phenomenon when the speed is higher the fin angle is not saturated with the power of the system to reach the limit therefore in practical applications the fin angle and lift are required to be restricted according to the experimental results of fin in the water tank in the lift feedback control system the fin angle constraint is α 22 d e g and the lift constraint is l 2 20 e 5 n when the wave direction is 45 the simulation is carried out as an example the results of experimental and simulated roll angle disturbance moment in the open loop and roll angle control moment of fin angle feedback control and lift feedback control are shown in fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8 both of the fin angle feedback control system and lift feedback control system can reduce roll motion fin angle feedback control system can make the roll angle limit to 1 while lift feedback control system can make the roll angle limit to 0 5 comparison experimental roll angle disturbance moment and simulated roll angle disturbance moment in the open loop experimental results are slightly larger than the simulation results however the deviation is within a reasonable range the reason for this phenomenon is that the experiment is restricted by the smaller experimental tank and device and it is difficult to fully simulate the state of the ship in the real environment the simulation of anti rolling in different waves and the calculation of anti rolling effect are shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 in the different wave directions lift feedback control system and fin angle feedback control system are compared and the former is better further shows the effectiveness of the fin axis mechanism designed in this paper the actual lift is more accurate than the fin angle estimation the lift directly detected is used as the feedback of control system which enables the fin to be not affected by the changing direction of the local flow so that it can change the fin angle according to the real needs meanwhile it can avoid entering the cavity area and prevent the lift generated by system can not reach or exceed the desired lift occasionally and then the situation of over anti rolling or less anti rolling for fin stabilizer can be avoided which can improve the rolling efficiency reduce the system energy consumption and prolong the life of the equipment rbf neural network compensation adaptive control is used to carry out simulation and the simulation results are shown in table 6 table 6 shows that the rolling mean values of pid controller are 0 25 1 72 and the anti rolling effects are 81 05 94 07 while the rolling mean values of rbf neural network compensation adaptive controller are 0 12 1 49 and the anti rolling effects are 83 52 97 86 comparison of rbf neural network compensation adaptive control and pid control the former can significantly reduce the nonlinear and uncertain influence of system and improve the anti rolling effect by comparison it is known that the design of rbf neural network compensation adaptive controller is suitable for lift feedback control system 6 conclusions the control system and control strategy of new lift feedback fin stabilizer are verified based on the comparative analysis of conventional fin stabilizers the following conclusions are obtained 1 the quantitative relationship between lift and displacement are presented by using timoshenko beam theory to deduce for the design of fin axis mechanism timoshenko beam matrix makes the flexural properties of fin axis digital which provides theoretical support for engineering application the validity of quantitative relation and the influence of main factors are proved based on the design parameters of an actual fin stabilizer which expand the selection range of sensors 2 it is convenient and practical for design of detachable axis cover and sensor installation at the same time closed space is formed to avoid external interference non contact displacement sensors are used to detect relative displacement which is difficult to damage and universal 3 for new lift feedback control system the improved pid control is applied by simulating and contrasting fin angle feedback control system which verifies the effectiveness of new system the tracking performance of new system is obtained by designing rbf neural network compensator which compensates nonlinear and uncertain part of the real system 4 in the field of ship motion control several widely is used active hydrofoils for roll reduction include fin rudder and so on while directly and accurately detecting dynamic hydrodynamics force is a universal problem the design in this paper can be provided reference for improving the axis of other hydrofoils in actual engineering the control deviation of fin stabilizer is mainly caused by two aspects internal causes and external causes for internal causes one is the influence of the nonlinear part in the rolling model the conventional control strategy often ignores the nonlinear links moreover in order to prevent the dynamic stall of the fin stabilizer and ensure the safety of the actuators the constraints are usually set up the constraints of the conventional fin stabilizers are difficult to make full use of lift as shown in fig 10 for external causes the fin stabilizers and ship are strongly disturbed by wind wave and current so they are difficult to predict accurately when designing fin stabilizers the system feedback and controller are mainly improved to reduce internal interference in this paper the future research will focus on the prediction and estimation of external disturbance and improve the utilization rate of lift conflicts of interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests

23244,for the conventional fin stabilizer its practical anti rolling effect is difficult to reach the theoretical design in order to solve this problem the reasons of system error are analyzed and then the uncertain factors of system are discussed a new lift feedback control system is designed and the improved advantage is analyzed for reducing the nonlinear error of feedback a new fin axis mechanism is designed which can directly detect actual lift however lift is difficult to detect which could be transformed into displacement easily measured through deduction of timoshenko beam theory then quantitative relation is established between lift and displacement and the main influencing factors are analyzed the effectiveness of lift feedback control system is verified by fin axis strain simulation and pid control simulation in view of the fin stabilizer system with uncertainties the compensation of system is needed the rbf neural network is applied to estimate the uncertainties lyapunov equation is adopted to satisfy the stability conditions the adaptive law is designed to improve the system accuracy rbf neural network can identify system model error on line which can guarantee the stability of closed loop system the simulations demonstrate the design of control strategy can effectively improve anti rolling effect keywords ship fin stabilizer lift feedback control system roll reduction adaptive control rbf neural network compensation anti rolling effect 1 introduction fin stabilizer is one of the most widely used active ship anti rolling devices through the sensors measuring ship roll and fin angle electro hydraulic servo system drives the fin to rotate in control mode according to feedback of ship s attitude the fin stabilizer is constantly adjusting fin angle which uses control moment produced by hydrodynamic force to resist sea wave disturbance thus ship roll can be reduced t perez and goodwin 2008 lh liang and sun 2015a b w fan et al 2009 the key to anti rolling performance of fin stabilizers depends on its control system and hydrodynamic characteristics of fin on the basis of determining shape structure of fin excellent control system and control strategy are designed to give full play to its hydrodynamic characteristics and improve anti rolling effect the theoretical effect of fin stabilizers can be more than 90 however since many interference factors make system error too large actual effect can not reach the theoretical index w fan et al 2009 w bai et al 2013 there are two main reasons for the errors firstly whether the system feedback is accurate i e whether measuring hydrodynamic force of fin is true or not secondly whether control system structure is reasonable and control strategy is effective therefore aiming at system errors of fin stabilizers the control system with nonlinearity and uncertainty and the disturbance in engineering application should be considered especially there is bigger error in the feedback of conventional fin stabilizers it is mainly because the feedback information is indirectly calculated through fin angle which can not reflect real demand because the control moment is actually generated by lift from dynamic hydrodynamic force however the marine environment is rough and installation problem of sensors is considered in practical engineering it is extremely difficult to detect directly actual lift lh liang and sun 2015a b jg song et al 2015 z liu and jin 2013 as a result fin angle feedback control is generally adopted in conventional fin stabilizers since the simple and reliable measuring device located in the interior of hull is convenient for maintenance and replacement nevertheless in fin angle feedback theoretical value of lift is approximately calculated with fin angle based on ideal constant hydrodynamic force actually the dynamic hydrodynamic force is much more complicated than that of the corresponding static v anantha subramanian et al 2007 lh liang and sun 2017a b c d in addition the relationship is seriously nonlinear and uncertain between fin angle and actual lift due to interaction of fins bilge keels and hull induces mc fang et al 2010 lh liang and sun 2017a b c d therefore there is a big error between theoretical value and actual value of lift it is a difficult problem to be solved how to replace theoretical value with actual value nowadays lift feedback control of fin stabilizers is still an emerging research according to the theory of vibration thin wing the relationship is studied between fin angle and lift moment lh liang and sun 2016a b the dynamic hydrodynamic model is established based on theodorsen theory and fin angle is converted to lift as feedback in ship roll model lh liang and sun 2017a b c d but the effect of vibration is only considered for the specific fin type so there is no universal in hz jin et al 2012 the hydrodynamic model of fin stabilizers is improved however it is only limited at zero speed status the lift feedback control of fin stabilizers at full speed is discussed jg song et al 2014 lift and fin angle integrated control is carried out for lift feedback control system of fin stabilizers lh liang and sun 2017a b c d however it has not put forward a practical method to measure lift directly in essence theoretical calculation of lift is carried out in the above studies which are not a direct measure of the real lift therefore it is difficult to avoid the feedback error the deviation signal can be obtained by measuring lift directly as feedback and dynamic lift required for anti rolling in real time fin is driven by deviation signal until the desired lift is reached which can avoid the error between actual value and theoretical value of lift d shuji et al 2007 l liang and sun 2017a b c d the most direct detection method is given in jg song et al 2014 massive force sensors are installed on fin surface and then lift is obtained by superposition of infinitesimal but sensors are easily damaged in waves and difficult to maintain hence specialized measuring device is designed according to specific characteristics of fin stabilizers japanese mitsubishi proposed to install pressure sensors in hydraulic servo system of driving fin rotation lift is measured with hydrodynamic pressure center of fin the changes are few in this way and maintenance of device is easy d shuji et al 2007 however the required parameters are nonlinear which are related to fin type angle angular velocity and ship speed lh liang and sun 2015a b british rolls royce designed strain gauge in cross shaft of fin stabilizers and loading force of strain gauge is converted to lift the shortcoming is its special position and the vulnerability of strain gauge maintenance is costly since ship must be docking in demand of maintenance the method is not universal which is only suitable for retractable fin stabilizers c ivan f et al 2008 so the further study is needed finally research institute of ship anti rolling and control proposes a measuring lift method using bearing load lh liang and sun 2016a b 2017a b c d the micro install and pressure sensors are installed in the box of fin stabilizers while processing and assembling precisions are very high and special sensors are needed be designed thus implementation was not easy to achieve in practice in addition to the above system feedback the control strategy should also be improved mainly due to the design of conventional fin stabilizers based on conolly linear roll model the serious nonlinear and uncertain factors are neglected m a santos neves et al 2003 to sum up there are two problems firstly real ship model exists serious nonlinearity secondly some parameters are uncertain m taylan 2000 s chakrabarti 2001 these factors can be attributed to the nonlinear and uncertain problems of the damping moment and restoring moment in the rolling motion mc fang and luo 2007 m taylan 2007 in practical engineering application pid controller is usually adopted in the control system of fin stabilizers the structure of pid controller is simple and it is high reliability however its design depends on the exact model while the rolling frequency damping coefficient and loading conditions and other variable parameters can directly affect the control effect mc fang et al 2012 in order to make up these defects some improvement methods are put forward such as using intelligent algorithms to optimize pid parameters designing variable parameter pid controller robust pid and other control algorithms etc these methods are used to solve the problem of system such as time variety parameters and its uncertainty nonlinearity and so on lh liang and sun 2015a b mc fang et al 2010 2012 besides the robust control neural network and fuzzy logic and other intelligent control methods are introduced into the controller design jc yin et al 2013 m a hinostroza et al 2015 in a j koshkouei and nowak 2012 the variable parameter optimal controller is proposed which can effectively improve anti rolling effect at the different speeds wave heights and wave directions in s surendran et al 2007 single neuron control is adopted to improve the overall system performance of fin stabilizers refs gh xia et al 2016a b 2017a b the fuzzy logic adaptive controller for fin stabilizers is designed and good results are obtained in the non specific sea conditions the pid control and sliding mode control are compared under the condition of changing sea conditions in lh liang and sun 2015a 2015b in mc fang et al 2010 2012 the effects of classical pid control optimal pid control and robust control on ship performance are discussed the results show that the pid control is satisfied with the specified speeds and wave directions in j song et al 2014 constrained model predictive control is applied to solve the dynamic stall of fin stabilizers by estimation of effective fin angle and saturation constraint on line in w bai et al 2013 pid control parameters are transformed into three weights of single neuron and the weights are adjusted dynamically in gq xia et al 2015 the neural network supervisory control algorithm is indicated and the complex nonlinear factors of fin stabilizer are distributed in the network weights the weights are adjusted online to improve anti rolling capability of fin stabilizers with multi sea conditions and multi speeds in jg song et al 2015 gq xia et al 2016a b 2017a b xia and luan 2018 the application of self organizing fuzzy controller and self tuning fuzzy controller in fin stabilizer system is presented these studies improve the system performance however they are only aimed at the improvement of control strategy and no attention to the larger error of feedback on this basis a new method is designed to detect the actual lift by improving conventional fin stabilizers it is done as the system feedback which is simple and practical the adaptive controller of lift feedback control system is designed by applying rbf neural network compensation strategy this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the control system and error reasons of fin stabilizers are analyzed and then a new lift feedback control system is developed in section 3 a new lift detection method is applied to solve the system feedback error in section 4 for control system with nonlinearity and uncertainty an adaptive controller based on rbf neural network compensation is designed in section 5 simulation results and discussion are proposed finally conclusions are given 2 analysis and design of system 2 1 roll model according to conolly theory the nonlinear roll model of a ship equipped with the fin stabilizer is approximated to 1 i x δ i x d 2 θ d t 2 n 1 d θ d t n 2 d θ d t d θ d t g 1 θ g 3 θ 3 g 5 θ 5 k ω k c where i x δ i x d 2 θ d t 2 is inertia moment of a ship n 1 d θ d t n 2 d θ d t d θ d t is damping moment of a ship g 1 θ g 3 θ 3 g 5 θ 5 is restoring moment k ω is disturbance moment of waves k c is control moment of the fin stabilizer ideally if the disturbance moment is completely offset by control moment the roll motion of the ship is stopped therefore the accurate control moment is the key of roll reduction while control moment need to be determined according to the disturbance of waves but the motion of waves is a complex irregular random movement and the marine environment is extremely bad thus how to accurately and effectively detect the actual hydrodynamic force is a difficult problem in the dynamic hydrodynamic force of fins lift is the real factor of roll reduction lift line is perpendicular to the relative velocity of current and the axis of fins since the fin arrangement is symmetrical when the lift of one side fin is upward the lift of the other side fin is down so the control moment can be expressed as 2 k c 2 l α l α where l α is the lift on a fin l α is the arm of control moment thus the control problem of fin stabilizers is transformed into how to accurately detect the actual lift the ship equipped with a pair of fin stabilizers is shown in fig 1 2 2 system error analysis 2 2 1 feedback error according to the calculation theory of force coefficient of fin in viscous fluid t perez and goodwin 2008 2010 when fins and water flow into a fixed angle lift approximation is kept constant which is shown as follow 3 l α 1 2 ρ v 2 a c 0 1 a 2 a 0 1 k α where c 0 4 μ a 0 ρ v 2 k tan β α a 0 2 a 0 θ 0 δ 1 θ 0 arctan v cos α 2 a 0 arctan μ 2 a 0 a 2 2 a 0 n π δ 1 n 0 1 2 ρ is fluid density v is fluid velocity a is the projection area of fins c l α is defined as lift coefficient then 4 c l α c 0 1 a 2 a 0 1 k α from eq 2 and eq 4 before the fin stall lift coefficient control moment coefficient and fin angle are linear in practical engineering the system of fin stabilizer is designed according to this kind of linear relation but in fact the dynamic hydrodynamic characteristics of fins are very complex naca0015 fin type is chosen to carry out hydrodynamic experiments model parameters are shown in table 1 the experimental results and experimental status table are shown in fig 2 and table 2 fig 2 shows that the dynamic relationship between lift coefficient control moment coefficient and fin angle is not an ideal linear relationship while it presents a closed curve there is large error between theoretical value and actual value i e the large error exists in the feedback therefore the fin stabilizer is difficult to resist wave disturbance moment which will definitely reduce the anti rolling effect 2 2 1 control error in practical application conolly linear roll model of ship is adopted in pid control but the model is simplified as follows 1 assume that the roll motion of the hull is independent and there are not coupling factors and other degrees of freedom motion 2 assume that ship width is much smaller than wave length 3 internal pressure field of waves is not affected by ship but in fact the motion of a ship in the ocean waves is a complex six degree of freedom movement in which there is a certain degree of coupling among the roll sway and yaw and internal pressure field is not ideal owing to the existence of the ship so ship will have a certain impact on the internal pressure field the rolling period of conolly model 5 t φ 2 π d s h i p h s h i p i x x δ i x x where d s h i p is the displacement of the ship h s h i p is the metacentric height of the ship the dimensionless damping coefficient 6 n μ n μ d s h i p h s h i p i x x δ i x x for different types of ships t φ and n μ are different because of the different design parameters due to the complex shape of ship and the interaction between ship and waves i x and δ i x are empirical or experimental formulas to determine so t φ is uncertain and changeable in addition n μ and n u and also relevant while n u is related to the hull shape loading condition roll frequency roll amplitude flow field around hull water viscosity and so on as a result there is serious nonlinearity and uncertainty in the system of fin stabilizer 2 3 lift feedback control system design 2 3 1 system structure because it is different in the control principle for new lift feedback fin stabilizer and conventional fin angle feedback fin stabilizer there is a difference in the system structure the structure of lift feedback fin stabilizer comprises three parts integrated controller electro hydraulic servo system and ship state feedback part as shown in fig 3 2 3 2 working process when the ship is subjected to the action of wave disturbance moment the sensors of state feedback part can measure roll angle roll velocity and roll acceleration the signals are input to data processor and they are adjusted calculated and amplified and then they are transmitted to integrated controller as input quantity in the integrated controller the signal is calculated by control strategy and the lift that needed for fin stabilizers to counter wave moment in real time is obtained which is used as the control signal input to servo system the lift control signal is converted to the instruction of turning fin by angle amplifier which is transmitted to electro hydraulic servo valve the hydraulic cylinder drives fin to rotate for the corresponding angle due to the effect of fluid dynamics the control moment is generated to resist disturbance moment by fin at the same time the actual lift is measured directly by lift sensor which is transmitted to servo system controller as a feedback signal 2 3 3 improved advantage in control form the lift feedback fin stabilizer is similar to fin angle feedback fin stabilizer but there are essential differences which are mainly reflected in the following aspects 1 the output of controller is lift which is the direct control of the ship s control command instead of indirect fin angle command 2 the effect of speed sensitivity adjuster is different in the fin angle feedback system the speed sensitivity adjustment is generally placed in the output circuit of controller and its function is to ensure the stability in the same roll state and the speed of lift feedback system is as an input signal of controller the output of controller is detected by speed sensitivity adjustment which ensures that the output command is always realized so the system can be guaranteed to work properly 3 the wave sensitivity adjuster can limit the saturation rate of the system to the maximum stable moment which can avoid the wear of mechanical devices 3 design and analysis of lift feedback the feedback error of conventional fin stabilizer leads to the bottleneck of anti rolling performance only control system improved by control algorithm can not eliminate the feedback error therefore from practical engineering point of view the study of fin stabilizers should seek effective lift feedback method based on dynamic hydrodynamic force 3 1 mechanism design of detecting lift during the last decades the conventional fin stabilizer has excellent reliability by verification on various ship types since detecting lift is achieved by improving the conventional fin axis mechanism the new system can inherit the practicality and reliability of conventional fin stabilizers and make up its deficiency the design of new hollow fin axis mechanism is shown in fig 4 1 fin axis is hollow inside with 4 solid axis core the outer of 4 solid axis core and 1 fin axis are fixed and the two rotate together 1 fin axis is mounted in the 3 cabinet and 5 angular contact roller bearing and 12 spherical roller bearing constitute two supports for fin axis 3 cabinet is welded to the hull bilge 1 fin axis located inside the hull portion and 11 rocker arm are fixed and its outer end installs fin with 13 fin sleeve 11 rocker arm connects hydraulic servo system so that 1 fin axis is rotated by the set control mode the inside of 1 fin axis is mounted detachable 7 axis end cover along the normal and tangential 6 9 two non contact displacement sensors are installed inside of 7 axis end cover 8 fin angle sensor is mounted on the 1 fin axis since 7 axis end cover is detachable and located within the hull its installation maintenance and replacement is easy 3 2 fin axis stress analysis since 5 angular contact roller bearing and 12 spherical roller bearing can be simplified into two simple pivots the b c of 1 fin axis can be approximately equivalent to a simply supported beam in the outer part of 12 spherical roller bearing 1 fin axis is vacant so the c e of 1 fin axis can be seen as a cantilever since 4 solid axis core is fixed at point d its a d is a cantilever in 1 fin axis thus the overall structure of mechanism is approximately combination simply supported beam and cantilever the simplified form of fin axis mechanism is shown in fig 5 when fin is rotated in wave fin axis can occur slight bending in the hydrodynamic effect the modification at e point of fin axis will lead d point deformed which will make axis core upward in the fin axis since the space of fin axis is large enough the upward of axis core is not restricted the upward of the a d axis core like a lever which makes the turning angle of d point transform into the displacement h a of a point through the structure relation here section inertia i d at d point is 7 i d π d 4 d 4 64 where d is outer diameter of fin axis d is corresponding inner diameter 3 3 strain analysis withtimoshenko beam theory according to timoshenko beam theory the beam cross section of a differential length d x is analyzed at the initial state assuming the cross section of the beam is flat under the action of shear bending it is no longer perpendicular to the neutral axis rotation terms produced by shear force is β as shown in fig 6 at the point x the total deflection of beam consists of two parts one part is caused by bending deformation and the other part is caused by shear force thus the slope of deflection curve is given by eq 8 8 d v d x φ x β x φ x and β x are the rotations caused by bending moment and shear force respectively assuming that line deflection and angular deflection are small the relationship between bending moment and curvature is 9 m x e i d φ x d x the relationship between shear force and shear strain is given by eq 10 10 v x k s a g β x the shear strain of beam is as follows 11 γ y z d v d x φ according to fig 6 eq 12 and eq 13 can be obtained 12 w d x d v 0 13 σ m 0 v d x d m w x d x d x 2 0 eq 14 can be obtained by eq 8 eq 9 eq 10 eq 12 and eq 13 14 d d x k s a g d v d x φ w it is assumed that the transverse displacement along beam element length is 15 v x a 1 x 3 a 2 x 2 a 3 x a 4 because each node of the beam has a lateral displacement v i and a small turning angle φ i thus the cubic displacement function is represented by 4 degrees of freedom in eq 15 it can satisfy the basic bending theory of beam at the same time the displacement and rotation angle of the joint can also be established the cross cutting strain γ is consistent with the three degree polynomial of v x then 16 γ c eq 17 can be obtained by eq 1 eq 9 eq 10 and eq 13 17 c 6 a 1 g where g e i k s a g k s a is the shear area k s a varies with the shape of the cross section according to eq 15 φ is expressed as a polynomial with x 18 φ a 3 2 a 2 x 3 x 2 6 g a 1 in the case of ignoring shear deformation the coefficients a i can be expressed using nodal displacements v 1 v 2 and rotation angle φ 1 φ 2 at the node of beam x 0 x l by eq 15 and eq 18 19 a 1 2 v 1 l φ 1 2 v 2 l φ 2 l l 2 12 g a 2 3 l v 1 2 l 2 6 g φ 1 3 l v 2 l 2 6 g φ 2 l l 2 12 g a 3 12 g v 1 l 3 6 g l φ 1 12 l v 2 6 g l φ 2 l l 2 12 g a 4 v 1 it can be obtained by

32 first factor is structure length of fin axis each part l i second factor is material of fin axis which is determined by modulus of elasticity e third factor is section inertia of fin axis i d which is determined by shape and size of cross section i d is determined by outside diameter d and inside diameter d because section of fin axis is circular h a should be as large as possible in order to reduce resolution requirement and selection difficulty of sensors there are three ways to increase h a as main factors 1 length of fin axis is increased l 2 l 3 and l 4 are related to structural strength if they are changed the intensity should be reconsidered as a result l 2 l 3 and l 4 can t be easily changed however l 1 is the suspended part of axis core l 1 stretches to hull which does not affect structural strength l 1 can be properly increased if the space of cabin is enough 2 modulus of elasticity e is reduced modulus of elasticity e is determined by material material with small modulus of elasticity is selected on the basis of ensuring structural strength 3 section inertia i d is reduced outer diameter d is reduced or inner diameter d is increased on the basis of ensuring structural strength the changes can make smaller section inertia of cross section i d 4 design of adaptive control based on rbf neural network compensation 4 1 system description the uncertain system

design the parameters of an actual ship equipped with fin stabilizer are adopted as the basis on this basis it is defined as the model 1 and the specific parameters are shown in table 3 1 on the model 1 the parameters of l 1 e and i d are changed in order to model 2 model 4 and model 3 respectively 2 l 1 is increased to 1165 m m and the other parameters are unchanged on the basis of model 1 which is set to model 2 3 alloy structural steel a i s i 5150 of model 1 is replaced with engineering synthetic resins a b s in order to compare obviously its modulus of elasticity e is 2495 9 n m m 2 and the other parameters are unchanged which is set to model 3 4 inner diameter is increased to 200 m m so section inertia of cross section i d is decreased the other parameters are fixed which is set to model 4 5 the fin axis of conventional fin stabilizer is used for reference and its diameter is 150 m m the other parameters are fixed which is set to model 5 the finite element simulation analysis is carried out according to the given quantitative relation and the simulation of the model 1 is shown in fig 7 the simulation results of the displacement at the core axis end in each model as shown in table 4 as can be seen from table 4 the design of the fin axis structure and lift detection method is effective which proves the accuracy of the quantitative relationship between lift and displacement three main factors affecting displacement is structure length l i modulus of elasticity e and section inertia of cross section i d one of them is changed the result is changed correspondingly and the rationality of the analysis is verified in the later stage of engineering application the specific calibration and correction of the theoretical deduction can be made to further reduce the error and make it closer to the actual situation the comparison between model 1 and model 5 can be obtained as follows the advantage of fin axis mechanism designed is that it can directly measure the actual lift which can overcome the error caused by the estimate of fin angle disadvantage is the fin axis is made thicker and it takes up valuable space due to the hollow in order to ensure the strength requirements at the same time the deflection of fin axis becomes larger so the fatigue degree and the sealing property of the material are required higher while the advantage of the conventional fin axis is the processing is easy and the difficulty of sealing is relatively low disadvantage is lift need be estimated by fin angle which causes the feedback error of the control system 5 2 main parameters and comparison steps a fin stabilizer system of a certain ship is as an example the simulation results are verified by simulation here the ittc single parameter spectrum is applied to simulate the wave motion and the model is conolly nonlinear model the main parameters are shown in table 5 as can be seen from table 5 and eq 1 the nominal model of fin stabilizer is 73 d 2 θ d t 2 0 25174 d θ d t 0 7056 d θ d t d θ d t 0 64836 θ 15 7696 θ 3 20 65 θ 5 0 00973 u 0 39479 e 7 k ω where u is the control variable of lift simulation experiments are carried out in two steps 1 comparison of fin angle feedback control system and lift feedback control system the improved pid controller in practical engineering is adopted 2 for lift feedback control system control strategies are compared and analyzed design of rbf neural network compensation adaptive control and pid control is used to carry out simulation 5 3 comparative analysis of control systems as a comparison the improved pid control strategy is proposed in the simulation which is usually used in practical engineering under the same conditions the simulation of fin angle feedback control system and lift feedback control system is studied here the pid controller of fin angle feedback system is 74 α p i d s k i 1 t i s 1 k d t d 1 s t d 1 s 1 t d 2 s 1 k p φ s according to the fin angle feedback system the pid controller of the lift feedback system is shown in the following 75 l p i d s k i l 1 t i s 1 k d l t d 1 s t d 1 s 1 t d 2 s 1 k p l φ s in the fin angle feedback control the constraint condition is α 22 d e g since the hydrodynamic characteristics of fin and the power of servo system are considered in lift feedback control in the high sea conditions when the speed is low the fin angle will appear saturation phenomenon when the speed is higher the fin angle is not saturated with the power of the system to reach the limit therefore in practical applications the fin angle and lift are required to be restricted according to the experimental results of fin in the water tank in the lift feedback control system the fin angle constraint is α 22 d e g and the lift constraint is l 2 20 e 5 n when the wave direction is 45 the simulation is carried out as an example the results of experimental and simulated roll angle disturbance moment in the open loop and roll angle control moment of fin angle feedback control and lift feedback control are shown in fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8 both of the fin angle feedback control system and lift feedback control system can reduce roll motion fin angle feedback control system can make the roll angle limit to 1 while lift feedback control system can make the roll angle limit to 0 5 comparison experimental roll angle disturbance moment and simulated roll angle disturbance moment in the open loop experimental results are slightly larger than the simulation results however the deviation is within a reasonable range the reason for this phenomenon is that the experiment is restricted by the smaller experimental tank and device and it is difficult to fully simulate the state of the ship in the real environment the simulation of anti rolling in different waves and the calculation of anti rolling effect are shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 in the different wave directions lift feedback control system and fin angle feedback control system are compared and the former is better further shows the effectiveness of the fin axis mechanism designed in this paper the actual lift is more accurate than the fin angle estimation the lift directly detected is used as the feedback of control system which enables the fin to be not affected by the changing direction of the local flow so that it can change the fin angle according to the real needs meanwhile it can avoid entering the cavity area and prevent the lift generated by system can not reach or exceed the desired lift occasionally and then the situation of over anti rolling or less anti rolling for fin stabilizer can be avoided which can improve the rolling efficiency reduce the system energy consumption and prolong the life of the equipment rbf neural network compensation adaptive control is used to carry out simulation and the simulation results are shown in table 6 table 6 shows that the rolling mean values of pid controller are 0 25 1 72 and the anti rolling effects are 81 05 94 07 while the rolling mean values of rbf neural network compensation adaptive controller are 0 12 1 49 and the anti rolling effects are 83 52 97 86 comparison of rbf neural network compensation adaptive control and pid control the former can significantly reduce the nonlinear and uncertain influence of system and improve the anti rolling effect by comparison it is known that the design of rbf neural network compensation adaptive controller is suitable for lift feedback control system 6 conclusions the control system and control strategy of new lift feedback fin stabilizer are verified based on the comparative analysis of conventional fin stabilizers the following conclusions are obtained 1 the quantitative relationship between lift and displacement are presented by using timoshenko beam theory to deduce for the design of fin axis mechanism timoshenko beam matrix makes the flexural properties of fin axis digital which provides theoretical support for engineering application the validity of quantitative relation and the influence of main factors are proved based on the design parameters of an actual fin stabilizer which expand the selection range of sensors 2 it is convenient and practical for design of detachable axis cover and sensor installation at the same time closed space is formed to avoid external interference non contact displacement sensors are used to detect relative displacement which is difficult to damage and universal 3 for new lift feedback control system the improved pid control is applied by simulating and contrasting fin angle feedback control system which verifies the effectiveness of new system the tracking performance of new system is obtained by designing rbf neural network compensator which compensates nonlinear and uncertain part of the real system 4 in the field of ship motion control several widely is used active hydrofoils for roll reduction include fin rudder and so on while directly and accurately detecting dynamic hydrodynamics force is a universal problem the design in this paper can be provided reference for improving the axis of other hydrofoils in actual engineering the control deviation of fin stabilizer is mainly caused by two aspects internal causes and external causes for internal causes one is the influence of the nonlinear part in the rolling model the conventional control strategy often ignores the nonlinear links moreover in order to prevent the dynamic stall of the fin stabilizer and ensure the safety of the actuators the constraints are usually set up the constraints of the conventional fin stabilizers are difficult to make full use of lift as shown in fig 10 for external causes the fin stabilizers and ship are strongly disturbed by wind wave and current so they are difficult to predict accurately when designing fin stabilizers the system feedback and controller are mainly improved to reduce internal interference in this paper the future research will focus on the prediction and estimation of external disturbance and improve the utilization rate of lift conflicts of interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests
