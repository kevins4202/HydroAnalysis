14170,since the bourgeoning interest in solid phase recovery of nutrient from wastewater a large number of solid phase materials have been investigated either as adsorbents or reactive materials in nutrient recovery technologies the theoretical basis for the choice of these material are often shrouded and not teased out which made it difficult to understand the underlying mechanism of the recovery process in this treatise an overview of the theoretical basis for the choice of solid phase material for nutrient recovery from wastewaters was provided the primary consideration for the choice of a solid phase material for nutrient recovery include the nutrient adsorption capacity the pore size ph values chemical and mineralogical assemblage and surficial physiognomies in order to ensure the sustainability of the process the material must be readily available low cost eco friendly and ease of nutrient release for plant growth good hydraulic conductivity to minimize the risk of clogging when applied as barriers or filters was also identified furthermore an evaluation of the concentration and bioavailability of possible contaminants leached from the solid phase material is required despite the plethora of materials that have been investigated as solid phase material they can be easily classified as green and non green materials this classification can be further sub divided into organic inorganic and composite solid phase materials keywords adsorbent adsorption nitrate nutrient recovery phosphate reactive material 1 introduction the united nations environment program has discovered that pollution emanating from nutrient discharge is one of the biggest environmental challenges of the 21st century rural intensive industries such as abattoirs piggeries chicken farms tanneries wool scours feedlots dairy farm and related factories produce large quantities of effluents that contain valuable nutrients i e phosphate and nitrate 1 3 it has been estimated that about 8 of nitrogen and 14 of phosphorus used in agricultural practices enter municipal wastewater penuelas et al 2012 human sewage is another nutrient rich wastewater although the nutrient content depends on the diet 4 in domestic wastewater urine contributes 50 80 of the phosphorous concentration and 75 of the nitrogen concentration excreted in the form of urea simha and ganesapillai 2016 arredondo et al 2015 5 the rich nutrient constituents of these wastewaters can be captured recovered and reused to improve soil fertility this is because nitrates and phosphates are essential plant nutrient requirements that enhance the growth and yield undesirable plants such as algae and macrophytes also bloom uncontrollably in water bodies with high nutrient load the nutrient initiate and propagate the process of eutrophication 6 8 zobo 7 the concept of resource recovery has provided a paradigm shift in wastewater perception rather than perceive nutrient laden wastewater as a disposable waste it is now considered a valuable resource that can add to the inventory of opportunities available for humanity 2 9 10 over the years the concept of nutrient recovery and reuse has been promoted through the development of innovative technologies such technologies include the use of biological nutrient uptakes 11 14 zhou et al 2015 15 bioelectrochemical systems bes nutrient uptake 16 19 chemical precipitation 20 electrocoagulation 21 22 adsorption and ion exchange 23 27 employing the processes of adsorption and ion exchange for nutrient recovery and reuse involve the use of a solid phase material that can physically or chemically interacts with the nutrient fraction in the aqua matrix woumfo et al 2015 28 29 these materials can be used either in the form of a fixed bed column system or as a dispersed phase in aqua medium to be settled out in a downstream clarifier 30 oladoja et al 2016 pan et al 2012 31 huser et al 2015 the review of nutrient recovery technologies whose operational principles hinges on solid phase recovery showed that a large number of solid phase materials have been studied either as adsorbents or reactive materials 32 35 oftentimes the justification for the choice of these materials are shrouded and not properly delineated which made it difficult to understand the underlying mechanism of the recovery process in any scientific operation the knowledge of the underlying mechanism of the process provides opportunities to modify and improve the process for enhanced performances in the present treatise we aimed at interrogating the trends in the use of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery to gain an insight into the variables that defined the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery explicating the variables that defined the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery would enable professionals in this field of study to make informed decision on the appropriate choice of material for specific purposes 2 the variables that define the choice of a solid phase material the nutrient binding characteristics nbc of a solid phase material is the physicochemical characteristics that enables it to interact favourably with nutrient fraction in aqueous system the knowledge of the nbc of a material is required before it is chosen for a particular application an appraisal of the nbc of the different solid phase materials that have been evaluated for nutrient recovery showed that they are strongly related to their physicochemical characteristics these include pore size ph value chemical and mineralogical assemblage and crystallographic property and textural and surficial physiognomies for sustainability the material must be abundant cheap non toxic reusable with no risk to soil or water quality and must readily release the nutrient recovered for plant use 36 in addition to the use of the nbc as criterion for material selection they are also needed for estimating the dosage of material needed to control the process of nutrient recovery at the desired level cucarella and renman 2009 further to good nbc the solid phase material should have good hydraulic conductivity to minimize the risk of system clogging or the occurrence of preferential flow when applied as barriers or filters furthermore the concentration and bioavailability of possible inorganic contaminants leached from the solid phase material must be evaluated this is because some solid phase materials may contain high levels of trace metals and heavy metals that can easily get leached into the water matrix 2 1 chemical composition consequent upon the amphoteric nature of materials that are rich in ca al mg and fe they perform better in the removal of oxoanions from aqua streams thus reactive materials that are rich in this array of metallic species are often used in nutrient recovery processes 37 39 in phosphate recovery materials that have shown high potentials are usually rich in ca fe al and mg the presence of these ions in any solid matrix enhances the phosphorus recovery either through precipitation or adsorption 40 41 interactions of reactive materials that are rich in ca fe and al with aqua phase p have been posited to involve a number of physicochemical associations these could be the formation of discrete secondary minerals surface adsorption internal ion exchange and precipitate formation 29 42 yu et al 2015 43 the precipitation of phosphate from aqua systemis usually initiated by the addition of a divalent or a trivalent metal ion e g magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 aluminium al3 or ferric iron fe3 44 or materials that are rich in this array of metals the choice of metal ion for phosphorus recovery amongst the aforementioned metal ions is important because the recovered phosphorus that is too tightly bound to the metal ion cannot readily be reused for industrial and agricultural purposes 45 magnesium and calcium rich precipitate are generally reused as fertilizer although the removal of phosphorus using aluminium and iron based precipitation is quite common in wastewater treatment caravelli et al 2010 but the phosphorus in iron phosphates is considered to be unavailable to plants although a fraction of the insoluble phosphorus may eventually become bioavailable depending on hydration or aging 46 2 2 ph value the effectiveness of any solid phase material in nutrient recovery strongly depends on the surface charge of the material 47 50 the ph of the solid solution system directly affects the surface charge of the material it is also a very important parameter to consider when choosing a material for nutrient recovery 51 53 nutrient recovery procedure using solid phase materials spans through a wide ph range 54 phosphate exist in different forms as a result of the variation in the ph value of the medium dai et al 2014 thus the ph of the system influences the available phosphate species fig 1 in a nutrient rich medium the different orthophosphates species are described by the following equations with their respective pka values at 25 c clifford 1961 1 p o 4 3 h 2 o h p o 4 2 o h pk 1 68 2 h p o 4 2 h 2 o h 2 p o 4 o h pk 6 79 3 h 2 p o 4 h 2 o h 3 p o 4 o h pk 11 67 4 h 2 o h o h pk 14 00 the phosphate speciation fig 1 which corroborated the position earlier canvassed by clifford 1961 was plotted using the medusa make equilibrium diagrams using sophisticated algorithms and hydra hydrochemical equilibrium constant database computer software clifford 1961 indicated the presence of h2po4 and hpo4 2 species at ph values that ranged between 5 and 10 the concentration of h2po4 specie is higher for ph value below 7 while hpo4 2 specie predominate over other species at ph values that ranged between 7 and 10 for ph values that ranged between 10 and 12 hpo4 2 predominate over po4 3 specie while for ph values higher than 12 5 the concentration of po4 3 was more abundant thus it is glaring that the influence of the ph of the solid phase material for phosphate recovery must be considered in any recovery procedure generally solid phase material with positive surface charge is required for effective recovery of nitrate nitrate uptake decreases in an alkaline medium due to the prevalence of oh ouardi et al 55 investigated the effects of the solution ph value on the adsorption of nitrate on a new clay and reported that the percentage nitrate removal decreased from 92 72 to 38 96 when the ph value was increased from 2 to 10 in any case of nitrate adsorption the ph dependency is related to the surface charge of the reactive material sowmya and meenakshi 56 reported that the adsorption capacity of ion exchange resin duolite a 171 remained the same in the ph value range of 3 9 and started to decrease after ph value of 9 daud et al 57 studied the effect of ph on nitrate removal using fe pt bimetallic nanoparticles and anionic exchange resins it was discovered that for anionic resin 82 5 nitrate removal was achieved at a contact time of 60 min and a value of 4 but there was a notable decrease in the efficiency of the material with increasing ph value chatterjee and woo 58 reported that the removal of nitrate on chitosan beads increased when solution ph value decreased from 8 to 3 due to protonation protonation increased the surface positive charge of the adsorbent which resulted in increased electrostatic attraction of nitrate and an enhanced nitrate removal capacity in some adsorbents reduction in the ph value led to a decrease in the solid phase adsorption capacity for example in the study by bhatnagar et al 59 the percentage of nitrate removal by zncl2 modified gac was almost constant at the ph range 4 11 however it decreased at ph value of 3 due to competition with cl ions which was added as hcl to adjust the solution ph value 2 3 textural properties in the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery a significant factor that is considered is the particle size the material must be significantly permeable to allow water flow through it without rapid clogging the porosity value provides information on the volume of voids in a material and how much water can actually come in contact with such material the particle size of any solid phase material is in direct relationship with the pore size and surface area the smaller the particle size the smaller the pore size of the material and the higher the surface area generally effectiveness of a material in nutrient recovery is enhanced by large surface area small particle and pore sizes nano solid phase materials have been found promising in nutrient recovery this is because of their higher surface area greater active sites and better selectivity 10 60 61 proving the effectiveness of nanoparticles for nutrient removal markeb et al 62 used magnetite nanoparticles mnps for phosphate removal and achieved adsorption capacity of more than 4 9 mg po4 3 g premised on the excellent features e g small size large surface area and highly reactive surfaces of zero valent iron nanoparticles nvzi they exhibit high potential for the removal of nitrate and phosphate 63 64 from the aqueous system studying the effects of particle sizes jóźwiakowski et al 2017 investigated the influence of the particle size of carbonate siliceous rock on the efficiency of phosphorous removal from domestic wastewater the studied particle sizes were 1 2 mm 2 5 mm and 5 10 mm the highest removal efficiency 97 was achieved with the substrate having the smallest particle size and the lowest phosphorus removal efficiency was observed with the filter containing rocks with a particle size of 5 10 mm jeon and yeom 47 investigated the use of crab shell for phosphate removal it was noted that the shell with particle size of less than 1000 μm had more than 85 phosphate removal efficiency within a period of 24 h from a 500 mg l phosphate solution whereas with a larger shell particles size of 3350 μm the efficiency of the material reduced to 50 jeon and yeom 2008 affirmed that the particle size of scallop shell used for phosphate removal affected both the removal rate as well as the removal capacity they observed that within 3 h the shell with particle size of 20 or 45 mm removed 100 of 100 mg l of phosphate the ones with the particle size of 100 mm removed 76 of 100 mg l phosphate in 8 h and particle size of 300 mm took 24 h for 75 removal when the particle size was increased to 500 mm it took 80 h to remove more than 95 of 100 mg l of phosphate but the shells of 1000 and 3000 mm in size removed only 49 and 21 of the phosphate in 80 h mikhak et al 65 investigated the effect of nano fe oh 3 clinoptilolite on nitrate and phosphate removal the nanomaterial achieved a removal efficiency of 90 and 80 of phosphate and nitrate respectively the efficiency of the material was ascribed to its nano particle size xiao et al 66 investigated the effects of sediments particle size on the adsorption of phosphate the particle sizes were divided into d1 0 30 μm d2 30 63 μm d3 63 92 μm and d4 92 125 μm the results of the effectiveness of each of the particle sizes are shown in fig 2 in the context of using solid phase materials in aquatic system to sequester nutrient in sediment the pollution of the overlying water is avoided with the use of solid phase materials with higher particle size this is because denser solid phase materials get sedimented easily this also preclude the suspension of the solid phase material on water surface 2 4 ecological risk the environmental impact of a solid phase material is a factor that must be considered before the choice for a particular application consequently comprehensive ecotoxicological assay should be performed to determine the possibility of severe and lingering ecotoxicological effects on the aquatic organisms these tests should also include the effects of physical changes in the water body lethal doses of such material effect of such material on aquatic lives and determination of elemental composition to ascertain the presence of toxic metals 31 67 van oosterhout and lurling 2011 2013 61 68 the addition of phosphorus inactivating solid phase material may increase metal ions in aquatic environment this will possibly lead to their accumulation in the food chain and finally posed a risk to human health 69 phoslock a lanthanum la modified bentonite that is commonly used to inactivate phosphorus in aqueous medium contain a reactive lanthanum which is considered toxic 70 73 the lethal dose ld50 of lacl3 as 4200 mg la per kilogram body weight for rats has been confirmed 74 many of the reactive materials used for nutrient recovery contains aluminum as the active component and it has been discovered that aluminum is acutely toxic at high level dose at ph value that ranged between 4 and 6 a dose of 0 1and 0 2 mg l aluminum can cause the reduction of survival and growth of larvae and post larvae 75 76 as for the risks on human health the presence of excess aluminum in drinking water gave rise to the discussions on possible neuropathological diseases such as alzheimer s diseases dementia in dialysis and encephalopathy 77 it was discovered that the kidney dialysis patients suffer dementia when the aluminum content of the dialysis fluid reached 0 08 mg l davison et al 77 it is hereby postulated that in simulation experiments the residual ions in solutions should be quantified after using any solid phase material for nutrient recovery before it is recommended for real life applications researchers that are conscious of the risk factors of their materials considered such tests and ascertain that the ecological and health risks of the materials are low 72 reitzel et al 2005 spears et al 31 in the study of different industrial waste products which included red ochre black ochre gypsum mag dust and vermiculite modified lanthanum bentonite product phoslock for p immobilization in sediments comparatively assessed the elemental composition of the materials and other ecotoxicological test to underpin regulatory policy decisions regarding the use of industrial waste products for pollution control in water bodies 3 making a choice materials of different types have been employed as solid phase materials for nutrient capture and recovery from the aqua system an overview of these solid phase materials showed that they can be broadly classified as green and non green materials under this classification a subdivision dubbed as organic and inorganic based green and no green materials is also provided the trend in the choice of solid phase materials vis à vis the theoretical justifications for the choice for nutrient capture and recovery from the aqua system are critically reviewed herein 3 1 green solid phase materials green solid phase materials are the naturally occurring materials globally green materials have gained the attentions of environmental scientist and engineers because they serve as sources of cheap materials for pollution remediation the choice of green solid phase materials for nutrient recovery was based on their unique chemical composition abundance renewability low cost eco friendliness and higher efficiency when rightly chosen the green solid phase materials that have been investigated for nutrient recovery include sands soils clays and rocks 78 79 plant parts such as husks tree backs 43 and 2015 and animal wastes such as seashells chitin and egg shell 41 2017 and 2012 saliu et al 2019 36 80 chowdhury et al 2010 in this discourse the green solid phase materials are further classified as organic and inorganic green solid phase materials 3 1 1 green inorganic solid phase material the green inorganic solid phase materials are naturally occurring material whose chemical composition are mainly inorganic derivatives examples of selected green inorganic solid phase materials e g alumina titania silica magnesia calcite ferrites etc are delineated in table 1 an overview of these materials showed that they were derived from naturally occurring minerals and animal by products the synonymous physicochemical characteristics that informed the choice for nutrient recovery was the high calcium iron and aluminium concentrations which enhanced the nutrient removal capacities especially phosphorus the selected materials exhibited different nutrient removal capacities but it is noteworthy that the reported capacities are functions of the operational conditions and are not transferable as a rule 81 83 the presence of these green inorganic materials in different types of soils clays and rocks situate them as veritable materials for nutrient recovery 92 arias et al 2001 86 pan et al 2013 soils that are rich in ca fe or al are generally effective in nutrient capture from waste streams arias et al 2001 posited that the presence of ca in soil materials was the most important parameter in determining p uptake by sands this is because of the precipitation of the phosphate fraction of the aqua stream as calcium phosphate mineral other soil materials that are rich in fe and mg have been reported to be effective in nutrient recovery dai and pan 2014 pan et al 2013 güngör and ünlü 78 have used sandy clay loamy sand and sandy loam soils for the removal of nitrate and nitrite from wastewater with the efficiency of over 90 a type of sand called monsary sand was used by forbes et al 79 for phosphorus recovery they noted that sand have poor affinity for phosphorus contrariwise sands that are rich in clay and silt particles or rich in minerals can be used for phosphorus recovered and pan 2014 investigated the effect of red soil in removing phosphorus from water column and reducing phosphorus release from the sediment the maximum p adsorption capacity of 1 29 and 2 22 mg g at ph 8 5 and 5 5 respectively were recorded the removal efficiency of the acid activated red mud was higher than that of the ordinary red mud with adsorption capacity of 5 858 and 1 859 mmol g respectively 86 carbonate rich materials e g limestone dolomite calcite and magnesite have been used as solid phase materials for the uptake of p from natural and wastewaters samples 85 93 94 dai et al 2016 limestone is a sedimentary rock largely composed of calcium carbonate caco3 limestone is rich in calcium which makes it a suitable material for nutrient recovery crushed limestone can serve as filter material and the resulting nutrient laden material can be used as soil amendment limestone facilitates p precipitation because it is rich in calcium shilton et al 93 in a batch experiment achieved 64 p removal using a new zealand limestone dolomite a sedimentary rock composed of calcium magnesium carbonate camg co3 2 with heteroporous structure its reaction mechanism in nutrient recovery is either by adsorption or precipitation 85 soils clays and rocks with aluminosilicates magnesium rich silicates or calcium silicates as their major structural framework have been studied as solid phase materials for nutrient capture 95 96 allophane soil pumic soil and zeolites have aluminosilicates as their major structural framework the choice of these materials for nutrient capture was attributed to their chemical compositions highly porous nature large specific surface area and low bulk densities 95 the unit particles of aluminosilicate minerals consist of hollow aluminosilicate nanoballs with an outer diameter of 3 5 5 0 nm they also carry electric charges from substitution of al3 and or si4 by cations of lower valencies and the gain or loss of protons as solution ph values changes these properties of aluminosilicates defined their choice as effective solid phase materials for nutrient recovery from wastewater when aluminosilicates are used for phosphorus recovery the p is precipitated as aluminum phosphate 95 moharami and jalali 97 studied the use of modified clays for the adsorption of phosphorus from aqueous solutions kaolinite bentonite calcite and zeolite were modified with fecl3 cacl2 and nacl and used for the removal of phosphorus bentonite is a typical 2 1 type clay mineral that contains one octahedral sheet that is sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets because of the presence of substituted metal cation in the framework they possessed permanent negative charge in the surface which is balanced by cationic counter ions in the interlayer space zhu 2012 these bentonite characteristics made them a suitable adsorbent for both anionic and cationic water pollutants in order to enhance the adsorption capacity for phosphate different methods have been used to modify bentonite clay chen et al 98 investigated the performance of thermally treated bentonite clay for phosphate removal from aqua system it was reported that the bentonite thermally treated at 8000c achieved 94 phosphate removal from a 10 mg p l solution recently phoslock a lanthanum modified bentonite clay became popular in phosphorus removal 31 70 73 phoslock stabilizes the aqueous active phosphorus by forming lapo4chelate precipitate thus la3 po43 lapo45 kasprzyk and gajewska 99 investigated the effectiveness of phoslock in phosphorus removal from a synthetic wastewater over 95 removal efficiency was achieved and the ph value of the aqueous medium remained the same yuan and wu 100 compared the phosphorus adsorption capacity of allophane and phoslock and discovered that allophane effectively removed p from a wide range of phosphate concentrations at high solution allophane ratios it was also discovered that allophane did not dissolve in water and can be easily recovered and reused for soil amendment when the performance efficiency was compared with that of phoslock it had a higher p removal capacity than phoslock degens et al 101 used allophane for phosphate removal from a dairy effluent the study revealed that 91 of the p in the effluent was removed over a period of two 2 years the choice of allophane rock soil or clay in phosphate recovery was ascribed to their chemical compositions porosity peculiar charge characteristics and small particle sizes zeolites are crystalline hydrated aluminosilicates of alkali and alkaline earth metals with three dimensional atomic structures natural zeolites were effective for the removal of p and nh4 n but not for nitrate 88 102 the aluminosilicate lattice of all forms of zeolites are negatively charged making them to lack adsorptive ability for anionic nitrate ions zeolites that were reported to effectively remove nitrate were modified some of the reported modifications include coating of zeolite surface with surfactants joachim et al 2011 103 low cost chitosan 104 doping with different metal precursors 61 105 106 etc using a natural zeolite lin et al 88 achieved removal efficiency of 98 9 for p and 68 9 for nh4 n from orthophosphate and ammonium nitrogen rich wastewaters at ph value that ranged between 3 and 11 in a batch and continuous reactor chen et al 107 used nano zeolites synthesized from fly ash zfa to remove nh4 n and p in anaerobically digested swine wastewater the values of n and p removal efficiencies ranged between 41 and 95 and 75 and 98 respectively with zfa dosage range between 0 25 and8g 100 ml the adsorption capacity was ascribed to the wastewater properties the colloidal properties and the negatively charged layer of zeolites 107 polonite is a green solid phase material with calcium silicate as its major framework the calcium silicate material with 50 silica and 45 calcium carbonate efficiently reduced the concentration of phosphorus p and bacteria in effluent 89 108 gustafsson 2008 polonite is rich in calcium which makes it a suitable solid phase material for the recovery of p from wastewater 109 cucarella et al 110 investigated the effect of polonite used for phosphorus removal from wastewater on soil properties and fertility of a mountain meadow it was discovered that after the wastewater treatment the p load on the polonite ranged between 0 4 and 1 5 g kg the filtration ability of polonite in a well that collects and treats effluent from a septic tank was studied for 28 days 111 the wastewater was received from a single household and passed through the polonite filter bed in the study phosphorus laden polonite was recommended for agricultural use renman and renman 89 tested the effectiveness of polonite for phosphate removal in a column and full scale systems using synthetic and domestic wastewater for a period of 67 92 weeks operating under different hydrological conditions in the synthetic solution 530 l m 2 d 1 fed into a column the total phosphate removal of 97 was achieved in the absence of organic matter during the 68 weeks period of study in a compact bed filled with municipal wastewater 76 7 l m 2 d 1 and 560 kg of polonite the average phosphate removal achieved was 89 after 92 weeks of operation in a recent study karczmarczyk et al 112 used polonite in the form of suspended filter for nutrient removal three curtains consisting of eight suspended bags were filled with 1200 g polonite as a solid phase material for p capture the ratio of the mass of the solid phase material to the water volume in hydraulic block was 3 1 g dm3 the study showed successive removal of phosphorus from water by polonite regardless of the initial concentration as the orthophosphate wollastonite a calcium metasilicate mineral casio3 or caosio2 has proven to be effective as solid phase material for nutrient recovery in an impure form the other elemental impurities in the rawwollastonite ore include iron fe aluminum al manganese mn magnesium mg and titanium with iron fe being the most abundant the effectiveness of wollastonite in phosphorus removal was attributed to the calcium and ferrous ions rich nature 113 the presence of these ionic species in wallastonite made it possible for phosphorus removal either through precipitation reaction or adsorption richman 113 found that wollastonite had very good p removal efficiency achieving about 87 80 removal brooks et al 84 designed a full scale constructed wetland and tested the efficiency of wollastonite in phosphate recovery in the study secondary wastewater was pumped upward through columns 1 5 m by 15 cm filled with wollastonite the soluble phosphorus concentrations in the treated and untreated water samples were monitored for four hundred and eleven 411 days and more than 80 p removal was recorded serpentine h4mg3si2o9 a magnesium rich silicate mineral that is associated with ultra basic igneous rocks the nutrient recovery performance in a laboratory test was satisfactory 87 but its efficiency and life span decreased drastically when used to treat real effluent the quest for cheap and ecofriendly solid phase materials for nutrient recovery from wastewater has prompted researchers towards the use of marine shells and egg globally the marine lives from which the shells are derived are sources of food however after the edible portions are removed considerably large amount of the shells is discarded as waste the growing accumulation of waste from the processing of these marine lives for human consumption has become a great concern for environmental managers yearly about 6 8 million tonnes of waste mollusc crab shrimp and lobster shells are produced globally 114 in korea for example about 300 000 tones of oyster shells are generated annually in the developing countries the waste shells are often discarded in landfill or dumped indiscriminately these methods of disposing waste shells are liable to cause environmental issues such as generation of offensive odors soil pollution and damage to the marine ecosystem in the developed countries the costs associated with the waste shell disposal are significant in order to avoid these challenges researchers are strategically devising means of turning these waste shells into products that could provide additional values the shells of some of these animals e g mollusca are majorly composed of calcium carbonate which makes them a promising source of calcium 42 115 116 the non toxic high porosity and high surface area to volume ratio of calcium carbonate generated from these waste shells makes them beneficial for many industrial applications 39 114 yuangsawad and ranong 2011 investigated the use of oyster shell for phosphorus removal from wastewater the thermally treated oyster shell contained 97 to 95 7 cao which was discovered to be efficient in phosphorus capture the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity was 583 5 mg p g sea urchin is a popular seafood in japan that generates large amount of waste this is because the percentage of the edible parts is just 20 while the remnant is mainly shell the main component of the sea urchin shell is calcium carbonate magdan et al 2004 like other marine shells sea urchin shells can be used as a calcium resource onoda et al 117 investigated the use of sea urchin to recover phosphate from artificially polluted water and observed that the thermally treated sea urchin shell recovered phosphate from water through precipitation reaction jiang et al 118 introduced a new calcium silicate composite csc prepared from waste glass and shells for phosphorus recovery the composite was treated in an alkali medium to improve its efficiency the major chemical composition of this composite was sio2 and cao the alkaline treated adsorbent asc showed higher adsorption capacity due to its higher specific surface area and total pore volume the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities obtained were 120 mg g and73 0 mg g for asc and for csc respectively waste eggshell generated on daily bases from households bakeries and restaurants is made up of majorly calcium carbonate they are porous materials which makes them suitable for use for phosphorus removal from aqua system 36 the use of egg shells either treated or raw shells for nutrient recovery have been documented kose and kıvanc 91 used calcined egg shells for phosphate removal from aqueous solutions the effects of calcination temperatures of egg shell on phosphate removal was studied by varying the temperature from 200 to 1000 for 2 h within the calcination s temperature studied caco3 and cao were identified as the major chemical composition of the egg shell after 790 it was observed that the caco3 component of the egg shell has almost transformed completely to cao the authors ascribed the 100 removal efficiency of the material to the observed chemical transformation in two different studies al eggshell solid phase material was developed for phosphorus recovery in the first study the eggshells were doped with al using alcl3 solution the material achieved 96 4 phosphorus recovery 90 in the second study guo et al 36 prepared aluminum modified eggshell by blending eggshell with alcl3 solution to obtain 100 mesh aluminum modified eggshell for phosphorus recovery from aqua system the modified egg shells showed better phosphate adsorption capacity than the unmodified egg shells mezenner and bensmaili 119 doped iron hydroxide with eggshell by mixing fecl3 with eggshell and discovered that the phosphate adsorption capacity of the iron hydroxide eggshell was 2 017 mg p g gastropod is pervasive thus a high magnitude of the shell gs ended up as waste materials this made it an ample and economical solid phase material for phosphate recovery 42 the calcareous layer of the shell is typically made of calcium carbonate oladoja et al 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 oladoja et al 120 investigated the use of gastropod shell as ca ion source for phosphorus removal via the crystallization process in a simulation study the shell is made of very high inorganic fractions and ca2 predominated amongst the metal ions the phosphorus removal efficiency of the gastropod shell was high in a phosphate solution concentration that ranged between 25 and 1000 mg l the solution ph and ionic strength of the solution had no influence on the phosphate removal efficiency phosphate removal via the crystallization process was said to occurred through interaction between the phosphate the ca species and the hydroxyl group of the medium to form any of the species of the phosphate minerals the phosphate removal efficiency of thermally treated gastropod shell was investigated in aquaculture wastewater 41 the phosphorus removal efficiency of the different thermally treated shell varied with the calcination temperature fig 3 the thermal treatment appreciably improved the p removal efficiency of the gs and the optimum treatment temperature was achieved at 750 the higher p recovery ability achieved at this temperature was attributed to the enhanced defects in the surficial features oladoja et al 2017 prepared a column reactor packed with the gastropod shell pellets for phosphorus abstraction from aquaculture wastewater the experiment was conductedover a period of 30 day a large fraction of the influent p pin 50 71 g was retained pads 37 18 g in by the gs pellets the phosphorus recovery capacity of the gs pellets was still intact at the end of the period of monitoring 3 1 2 green organic solid phase materials the quest for cost effective approach to nutrient recovery has culminated in the use of lignocellulosic waste materials these materials include husks tree backs straws wood chips saw dust etc kim et al 2000 keränen et al 2013 and 2015 lignocellulosic waste materials are available worldwide thus offering a local abundant renewable and cheap raw material for the production of water treatment chemicals it has been estimated that over 340 million metric tons and 30 million metric tons of straw are produced in china and germany annually respectively unfortunately most of these are burnt for energy generation 121 over 600 000 tons of sawdust are generated in finland most of which are dumped as waste in landfills 122 a review of selected green organic materials that have been used for nutrient recovery are presented in table 2 the results presented in tables 2 showed that the majority of the green organic based materials that have been used are cellulosic and few of them e g alfalfa biomass newspaper waste sawdust wheat straw wood chips etc have been used in the pristine state without modification varied nutrient recovery capacities have been reported for the different materials investigated it should be noted that that the reported capacities for each material presented in table 2 greatly depend on the operational conditions and are not transferable as a rule 81 83 the chemical composition and surface functional groups on these materials placed them as appropriate solid phase materials for nutrient recovery the biomass derived from lignocellulose is made up of carbohydrate polymers cellulose and hemicellulose which are strongly attached to an aromatic polymer lignin the chemical structures of cellulose and hemicellulose possess abundant hydroxyl groups which can be easily transformed to other reactive polymers through chemical reactions lignocellulose possesses negatively charged surface which makes the surface unattractive to anionic species therefore the use of lignocellulose biomass for the removal of anions is ineffective without surface modification the inactive functional groups of lignocellulosic materials can be reinforced to increase the number of active sites and potentials lignocellulose reinforcement could be achieved by surface modification wan and hanafiah 2008 the reinforcement process is essential since the original lignocellulosic biomass has extremely low phosphorus removal efficiency consequently several methods have been developed to cationized these materials the modifying agents that have been used for lignocellulose modifications include oxidizing agents k2mno4 and h2o2 organic and mineral compounds formaldehyde epichlorohydrin glutaraldehyde succinic maleic and phtalic organic and inorganic acids hcl h2so4 hno3 formic acid acetic acid citric oxalic and tartaric acid bases and basic solutions naoh na2co3 ca oh 2 cacl2 amination is another method that has been use to cationize lignocellulosicbiomass surfaces this is done by incorporating a nitrogen bearing amine compounds into lignocellulosic biomass as the electron configuration of nitrogen allows the formation of a cation 137 researchers have modified different lignocellulosic biomass to achieve higher nutrient removal efficiency orlando et al 123 modified different types of lignocellulosic biomass with thionyl chloride n n dimethylformamide dimethylamine and formaldehyde and obtained the highest adsorption capacity of 2 8 mg g for no3 nwith modified moringa oleifera hull the treatment of the lignocellulosic biomass transformed the materials into a weak base anion exchanger which enhanced interaction with anionic species karachalios and wazne 124 treated pine bark with chlorocholine chloride and urea the surface of the material was activated for nitrogen removal through amination to produce weak base anion exchangers the optimal adsorption capacity of 40 8 mg g was achieved ohura et al 125 pointed out that orange waste is a promising available and inexpensive agricultural waste that could be used for phosphorus recovery from wastewater the possibility of this was tested by modifying orange waste with zr and used for phosphorus recovery from a side stream liquid and secondary effluent that contained 68 2 and 5 9 mg dm3 p respectively the maximum adsorption capacity obtained was 1 3 mg g biswas et al 138 also tested the efficiency of orange waste gel pre treated with a base i e ca oh 2 and loaded with zrocl2 8h2o and an adsorption capacity of 175 mg g was obtained in the experiment conducted by carvalho et al 2011 bagasse fibre a lignocellulosic biomass was first etherificated using monochloroacetic acid and then loaded with fecl2 the phosphorus adsorption capacity obtained was 152 mg g xu et al 126 adopted a new method for the preparation of wheat straw as an anion exchanger based on aminated intermediate epoxypropyl triethylammonium chloride for nutrient recovery the maximum adsorption capacities of modified wheat straw for phosphate and nitrate were 45 7 and 52 8 mg g respectively the adsorption capacity value obtained from the use of modified biomass was comparable with those obtained from activated carbons commercial anion exchange resin and some other modified adsorbents soumya et al 139 investigated the adsorption of phosphate and nitrate from aqueous solution using sodium alginate modified seagrass cymodocearotundata beads under varying operational conditions the adsorption characteristics of this material were enhanced this modified lignocellulosic biomass was effective with62 for nitrate and 71 for phosphate removal it was concluded that sodium alginate modified seagrass is an effective low cost and relatively available adsorbent for nutrient recovery from wastewater hafshejani et al 140 investigated the performance of modified sugarcane bagasse vermicompost for nitrate recovery from aqueous solution the anion and cation exchange capacity of the material were7 76 cmol kg and 11 16 cmol kg respectively the highest nitrate removal efficiency 81 7 was achieved at elevated temperature with solution ph value of 3 78 after 120 min of contact time and adsorbent dosage of 2 g l the presence of other competing anions such as chlorides and sulphates reduced the amount of nitrate removed by sugarcane bagasse vermicompost chitosan is a natural product derived from the deacetylation of chitin a polysaccharide chitin is produced by insects crustaceans yeasts cell walls insects fungi and green algae however crustacean shells have been discovered to be the principal source for commercial chitin chitin is the polymer of n acetyl β d glucosamine after deacetylation the structure of chitin differs from that of the chitosan due to the presence of an acetyl group on the amine group fig 4 the acetyl group protects the amine group from activity thereby making adsorption on chitin less sensitive the exposed amine group in chitosan makes it more reactive when compared with chitin the setbacks encountered in the practical use of chitosan such as low solubility in acidic mediums low mechanical strength low adsorption capacity and lack of selectivity has led to the different structural modifications the modification procedures ranges from physical to chemical modifications to achieve bigger surface area enhanced porosity and smaller size to improve reactivity chatterjee et al 2009 investigated the adsorption of nitrate by chitosan obtained by thermochemical deacetylation of chitin the adsorption of nitrate to chitosan strongly depended on the solution temperature and ph value the adsorption capacity increased in acidic medium the enhanced capacity was attributed to the protonation of the amine group present on the chitosan leading to electrostatic interaction between the positively charged amine group and the negatively charged nitrate group in the recovery of nitrate and phosphate using chitosan the mechanism of the recovery process was ascribed to electrostatic attraction fig 5 the regeneration of the spent chitosan can be effected using alkali solution fig 5 golie and upadhyayula 127 investigated the adsorption capacity of chitosan modified with quaternary ammonium chloride with different degrees of crosslinking it was noted that the crosslinker enhanced the stability of chitosan under acidic conditions but negatively affected the adsorption capacity due to consumption of amino groups nevertheless in another study by banu and meenakshi 128 chitosan modified with quaternary ammonium chloride was able to achieve 78 and 90 removal efficiency for nitrate and phosphate respectively in this study it was noted that the phosphate removal efficiency by the modified chitosan was higher than that for nitrate this was attributed to the fact that phosphate had higher ionic potential than nitrate in the medium electrostatic attraction between quarternized sites i e positively charged and the anions i e negatively charged ion exchange and hydrogen bonding were the mechanisms of reaction between the modified chitosan and the anions fig 6 3 2 non green solid phase materials non green reactive materials used in nutrient recovery are synthetic chemicals prepared either to adsorb or precipitate nutrient from wastewater these reactive materials which include metal oxides hydroxides metal composites ion exchange resins and industrial waste products are listed in table 3 the materials listed in table 3 constituted the largest array of materials that have been sed for nutrient

capacities for each material listed in table 3 hinges on the operational conditions and are not transferable as a rule 81 83 3 2 1 non green inorganic solid phase materials materials containing metal oxides and hydroxides of divalent and trivalent metals e g ca2 fe3 al3 mg2 la3 mn3 and zr3 have been developed and investigated for nutrient recovery due to their low cost of production chemical stability and eco friendliness 41 156 the ease of synthesis modification and the ability to manipulate the surface chemistry have also made them versatile and appealing yu et al 2015 prepared a fe mg la tri metal composite via co precipitation method for the removal of phosphorus from wastewater since the point zero charge of the material was about 6 3 the adsorption of phosphate was favored below this ph value zhang et al 157 investigated the impact of ferric chloride fe iii and ferrous sulphate fe ii on phosphorus removal from aqua system and achieved 80 phosphate recovery in an aerobic chamber phosphate adsorptive capacity of metal oxides and hydroxides have been reported to differ greatly 38 157 different methods have been used for the preparation of metal oxides and hydroxides used as solid phase for nutrient recovery these methods include sol gel precipitation cross linking and metal cation doping ion exchange chemical and hydrothermal method the method of synthesis of metal oxides and hydroxides determines the crystallinity porosity particle size roughness and amorphous structure and these properties influences the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery different metal oxides investigated recently for nutrient recovery include la iii oxide 10 lanthanum hydroxide 158 iron oxide 60 amorphous zirconium oxide nanoparticles 159 zirconium oxide 160 nano hydrous manganese oxide 141 etc zhang et al 158 observed that the adsorption capacity of lanthanum hydroxide doped activated carbon fiber 16 1 mg g was significantly higher than that of lanthanum oxide doped activated carbon fiber 9 5 mg g under the same adsorption conditions struvite map is a slow releasing fertilizer produced by precipitation in the presence of magnesium mg2 ammonium nh4 and phosphate po3 according to the reaction mg2 nh 4 po3 4 6h2o mgnh4po4 6h2o6 the recovery of struvite is only made possible in the presence of mg2 magnesium ion of different sources have been used over the years for struvite precipitation from wastewater which include mg oh 2 mgcl2 mgo 142 the utilization of magnesium derived from cheap sources would have appreciable impact on the overall cost of struvite production 161 hug and udert 162 stated that the use of mgo is a cheaper alternative compared to other magnesium sources such as mgcl2 mgso4 the use of mgo or mg oh 2 is also of advantage as they tend to stabilize the ph of the solution in an optimal range to promote the crystallization of struvite 163 barbosa et al 142 recovered nutrient from source separated urine through struvite precipitation mgo mg oh 2 and mgcl2 were tested as precipitating agents for struvite precipitation from urine when mgcl2 was used p recovery efficiency ranged between 82 and 89 with mg oh 2 the p recovery efficiency ranged between 79 and 93 the p recovery efficiencies ranged between 90 and 99 when mgo was used as mg2 source the ph of the solution increased from 8 5 9 in the first 3 min and remained at 9 2 during the stirring time 10 min due to the affinities of oxides and hydroxides of zirconium for phosphate they have been used in different forms as solid phase materials for phosphorus removal 146 the different forms of zirconium based solid phase materials used for phosphate capture include amorphous zirconium hydroxide 164 hydrous zirconium oxide 165 hydrated zirconium oxide 38 mesoporous zirconium oxide 166 amorphous zirconium oxide nanoparticles 159 multi component adsorbents i e either green or non green possesses physicochemical properties that significantly differentiate them from those of their individual components most of the green reactive materials consist of mixed metal oxides which make them effective for nutrient recovery in order to mimic this researchers have moved on to synthesis different mixed metal oxides or double layered hydroxides for nutrient recovery in different studies al iii sousa et al 2013 cr iii cu ii 167 mn iv 40 ti iv 168 and zr iv 169 have been incorporated into iron oxide to form bimetallic or trimetallic oxide adsorbents with high adsorption capacities for phosphate several binary metal oxides that have been used for phosphate recovery include fe zr oxide 143 fe cu binary oxides 144 fe zr binary oxides 61 ti fe binary oxides 10 using a facile solvothermal technique gu et al 145 synthesized a magnetic spinel zinc ferrite for phosphorus removal the material crystallized as a cubic znfe2o4 the ease of phosphate recovery from the material was achieved due to the magnetic nature of the prepared znfe2o4 the reaction between phosphate and the magnetic zinc ferrite was spontaneous and endothermic in nature yu et al 2015 prepared a fe mg la tri metal composite for phosphorus removal from wastewater the trimetal composite was prepared via co precipitation method and the point zero charge of the material was about 6 3 which favored the adsorption of phosphate jiang et al 118 synthesized a fe3o4 alkali treated calcium silicate fe3o4 asc composite when the composite was used for phosphate recovery the monolayer adsorption capacity obtained was 128 mg g the composite was said to be effective and highly selective at ph value that ranged between 2 5 and13 even in the presence of other anions nearly 100 phosphate removal was achieved when fe3o4 asc composite was used for real lake water treatment in a recent study kondalkar et al 170 synthesized through co precipitation mn zn ti oxide nanocomposite for phosphorus recovery the phpzc of the nanocomposite was 6 2 and at ph value of 6 the maximum phosphate adsorption was 151 mg g the reactivity and adsorptivity of metal hydro oxides have been linked to their particle sizes 171 it has also been discovered that there is a link between the particle size and the point zero charge of metal oxides 141 abbas et al 172 speculated a shift in the phpzc of metal oxides occurring with the decrease in size particularly when it is less than 5 nm madden et al 173 observed a remarkable shift in ph edge for the 7 nm hematite fe2o3 when compared with the 25 nm and 88 nm samples layered double hydroxides ldhs are hydrotalcites or hydrotalcite like compounds htlcs that consist of positively charged brucite like layers with a compensating negatively charged interlayer zone and water molecules the generic formula of ldh structures can be written as m2 1 x m3 x oh 2 x an x n zh2o the m2 in the structure represent divalent cations while the m3 denotes trivalent cations an is the interlayer compensating anions of valence n such as no3 so4 2 co3 2 co3 2 cl so4 2 rco2 of valence n while x is the molar ratio of m3 m2 m3 which ranges from 0 2 0 4 jiang et al 2007 174 when a trivalent cation is isomorphously substituted with a divalent cation in the framework there will be generation of positive charge which made ldhs good adsorbents for many anions the high adsorption capacity of ldhs has been attributed to their large surface area basic surface properties phase purity and structural stability 37 ldhs normally contain two different metals which could be zn al mg al ni fe mg fe co fe etc bhatnagar and silanpaa 2011 ternary or multiple ldhs with multiple metal compositions such as ca al zn ldh 175 zn mg al ldh 176 zn mg ni al ldh 177 have also been prepared iron based ldhs are promising candidates for anion removal and addition of la3 into them were observed to further enhanced the anion removal efficiency 178 in another study the fe3 in mg fe ldhs was replaced with al3 to form mg al ldh the al based ldh showed greater adsorption capacity for anions when compared with the fe based ldh 179 over the years researchers have investigated the efficiency of ldhs in nutrient recovery from aqueous system xue et al 147 synthesized mg al ldh and investigated the efficiency in nitrate removal from water the adsorption capacity of mg al ldh for nitrate was 118 11 mg g in another study tong et al 180 prepared a calcined mg al ldh and investigated its effectiveness on nitrate removal from aqueous medium using similar procedure other calcined mg al ldh chtlcs were synthesized with different metal composition and metal molar ratio yang et al 24 synthesized series of ldhs as adsorbents for nitrate in the study mg al zn fe zn al and mg al fe hydrotalcites were prepared via co precipitation method with different molar ratio the mg fe chtlcs achieved the highest nitrate adsorption capacity 71 05 mg g and the removal efficiency of 96 1 was achieved this high nitrate removal efficiency was closely followed by mgalfe hydrotalcites htlc particles while other ldhs showed poor nitrate removal efficiency the molar ratio of the metal ions had great effect on the nitrate adsorption capacity for phosphate removal ashekuzaman and jiang 2013 prepared various nitrate intercalated ldhs through co precipitation method to identify the best metal precursors for phosphate specific ldh adsorbents different ldhs containing mg al ca al mg fe ca fe mgca al and mgca fe were prepared through co precipitation from the nitrate salts of each of the metals the screening of the ldhs for phosphate removal revealed that the adsorption of phosphate on ca based ldhs e g ca fe ca al and ca dominated ldhs e g mgca3 fe mgca3al 97 99 were much higher than those of mg based ldhs amongst the plethora of solid phase materials that have been investigated as veritable solid phase material for nutrient recovery industrial waste products have been considered as highly promising materials the choice of these waste products as solid phase materials hinged on their low cost and physicochemical characteristics such industrial wastes include fly ash 181 182 blast furnace slag 183 184 red mud 185 etc the industrial waste products that have been investigated and the variables that defined the choice for nutrient capture are presented herein under the various headings viz 3 2 1 1 red mud red mud is an environmentally hazardous industrial waste material derived from alkaline digestion of bauxite in bayer process for alumina production the generation of red mud has been a significant problem in the alumina industry and they are mostly disposed of by landfill for sustainability the alternative uses for red mud are being studied gurudic et al 2013 the high aluminum iron and calcium content as well as its large surface areas and porosity have led to its use as solid phase material for nutrient capture from wastewater cengeloglu et al 149 studied the adsorption efficiency of raw and hcl activated red mud for nitrate removal the acid treated red mud performed better than the raw red mud but a reduction in the capacity was noted at ph value above 7 the adsorption capacity of raw and activated red mud was1 859 and 5 858 mmol no3 g respectively the enhanced capacity of the acid treated red mud was accredited to the leaching of the sodalite compounds na4al3si3o12cl by the acid which could have been responsible for blocking of adsorption sites in the raw red mud in a recent study a novel mechano chemically activated red mud was used as adsorbent for nitrate removal from constant stock nitrate solution the particle size of raw red mud was mechanically reduced to obtain a particle size of 0 149 mm this was chemically activated by boiling diluted hcl the study reported that nitrate removal generally increased with increasing acid concentration and acidification time the maximum nitrate removal efficiency of 75 11 was achieved at acid concentrate of 20 w w and acidification time of 20 min 150 various studies have been conducted using red mud as solid phase material for phosphate removal from aqua system raw and acidified red mud 186 have been used for phosphate adsorption from aqueous medium in a study prajapati et al 185 used raw thermally treated and acid activated red mud for phosphate removal despite the enhanced surface area of the thermally treated red mud the acid activated red mud showed better selective adsorption for phosphate the acid treated red mud achieved phosphate adsorption capacity of 205 1 mg g compared with thermally treated and raw red mud with adsorption capacity of 190 8 mg g and 125 9 mg g respectively 3 2 1 2 fly ash fly ash is a coal combustion product driven out with flue gases fromcoal fired boiler the composition of fly ash depends on the composition of the coal burnt but the major chemical composition includes amorphous and crystalline silicon dioxide sio2 fe2o3 al2o3 feo tio2 cao mno2 and etc the upsurge in the global energy consumption has been identified as the cause of the increase in annual tonnage discharge of fly ash the accumulations of fly ash have resulted into environmental pollution 187 consequently the processing recycling and utilization of fly ash has become an issue at the front burner of research 181 184 188 189 the presence of some metal oxides like al2o3 feo fe2o3 cao and mgo have made fly ash a suitable solid phase material for nutrient recovery 182 190 apart from its chemical compositions the effectiveness of fly ash in nutrient recovery could be attributed to the large specific surface area abundant surface active groups and porosity peng et al 2004 191 192 hermassi et al 181 investigated the use of fly ash as solid phase material for phosphate recovery from aqua system the study posited that the adsorption kinetics of phosphorus uptake by fly ash particles occurred through a diffusion based process the agronomical assay conducted on the recovered nutrient affirmed the potential of this nutrient rich solid phase material in agricultural usage kandel et al 182 prepared a bioretention cell for phosphorus capture by mixing5 fly ash with sand the bioretention cell achieved 85 phosphorus removal by adsorption process ramsey et al 151 investigated different permeable reactive concretes including fly ash for the removal and retention of inorganic nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate phosphorus po4 p fly ash was able to remove 39 of no3 n and more than 91 po4 p 3 2 1 3 slags slag is a byproduct generated from iron and steel production various slag exhibits different chemistry due to the different routes to the production these slags ranges from i electric arc furnace eaf slag a product from the melting of steel scrap iron ore and lime in an electric arc furnace they are rich in fe and ca claveau mallet et al 2014 87 193 194 ii blast furnace bf slag a byproduct of iron ore limestone and coke fused at temperatures above 15000c they are rich in si and ca 195 oguz et al 2004 194 iii basic oxygen furnace slag bof slag generated from the refining of iron in a basic oxygen furnace 196 xue et al 2009 iv melter slag produced when iron sand is converted to melter iron they are rich in ti and al bourke et al 2005 194 v argon oxygen decarburization aod slag produced in the argon oxygen decarburization converter during stainless steel refining to reduce the carbon content to less than 0 05 zhao et al 2013 salman et al 2015 the major chemical compositions of aod are the same as those of eaf stainless steel slag but aod has higher cao and lower sio2 content when compared with aod 197 salman et al 2015 li et al 2017 vi aluminum salt slag is formed as industrial by product during the secondary aluminum production 198 the chemical composition of aluminum salt slag depends mainly on the operation process from which it is produced xrd analysis carried out on aluminum salt slag ren et al 2015 revealed that the major chemical component is aluminum 43 6 other minor constituents include soluble salts of na k and cl and other elements such as si mg fe cu ti zn mn etc the disposal of these slags is a worldwide problem several studies have been conducted to find alternative uses for these industrial wastes which include their use as solid phase material for wastewater remediation 199 200 johansson et al 2010 ramakrishna et al 1997 amongst these studies is the use of slag for nutrient recovery from aqua system several studies have established the use of slag for phosphorus removal and concluded that its efficiency is due to the physical properties and chemical compositions lim et al 2017 201 ahmad et al 2017 ren et al 2015 hussain et al 2014 202 204 claveau mallet et al 2013 han et al 2016 the main mechanism of p removal is based on cao slag dissolution followed by ca phosphate precipitation 196 205 lim et al 2017 zuo et al 2017 barca et al 206 investigated electric arc furnace steel slag eaf slag and basic oxygen furnace steel slag bof slag as solid phase materials for phosphorus removal in a constructed wetland the study was carried out for a period of two years and the eaf slag removed 37 of the inlet total p while the bof slag removed 62 of the total phosphorus bowden et al 196 confirmed that basic oxygen furnace slag bofs achieved higher phosphate removal capacity than other steel slags due to the higher ca content 42 44 cao and free lime content 4 6 while investigating the effects of particle size of slag on phosphorus recovery johansson 1999b reported that phosphate sorption capacity of slag decreased in the following order amorphous coarse bfs amorphous fine bfs fine crystalline bfs coarse crystalline blast furnace slag bfs the slag with large surface area showed more reactive ca availability for phosphate precipitation in a recent study zuo et al 2018 investigated in a column experiment the mechanisms and performances of dual slag filters for phosphate recovery from domestic wastewater the column was packed with blast furnace slag bfs argon oxygen decarburisation slag aod and electric arc furnace slag eaf they were combined in five different ways in different columns the sixth column was packed with only eaf about 99 of the phosphorus was removed within 4 h the study discovered that the column packed with only aef showed the highest phosphate recovery capacity as it removed 240 mg of p out of the 248 9 mg added to the column the removal efficiency of the other columns fluctuated between 60 9and 90 this result was said to be unexpected as the previously conducted batch experiment with synthetic p solution showed that the aod slag had better p removal performance than eaf zuo et al 2016b this was justified with the fact that the amount of aef used in the column experiment was higher than that of aod lim et al 2017 investigated the mathematical model suitable for the description of the adsorption of phosphorus unto eaf and its performance efficiency the results of the study showed that the data fitted best with the langmuir isotherm equation with 0 166 mg g monolayer adsorption capacity it was also observed that eaf with smaller particle size had higher efficiency considering the low performance efficiency of slags in nitrate recovery limited studies have been reported thus far hao 2014 201 so far the highest nitrate removal efficiency obtained was 2 83 mg g hao 2014 due to low efficiency of slags in nitrate removal studies have been conducted to modify these industrial slags to improve their efficiency in a study by duan et al 2013 steel slag was modified with al oh 3 to improve nh3 n removal from aqueous solution in a recent study by yang et al 201 steel slag was modified by soaking dried slag in aluminum hydroxide solution in different ratios at room temperature for 10 h after drying the slag was heated at different temperatures viz 600 700 800 and 9000c with this modification the study achieved nitrate adsorption capacity of 6 165 mg g which was relatively higher than what has been reported in other studies 3 3 composite solid phase materials composite material is prepared by combination of chemically and structurally different constituent materials to ensure improved properties the combination produces a synergistic effect and aggregate properties that are different from those of its constituents the aggregated properties in the composite materials tends to increase the efficiency of such materials several composite materials with micro and nanostructures have been prepared their structures are more finely divided thus particles in the micrometer or nanometer range are produced chung et al 2010 for the purpose of nutrient recovery from aqua system several composite materials have been developed and tested rajendra 2018 golie and upadhyayula 207 prepared a composite material by incorporating metal ions into chitosan matrix and the composite material was tested for nutrient recovery from aqueous system dai et al 52 used chitosan loaded with cu2 for phosphate removal and the integrity of the material remained intact at ph value 4 masheane et al 208 developed a novel chitosan beads grafted with al and functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes f mwcnts for the removal of nitrate from aqua system nitrates removal from water by the chitosan al f mwcnt beads was conducted in a batch adsorption process the study revealed that nitrate uptake was favoured in an acidic medium within a ph value range of 2 6 the percentage removal value of 96 8 was achieved golie and upadhyayula 207 used chitosan alumina for nitrate removal in a column reactor the influence of bed depth flow rate and adsorbate concentration on the efficacy of the reactor was investigated the performance efficiency of the reactor increased with increasing bed height and lower flow rate and influent nitrate concentration enhanced the reactor capacity for nitrate recovery the ability of zr iv crosslinked quaternized chitosan bentonite composite to remove phosphate was studied by wang et al 2018 the adsorption capacity of the composite for phosphate was 65 35 mg g the reaction was exothermic and spontaneous in nature and the adsorption mechanisms included electrostatic interaction ligand exchange and hydrogen bond formation rajeswari et al 154 prepared polyethylene glycol chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol chitosan composites for nitrate removal from aqua system under varying experimental conditions the influence of the composite morphology on nitrate removal was evaluated the abundance of open pores in the adsorbent enhanced mass transfer of nitrate ions onto the chitosan composites the adsorption capacities of peg chitosan and pva chitosan were 50 68 and 35 03 mg g respectively jóźwiak et al 209 explored the possibilities of using chitosan hydrogel beads to simultaneously remove phosphate nitrite and nitrate in a multicomponent system the highest affinity for these species was noted at ph value 4 at the ph value that ranged between 6 and 11 the adsorption of orthophosphate and nitrate onto chitosan proved ineffective the effectiveness of the hydrogel bead was ascribed to the protonation of the surface of the hydrogel leading to an electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent and the anions at higher ph value negative charges predominate the chitosan bead surfaces leading to electrostatic repulsion arshadi et al 130 prepared an iron nanoparticles loaded spondias purpurea seed waste for removal of phosphate from both synthetic and natural water the spondias purpurea seed coats embryo and endosperm were oven dried for 72 h in 700c and ground to powder this was then sieved to obtain particle sizes that ranged between 250 µm and 400 µm the s naoh nzvi nano biocomposite was prepared by modification of the material with naoh and fecl2 4h2o the kinetic study of the s naoh nzvi nano biocomposite in phosphate removal was studied after 5 min percentages of p removal were 99 9 88 3 and 86 0 at an initial concentration of 19 45 and 150 mg l respectively manganese oxides mno is a transition metal oxide with strong surface reactivity and high surface area due to the specific surface properties low point zero charge mno cannot be used directly to adsorb anions like nitrate and phosphate the point of zero charge phpzc of most mno ranges between 2 and 3 210 211 near neutral ph value manganese oxides are negatively charged thus it cannot effectively adsorb anionic species because of electrostatic repulsion 212 in order to enhance its phosphate removal ability pan et al 141 synthesized a nano hydrous manganese oxide hmo and immobilized it within a polystyrene anion exchanger ns the point zero charge of the resulting nanocomposite hmo ns shifted from 6 2 for the untreated hmo to 10 5 for the capsulated hmo thereby making nanoparticles positively charged at neutral ph the ph shift allowed the predominance of positive charge on the surface of the nanoparticles thereby enhancing the phosphate adsorption different studies have also been carried out to modify zirconium based solid phase material for an enhanced phosphorus capture these modifications include zirconium loaded with gel 138 zirconium loaded on monophosphonic acid resin 213 hydrous zirconium oxide loaded on anion exchange resin 60 biomass based hydrous zirconium oxide nanocomposite 214 fibers loaded with zirconium hydroxide 213 binary oxides of zirconium loaded on other metals 10 143 the results from these studies showed that the mechanism of reaction of zirconium based adsorbent is based on the adsorption of phosphate to the surface hydroxyl of zirconia 10 the maximum adsorption capacity of pure zirconium oxide nanoparticles and the modified zirconium based adsorbent for phosphorus in all these investigations ranged between 99 01 mg g and 131 6 mg g 146 zhang et al 157 investigated the effectiveness of different sizes of anthracites modified with nine types of ldhs for nh4 n removal from wastewater the various m2 m3 cations incorporated include mg al ca fe mg fe zn al ca co zn co ca co mg co ca al and zn fe in 2 1 m ratio from their respective chloride salts the column experiments for treatment of sewage wastewater using these solid phase materials were set up to simulate the vertical flow constructed wetland the average removal efficiencies of total nitrogen and nh4 n for all the tested substrates ranged between53 7 and89 8 and 68 0 91 6 respectively a scrap tire is a tire that is no longer in use the recycled shredded tire chips material are coarse aggregates lightweight material with long term stability tire with porosity of 0 6 215 it has been discovered that over one billion waste tires are generated annually worldwide and in the year 2007 303 million scrap tires were produced in the united states about 54 of the recovered tires are used as fuel followed by ground rubber 17 and civil engineering applications 12 us environmental protection agency 2011 216 218 in less developed countries most of this worn out tires are often dumped illegally 219 finding alternative use for scrap tires has led to its use in wastewater treatment lin et al 2010 215 220 the use of scrap tire in nutrient recovery have been studied 221 223 large amounts of steel wires are embedded into tires to provide strength and stability when tires are shredded the wires become visible due to the presence of the steel iron tire chips have good ion exchange capacity which enables their use as buffer material adsorbing and releasing nitrate nitrogen and phosphate 222 wanielista et al 224 found out that the use of recycled tires significantly decreased the concentration of orthophosphate and total phosphorus in water treated with a mixture of tire crumb and soils a diminution in nitrate nitrite and nh3 was also observed using tire crumb to reduce limiting nutrients can minimize the negative ecological impact and at the same time reduced the human footprint left by used tires garcía pérez et al 152 investigated the ability of recycled shredded tire chips in the treatment of strongly polluted bakery wastewater at the end of the three year experimental period the total treatment percentage removal efficiencies were potassium 36 total nitrogen 56 total kjeldahl nitrogen 57 total phosphorus 65 total suspended solids 69 ammonia nitrogen 87 five day biochemical oxygen demand 92 escherichia coli 97 and fat oil and grease total 99 krayzelova et al 222 investigated the effectiveness of a composite made up of scrap tire chips elemental sulfur pellets and crushed oyster shells in the adsorption of nitrate from synthetic wastewater in a column study the composite achieved high nitrate removal efficiencies under steady condition 90 at variable flow 89 and variable concentration 94 conditions during the nitrate adsorption study phosphate was slightly adsorbed to the scrap tires at an adsorption capacity of 0 022 mg g 1 of scrap tires ammonium removal was also observed but it was discovered that the initial concentration of ammonium was too low to calculate the amount of ammonium as nitrogen adsorbed per gram of tire 4 choice of solid phase material for nutrient capture an overview a systematic appraisal of the solid phase materials that have been investigated for nutrient removal showed that both organic and inorganic based materials derived from both natural and synthetic origins have been extensively investigated for nutrient recovery plethora of these materials have been used either as adsorbents or reactive materials for either nutrient fraction capture or recovery from aqueous streams taking into cognizance the research aim delineated in the different research reports that were reviewed the purpose of the use of these arrays of investigated solid phase materials were just two folds in the first case the nutrient fraction is captured because of the potential pollution effects of the presence in the aqua stream in the second instance the nutrient fractions are recovered for reuse because of the potentials as valuable resources considering the purposes of the two aforementioned operations the variables that defined the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient fraction recovery is totally at variance with that of the nutrient fraction capture for reuse while a less stringent conditions may be required in the choice of solid phase materials for pollution control purposes a more stringent condition is definitely required for resource recovery purposes high affinity of the solid phase material for the nutrient fraction which is the major consideration for nutrient capture is not sufficient for a material to be considered for nutrient recovery purposes a good example is the observation that solid phase materials that are rich in calcium aluminium magnesium and iron show high affinity for phosphate despite the high affinities of these different metal phases for phosphate the bond strengths between the metal ion and phosphate differ greatly while iron and aluminium tenaciously bind to the phosphorus fraction the other metal ions tenuously bind to phosphorus thus these differences in the bond strengths between phosphorus and the different metal ions determine the nutrient availability to plants in soil in order to design an eco friendly and sustainable p recovery system morse et al 45 surmised that the choice of the solid phase material is salient this caveat was occasioned by the fact that a too tightly bound phosphorus to the solid phase material would be inapplicable in industrial and agricultural applications although the removal of p from aqua stream using aluminium and iron rich materials is prevalent but it is unattractive for the recovery and reuse purpose this is due to the tenacious interaction between the metal phase and the recovered phosphorus furthermore aluminium is toxic to many plants and some soil organisms 225 thus mg2 and ca2 rich materials are preferred for p recovery because of the potential of the nutrient laden adsorbent to be reused as fertilizer the toxicity of the solid phase material is also very important in either the use of solid phase material for both pollution abatement or for the purpose of resource recovery because the leaching of toxic species into water matrix in either case portends danger in other to adequately predict and ascertain the efficiency of a solid phase material in nutrient fraction capture and to determine the potential for reuse in agricultural practice and the process safety adequate knowledge of the solid phase material is apposite in order to gain insight into the knowledge of the solid phase materials to be used a comprehensive characterization protocol should be adopted before the commencement of the recovery process adequate knowledge of the solid phase material via comprehensive characterization would go a long way to ameliorate unforeseen challenges during the process of nutrient capture and recovery and product applications 5 conclusion the primary consideration for the choice of a solid phase material was the nutrient adsorption capacity other important variables identified include the pore size ph values chemical and mineralogical assemblage and surficial physiognomies for sustainability the material must be cheap non toxic reusable with no risk to soil or water quality and must ready be able to release the nutrient recovered for agricultural purposes the solid phase material should also have good hydraulic conductivity to minimize the risk of clogging or the occurrence of preferential flow when applied as barriers or fitters in addition the knowledge of the concentration and bioavailability of possible contaminants leached from the solid phase material is imperative an overview of the different solid phase materials that have been used for nutrient recovery showed that they can be broadly classified as green and non green solid phase materials this broad classification can also be subdivided into organic inorganic and composite solid phase materials 226 357 declaration of competing interest none 
14170,since the bourgeoning interest in solid phase recovery of nutrient from wastewater a large number of solid phase materials have been investigated either as adsorbents or reactive materials in nutrient recovery technologies the theoretical basis for the choice of these material are often shrouded and not teased out which made it difficult to understand the underlying mechanism of the recovery process in this treatise an overview of the theoretical basis for the choice of solid phase material for nutrient recovery from wastewaters was provided the primary consideration for the choice of a solid phase material for nutrient recovery include the nutrient adsorption capacity the pore size ph values chemical and mineralogical assemblage and surficial physiognomies in order to ensure the sustainability of the process the material must be readily available low cost eco friendly and ease of nutrient release for plant growth good hydraulic conductivity to minimize the risk of clogging when applied as barriers or filters was also identified furthermore an evaluation of the concentration and bioavailability of possible contaminants leached from the solid phase material is required despite the plethora of materials that have been investigated as solid phase material they can be easily classified as green and non green materials this classification can be further sub divided into organic inorganic and composite solid phase materials keywords adsorbent adsorption nitrate nutrient recovery phosphate reactive material 1 introduction the united nations environment program has discovered that pollution emanating from nutrient discharge is one of the biggest environmental challenges of the 21st century rural intensive industries such as abattoirs piggeries chicken farms tanneries wool scours feedlots dairy farm and related factories produce large quantities of effluents that contain valuable nutrients i e phosphate and nitrate 1 3 it has been estimated that about 8 of nitrogen and 14 of phosphorus used in agricultural practices enter municipal wastewater penuelas et al 2012 human sewage is another nutrient rich wastewater although the nutrient content depends on the diet 4 in domestic wastewater urine contributes 50 80 of the phosphorous concentration and 75 of the nitrogen concentration excreted in the form of urea simha and ganesapillai 2016 arredondo et al 2015 5 the rich nutrient constituents of these wastewaters can be captured recovered and reused to improve soil fertility this is because nitrates and phosphates are essential plant nutrient requirements that enhance the growth and yield undesirable plants such as algae and macrophytes also bloom uncontrollably in water bodies with high nutrient load the nutrient initiate and propagate the process of eutrophication 6 8 zobo 7 the concept of resource recovery has provided a paradigm shift in wastewater perception rather than perceive nutrient laden wastewater as a disposable waste it is now considered a valuable resource that can add to the inventory of opportunities available for humanity 2 9 10 over the years the concept of nutrient recovery and reuse has been promoted through the development of innovative technologies such technologies include the use of biological nutrient uptakes 11 14 zhou et al 2015 15 bioelectrochemical systems bes nutrient uptake 16 19 chemical precipitation 20 electrocoagulation 21 22 adsorption and ion exchange 23 27 employing the processes of adsorption and ion exchange for nutrient recovery and reuse involve the use of a solid phase material that can physically or chemically interacts with the nutrient fraction in the aqua matrix woumfo et al 2015 28 29 these materials can be used either in the form of a fixed bed column system or as a dispersed phase in aqua medium to be settled out in a downstream clarifier 30 oladoja et al 2016 pan et al 2012 31 huser et al 2015 the review of nutrient recovery technologies whose operational principles hinges on solid phase recovery showed that a large number of solid phase materials have been studied either as adsorbents or reactive materials 32 35 oftentimes the justification for the choice of these materials are shrouded and not properly delineated which made it difficult to understand the underlying mechanism of the recovery process in any scientific operation the knowledge of the underlying mechanism of the process provides opportunities to modify and improve the process for enhanced performances in the present treatise we aimed at interrogating the trends in the use of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery to gain an insight into the variables that defined the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery explicating the variables that defined the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery would enable professionals in this field of study to make informed decision on the appropriate choice of material for specific purposes 2 the variables that define the choice of a solid phase material the nutrient binding characteristics nbc of a solid phase material is the physicochemical characteristics that enables it to interact favourably with nutrient fraction in aqueous system the knowledge of the nbc of a material is required before it is chosen for a particular application an appraisal of the nbc of the different solid phase materials that have been evaluated for nutrient recovery showed that they are strongly related to their physicochemical characteristics these include pore size ph value chemical and mineralogical assemblage and crystallographic property and textural and surficial physiognomies for sustainability the material must be abundant cheap non toxic reusable with no risk to soil or water quality and must readily release the nutrient recovered for plant use 36 in addition to the use of the nbc as criterion for material selection they are also needed for estimating the dosage of material needed to control the process of nutrient recovery at the desired level cucarella and renman 2009 further to good nbc the solid phase material should have good hydraulic conductivity to minimize the risk of system clogging or the occurrence of preferential flow when applied as barriers or filters furthermore the concentration and bioavailability of possible inorganic contaminants leached from the solid phase material must be evaluated this is because some solid phase materials may contain high levels of trace metals and heavy metals that can easily get leached into the water matrix 2 1 chemical composition consequent upon the amphoteric nature of materials that are rich in ca al mg and fe they perform better in the removal of oxoanions from aqua streams thus reactive materials that are rich in this array of metallic species are often used in nutrient recovery processes 37 39 in phosphate recovery materials that have shown high potentials are usually rich in ca fe al and mg the presence of these ions in any solid matrix enhances the phosphorus recovery either through precipitation or adsorption 40 41 interactions of reactive materials that are rich in ca fe and al with aqua phase p have been posited to involve a number of physicochemical associations these could be the formation of discrete secondary minerals surface adsorption internal ion exchange and precipitate formation 29 42 yu et al 2015 43 the precipitation of phosphate from aqua systemis usually initiated by the addition of a divalent or a trivalent metal ion e g magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 aluminium al3 or ferric iron fe3 44 or materials that are rich in this array of metals the choice of metal ion for phosphorus recovery amongst the aforementioned metal ions is important because the recovered phosphorus that is too tightly bound to the metal ion cannot readily be reused for industrial and agricultural purposes 45 magnesium and calcium rich precipitate are generally reused as fertilizer although the removal of phosphorus using aluminium and iron based precipitation is quite common in wastewater treatment caravelli et al 2010 but the phosphorus in iron phosphates is considered to be unavailable to plants although a fraction of the insoluble phosphorus may eventually become bioavailable depending on hydration or aging 46 2 2 ph value the effectiveness of any solid phase material in nutrient recovery strongly depends on the surface charge of the material 47 50 the ph of the solid solution system directly affects the surface charge of the material it is also a very important parameter to consider when choosing a material for nutrient recovery 51 53 nutrient recovery procedure using solid phase materials spans through a wide ph range 54 phosphate exist in different forms as a result of the variation in the ph value of the medium dai et al 2014 thus the ph of the system influences the available phosphate species fig 1 in a nutrient rich medium the different orthophosphates species are described by the following equations with their respective pka values at 25 c clifford 1961 1 p o 4 3 h 2 o h p o 4 2 o h pk 1 68 2 h p o 4 2 h 2 o h 2 p o 4 o h pk 6 79 3 h 2 p o 4 h 2 o h 3 p o 4 o h pk 11 67 4 h 2 o h o h pk 14 00 the phosphate speciation fig 1 which corroborated the position earlier canvassed by clifford 1961 was plotted using the medusa make equilibrium diagrams using sophisticated algorithms and hydra hydrochemical equilibrium constant database computer software clifford 1961 indicated the presence of h2po4 and hpo4 2 species at ph values that ranged between 5 and 10 the concentration of h2po4 specie is higher for ph value below 7 while hpo4 2 specie predominate over other species at ph values that ranged between 7 and 10 for ph values that ranged between 10 and 12 hpo4 2 predominate over po4 3 specie while for ph values higher than 12 5 the concentration of po4 3 was more abundant thus it is glaring that the influence of the ph of the solid phase material for phosphate recovery must be considered in any recovery procedure generally solid phase material with positive surface charge is required for effective recovery of nitrate nitrate uptake decreases in an alkaline medium due to the prevalence of oh ouardi et al 55 investigated the effects of the solution ph value on the adsorption of nitrate on a new clay and reported that the percentage nitrate removal decreased from 92 72 to 38 96 when the ph value was increased from 2 to 10 in any case of nitrate adsorption the ph dependency is related to the surface charge of the reactive material sowmya and meenakshi 56 reported that the adsorption capacity of ion exchange resin duolite a 171 remained the same in the ph value range of 3 9 and started to decrease after ph value of 9 daud et al 57 studied the effect of ph on nitrate removal using fe pt bimetallic nanoparticles and anionic exchange resins it was discovered that for anionic resin 82 5 nitrate removal was achieved at a contact time of 60 min and a value of 4 but there was a notable decrease in the efficiency of the material with increasing ph value chatterjee and woo 58 reported that the removal of nitrate on chitosan beads increased when solution ph value decreased from 8 to 3 due to protonation protonation increased the surface positive charge of the adsorbent which resulted in increased electrostatic attraction of nitrate and an enhanced nitrate removal capacity in some adsorbents reduction in the ph value led to a decrease in the solid phase adsorption capacity for example in the study by bhatnagar et al 59 the percentage of nitrate removal by zncl2 modified gac was almost constant at the ph range 4 11 however it decreased at ph value of 3 due to competition with cl ions which was added as hcl to adjust the solution ph value 2 3 textural properties in the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery a significant factor that is considered is the particle size the material must be significantly permeable to allow water flow through it without rapid clogging the porosity value provides information on the volume of voids in a material and how much water can actually come in contact with such material the particle size of any solid phase material is in direct relationship with the pore size and surface area the smaller the particle size the smaller the pore size of the material and the higher the surface area generally effectiveness of a material in nutrient recovery is enhanced by large surface area small particle and pore sizes nano solid phase materials have been found promising in nutrient recovery this is because of their higher surface area greater active sites and better selectivity 10 60 61 proving the effectiveness of nanoparticles for nutrient removal markeb et al 62 used magnetite nanoparticles mnps for phosphate removal and achieved adsorption capacity of more than 4 9 mg po4 3 g premised on the excellent features e g small size large surface area and highly reactive surfaces of zero valent iron nanoparticles nvzi they exhibit high potential for the removal of nitrate and phosphate 63 64 from the aqueous system studying the effects of particle sizes jóźwiakowski et al 2017 investigated the influence of the particle size of carbonate siliceous rock on the efficiency of phosphorous removal from domestic wastewater the studied particle sizes were 1 2 mm 2 5 mm and 5 10 mm the highest removal efficiency 97 was achieved with the substrate having the smallest particle size and the lowest phosphorus removal efficiency was observed with the filter containing rocks with a particle size of 5 10 mm jeon and yeom 47 investigated the use of crab shell for phosphate removal it was noted that the shell with particle size of less than 1000 μm had more than 85 phosphate removal efficiency within a period of 24 h from a 500 mg l phosphate solution whereas with a larger shell particles size of 3350 μm the efficiency of the material reduced to 50 jeon and yeom 2008 affirmed that the particle size of scallop shell used for phosphate removal affected both the removal rate as well as the removal capacity they observed that within 3 h the shell with particle size of 20 or 45 mm removed 100 of 100 mg l of phosphate the ones with the particle size of 100 mm removed 76 of 100 mg l phosphate in 8 h and particle size of 300 mm took 24 h for 75 removal when the particle size was increased to 500 mm it took 80 h to remove more than 95 of 100 mg l of phosphate but the shells of 1000 and 3000 mm in size removed only 49 and 21 of the phosphate in 80 h mikhak et al 65 investigated the effect of nano fe oh 3 clinoptilolite on nitrate and phosphate removal the nanomaterial achieved a removal efficiency of 90 and 80 of phosphate and nitrate respectively the efficiency of the material was ascribed to its nano particle size xiao et al 66 investigated the effects of sediments particle size on the adsorption of phosphate the particle sizes were divided into d1 0 30 μm d2 30 63 μm d3 63 92 μm and d4 92 125 μm the results of the effectiveness of each of the particle sizes are shown in fig 2 in the context of using solid phase materials in aquatic system to sequester nutrient in sediment the pollution of the overlying water is avoided with the use of solid phase materials with higher particle size this is because denser solid phase materials get sedimented easily this also preclude the suspension of the solid phase material on water surface 2 4 ecological risk the environmental impact of a solid phase material is a factor that must be considered before the choice for a particular application consequently comprehensive ecotoxicological assay should be performed to determine the possibility of severe and lingering ecotoxicological effects on the aquatic organisms these tests should also include the effects of physical changes in the water body lethal doses of such material effect of such material on aquatic lives and determination of elemental composition to ascertain the presence of toxic metals 31 67 van oosterhout and lurling 2011 2013 61 68 the addition of phosphorus inactivating solid phase material may increase metal ions in aquatic environment this will possibly lead to their accumulation in the food chain and finally posed a risk to human health 69 phoslock a lanthanum la modified bentonite that is commonly used to inactivate phosphorus in aqueous medium contain a reactive lanthanum which is considered toxic 70 73 the lethal dose ld50 of lacl3 as 4200 mg la per kilogram body weight for rats has been confirmed 74 many of the reactive materials used for nutrient recovery contains aluminum as the active component and it has been discovered that aluminum is acutely toxic at high level dose at ph value that ranged between 4 and 6 a dose of 0 1and 0 2 mg l aluminum can cause the reduction of survival and growth of larvae and post larvae 75 76 as for the risks on human health the presence of excess aluminum in drinking water gave rise to the discussions on possible neuropathological diseases such as alzheimer s diseases dementia in dialysis and encephalopathy 77 it was discovered that the kidney dialysis patients suffer dementia when the aluminum content of the dialysis fluid reached 0 08 mg l davison et al 77 it is hereby postulated that in simulation experiments the residual ions in solutions should be quantified after using any solid phase material for nutrient recovery before it is recommended for real life applications researchers that are conscious of the risk factors of their materials considered such tests and ascertain that the ecological and health risks of the materials are low 72 reitzel et al 2005 spears et al 31 in the study of different industrial waste products which included red ochre black ochre gypsum mag dust and vermiculite modified lanthanum bentonite product phoslock for p immobilization in sediments comparatively assessed the elemental composition of the materials and other ecotoxicological test to underpin regulatory policy decisions regarding the use of industrial waste products for pollution control in water bodies 3 making a choice materials of different types have been employed as solid phase materials for nutrient capture and recovery from the aqua system an overview of these solid phase materials showed that they can be broadly classified as green and non green materials under this classification a subdivision dubbed as organic and inorganic based green and no green materials is also provided the trend in the choice of solid phase materials vis à vis the theoretical justifications for the choice for nutrient capture and recovery from the aqua system are critically reviewed herein 3 1 green solid phase materials green solid phase materials are the naturally occurring materials globally green materials have gained the attentions of environmental scientist and engineers because they serve as sources of cheap materials for pollution remediation the choice of green solid phase materials for nutrient recovery was based on their unique chemical composition abundance renewability low cost eco friendliness and higher efficiency when rightly chosen the green solid phase materials that have been investigated for nutrient recovery include sands soils clays and rocks 78 79 plant parts such as husks tree backs 43 and 2015 and animal wastes such as seashells chitin and egg shell 41 2017 and 2012 saliu et al 2019 36 80 chowdhury et al 2010 in this discourse the green solid phase materials are further classified as organic and inorganic green solid phase materials 3 1 1 green inorganic solid phase material the green inorganic solid phase materials are naturally occurring material whose chemical composition are mainly inorganic derivatives examples of selected green inorganic solid phase materials e g alumina titania silica magnesia calcite ferrites etc are delineated in table 1 an overview of these materials showed that they were derived from naturally occurring minerals and animal by products the synonymous physicochemical characteristics that informed the choice for nutrient recovery was the high calcium iron and aluminium concentrations which enhanced the nutrient removal capacities especially phosphorus the selected materials exhibited different nutrient removal capacities but it is noteworthy that the reported capacities are functions of the operational conditions and are not transferable as a rule 81 83 the presence of these green inorganic materials in different types of soils clays and rocks situate them as veritable materials for nutrient recovery 92 arias et al 2001 86 pan et al 2013 soils that are rich in ca fe or al are generally effective in nutrient capture from waste streams arias et al 2001 posited that the presence of ca in soil materials was the most important parameter in determining p uptake by sands this is because of the precipitation of the phosphate fraction of the aqua stream as calcium phosphate mineral other soil materials that are rich in fe and mg have been reported to be effective in nutrient recovery dai and pan 2014 pan et al 2013 güngör and ünlü 78 have used sandy clay loamy sand and sandy loam soils for the removal of nitrate and nitrite from wastewater with the efficiency of over 90 a type of sand called monsary sand was used by forbes et al 79 for phosphorus recovery they noted that sand have poor affinity for phosphorus contrariwise sands that are rich in clay and silt particles or rich in minerals can be used for phosphorus recovered and pan 2014 investigated the effect of red soil in removing phosphorus from water column and reducing phosphorus release from the sediment the maximum p adsorption capacity of 1 29 and 2 22 mg g at ph 8 5 and 5 5 respectively were recorded the removal efficiency of the acid activated red mud was higher than that of the ordinary red mud with adsorption capacity of 5 858 and 1 859 mmol g respectively 86 carbonate rich materials e g limestone dolomite calcite and magnesite have been used as solid phase materials for the uptake of p from natural and wastewaters samples 85 93 94 dai et al 2016 limestone is a sedimentary rock largely composed of calcium carbonate caco3 limestone is rich in calcium which makes it a suitable material for nutrient recovery crushed limestone can serve as filter material and the resulting nutrient laden material can be used as soil amendment limestone facilitates p precipitation because it is rich in calcium shilton et al 93 in a batch experiment achieved 64 p removal using a new zealand limestone dolomite a sedimentary rock composed of calcium magnesium carbonate camg co3 2 with heteroporous structure its reaction mechanism in nutrient recovery is either by adsorption or precipitation 85 soils clays and rocks with aluminosilicates magnesium rich silicates or calcium silicates as their major structural framework have been studied as solid phase materials for nutrient capture 95 96 allophane soil pumic soil and zeolites have aluminosilicates as their major structural framework the choice of these materials for nutrient capture was attributed to their chemical compositions highly porous nature large specific surface area and low bulk densities 95 the unit particles of aluminosilicate minerals consist of hollow aluminosilicate nanoballs with an outer diameter of 3 5 5 0 nm they also carry electric charges from substitution of al3 and or si4 by cations of lower valencies and the gain or loss of protons as solution ph values changes these properties of aluminosilicates defined their choice as effective solid phase materials for nutrient recovery from wastewater when aluminosilicates are used for phosphorus recovery the p is precipitated as aluminum phosphate 95 moharami and jalali 97 studied the use of modified clays for the adsorption of phosphorus from aqueous solutions kaolinite bentonite calcite and zeolite were modified with fecl3 cacl2 and nacl and used for the removal of phosphorus bentonite is a typical 2 1 type clay mineral that contains one octahedral sheet that is sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets because of the presence of substituted metal cation in the framework they possessed permanent negative charge in the surface which is balanced by cationic counter ions in the interlayer space zhu 2012 these bentonite characteristics made them a suitable adsorbent for both anionic and cationic water pollutants in order to enhance the adsorption capacity for phosphate different methods have been used to modify bentonite clay chen et al 98 investigated the performance of thermally treated bentonite clay for phosphate removal from aqua system it was reported that the bentonite thermally treated at 8000c achieved 94 phosphate removal from a 10 mg p l solution recently phoslock a lanthanum modified bentonite clay became popular in phosphorus removal 31 70 73 phoslock stabilizes the aqueous active phosphorus by forming lapo4chelate precipitate thus la3 po43 lapo45 kasprzyk and gajewska 99 investigated the effectiveness of phoslock in phosphorus removal from a synthetic wastewater over 95 removal efficiency was achieved and the ph value of the aqueous medium remained the same yuan and wu 100 compared the phosphorus adsorption capacity of allophane and phoslock and discovered that allophane effectively removed p from a wide range of phosphate concentrations at high solution allophane ratios it was also discovered that allophane did not dissolve in water and can be easily recovered and reused for soil amendment when the performance efficiency was compared with that of phoslock it had a higher p removal capacity than phoslock degens et al 101 used allophane for phosphate removal from a dairy effluent the study revealed that 91 of the p in the effluent was removed over a period of two 2 years the choice of allophane rock soil or clay in phosphate recovery was ascribed to their chemical compositions porosity peculiar charge characteristics and small particle sizes zeolites are crystalline hydrated aluminosilicates of alkali and alkaline earth metals with three dimensional atomic structures natural zeolites were effective for the removal of p and nh4 n but not for nitrate 88 102 the aluminosilicate lattice of all forms of zeolites are negatively charged making them to lack adsorptive ability for anionic nitrate ions zeolites that were reported to effectively remove nitrate were modified some of the reported modifications include coating of zeolite surface with surfactants joachim et al 2011 103 low cost chitosan 104 doping with different metal precursors 61 105 106 etc using a natural zeolite lin et al 88 achieved removal efficiency of 98 9 for p and 68 9 for nh4 n from orthophosphate and ammonium nitrogen rich wastewaters at ph value that ranged between 3 and 11 in a batch and continuous reactor chen et al 107 used nano zeolites synthesized from fly ash zfa to remove nh4 n and p in anaerobically digested swine wastewater the values of n and p removal efficiencies ranged between 41 and 95 and 75 and 98 respectively with zfa dosage range between 0 25 and8g 100 ml the adsorption capacity was ascribed to the wastewater properties the colloidal properties and the negatively charged layer of zeolites 107 polonite is a green solid phase material with calcium silicate as its major framework the calcium silicate material with 50 silica and 45 calcium carbonate efficiently reduced the concentration of phosphorus p and bacteria in effluent 89 108 gustafsson 2008 polonite is rich in calcium which makes it a suitable solid phase material for the recovery of p from wastewater 109 cucarella et al 110 investigated the effect of polonite used for phosphorus removal from wastewater on soil properties and fertility of a mountain meadow it was discovered that after the wastewater treatment the p load on the polonite ranged between 0 4 and 1 5 g kg the filtration ability of polonite in a well that collects and treats effluent from a septic tank was studied for 28 days 111 the wastewater was received from a single household and passed through the polonite filter bed in the study phosphorus laden polonite was recommended for agricultural use renman and renman 89 tested the effectiveness of polonite for phosphate removal in a column and full scale systems using synthetic and domestic wastewater for a period of 67 92 weeks operating under different hydrological conditions in the synthetic solution 530 l m 2 d 1 fed into a column the total phosphate removal of 97 was achieved in the absence of organic matter during the 68 weeks period of study in a compact bed filled with municipal wastewater 76 7 l m 2 d 1 and 560 kg of polonite the average phosphate removal achieved was 89 after 92 weeks of operation in a recent study karczmarczyk et al 112 used polonite in the form of suspended filter for nutrient removal three curtains consisting of eight suspended bags were filled with 1200 g polonite as a solid phase material for p capture the ratio of the mass of the solid phase material to the water volume in hydraulic block was 3 1 g dm3 the study showed successive removal of phosphorus from water by polonite regardless of the initial concentration as the orthophosphate wollastonite a calcium metasilicate mineral casio3 or caosio2 has proven to be effective as solid phase material for nutrient recovery in an impure form the other elemental impurities in the rawwollastonite ore include iron fe aluminum al manganese mn magnesium mg and titanium with iron fe being the most abundant the effectiveness of wollastonite in phosphorus removal was attributed to the calcium and ferrous ions rich nature 113 the presence of these ionic species in wallastonite made it possible for phosphorus removal either through precipitation reaction or adsorption richman 113 found that wollastonite had very good p removal efficiency achieving about 87 80 removal brooks et al 84 designed a full scale constructed wetland and tested the efficiency of wollastonite in phosphate recovery in the study secondary wastewater was pumped upward through columns 1 5 m by 15 cm filled with wollastonite the soluble phosphorus concentrations in the treated and untreated water samples were monitored for four hundred and eleven 411 days and more than 80 p removal was recorded serpentine h4mg3si2o9 a magnesium rich silicate mineral that is associated with ultra basic igneous rocks the nutrient recovery performance in a laboratory test was satisfactory 87 but its efficiency and life span decreased drastically when used to treat real effluent the quest for cheap and ecofriendly solid phase materials for nutrient recovery from wastewater has prompted researchers towards the use of marine shells and egg globally the marine lives from which the shells are derived are sources of food however after the edible portions are removed considerably large amount of the shells is discarded as waste the growing accumulation of waste from the processing of these marine lives for human consumption has become a great concern for environmental managers yearly about 6 8 million tonnes of waste mollusc crab shrimp and lobster shells are produced globally 114 in korea for example about 300 000 tones of oyster shells are generated annually in the developing countries the waste shells are often discarded in landfill or dumped indiscriminately these methods of disposing waste shells are liable to cause environmental issues such as generation of offensive odors soil pollution and damage to the marine ecosystem in the developed countries the costs associated with the waste shell disposal are significant in order to avoid these challenges researchers are strategically devising means of turning these waste shells into products that could provide additional values the shells of some of these animals e g mollusca are majorly composed of calcium carbonate which makes them a promising source of calcium 42 115 116 the non toxic high porosity and high surface area to volume ratio of calcium carbonate generated from these waste shells makes them beneficial for many industrial applications 39 114 yuangsawad and ranong 2011 investigated the use of oyster shell for phosphorus removal from wastewater the thermally treated oyster shell contained 97 to 95 7 cao which was discovered to be efficient in phosphorus capture the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity was 583 5 mg p g sea urchin is a popular seafood in japan that generates large amount of waste this is because the percentage of the edible parts is just 20 while the remnant is mainly shell the main component of the sea urchin shell is calcium carbonate magdan et al 2004 like other marine shells sea urchin shells can be used as a calcium resource onoda et al 117 investigated the use of sea urchin to recover phosphate from artificially polluted water and observed that the thermally treated sea urchin shell recovered phosphate from water through precipitation reaction jiang et al 118 introduced a new calcium silicate composite csc prepared from waste glass and shells for phosphorus recovery the composite was treated in an alkali medium to improve its efficiency the major chemical composition of this composite was sio2 and cao the alkaline treated adsorbent asc showed higher adsorption capacity due to its higher specific surface area and total pore volume the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities obtained were 120 mg g and73 0 mg g for asc and for csc respectively waste eggshell generated on daily bases from households bakeries and restaurants is made up of majorly calcium carbonate they are porous materials which makes them suitable for use for phosphorus removal from aqua system 36 the use of egg shells either treated or raw shells for nutrient recovery have been documented kose and kıvanc 91 used calcined egg shells for phosphate removal from aqueous solutions the effects of calcination temperatures of egg shell on phosphate removal was studied by varying the temperature from 200 to 1000 for 2 h within the calcination s temperature studied caco3 and cao were identified as the major chemical composition of the egg shell after 790 it was observed that the caco3 component of the egg shell has almost transformed completely to cao the authors ascribed the 100 removal efficiency of the material to the observed chemical transformation in two different studies al eggshell solid phase material was developed for phosphorus recovery in the first study the eggshells were doped with al using alcl3 solution the material achieved 96 4 phosphorus recovery 90 in the second study guo et al 36 prepared aluminum modified eggshell by blending eggshell with alcl3 solution to obtain 100 mesh aluminum modified eggshell for phosphorus recovery from aqua system the modified egg shells showed better phosphate adsorption capacity than the unmodified egg shells mezenner and bensmaili 119 doped iron hydroxide with eggshell by mixing fecl3 with eggshell and discovered that the phosphate adsorption capacity of the iron hydroxide eggshell was 2 017 mg p g gastropod is pervasive thus a high magnitude of the shell gs ended up as waste materials this made it an ample and economical solid phase material for phosphate recovery 42 the calcareous layer of the shell is typically made of calcium carbonate oladoja et al 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 oladoja et al 120 investigated the use of gastropod shell as ca ion source for phosphorus removal via the crystallization process in a simulation study the shell is made of very high inorganic fractions and ca2 predominated amongst the metal ions the phosphorus removal efficiency of the gastropod shell was high in a phosphate solution concentration that ranged between 25 and 1000 mg l the solution ph and ionic strength of the solution had no influence on the phosphate removal efficiency phosphate removal via the crystallization process was said to occurred through interaction between the phosphate the ca species and the hydroxyl group of the medium to form any of the species of the phosphate minerals the phosphate removal efficiency of thermally treated gastropod shell was investigated in aquaculture wastewater 41 the phosphorus removal efficiency of the different thermally treated shell varied with the calcination temperature fig 3 the thermal treatment appreciably improved the p removal efficiency of the gs and the optimum treatment temperature was achieved at 750 the higher p recovery ability achieved at this temperature was attributed to the enhanced defects in the surficial features oladoja et al 2017 prepared a column reactor packed with the gastropod shell pellets for phosphorus abstraction from aquaculture wastewater the experiment was conductedover a period of 30 day a large fraction of the influent p pin 50 71 g was retained pads 37 18 g in by the gs pellets the phosphorus recovery capacity of the gs pellets was still intact at the end of the period of monitoring 3 1 2 green organic solid phase materials the quest for cost effective approach to nutrient recovery has culminated in the use of lignocellulosic waste materials these materials include husks tree backs straws wood chips saw dust etc kim et al 2000 keränen et al 2013 and 2015 lignocellulosic waste materials are available worldwide thus offering a local abundant renewable and cheap raw material for the production of water treatment chemicals it has been estimated that over 340 million metric tons and 30 million metric tons of straw are produced in china and germany annually respectively unfortunately most of these are burnt for energy generation 121 over 600 000 tons of sawdust are generated in finland most of which are dumped as waste in landfills 122 a review of selected green organic materials that have been used for nutrient recovery are presented in table 2 the results presented in tables 2 showed that the majority of the green organic based materials that have been used are cellulosic and few of them e g alfalfa biomass newspaper waste sawdust wheat straw wood chips etc have been used in the pristine state without modification varied nutrient recovery capacities have been reported for the different materials investigated it should be noted that that the reported capacities for each material presented in table 2 greatly depend on the operational conditions and are not transferable as a rule 81 83 the chemical composition and surface functional groups on these materials placed them as appropriate solid phase materials for nutrient recovery the biomass derived from lignocellulose is made up of carbohydrate polymers cellulose and hemicellulose which are strongly attached to an aromatic polymer lignin the chemical structures of cellulose and hemicellulose possess abundant hydroxyl groups which can be easily transformed to other reactive polymers through chemical reactions lignocellulose possesses negatively charged surface which makes the surface unattractive to anionic species therefore the use of lignocellulose biomass for the removal of anions is ineffective without surface modification the inactive functional groups of lignocellulosic materials can be reinforced to increase the number of active sites and potentials lignocellulose reinforcement could be achieved by surface modification wan and hanafiah 2008 the reinforcement process is essential since the original lignocellulosic biomass has extremely low phosphorus removal efficiency consequently several methods have been developed to cationized these materials the modifying agents that have been used for lignocellulose modifications include oxidizing agents k2mno4 and h2o2 organic and mineral compounds formaldehyde epichlorohydrin glutaraldehyde succinic maleic and phtalic organic and inorganic acids hcl h2so4 hno3 formic acid acetic acid citric oxalic and tartaric acid bases and basic solutions naoh na2co3 ca oh 2 cacl2 amination is another method that has been use to cationize lignocellulosicbiomass surfaces this is done by incorporating a nitrogen bearing amine compounds into lignocellulosic biomass as the electron configuration of nitrogen allows the formation of a cation 137 researchers have modified different lignocellulosic biomass to achieve higher nutrient removal efficiency orlando et al 123 modified different types of lignocellulosic biomass with thionyl chloride n n dimethylformamide dimethylamine and formaldehyde and obtained the highest adsorption capacity of 2 8 mg g for no3 nwith modified moringa oleifera hull the treatment of the lignocellulosic biomass transformed the materials into a weak base anion exchanger which enhanced interaction with anionic species karachalios and wazne 124 treated pine bark with chlorocholine chloride and urea the surface of the material was activated for nitrogen removal through amination to produce weak base anion exchangers the optimal adsorption capacity of 40 8 mg g was achieved ohura et al 125 pointed out that orange waste is a promising available and inexpensive agricultural waste that could be used for phosphorus recovery from wastewater the possibility of this was tested by modifying orange waste with zr and used for phosphorus recovery from a side stream liquid and secondary effluent that contained 68 2 and 5 9 mg dm3 p respectively the maximum adsorption capacity obtained was 1 3 mg g biswas et al 138 also tested the efficiency of orange waste gel pre treated with a base i e ca oh 2 and loaded with zrocl2 8h2o and an adsorption capacity of 175 mg g was obtained in the experiment conducted by carvalho et al 2011 bagasse fibre a lignocellulosic biomass was first etherificated using monochloroacetic acid and then loaded with fecl2 the phosphorus adsorption capacity obtained was 152 mg g xu et al 126 adopted a new method for the preparation of wheat straw as an anion exchanger based on aminated intermediate epoxypropyl triethylammonium chloride for nutrient recovery the maximum adsorption capacities of modified wheat straw for phosphate and nitrate were 45 7 and 52 8 mg g respectively the adsorption capacity value obtained from the use of modified biomass was comparable with those obtained from activated carbons commercial anion exchange resin and some other modified adsorbents soumya et al 139 investigated the adsorption of phosphate and nitrate from aqueous solution using sodium alginate modified seagrass cymodocearotundata beads under varying operational conditions the adsorption characteristics of this material were enhanced this modified lignocellulosic biomass was effective with62 for nitrate and 71 for phosphate removal it was concluded that sodium alginate modified seagrass is an effective low cost and relatively available adsorbent for nutrient recovery from wastewater hafshejani et al 140 investigated the performance of modified sugarcane bagasse vermicompost for nitrate recovery from aqueous solution the anion and cation exchange capacity of the material were7 76 cmol kg and 11 16 cmol kg respectively the highest nitrate removal efficiency 81 7 was achieved at elevated temperature with solution ph value of 3 78 after 120 min of contact time and adsorbent dosage of 2 g l the presence of other competing anions such as chlorides and sulphates reduced the amount of nitrate removed by sugarcane bagasse vermicompost chitosan is a natural product derived from the deacetylation of chitin a polysaccharide chitin is produced by insects crustaceans yeasts cell walls insects fungi and green algae however crustacean shells have been discovered to be the principal source for commercial chitin chitin is the polymer of n acetyl β d glucosamine after deacetylation the structure of chitin differs from that of the chitosan due to the presence of an acetyl group on the amine group fig 4 the acetyl group protects the amine group from activity thereby making adsorption on chitin less sensitive the exposed amine group in chitosan makes it more reactive when compared with chitin the setbacks encountered in the practical use of chitosan such as low solubility in acidic mediums low mechanical strength low adsorption capacity and lack of selectivity has led to the different structural modifications the modification procedures ranges from physical to chemical modifications to achieve bigger surface area enhanced porosity and smaller size to improve reactivity chatterjee et al 2009 investigated the adsorption of nitrate by chitosan obtained by thermochemical deacetylation of chitin the adsorption of nitrate to chitosan strongly depended on the solution temperature and ph value the adsorption capacity increased in acidic medium the enhanced capacity was attributed to the protonation of the amine group present on the chitosan leading to electrostatic interaction between the positively charged amine group and the negatively charged nitrate group in the recovery of nitrate and phosphate using chitosan the mechanism of the recovery process was ascribed to electrostatic attraction fig 5 the regeneration of the spent chitosan can be effected using alkali solution fig 5 golie and upadhyayula 127 investigated the adsorption capacity of chitosan modified with quaternary ammonium chloride with different degrees of crosslinking it was noted that the crosslinker enhanced the stability of chitosan under acidic conditions but negatively affected the adsorption capacity due to consumption of amino groups nevertheless in another study by banu and meenakshi 128 chitosan modified with quaternary ammonium chloride was able to achieve 78 and 90 removal efficiency for nitrate and phosphate respectively in this study it was noted that the phosphate removal efficiency by the modified chitosan was higher than that for nitrate this was attributed to the fact that phosphate had higher ionic potential than nitrate in the medium electrostatic attraction between quarternized sites i e positively charged and the anions i e negatively charged ion exchange and hydrogen bonding were the mechanisms of reaction between the modified chitosan and the anions fig 6 3 2 non green solid phase materials non green reactive materials used in nutrient recovery are synthetic chemicals prepared either to adsorb or precipitate nutrient from wastewater these reactive materials which include metal oxides hydroxides metal composites ion exchange resins and industrial waste products are listed in table 3 the materials listed in table 3 constituted the largest array of materials that have been sed for nutrient recovery they include oxides hydroxide layer double hydroxides derived from anthropogenic sources congruent to the source diversity the chemical composition that defined the choice high metallic composition porosity high anion exchange capacity etc for nutrient recovery are also widely varied some of them are used directly or combined with other materials as composites note that the reported capacities for each material listed in table 3 hinges on the operational conditions and are not transferable as a rule 81 83 3 2 1 non green inorganic solid phase materials materials containing metal oxides and hydroxides of divalent and trivalent metals e g ca2 fe3 al3 mg2 la3 mn3 and zr3 have been developed and investigated for nutrient recovery due to their low cost of production chemical stability and eco friendliness 41 156 the ease of synthesis modification and the ability to manipulate the surface chemistry have also made them versatile and appealing yu et al 2015 prepared a fe mg la tri metal composite via co precipitation method for the removal of phosphorus from wastewater since the point zero charge of the material was about 6 3 the adsorption of phosphate was favored below this ph value zhang et al 157 investigated the impact of ferric chloride fe iii and ferrous sulphate fe ii on phosphorus removal from aqua system and achieved 80 phosphate recovery in an aerobic chamber phosphate adsorptive capacity of metal oxides and hydroxides have been reported to differ greatly 38 157 different methods have been used for the preparation of metal oxides and hydroxides used as solid phase for nutrient recovery these methods include sol gel precipitation cross linking and metal cation doping ion exchange chemical and hydrothermal method the method of synthesis of metal oxides and hydroxides determines the crystallinity porosity particle size roughness and amorphous structure and these properties influences the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient recovery different metal oxides investigated recently for nutrient recovery include la iii oxide 10 lanthanum hydroxide 158 iron oxide 60 amorphous zirconium oxide nanoparticles 159 zirconium oxide 160 nano hydrous manganese oxide 141 etc zhang et al 158 observed that the adsorption capacity of lanthanum hydroxide doped activated carbon fiber 16 1 mg g was significantly higher than that of lanthanum oxide doped activated carbon fiber 9 5 mg g under the same adsorption conditions struvite map is a slow releasing fertilizer produced by precipitation in the presence of magnesium mg2 ammonium nh4 and phosphate po3 according to the reaction mg2 nh 4 po3 4 6h2o mgnh4po4 6h2o6 the recovery of struvite is only made possible in the presence of mg2 magnesium ion of different sources have been used over the years for struvite precipitation from wastewater which include mg oh 2 mgcl2 mgo 142 the utilization of magnesium derived from cheap sources would have appreciable impact on the overall cost of struvite production 161 hug and udert 162 stated that the use of mgo is a cheaper alternative compared to other magnesium sources such as mgcl2 mgso4 the use of mgo or mg oh 2 is also of advantage as they tend to stabilize the ph of the solution in an optimal range to promote the crystallization of struvite 163 barbosa et al 142 recovered nutrient from source separated urine through struvite precipitation mgo mg oh 2 and mgcl2 were tested as precipitating agents for struvite precipitation from urine when mgcl2 was used p recovery efficiency ranged between 82 and 89 with mg oh 2 the p recovery efficiency ranged between 79 and 93 the p recovery efficiencies ranged between 90 and 99 when mgo was used as mg2 source the ph of the solution increased from 8 5 9 in the first 3 min and remained at 9 2 during the stirring time 10 min due to the affinities of oxides and hydroxides of zirconium for phosphate they have been used in different forms as solid phase materials for phosphorus removal 146 the different forms of zirconium based solid phase materials used for phosphate capture include amorphous zirconium hydroxide 164 hydrous zirconium oxide 165 hydrated zirconium oxide 38 mesoporous zirconium oxide 166 amorphous zirconium oxide nanoparticles 159 multi component adsorbents i e either green or non green possesses physicochemical properties that significantly differentiate them from those of their individual components most of the green reactive materials consist of mixed metal oxides which make them effective for nutrient recovery in order to mimic this researchers have moved on to synthesis different mixed metal oxides or double layered hydroxides for nutrient recovery in different studies al iii sousa et al 2013 cr iii cu ii 167 mn iv 40 ti iv 168 and zr iv 169 have been incorporated into iron oxide to form bimetallic or trimetallic oxide adsorbents with high adsorption capacities for phosphate several binary metal oxides that have been used for phosphate recovery include fe zr oxide 143 fe cu binary oxides 144 fe zr binary oxides 61 ti fe binary oxides 10 using a facile solvothermal technique gu et al 145 synthesized a magnetic spinel zinc ferrite for phosphorus removal the material crystallized as a cubic znfe2o4 the ease of phosphate recovery from the material was achieved due to the magnetic nature of the prepared znfe2o4 the reaction between phosphate and the magnetic zinc ferrite was spontaneous and endothermic in nature yu et al 2015 prepared a fe mg la tri metal composite for phosphorus removal from wastewater the trimetal composite was prepared via co precipitation method and the point zero charge of the material was about 6 3 which favored the adsorption of phosphate jiang et al 118 synthesized a fe3o4 alkali treated calcium silicate fe3o4 asc composite when the composite was used for phosphate recovery the monolayer adsorption capacity obtained was 128 mg g the composite was said to be effective and highly selective at ph value that ranged between 2 5 and13 even in the presence of other anions nearly 100 phosphate removal was achieved when fe3o4 asc composite was used for real lake water treatment in a recent study kondalkar et al 170 synthesized through co precipitation mn zn ti oxide nanocomposite for phosphorus recovery the phpzc of the nanocomposite was 6 2 and at ph value of 6 the maximum phosphate adsorption was 151 mg g the reactivity and adsorptivity of metal hydro oxides have been linked to their particle sizes 171 it has also been discovered that there is a link between the particle size and the point zero charge of metal oxides 141 abbas et al 172 speculated a shift in the phpzc of metal oxides occurring with the decrease in size particularly when it is less than 5 nm madden et al 173 observed a remarkable shift in ph edge for the 7 nm hematite fe2o3 when compared with the 25 nm and 88 nm samples layered double hydroxides ldhs are hydrotalcites or hydrotalcite like compounds htlcs that consist of positively charged brucite like layers with a compensating negatively charged interlayer zone and water molecules the generic formula of ldh structures can be written as m2 1 x m3 x oh 2 x an x n zh2o the m2 in the structure represent divalent cations while the m3 denotes trivalent cations an is the interlayer compensating anions of valence n such as no3 so4 2 co3 2 co3 2 cl so4 2 rco2 of valence n while x is the molar ratio of m3 m2 m3 which ranges from 0 2 0 4 jiang et al 2007 174 when a trivalent cation is isomorphously substituted with a divalent cation in the framework there will be generation of positive charge which made ldhs good adsorbents for many anions the high adsorption capacity of ldhs has been attributed to their large surface area basic surface properties phase purity and structural stability 37 ldhs normally contain two different metals which could be zn al mg al ni fe mg fe co fe etc bhatnagar and silanpaa 2011 ternary or multiple ldhs with multiple metal compositions such as ca al zn ldh 175 zn mg al ldh 176 zn mg ni al ldh 177 have also been prepared iron based ldhs are promising candidates for anion removal and addition of la3 into them were observed to further enhanced the anion removal efficiency 178 in another study the fe3 in mg fe ldhs was replaced with al3 to form mg al ldh the al based ldh showed greater adsorption capacity for anions when compared with the fe based ldh 179 over the years researchers have investigated the efficiency of ldhs in nutrient recovery from aqueous system xue et al 147 synthesized mg al ldh and investigated the efficiency in nitrate removal from water the adsorption capacity of mg al ldh for nitrate was 118 11 mg g in another study tong et al 180 prepared a calcined mg al ldh and investigated its effectiveness on nitrate removal from aqueous medium using similar procedure other calcined mg al ldh chtlcs were synthesized with different metal composition and metal molar ratio yang et al 24 synthesized series of ldhs as adsorbents for nitrate in the study mg al zn fe zn al and mg al fe hydrotalcites were prepared via co precipitation method with different molar ratio the mg fe chtlcs achieved the highest nitrate adsorption capacity 71 05 mg g and the removal efficiency of 96 1 was achieved this high nitrate removal efficiency was closely followed by mgalfe hydrotalcites htlc particles while other ldhs showed poor nitrate removal efficiency the molar ratio of the metal ions had great effect on the nitrate adsorption capacity for phosphate removal ashekuzaman and jiang 2013 prepared various nitrate intercalated ldhs through co precipitation method to identify the best metal precursors for phosphate specific ldh adsorbents different ldhs containing mg al ca al mg fe ca fe mgca al and mgca fe were prepared through co precipitation from the nitrate salts of each of the metals the screening of the ldhs for phosphate removal revealed that the adsorption of phosphate on ca based ldhs e g ca fe ca al and ca dominated ldhs e g mgca3 fe mgca3al 97 99 were much higher than those of mg based ldhs amongst the plethora of solid phase materials that have been investigated as veritable solid phase material for nutrient recovery industrial waste products have been considered as highly promising materials the choice of these waste products as solid phase materials hinged on their low cost and physicochemical characteristics such industrial wastes include fly ash 181 182 blast furnace slag 183 184 red mud 185 etc the industrial waste products that have been investigated and the variables that defined the choice for nutrient capture are presented herein under the various headings viz 3 2 1 1 red mud red mud is an environmentally hazardous industrial waste material derived from alkaline digestion of bauxite in bayer process for alumina production the generation of red mud has been a significant problem in the alumina industry and they are mostly disposed of by landfill for sustainability the alternative uses for red mud are being studied gurudic et al 2013 the high aluminum iron and calcium content as well as its large surface areas and porosity have led to its use as solid phase material for nutrient capture from wastewater cengeloglu et al 149 studied the adsorption efficiency of raw and hcl activated red mud for nitrate removal the acid treated red mud performed better than the raw red mud but a reduction in the capacity was noted at ph value above 7 the adsorption capacity of raw and activated red mud was1 859 and 5 858 mmol no3 g respectively the enhanced capacity of the acid treated red mud was accredited to the leaching of the sodalite compounds na4al3si3o12cl by the acid which could have been responsible for blocking of adsorption sites in the raw red mud in a recent study a novel mechano chemically activated red mud was used as adsorbent for nitrate removal from constant stock nitrate solution the particle size of raw red mud was mechanically reduced to obtain a particle size of 0 149 mm this was chemically activated by boiling diluted hcl the study reported that nitrate removal generally increased with increasing acid concentration and acidification time the maximum nitrate removal efficiency of 75 11 was achieved at acid concentrate of 20 w w and acidification time of 20 min 150 various studies have been conducted using red mud as solid phase material for phosphate removal from aqua system raw and acidified red mud 186 have been used for phosphate adsorption from aqueous medium in a study prajapati et al 185 used raw thermally treated and acid activated red mud for phosphate removal despite the enhanced surface area of the thermally treated red mud the acid activated red mud showed better selective adsorption for phosphate the acid treated red mud achieved phosphate adsorption capacity of 205 1 mg g compared with thermally treated and raw red mud with adsorption capacity of 190 8 mg g and 125 9 mg g respectively 3 2 1 2 fly ash fly ash is a coal combustion product driven out with flue gases fromcoal fired boiler the composition of fly ash depends on the composition of the coal burnt but the major chemical composition includes amorphous and crystalline silicon dioxide sio2 fe2o3 al2o3 feo tio2 cao mno2 and etc the upsurge in the global energy consumption has been identified as the cause of the increase in annual tonnage discharge of fly ash the accumulations of fly ash have resulted into environmental pollution 187 consequently the processing recycling and utilization of fly ash has become an issue at the front burner of research 181 184 188 189 the presence of some metal oxides like al2o3 feo fe2o3 cao and mgo have made fly ash a suitable solid phase material for nutrient recovery 182 190 apart from its chemical compositions the effectiveness of fly ash in nutrient recovery could be attributed to the large specific surface area abundant surface active groups and porosity peng et al 2004 191 192 hermassi et al 181 investigated the use of fly ash as solid phase material for phosphate recovery from aqua system the study posited that the adsorption kinetics of phosphorus uptake by fly ash particles occurred through a diffusion based process the agronomical assay conducted on the recovered nutrient affirmed the potential of this nutrient rich solid phase material in agricultural usage kandel et al 182 prepared a bioretention cell for phosphorus capture by mixing5 fly ash with sand the bioretention cell achieved 85 phosphorus removal by adsorption process ramsey et al 151 investigated different permeable reactive concretes including fly ash for the removal and retention of inorganic nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate phosphorus po4 p fly ash was able to remove 39 of no3 n and more than 91 po4 p 3 2 1 3 slags slag is a byproduct generated from iron and steel production various slag exhibits different chemistry due to the different routes to the production these slags ranges from i electric arc furnace eaf slag a product from the melting of steel scrap iron ore and lime in an electric arc furnace they are rich in fe and ca claveau mallet et al 2014 87 193 194 ii blast furnace bf slag a byproduct of iron ore limestone and coke fused at temperatures above 15000c they are rich in si and ca 195 oguz et al 2004 194 iii basic oxygen furnace slag bof slag generated from the refining of iron in a basic oxygen furnace 196 xue et al 2009 iv melter slag produced when iron sand is converted to melter iron they are rich in ti and al bourke et al 2005 194 v argon oxygen decarburization aod slag produced in the argon oxygen decarburization converter during stainless steel refining to reduce the carbon content to less than 0 05 zhao et al 2013 salman et al 2015 the major chemical compositions of aod are the same as those of eaf stainless steel slag but aod has higher cao and lower sio2 content when compared with aod 197 salman et al 2015 li et al 2017 vi aluminum salt slag is formed as industrial by product during the secondary aluminum production 198 the chemical composition of aluminum salt slag depends mainly on the operation process from which it is produced xrd analysis carried out on aluminum salt slag ren et al 2015 revealed that the major chemical component is aluminum 43 6 other minor constituents include soluble salts of na k and cl and other elements such as si mg fe cu ti zn mn etc the disposal of these slags is a worldwide problem several studies have been conducted to find alternative uses for these industrial wastes which include their use as solid phase material for wastewater remediation 199 200 johansson et al 2010 ramakrishna et al 1997 amongst these studies is the use of slag for nutrient recovery from aqua system several studies have established the use of slag for phosphorus removal and concluded that its efficiency is due to the physical properties and chemical compositions lim et al 2017 201 ahmad et al 2017 ren et al 2015 hussain et al 2014 202 204 claveau mallet et al 2013 han et al 2016 the main mechanism of p removal is based on cao slag dissolution followed by ca phosphate precipitation 196 205 lim et al 2017 zuo et al 2017 barca et al 206 investigated electric arc furnace steel slag eaf slag and basic oxygen furnace steel slag bof slag as solid phase materials for phosphorus removal in a constructed wetland the study was carried out for a period of two years and the eaf slag removed 37 of the inlet total p while the bof slag removed 62 of the total phosphorus bowden et al 196 confirmed that basic oxygen furnace slag bofs achieved higher phosphate removal capacity than other steel slags due to the higher ca content 42 44 cao and free lime content 4 6 while investigating the effects of particle size of slag on phosphorus recovery johansson 1999b reported that phosphate sorption capacity of slag decreased in the following order amorphous coarse bfs amorphous fine bfs fine crystalline bfs coarse crystalline blast furnace slag bfs the slag with large surface area showed more reactive ca availability for phosphate precipitation in a recent study zuo et al 2018 investigated in a column experiment the mechanisms and performances of dual slag filters for phosphate recovery from domestic wastewater the column was packed with blast furnace slag bfs argon oxygen decarburisation slag aod and electric arc furnace slag eaf they were combined in five different ways in different columns the sixth column was packed with only eaf about 99 of the phosphorus was removed within 4 h the study discovered that the column packed with only aef showed the highest phosphate recovery capacity as it removed 240 mg of p out of the 248 9 mg added to the column the removal efficiency of the other columns fluctuated between 60 9and 90 this result was said to be unexpected as the previously conducted batch experiment with synthetic p solution showed that the aod slag had better p removal performance than eaf zuo et al 2016b this was justified with the fact that the amount of aef used in the column experiment was higher than that of aod lim et al 2017 investigated the mathematical model suitable for the description of the adsorption of phosphorus unto eaf and its performance efficiency the results of the study showed that the data fitted best with the langmuir isotherm equation with 0 166 mg g monolayer adsorption capacity it was also observed that eaf with smaller particle size had higher efficiency considering the low performance efficiency of slags in nitrate recovery limited studies have been reported thus far hao 2014 201 so far the highest nitrate removal efficiency obtained was 2 83 mg g hao 2014 due to low efficiency of slags in nitrate removal studies have been conducted to modify these industrial slags to improve their efficiency in a study by duan et al 2013 steel slag was modified with al oh 3 to improve nh3 n removal from aqueous solution in a recent study by yang et al 201 steel slag was modified by soaking dried slag in aluminum hydroxide solution in different ratios at room temperature for 10 h after drying the slag was heated at different temperatures viz 600 700 800 and 9000c with this modification the study achieved nitrate adsorption capacity of 6 165 mg g which was relatively higher than what has been reported in other studies 3 3 composite solid phase materials composite material is prepared by combination of chemically and structurally different constituent materials to ensure improved properties the combination produces a synergistic effect and aggregate properties that are different from those of its constituents the aggregated properties in the composite materials tends to increase the efficiency of such materials several composite materials with micro and nanostructures have been prepared their structures are more finely divided thus particles in the micrometer or nanometer range are produced chung et al 2010 for the purpose of nutrient recovery from aqua system several composite materials have been developed and tested rajendra 2018 golie and upadhyayula 207 prepared a composite material by incorporating metal ions into chitosan matrix and the composite material was tested for nutrient recovery from aqueous system dai et al 52 used chitosan loaded with cu2 for phosphate removal and the integrity of the material remained intact at ph value 4 masheane et al 208 developed a novel chitosan beads grafted with al and functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes f mwcnts for the removal of nitrate from aqua system nitrates removal from water by the chitosan al f mwcnt beads was conducted in a batch adsorption process the study revealed that nitrate uptake was favoured in an acidic medium within a ph value range of 2 6 the percentage removal value of 96 8 was achieved golie and upadhyayula 207 used chitosan alumina for nitrate removal in a column reactor the influence of bed depth flow rate and adsorbate concentration on the efficacy of the reactor was investigated the performance efficiency of the reactor increased with increasing bed height and lower flow rate and influent nitrate concentration enhanced the reactor capacity for nitrate recovery the ability of zr iv crosslinked quaternized chitosan bentonite composite to remove phosphate was studied by wang et al 2018 the adsorption capacity of the composite for phosphate was 65 35 mg g the reaction was exothermic and spontaneous in nature and the adsorption mechanisms included electrostatic interaction ligand exchange and hydrogen bond formation rajeswari et al 154 prepared polyethylene glycol chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol chitosan composites for nitrate removal from aqua system under varying experimental conditions the influence of the composite morphology on nitrate removal was evaluated the abundance of open pores in the adsorbent enhanced mass transfer of nitrate ions onto the chitosan composites the adsorption capacities of peg chitosan and pva chitosan were 50 68 and 35 03 mg g respectively jóźwiak et al 209 explored the possibilities of using chitosan hydrogel beads to simultaneously remove phosphate nitrite and nitrate in a multicomponent system the highest affinity for these species was noted at ph value 4 at the ph value that ranged between 6 and 11 the adsorption of orthophosphate and nitrate onto chitosan proved ineffective the effectiveness of the hydrogel bead was ascribed to the protonation of the surface of the hydrogel leading to an electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent and the anions at higher ph value negative charges predominate the chitosan bead surfaces leading to electrostatic repulsion arshadi et al 130 prepared an iron nanoparticles loaded spondias purpurea seed waste for removal of phosphate from both synthetic and natural water the spondias purpurea seed coats embryo and endosperm were oven dried for 72 h in 700c and ground to powder this was then sieved to obtain particle sizes that ranged between 250 µm and 400 µm the s naoh nzvi nano biocomposite was prepared by modification of the material with naoh and fecl2 4h2o the kinetic study of the s naoh nzvi nano biocomposite in phosphate removal was studied after 5 min percentages of p removal were 99 9 88 3 and 86 0 at an initial concentration of 19 45 and 150 mg l respectively manganese oxides mno is a transition metal oxide with strong surface reactivity and high surface area due to the specific surface properties low point zero charge mno cannot be used directly to adsorb anions like nitrate and phosphate the point of zero charge phpzc of most mno ranges between 2 and 3 210 211 near neutral ph value manganese oxides are negatively charged thus it cannot effectively adsorb anionic species because of electrostatic repulsion 212 in order to enhance its phosphate removal ability pan et al 141 synthesized a nano hydrous manganese oxide hmo and immobilized it within a polystyrene anion exchanger ns the point zero charge of the resulting nanocomposite hmo ns shifted from 6 2 for the untreated hmo to 10 5 for the capsulated hmo thereby making nanoparticles positively charged at neutral ph the ph shift allowed the predominance of positive charge on the surface of the nanoparticles thereby enhancing the phosphate adsorption different studies have also been carried out to modify zirconium based solid phase material for an enhanced phosphorus capture these modifications include zirconium loaded with gel 138 zirconium loaded on monophosphonic acid resin 213 hydrous zirconium oxide loaded on anion exchange resin 60 biomass based hydrous zirconium oxide nanocomposite 214 fibers loaded with zirconium hydroxide 213 binary oxides of zirconium loaded on other metals 10 143 the results from these studies showed that the mechanism of reaction of zirconium based adsorbent is based on the adsorption of phosphate to the surface hydroxyl of zirconia 10 the maximum adsorption capacity of pure zirconium oxide nanoparticles and the modified zirconium based adsorbent for phosphorus in all these investigations ranged between 99 01 mg g and 131 6 mg g 146 zhang et al 157 investigated the effectiveness of different sizes of anthracites modified with nine types of ldhs for nh4 n removal from wastewater the various m2 m3 cations incorporated include mg al ca fe mg fe zn al ca co zn co ca co mg co ca al and zn fe in 2 1 m ratio from their respective chloride salts the column experiments for treatment of sewage wastewater using these solid phase materials were set up to simulate the vertical flow constructed wetland the average removal efficiencies of total nitrogen and nh4 n for all the tested substrates ranged between53 7 and89 8 and 68 0 91 6 respectively a scrap tire is a tire that is no longer in use the recycled shredded tire chips material are coarse aggregates lightweight material with long term stability tire with porosity of 0 6 215 it has been discovered that over one billion waste tires are generated annually worldwide and in the year 2007 303 million scrap tires were produced in the united states about 54 of the recovered tires are used as fuel followed by ground rubber 17 and civil engineering applications 12 us environmental protection agency 2011 216 218 in less developed countries most of this worn out tires are often dumped illegally 219 finding alternative use for scrap tires has led to its use in wastewater treatment lin et al 2010 215 220 the use of scrap tire in nutrient recovery have been studied 221 223 large amounts of steel wires are embedded into tires to provide strength and stability when tires are shredded the wires become visible due to the presence of the steel iron tire chips have good ion exchange capacity which enables their use as buffer material adsorbing and releasing nitrate nitrogen and phosphate 222 wanielista et al 224 found out that the use of recycled tires significantly decreased the concentration of orthophosphate and total phosphorus in water treated with a mixture of tire crumb and soils a diminution in nitrate nitrite and nh3 was also observed using tire crumb to reduce limiting nutrients can minimize the negative ecological impact and at the same time reduced the human footprint left by used tires garcía pérez et al 152 investigated the ability of recycled shredded tire chips in the treatment of strongly polluted bakery wastewater at the end of the three year experimental period the total treatment percentage removal efficiencies were potassium 36 total nitrogen 56 total kjeldahl nitrogen 57 total phosphorus 65 total suspended solids 69 ammonia nitrogen 87 five day biochemical oxygen demand 92 escherichia coli 97 and fat oil and grease total 99 krayzelova et al 222 investigated the effectiveness of a composite made up of scrap tire chips elemental sulfur pellets and crushed oyster shells in the adsorption of nitrate from synthetic wastewater in a column study the composite achieved high nitrate removal efficiencies under steady condition 90 at variable flow 89 and variable concentration 94 conditions during the nitrate adsorption study phosphate was slightly adsorbed to the scrap tires at an adsorption capacity of 0 022 mg g 1 of scrap tires ammonium removal was also observed but it was discovered that the initial concentration of ammonium was too low to calculate the amount of ammonium as nitrogen adsorbed per gram of tire 4 choice of solid phase material for nutrient capture an overview a systematic appraisal of the solid phase materials that have been investigated for nutrient removal showed that both organic and inorganic based materials derived from both natural and synthetic origins have been extensively investigated for nutrient recovery plethora of these materials have been used either as adsorbents or reactive materials for either nutrient fraction capture or recovery from aqueous streams taking into cognizance the research aim delineated in the different research reports that were reviewed the purpose of the use of these arrays of investigated solid phase materials were just two folds in the first case the nutrient fraction is captured because of the potential pollution effects of the presence in the aqua stream in the second instance the nutrient fractions are recovered for reuse because of the potentials as valuable resources considering the purposes of the two aforementioned operations the variables that defined the choice of solid phase materials for nutrient fraction recovery is totally at variance with that of the nutrient fraction capture for reuse while a less stringent conditions may be required in the choice of solid phase materials for pollution control purposes a more stringent condition is definitely required for resource recovery purposes high affinity of the solid phase material for the nutrient fraction which is the major consideration for nutrient capture is not sufficient for a material to be considered for nutrient recovery purposes a good example is the observation that solid phase materials that are rich in calcium aluminium magnesium and iron show high affinity for phosphate despite the high affinities of these different metal phases for phosphate the bond strengths between the metal ion and phosphate differ greatly while iron and aluminium tenaciously bind to the phosphorus fraction the other metal ions tenuously bind to phosphorus thus these differences in the bond strengths between phosphorus and the different metal ions determine the nutrient availability to plants in soil in order to design an eco friendly and sustainable p recovery system morse et al 45 surmised that the choice of the solid phase material is salient this caveat was occasioned by the fact that a too tightly bound phosphorus to the solid phase material would be inapplicable in industrial and agricultural applications although the removal of p from aqua stream using aluminium and iron rich materials is prevalent but it is unattractive for the recovery and reuse purpose this is due to the tenacious interaction between the metal phase and the recovered phosphorus furthermore aluminium is toxic to many plants and some soil organisms 225 thus mg2 and ca2 rich materials are preferred for p recovery because of the potential of the nutrient laden adsorbent to be reused as fertilizer the toxicity of the solid phase material is also very important in either the use of solid phase material for both pollution abatement or for the purpose of resource recovery because the leaching of toxic species into water matrix in either case portends danger in other to adequately predict and ascertain the efficiency of a solid phase material in nutrient fraction capture and to determine the potential for reuse in agricultural practice and the process safety adequate knowledge of the solid phase material is apposite in order to gain insight into the knowledge of the solid phase materials to be used a comprehensive characterization protocol should be adopted before the commencement of the recovery process adequate knowledge of the solid phase material via comprehensive characterization would go a long way to ameliorate unforeseen challenges during the process of nutrient capture and recovery and product applications 5 conclusion the primary consideration for the choice of a solid phase material was the nutrient adsorption capacity other important variables identified include the pore size ph values chemical and mineralogical assemblage and surficial physiognomies for sustainability the material must be cheap non toxic reusable with no risk to soil or water quality and must ready be able to release the nutrient recovered for agricultural purposes the solid phase material should also have good hydraulic conductivity to minimize the risk of clogging or the occurrence of preferential flow when applied as barriers or fitters in addition the knowledge of the concentration and bioavailability of possible contaminants leached from the solid phase material is imperative an overview of the different solid phase materials that have been used for nutrient recovery showed that they can be broadly classified as green and non green solid phase materials this broad classification can also be subdivided into organic inorganic and composite solid phase materials 226 357

14171,three types of free fatty acid ffa rich oil i e jatropha oil jo palm fatty acid distillate pfad and palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad were investigated into their potentiality as green extractants for cu ii ion extraction from aqueous solutions the physicochemical properties of ffa rich oils and their progressive phase separations with cu ii containing aqueous solutions were studied the effect of initial cu ii ion concentration on the extraction efficiency by different ffa rich oils along with their ph extraction isotherms and back extraction stripping were also explored the results revealed that pkfad showed the most favorable physicochemical properties and phase separation behavior while achieving a high extraction efficiency 95 among all the ffa rich oils studied therefore pkfad is a prospective green exractant for cu ii ions from aqueous solutions keywords extraction cu ii ions jatropha oil palm fatty acid distillate palm kernel fatty acid distillate green extractants 1 introduction in recent decades heavy metals in industrial effluents have drawn considerable attention of both researchers and practitioners from all around the globe owing to their lethal toxicity at low concentrations 1 ppm of ld50 median lethal dose 1 non biodegradability bioaccumulation and inherent persistency 2 among the various heavy metals copper is one of the toxic priority pollutants listed by the u s environmental protection agency 3 in particular cupric cu ii ions which are found ubiquitously in effluents produced by a wide variety of industries such as electroplating mining printed circuit board manufacturing and metal finishing 4 have exacerbated various deleterious degradations towards the living organisms such as fish and shellfish 5 when effluents laden with cu ii ions are discharged directly into the waterways the conventional effluent treatment techniques for cu ii ions include chemical precipitation 6 coagulation flocculation 7 membrane filtration 8 ion exchange 9 and adsorption 10 however each of these techniques suffers from its own intrinsic shortcomings and none of them is universal in treating all kinds of industrial effluents established since the 1940s 11 solvent extraction is one of the prevalent effluent treatment techniques for metal ions due to its high efficiency high selectivity ease of operation and low operating and maintenance costs 12 its working principle is based on the relative solubility of metal ions between an aqueous solution and an organic solvent which are immiscible with each other 13 typically the organic solvent is made up of an extractant and a diluent where the former binds and converts metal ions into extractable species while the latter governs the overall solvent conditions 14 nevertheless the conventional extractants di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa cyanex 272 lix 84 aliquat 336 14 and diluents kerosene n hexane chloroform toluene 14 used in solvent extraction are mostly derived from petroleum resources which are detrimental to living organisms when they are released to the environment and could be inordinately expensive due to their finite resources of late there is increasing research in the application of renewable and environmentally benign organic solvents in extracting metal ions from aqueous solutions for instance chang et al 15 wahab et al 16 and bhatluri et al 17 successfully utilized d2ehpa as an extractant and fresh or waste vegetable oil soybean oil 15 palm oil 16 or coconut oil 17 as a diluent to extract various metal ions cu ii 15 16 cd ii 17 or pb ii 17 ions from aqueous solutions however these organic solvents were not entirely green since one of the components of the solvents i e d2ehpa the extractant was a hazardous petroleum product in another study ong et al 18 hydrolyzed the waste vegetable oil in a cu ii containing aqueous solution to generate free fatty acids ffas green extractants which concomitantly extracted cu ii ions by a cation exchange mechanism this simultaneous oil hydrolysis and solvent extraction process is a prospective effluent treatment technique in view of the totally green organic solvent used however this process is more complex and incurs a higher operating cost than the traditional solvent extraction due to the more severe operating conditions 225 c vs 25 c of operating temperature 480 min vs 6 min of operating time pre treatment of product for glycerol removal vs no pre treatment of product sensitive extraction condition that requires an absence of oxygen vs non sensitive extraction condition 18 19 involved to reap the benefits of ffas as green extractants and to avoid the additional hydrolysis process during solvent extraction as reported by ong et al 18 three types of naturally ffa rich oils namely jatropha oil jo with 14 wt ffas 20 21 palm fatty acid distillate pfad with 90 wt ffas 22 and palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad with 80 90 wt ffas 23 were studied as the potential renewable and green extractants without any diluents for cu ii ion extraction from aqueous solutions in this work in general jo is non edible vegetable oil which is mainly converted into biodiesel for use in diesel engines 24 pfad and pkfad on the other hand are by products from the physical refining of crude palm oil 22 and crude palm kernel oil 23 respectively both of which are widely utilized as fatty acid fa sources for oleo chemical soap and animal feed industries 25 26 as much as we know these ffa rich oils have not been used to extract metal ions from aqueous solutions to this end the physicochemical properties of jo pfad and pkfad were first determined and their progressive phase separations with cu ii containing aqueous solutions were investigated next the effect of initial cu ii ion concentration on the extraction efficiency was studied and the ph extraction isotherms of cu ii ions with jo pfad and pkfad were explored the roles of jo pfad and pkfad as extractants for cu ii ions were also discussed and verified lastly back extraction or stripping of cu ii ions from cu ii loaded pkfad was investigated with different stripping agents 2 experimental study 2 1 materials the ffa rich oils were supplied by local vendors i e jo by bionas sdn bhd pfad and pkfad by sime darby sdn bhd all of which was used directly without further purification copper

merck 1 in ethanol were used as received 2 2 equipment an incubator shaker lab companion si 300 was used to mix the aqueous and organic phases and a ph meter hanna instruments hi11310 was used to measure the ph of aqueous phase before and after extraction the concentrations of cu ii ions in aqueous phases after extraction were determined by a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer faas shimadzu aa7000 whereas the viscosities and functional groups of organic phases were analyzed by a digital viscometer graigar ndj 8s and an attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy shimadzu irprestige 21 respectively 2 3 characterization of ffa rich oils the ffa rich oils i e jo pfad and pkfad used in this work were characterized for their viscosities water solubility fa compositions and ffa contents the viscosity was measured with a digital viscometer based on the astm d445 test method 27 whereas the water solubility was determined by measuring the equilibrium water content in an ffa rich oils by means of the karl fischer titration method 28 after mixing the solvent with an aqueous solution containing 100 mg l of cu ii ions and 200 mm of na2so4 inert salt under the following conditions equilibrium ph pheq of 4 0 19 29 organic to aqueous phase ratio of 1 5 1 and temperature of 50 c while the fa compositions were analyzed in accordance with the standard aoac 996 06 test method 30 the ffa contents were determined through a titration method as described by zenevicz et al 31 the latter began with mixing 2 g of an ffa rich oil with 30 ml of an equivolume solution of anhydrous ethanol and diethyl ether the mixture was then titrated against a 0 1 m koh solution with phenolphthalein as an indicator lastly the ffa content of the ffa rich oil was calculated by 31 1 f f a c o n t e n t w t v k o h m k o h m m f f a 10 m s where vkoh is the volume of koh solution ml used in the titration mkoh is the molarity of koh solution mol l mmffa is the average molar mass of ffas and ms is the sample mass g other properties of ffa rich oils such as melting point and density were obtained from the literature 32 34 2 4 preparation of aqueous and organic phases in extraction experiments the aqueous phases containing specific initial concentrations 100 500 and 1000 mg l of cu ii ions were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of cuso4 5h2o in distilled water loaded with 200 mm na2so4 whereas the organic phases were prepared with different ffa rich oils i e jo pfad and pkfad without any pre treatment or addition of chemicals in stripping experiments the organic phase were cu ii loaded pkfad obtained from the extraction experiments whereas the aqueous phases were prepared from various types of stripping agents h2so4 hno3 and hcl at different concentrations from 0 5 to 2 0 m 2 5 extraction procedure extraction of cu ii ions was performed based on the shake out test as delineated in our previous work 35 firstly a volume of 22 5 ml ffa rich oil jo pfad or pkfad was mixed with a prepared cu ii containing aqueous solution at 1 5 1 organic to aqueous volume ratio in a glass stoppered conical flask the flask was then agitated on an incubator shaker at 150 rpm and 50 c for 8 min the mixture was left to settle for 5 min for phase separation next about 10 ml sample was taken from the aqueous phase with a syringe and the ph of the sample was measured with a ph meter if the desired pheq was not obtained the ph of the aqueous phase was adjusted with 1 m h2so4 or 1 m naoh and the mixture was mixed for another 8 min this step was repeated until the desired pheq was obtained finally the mixture was transferred into a separating funnel for overnight phase disengagement and about 15 ml sample was withdrawn from the aqueous phase for chemical analysis with a faas the percentage extraction e of cu ii ions was calculated according to 2 e c u i a q c u f a q c u i a q x 100 where cu i aq and cu f aq are the initial and final cu ii ion concentrations respectively in the aqueous feed phase all extraction experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate at 50 c and the relative standard deviation between replicate samples within an experiment range was less than 3 2 6 stripping procedure the stripping experiments were conducted by using the same procedures as the extraction experiments but without the pheq adjustment after mixing of aqueous and organic phases an organic to aqueous volume ratio of 1 1 and a temperature of 25 c were applied throughout all the stripping experiments the percentage of stripping s of cu ii ions was given by 3 s c u f s t r i p c u i a q c u f a q x 100 where cu f strip is the final concentration of cu ii ions in the aqueous stripping phase all stripping experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate and the relative standard deviation between replicate samples within an experiment range was less than 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of ffa rich oils the physicochemical properties of an organic solvent govern the extraction behavior of the organic solvent and determine its suitability for use in sx 13 table 1 shows the physicochemical properties melting point density viscosity fa composition ffa content and water solubility of different ffa rich oils jo pfad and pkfad studied in this work it can be seen that the melting points of jo and pkfad were well below room temperature 25 c i e 4 5 c and 22 c respectively whereas that of pfad was above room temperature i e 45 c as a result jo and pkfad were literally liquids at ambient conditions and could be employed as the potential organic solvents for ambient sx whereas pfad was semi solid and could only be used for high temperature sx nevertheless all these ffa rich oils were found to have analogous densities of less than 1 g cm3 i e 0 86 0 89 g cm3 table 1 suggesting that all of them float on water this provides a key insight concerning the configuration of aqueous and organic phases when they are applied in an sx system table 1 also reveals that jo was significantly more viscous 50 2 mpa s 50 c than pfad 24 3 mpa s 50 c and pkfad 23 0 mpa s 50 c and these findings are in good agreement with the previous works 36 39 being lipid materials ffa rich oils owe their viscosities to three key features of fa composition carbon chain length degree of unsaturation and double bond configuration 40 in general the viscosity of a lipid material increases with the carbon chain length but decreases with the degree of unsaturation and the cis double bond configuration of its bulk fas 41 among these factors carbon chain length appears to be the most fitting in explaining the viscosity order of ffa rich oils obtained in this work in this regard jo which was rich in 18 carbon oleic acid 42 0 wt was the most viscous followed by pfad that was abundant in 16 carbon palmitic acid 49 7 wt and pkfad that was loaded with 12 carbon lauric acid 49 1 wt as depicted in table 1 similar findings on the increasing viscosity of fatty acids with their carbon chain length had also been reported by several researchers 40 41 nonetheless all these ffa rich oils were substantially more viscous than the conventional petroleum based organic solvents used in sx for instance kerosene 1 64 mpa s 25 c 14 n hexane 0 297 mpa s 25 c 14 and chloroform 0 53 mpa s 25 c 14 this is an undesirable trait since the viscous ffa rich oils would reduce their mobility and hinder the transport of solutes across them during the sx process providentially the high viscosities of ffa rich oils could be moderated by heating which would reduce the intermolecular cohesive forces in the oils 42 mixing or stirring that would minimize the boundary layer resistance concentration polarization in the oils 14 adding suitable viscosity reducers to the oils 43 and so forth in spite of the greater viscosities of ffa rich oils than those of the conventional organic solvents it is noteworthy that jo was as viscous as vegetable oil 44 54 mpa s 25 c 14 while pfad and pkfad were about a factor of two less viscous than vegetable oil this implies that ffa rich oils particularly pfad and pkad were more favorable than vegetable oil to be used as green organic solvents for sx at least from the lower viscosity point of view with respect to water solubility pkfad was found to dissolve the most amount of water 0 983 wt 50 c followed by jo 0 511 wt 50 c and pfad 0 389 wt 50 c as shown in table 1 this suggests the order of decreasing polarity of pkfad jo pfad which may be explained by the variations in their ffa contents and fa chain length on the whole ffas are fas that occur as free unesterified molecules in nature as opposed to fas which are often esterified to lipid molecules 44 being free molecules ffas carry polar heads of free oh groups of the carboxylic acid moieties which interact favorably with water compared to their lipid bound fa counterparts that have no free oh 44 as a result the higher the ffa content of an oil the more water soluble it is in light of the highest ffa content of pkfad 92 2 wt along with the shortest carbon chain length of its bulk 12 carbon lauric acid pkfad exhibited the greatest water solubility 0 983 wt 50 c among the ffa rich oils table 1 nevertheless the larger ffa content of pfad 85 0 wt and the shorter carbon chain length of its bulk 16 carbon palmitic acid than those of jo ffa content of 16 9 wt and bulk 18 carbon oleic acid did not result in the larger water solubility of pfad this may be attributed to the smaller degree of unsaturation of pfad than that of jo unsaturated to saturated fa ratio of pfad of 1 1 vs that of jo of 3 1 table 1 which had rendered it less polar and thus dissolved less water than jo 0 389 wt 50 c vs 0 511 wt 50 c table 1 in spite of their abilities in dissolving trace amounts of water 1 wt all ffa rich oils are practically non polar due to their extremely low dielectric constants i e 4 45 46 and therefore could be used as the potential organic solvents for sx in a nutshell pkfad exhibited the most favorable physicochemical properties for solvent extraction among all ffa rich oils studied on account of its low melting point of 22 c low density of 0 89 g cm3 70 c moderate viscosity of 23 0 mpa s 50 c high ffa content of 92 2 wt and low water solubility of 0 983 wt 50 c table 1 pfad and jo were less favorable due to the high melting point of 45 c for the former and the high viscosity of 50 2 mpa s 50 c for the latter 3 2 progressive phase separations of ffa rich oils with cu ii containing aqueous solutions rapid separation of the organic and aqueous phases without emulsion or crud formation at the organic aqueous interface is a desirable trait in sx in this work the progressive phase separations of different ffa rich oils i e jo pfad and pkfad from cu ii containing aqueous solutions were investigated without and with pheq adjustments fig 1 the initial cu ii ion concentration in the aqueous solution was maintained at 100 mg l throughout the investigation without pheq adjustment the pheq of the jo pfad and pkfad aqueous systems were attained at 5 4 3 4 and 3 4 respectively to adjust and maintain the same pheq of 4 0 across different organic aqueous systems a few drops of 1 m h2so4 was added to the jo aqueous system while a trace amount of 1 m naoh was added to both the pfad and pkfad aqueous systems as can be seen in fig 1 a thick and bulky emulsion layer that almost filled up the entire separating funnel was formed between the organic and aqueous layers at the outset of phase separation i e t 0 in all the organic aqueous systems either without or with pheq adjustment this unstable emulsion layer then broke up with time due to creaming flocculation and coalescence 47 until complete phase separation occurred fig 1 the emulsion breaking time i e the time required to break up the emulsion layer however varied from one organic aqueous system to another and between those without and with pheq adjustments within an organic aqueous system without pheq adjustment the increasing order of the emulsion breaking time was pfad aqueous system 1 67 min fig 1b i pkfad aqueous system 3 min fig 1c i jo aqueous system 5 min fig 1a i whereas with pheq adjustment the order was pkfad aqueous system 5 min fig 1c ii jo aqueous system 5 5 min fig 1a ii pfad aqueous system 300 min fig 1b ii the former order could be deduced from the variations in the viscosity and water solubility among the ffa rich oils while the latter was influenced by the presence of soap i e sodium salts of fas due to the reaction of fas with naoh in the system which could act as a surfactant to stabilize the emulsion layers by reducing the liquid liquid interfacial tension and prolong the emulsion breaking time 48 without pheq adjustment pfad aqueous system took the shortest time to break up the emulsion layer due to its relatively low viscosity 24 3 mpa s 50 c table 1 and lowest water solubility 0 389 wt 50 c table 1 among the ffa rich oils the low viscosity of pfad enhanced the creaming rate of pfad droplets from emulsion to organic layer according to stoke s law 47 while the lowest water solubility in pfad indicates its lowest polarity among the ffa rich oils which prompted its separation from the polar aqueous solution based on the like dissolves like aphorism 19 between pkfad and jo aqueous systems without pheq adjustment the former was faster in breaking up the emulsion layer due to its much lower viscosity 23 0 mpa s 50 c vs 50 2 mpa s 50 c table 1 albeit its higher water solubility 0 983 wt 50 c vs 0 511 wt 50 c table 1 than the latter with pheq adjustment however soap was formed in both the pfad and pkfad aqueous systems following the addition of 1 m naoh during pheq adjustment which in turn increased the emulsion breaking time i e from 1 67 min without pheq adjustment fig 1b i to 300 min with pheq adjustment fig 1b ii for pfad aqueous system and from 3 min without pheq adjustment fig 1c i to 5 min with pheq adjustment fig 1c ii for pkfad aqueous system the substantially larger increment in the emulsion breaking time encountered by the pfad aqueous system than that by the pkfad aqueous system when pheq was adjusted from 3 4 to 4 0 may be attributed to the greater amount of soap surfactant formed in the pfad aqueous system fig 1b ii as a result of its higher proportion of unsaturated fas unsaturated to saturated fa ratio of 1 1 vs 1 7 table 1 which were more reactive than their saturated counterparts due to their double bonds 49 this finding is consistent with that of kamba et al 48 who reported the increasing emulsion stability with surfactant concentration meanwhile no soap was formed in jo aqueous system when pheq was adjusted from 5 4 to 4 0 due to the addition of 1 m h2so4 instead of 1 m naoh into the system consequently jo aqueous system did not undergo a significant change in the emulsion breaking time when pheq was adjusted i e from 5 min without pheq adjustment fig 1a i to 5 5 min with pheq adjustment fig 1a ii on top of the variations observed in the emulsion breaking time among the organic aqueous systems and between those without and with pheq adjustment within an organic aqueous system the color intensity of the organic layer within an organic aqueous system also experienced notable changes when pheq was adjusted particularly for pfad fig 1b i ii and pkfad aqueous fig 1c i ii systems where the color intensity of the organic layers changed from somewhat lighter to much darker this suggests that there may have been a steep rise in the concentration of cu ii ions in the organic layers of pfad and pfkad aqueous systems when pheq was adjusted from 3 4 to 4 0 for jo aqueous system on the other hand a subtle change in the color intensity of the organic layer from darker to lighter implies a decline in the cu ii ion concentrations in the organic layer of jo aqueous system when pheq was adjusted from 5 4 to 4 0 fig 1a i ii 3 3 effect of initial cu ii ion concentration on extraction efficiency since the initial solute concentration in aqueous solutions often varies from one source to another it is vital to study the effect of initial solute concentration on the extraction efficiency of a solvent for the solute fig 2 shows the effect of different initial cu ii ion concentrations 100 500 and 1000 mg l on the e of cu ii ions by various ffa rich oils jo pfad and pkfad at pheq of 4 0 it reveals that pfad achieved the highest e of cu ii ions throughout the different initial cu ii ion concentrations studied followed closely by pkfad and then jo regardless of the types of ffa rich oil studied e of cu ii ions were the lowest at 100 mg l of initial cu ii ion concentration i e 23 for jo 85 for pfad and 75 for pkfad they then enhanced steadily with the initial cu ii ion concentration from 100 to 500 mg l reached or closely approached a small peak at 500 mg l i e 36 for jo 95 for pfad and 91 for pkfad and plateaued or declined somewhat thereafter to 1000 mg l fig 2 the rise in the e of cu ii ions from 100 to 500 mg l attained by all ffa rich oils fig 2 was ascribed to the increase in the driving force for cu ii ion transfer which caused the equilibrium position of the extraction reaction of cu ii ions with ffas to shift to the right and improved the extraction the extraction reaction of cu ii ions with ffas is expressed as 4 c u a q 2 2 m 2 h r 2 o r g c u r 2 h r m o r g 2 h a q where the subscripts aq and org correspond to the aqueous and organic phases respectively hr 2 represents the dimeric form of ffas and m is the number of monomeric ffas engaged in the cu ii organic complex meanwhile the peaks achieved at 500 mg l fig 2 as well as the plateaus or drops obtained subsequently fig 2 denote the increasing mass transfer resistance of cu ii ions from aqueous to organic phases which aggravated the extraction nevertheless it should be noted that the absolute amounts of cu ii ion extracted increased with the initial cu ii ion concentration for all faa rich oils these findings are comparable with other similar previous work 50 51 considering the typical range of cu ii ion concentration in real electroplating wastewater of 1 1 283 mg l 52 54 the initial cu ii ion concentration of 100 mg l was selected for further study 3 4 pheq extraction isotherms a pheq extraction isotherm is crucial to predicting the extraction characteristics of an organic solvent with respect to a solute under a variety of conditions hence the pheq extraction isotherms of cu ii ions with various ffa rich oils were investigated and the results were shown in fig 3 the initial cu ii ion concentration in the aqueous solutions was maintained at 100 mg l throughout the investigation in general a sigmoid curve was obtained for all the pheq extraction isotherms where the e of cu ii ions was minimum 20 at pheq of less than 3 40 for all ffa rich oils followed by a dramatic increase from 23 to 88 at pheq of 4 0 to 4 8 18 to 93 at pheq of 3 4 to 4 2 and from 8 to 92 at pheq of 3 4 to 4 5 for jo pfad and pkfad respectively achieving the maximum 95 at pheq of 5 4 4 7 and 4 7 for jo pfad and pkfad respectively and plateauing thereafter for all ffa rich oils fig 3 owing to the high pheq dependency of different ffa rich oils in cu ii ion extraction it is presumed that the active components that bound with cu ii ions during the extraction process were the ffas contained in ffa rich oils since they possessed acidic protons h in their free oh groups of carboxylic acid moieties 55 and thus could function as cationic extractants 56 according to the extraction reaction of cu ii ions with ffas eq 4 ffa molecules extract cu ii ions by releasing and exchanging their h reversibly with cu ii ions where its equilibrium position shifts to the right and increases the e when h decreases increasing pheq and shifts to the left and reduces the e when h increases decreasing pheq the ph extraction isotherms fig 3 obtained in this work are consistent with those reported in similar previous studies 19 57 59 they also justify the earlier conjectures about the plausible drastic increments in the cu ii ion concentrations in the organic layers of both pfad and pfkad aqueous systems when adjusting the pheq from 3 4 to 4 0 fig 1 b i ii and c i ii based upon the remarkable rise in the e of cu ii ions from pheq of 3 4 18 for pfad and 8 for pkfad fig 3 to 4 0 85 for pfad and 75 for pkfad fig 3 as well as the possible reduction in the cu ii ion concentrations in the organic layers of jo aqueous system when adjusting the pheq from 5 4 to 4 0 fig 1 a i ii due to the decline in the e of cu ii ions from pheq of 5 4 96 fig 3 to 4 0 23 fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3 the pheq extraction isotherm of cu ii ions with pfad exhibited the greatest steepness of the sigmoid curve followed by those with pkfad and jo this implies that pfad was the strongest extractant with a ph50 pheq at which 50 of cu ii ions was extracted of 3 5 pkfad was the intermediate extractant with a ph50 of 3 8 and jo was the weakest extractant with a ph50 of 4 3 fig 3 this is the characteristic of cationic extractants in which a low ph50 of the extractant for a solute signifies its high strength and propensity in extracting the solute from highly acidic aqueous media whereas a high ph50 indicates its low strength and inclination in extracting the solute from lowly acidic aqueous media 55 the ascending order of cu ii ion extraction strength of jo pkfad pfad obtained could be elucidated from the major fa contained in each of the oils jo which contained predominantly oleic acid 18 1 cis table 1 was the weakest extractant due to the steric hindrance imposed by its long chain length of 18 carbons and cis configuration that inhibited the access to the complexing sites 49 this finding agrees well with the decline in the extraction strength of different carboxylic acids for ni ii ions with their steric bulkiness as reported by preston preez 60 nevertheless between pfad and pkfad which were mainly composed of palmitic acid 16 0 and lauric acid 12 0 table 1 respectively the greater steric hindrance imposed on palmitic acid by its longer chain length of 16 carbons did not seem to reduce its extraction strength for cu ii ions this may be ascribed to the relatively lower polarity of pfad than pkfad as reflected by its lower water solubility 0 389 wt 50 c vs 0 983 wt 50 c table 1 since cu ii organic complexes were practically nonpolar due to their long nonpolar hydrocarbon tails more cu ii organic complexes could dissolve in pfad rather than in pkfad once again based on the principle of like dissolves like in spite of the deviations in the extraction strength for cu ii ions among the ffa rich oils all of them were capable to extract more than 95 of cu ii ions from aqueous solutions at distinct pheq i e 4 7 for pfad and pkfad and 5 4 for jo fig 2 which were as good as if not better than the classical extractants for cu ii ions such as d2ehpa 61 cyanex 272 62 and lix 84 i 63 diluted in various kinds of diluents 3 5 verification of the roles of ffa rich oils as extractants to verify the roles of ffa rich oils as extractants with ffas being the active components in cu ii ion extraction as proposed in sec 3 4 the pheq of the aqueous phases in jo pfad and pkfad aqueous systems were measured before and after extraction without pheq adjustment fig 4 it was discovered that the aqueous phases experienced considerable pheq drops before and after extraction i e from 5 7 to 5 4 for jo aqueous system and from 5 7 to 3 4 for both pfad and pkfad aqueous systems as shown in fig 4 these pheq drops denote the release of acidic h from ffa rich oils into aqueous phases which were presumed to be derived from the ffas contained in ffa rich oils as shown in eq 4 this presumption was supported by the ftir analysis of ffa rich oils loaded with cu ii ions where the amplitudes of the strong and broad co stretching bands of carboxylic acids which spanned over a range from 1650 to 1790 cm 1 64 decreased with the cu ii ion concentration loaded in the oils fig 5 this may be attributed to the increasing cleavage of oh bonds in the carboxylic acid moieties at one end of the ffas to liberate more acidic h for cation exchange with cu ii ions which in turn diminished the intensity of co stretching bands of carboxylic acids with cu ii ions loaded in the oils in fact similar findings have been reported in our previous works 19 65 3 6 stripping of cu ii ions from cu ii loaded pkfad stripping of extracted solutes from solute loaded solvents is vital for solute recovery and solvent regeneration in this work stripping of cu ii ions from cu ii loaded pkfad was investigated with h2so4 hno3 and hcl at different concentrations 0 5 2 0 m as the stripping agents and the findings obtained are depicted in fig 6 it was found that the s of cu ii ions increased with the stripping agent concentration 0 5 2 0 m from 90 to 95 and 88 to 93 for hno3 and hcl respectively but decreased from 94 to 83 for h2so4 the former was due to the higher h concentration at a greater molarity of hno3 and hcl while the latter was attributed to the substantially higher viscosity of h2so4 24 m pa s 20 c 66 than the viscosities of hno3 0 75 m pa s 25 c 67 and hcl 1 8 m pa s 15 c 68 which increased with its concentration 69 a similar finding was reported by hu et al 69 who observed the decline in s of vanadium from vanadium loaded hexane with h2so4 concentration despite the negative effect of h2so4 on s of cu ii ions at high concentrations its s accomplished at a low concentration of 0 5 m 94 was compatible with the s of hno3 95 and hcl 93 achieved at a high concentration of 2 0 m this could be elucidated from the greater number of moles of h 2 mol produced when one mole of h2so4 dissociated compared to that 1 mol of hno3 or hcl when one mole of hno3 or hcl dissociated the greater number of moles of h liberated by h2so4 moved the equilibrium position of the extraction equation eq 4 to the left and enhanced the s owing to the high efficiency of h2so4 at low concentrations coupled with its low volatility b p 335 c 66 compared to those of hno3 b p 83 c 67 and hcl b p 57 c 68 0 5 m h2so4 was the most preferable stripping agent for cu ii ion stripping from cu ii loaded pkfad from safety and environmental perspectives 4 conclusions among all ffa rich oils studied palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad exhibited the most favorable physicochemical properties for solvent extraction owing to its low melting point of 22 c low density of 0 89 g cm3 70 c moderate viscosity of 23 0 mpa s 50 c high ffa content of 92 2 wt and low water solubility of 0 983 wt 50 c palm fatty acid distillate pfad and jatropha oil jo were less favorable due to the high melting point of 45 c for the former and the high viscosity of 50 2 mpa s 50 c for the latter pkfad also showed the fastest 5 min phase separation with cu ii containing aqueous solutions at an equilibrium ph pheq of 4 0 followed closely by jo 5 5 min and then pfad 300 min they also shared a similar pattern increased reached a peak and plateaued or declined slightly of the initial cu ii ion concentration effect on cu ii ion extraction a sigmoid curve was obtained for all the ph extraction isotherms of cu ii ions investigated with different ffa rich oils and their extraction strengths for cu ii ions were found to be in the ascending order of jo pkfad pfad despite their dissimilarities in extraction strengths all ffa rich oils were capable to extract more than 95 of cu ii ions from aqueous solutions at distinct pheq i e 4 7 for pfad and pkfad and 5 4 for jo the roles of ffa rich oils as extractants with ffas being the active components in cu ii ion extraction were examined and verified by the decreasing amplitudes of the carboxylic acid co stretching bands with the cu ii ion concentration loaded in ffa rich oils the most preferable stripping agent was found to be 0 5 m h2so4 which stripped 94 of cu ii ions from cu ii loaded pkfad author contributions all authors have participated in a conception and design or analysis and interpretation of the data b drafting the

14171,three types of free fatty acid ffa rich oil i e jatropha oil jo palm fatty acid distillate pfad and palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad were investigated into their potentiality as green extractants for cu ii ion extraction from aqueous solutions the physicochemical properties of ffa rich oils and their progressive phase separations with cu ii containing aqueous solutions were studied the effect of initial cu ii ion concentration on the extraction efficiency by different ffa rich oils along with their ph extraction isotherms and back extraction stripping were also explored the results revealed that pkfad showed the most favorable physicochemical properties and phase separation behavior while achieving a high extraction efficiency 95 among all the ffa rich oils studied therefore pkfad is a prospective green exractant for cu ii ions from aqueous solutions keywords extraction cu ii ions jatropha oil palm fatty acid distillate palm kernel fatty acid distillate green extractants 1 introduction in recent decades heavy metals in industrial effluents have drawn considerable attention of both researchers and practitioners from all around the globe owing to their lethal toxicity at low concentrations 1 ppm of ld50 median lethal dose 1 non biodegradability bioaccumulation and inherent persistency 2 among the various heavy metals copper is one of the toxic priority pollutants listed by the u s environmental protection agency 3 in particular cupric cu ii ions which are found ubiquitously in effluents produced by a wide variety of industries such as electroplating mining printed circuit board manufacturing and metal finishing 4 have exacerbated various deleterious degradations towards the living organisms such as fish and shellfish 5 when effluents laden with cu ii ions are discharged directly into the waterways the conventional effluent treatment techniques for cu ii ions include chemical precipitation 6 coagulation flocculation 7 membrane filtration 8 ion exchange 9 and adsorption 10 however each of these techniques suffers from its own intrinsic shortcomings and none of them is universal in treating all kinds of industrial effluents established since the 1940s 11 solvent extraction is one of the prevalent effluent treatment techniques for metal ions due to its high efficiency high selectivity ease of operation and low operating and maintenance costs 12 its working principle is based on the relative solubility of metal ions between an aqueous solution and an organic solvent which are immiscible with each other 13 typically the organic solvent is made up of an extractant and a diluent where the former binds and converts metal ions into extractable species while the latter governs the overall solvent conditions 14 nevertheless the conventional extractants di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa cyanex 272 lix 84 aliquat 336 14 and diluents kerosene n hexane chloroform toluene 14 used in solvent extraction are mostly derived from petroleum resources which are detrimental to living organisms when they are released to the environment and could be inordinately expensive due to their finite resources of late there is increasing research in the application of renewable and environmentally benign organic solvents in extracting metal ions from aqueous solutions for instance chang et al 15 wahab et al 16 and bhatluri et al 17 successfully utilized d2ehpa as an extractant and fresh or waste vegetable oil soybean oil 15 palm oil 16 or coconut oil 17 as a diluent to extract various metal ions cu ii 15 16 cd ii 17 or pb ii 17 ions from aqueous solutions however these organic solvents were not entirely green since one of the components of the solvents i e d2ehpa the extractant was a hazardous petroleum product in another study ong et al 18 hydrolyzed the waste vegetable oil in a cu ii containing aqueous solution to generate free fatty acids ffas green extractants which concomitantly extracted cu ii ions by a cation exchange mechanism this simultaneous oil hydrolysis and solvent extraction process is a prospective effluent treatment technique in view of the totally green organic solvent used however this process is more complex and incurs a higher operating cost than the traditional solvent extraction due to the more severe operating conditions 225 c vs 25 c of operating temperature 480 min vs 6 min of operating time pre treatment of product for glycerol removal vs no pre treatment of product sensitive extraction condition that requires an absence of oxygen vs non sensitive extraction condition 18 19 involved to reap the benefits of ffas as green extractants and to avoid the additional hydrolysis process during solvent extraction as reported by ong et al 18 three types of naturally ffa rich oils namely jatropha oil jo with 14 wt ffas 20 21 palm fatty acid distillate pfad with 90 wt ffas 22 and palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad with 80 90 wt ffas 23 were studied as the potential renewable and green extractants without any diluents for cu ii ion extraction from aqueous solutions in this work in general jo is non edible vegetable oil which is mainly converted into biodiesel for use in diesel engines 24 pfad and pkfad on the other hand are by products from the physical refining of crude palm oil 22 and crude palm kernel oil 23 respectively both of which are widely utilized as fatty acid fa sources for oleo chemical soap and animal feed industries 25 26 as much as we know these ffa rich oils have not been used to extract metal ions from aqueous solutions to this end the physicochemical properties of jo pfad and pkfad were first determined and their progressive phase separations with cu ii containing aqueous solutions were investigated next the effect of initial cu ii ion concentration on the extraction efficiency was studied and the ph extraction isotherms of cu ii ions with jo pfad and pkfad were explored the roles of jo pfad and pkfad as extractants for cu ii ions were also discussed and verified lastly back extraction or stripping of cu ii ions from cu ii loaded pkfad was investigated with different stripping agents 2 experimental study 2 1 materials the ffa rich oils were supplied by local vendors i e jo by bionas sdn bhd pfad and pkfad by sime darby sdn bhd all of which was used directly without further purification copper

merck 1 in ethanol were used as received 2 2 equipment an incubator shaker lab companion si 300 was used to mix the aqueous and organic phases and a ph meter hanna instruments hi11310 was used to measure the ph of aqueous phase before and after extraction the concentrations of cu ii ions in aqueous phases after extraction were determined by a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer faas shimadzu aa7000 whereas the viscosities and functional groups of organic phases were analyzed by a digital viscometer graigar ndj 8s and an attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy shimadzu irprestige 21 respectively 2 3 characterization of ffa rich oils the ffa rich oils i e jo pfad and pkfad used in this work were characterized for their viscosities water solubility fa compositions and ffa contents the viscosity was measured with a digital viscometer based on the astm d445 test method 27 whereas the water solubility was determined by measuring the equilibrium water content in an ffa rich oils by means of the karl fischer titration method 28 after mixing the solvent with an aqueous solution containing 100 mg l of cu ii ions and 200 mm of na2so4 inert salt under the following conditions equilibrium ph pheq of 4 0 19 29 organic to aqueous phase ratio of 1 5 1 and temperature of 50 c while the fa compositions were analyzed in accordance with the standard aoac 996 06 test method 30 the ffa contents were determined through a titration method as described by zenevicz et al 31 the latter began with mixing 2 g of an ffa rich oil with 30 ml of an equivolume solution of anhydrous ethanol and diethyl ether the mixture was then titrated against a 0 1 m koh solution with phenolphthalein as an indicator lastly the ffa content of the ffa rich oil was calculated by 31 1 f f a c o n t e n t w t v k o h m k o h m m f f a 10 m s where vkoh is the volume of koh solution ml used in the titration mkoh is the molarity of koh solution mol l mmffa is the average molar mass of ffas and ms is the sample mass g other properties of ffa rich oils such as melting point and density were obtained from the literature 32 34 2 4 preparation of aqueous and organic phases in extraction experiments the aqueous phases containing specific initial concentrations 100 500 and 1000 mg l of cu ii ions were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of cuso4 5h2o in distilled water loaded with 200 mm na2so4 whereas the organic phases were prepared with different ffa rich oils i e jo pfad and pkfad without any pre treatment or addition of chemicals in stripping experiments the organic phase were cu ii loaded pkfad obtained from the extraction experiments whereas the aqueous phases were prepared from various types of stripping agents h2so4 hno3 and hcl at different concentrations from 0 5 to 2 0 m 2 5 extraction procedure extraction of cu ii ions was performed based on the shake out test as delineated in our previous work 35 firstly a volume of 22 5 ml ffa rich oil jo pfad or pkfad was mixed with a prepared cu ii containing aqueous solution at 1 5 1 organic to aqueous volume ratio in a glass stoppered conical flask the flask was then agitated on an incubator shaker at 150 rpm and 50 c for 8 min the mixture was left to settle for 5 min for phase separation next about 10 ml sample was taken from the aqueous phase with a syringe and the ph of the sample was measured with a ph meter if the desired pheq was not obtained the ph of the aqueous phase was adjusted with 1 m h2so4 or 1 m naoh and the mixture was mixed for another 8 min this step was repeated until the desired pheq was obtained finally the mixture was transferred into a separating funnel for overnight phase disengagement and about 15 ml sample was withdrawn from the aqueous phase for chemical analysis with a faas the percentage extraction e of cu ii ions was calculated according to 2 e c u i a q c u f a q c u i a q x 100 where cu i aq and cu f aq are the initial and final cu ii ion concentrations respectively in the aqueous feed phase all extraction experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate at 50 c and the relative standard deviation between replicate samples within an experiment range was less than 3 2 6 stripping procedure the stripping experiments were conducted by using the same procedures as the extraction experiments but without the pheq adjustment after mixing of aqueous and organic phases an organic to aqueous volume ratio of 1 1 and a temperature of 25 c were applied throughout all the stripping experiments the percentage of stripping s of cu ii ions was given by 3 s c u f s t r i p c u i a q c u f a q x 100 where cu f strip is the final concentration of cu ii ions in the aqueous stripping phase all stripping experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate and the relative standard deviation between replicate samples within an experiment range was less than 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of ffa rich oils the physicochemical properties of an organic solvent govern the extraction behavior of the organic solvent and determine its suitability for use in sx 13 table 1 shows the physicochemical properties melting point density viscosity fa composition ffa content and water solubility of different ffa rich oils jo pfad and pkfad studied in this work it can be seen that the melting points of jo and pkfad were well below room temperature 25 c i e 4 5 c and 22 c respectively whereas that of pfad was above room temperature i e 45 c as a result jo and pkfad were literally liquids at ambient conditions and could be employed as the potential organic solvents for ambient sx whereas pfad was semi solid and could only be used for high temperature sx nevertheless all these ffa rich oils were found to have analogous densities of less than 1 g cm3 i e 0 86 0 89 g cm3 table 1 suggesting that all of them float on water this provides a key insight concerning the configuration of aqueous and organic phases when they are applied in an sx system table 1 also reveals that jo was significantly more viscous 50 2 mpa s 50 c than pfad 24 3 mpa s 50 c and pkfad 23 0 mpa s 50 c and these findings are in good agreement with the previous works 36 39 being lipid materials ffa rich oils owe their viscosities to three key features of fa composition carbon chain length degree of unsaturation and double bond configuration 40 in general the viscosity of a lipid material increases with the carbon chain length but decreases with the degree of unsaturation and the cis double bond configuration of its bulk fas 41 among these factors carbon chain length appears to be the most fitting in explaining the viscosity order of ffa rich oils obtained in this work in this regard jo which was rich in 18 carbon oleic acid 42 0 wt was the most viscous followed by pfad that was abundant in 16 carbon palmitic acid 49 7 wt and pkfad that was loaded with 12 carbon lauric acid 49 1 wt as depicted in table 1 similar findings on the increasing viscosity of fatty acids with their carbon chain length had also been reported by several researchers 40 41 nonetheless all these ffa rich oils were substantially more viscous than the conventional petroleum based organic solvents used in sx for instance kerosene 1 64 mpa s 25 c 14 n hexane 0 297 mpa s 25 c 14 and chloroform 0 53 mpa s 25 c 14 this is an undesirable trait since the viscous ffa rich oils would reduce their mobility and hinder the transport of solutes across them during the sx process providentially the high viscosities of ffa rich oils could be moderated by heating which would reduce the intermolecular cohesive forces in the oils 42 mixing or stirring that would minimize the boundary layer resistance concentration polarization in the oils 14 adding suitable viscosity reducers to the oils 43 and so forth in spite of the greater viscosities of ffa rich oils than those of the conventional organic solvents it is noteworthy that jo was as viscous as vegetable oil 44 54 mpa s 25 c 14 while pfad and pkfad were about a factor of two less viscous than vegetable oil this implies that ffa rich oils particularly pfad and pkad were more favorable than vegetable oil to be used as green organic solvents for sx at least from the lower viscosity point of view with respect to water solubility pkfad was found to dissolve the most amount of water 0 983 wt 50 c followed by jo 0 511 wt 50 c and pfad 0 389 wt 50 c as shown in table 1 this suggests the order of decreasing polarity of pkfad jo pfad which may be explained by the variations in their ffa contents and fa chain length on the whole ffas are fas that occur as free unesterified molecules in nature as opposed to fas which are often esterified to lipid molecules 44 being free molecules ffas carry polar heads of free oh groups of the carboxylic acid moieties which interact favorably with water compared to their lipid bound fa counterparts that have no free oh 44 as a result the higher the ffa content of an oil the more water soluble it is in light of the highest ffa content of pkfad 92 2 wt along with the shortest carbon chain length of its bulk 12 carbon lauric acid pkfad exhibited the greatest water solubility 0 983 wt 50 c among the ffa rich oils table 1 nevertheless the larger ffa content of pfad 85 0 wt and the shorter carbon chain length of its bulk 16 carbon palmitic acid than those of jo ffa content of 16 9 wt and bulk 18 carbon oleic acid did not result in the larger water solubility of pfad this may be attributed to the smaller degree of unsaturation of pfad than that of jo unsaturated to saturated fa ratio of pfad of 1 1 vs that of jo of 3 1 table 1 which had rendered it less polar and thus dissolved less water than jo 0 389 wt 50 c vs 0 511 wt 50 c table 1 in spite of their abilities in dissolving trace amounts of water 1 wt all ffa rich oils are practically non polar due to their extremely low dielectric constants i e 4 45 46 and therefore could be used as the potential organic solvents for sx in a nutshell pkfad exhibited the most favorable physicochemical properties for solvent extraction among all ffa rich oils studied on account of its low melting point of 22 c low density of 0 89 g cm3 70 c moderate viscosity of 23 0 mpa s 50 c high ffa content of 92 2 wt and low water solubility of 0 983 wt 50 c table 1 pfad and jo were less favorable due to the high melting point of 45 c for the former and the high viscosity of 50 2 mpa s 50 c for the latter 3 2 progressive phase separations of ffa rich oils with cu ii containing aqueous solutions rapid separation of the organic and aqueous phases without emulsion or crud formation at the organic aqueous interface is a desirable trait in sx in this work the progressive phase separations of different ffa rich oils i e jo pfad and pkfad from cu ii containing aqueous solutions were investigated without and with pheq adjustments fig 1 the initial cu ii ion concentration in the aqueous solution was maintained at 100 mg l throughout the investigation without pheq adjustment the pheq of the jo pfad and pkfad aqueous systems were attained at 5 4 3 4 and 3 4 respectively to adjust and maintain the same pheq of 4 0 across different organic aqueous systems a few drops of 1 m h2so4 was added to the jo aqueous system while a trace amount of 1 m naoh was added to both the pfad and pkfad aqueous systems as can be seen in fig 1 a thick and bulky emulsion layer that almost filled up the entire separating funnel was formed between the organic and aqueous layers at the outset of phase separation i e t 0 in all the organic aqueous systems either without or with pheq adjustment this unstable emulsion layer then broke up with time due to creaming flocculation and coalescence 47 until complete phase separation occurred fig 1 the emulsion breaking time i e the time required to break up the emulsion layer however varied from one organic aqueous system to another and between those without and with pheq adjustments within an organic aqueous system without pheq adjustment the increasing order of the emulsion breaking time was pfad aqueous system 1 67 min fig 1b i pkfad aqueous system 3 min fig 1c i jo aqueous system 5 min fig 1a i whereas with pheq adjustment the order was pkfad aqueous system 5 min fig 1c ii jo aqueous system 5 5 min fig 1a ii pfad aqueous system 300 min fig 1b ii the former order could be deduced from the variations in the viscosity and water solubility among the ffa rich oils while the latter was influenced by the presence of soap i e sodium salts of fas due to the reaction of fas with naoh in the system which could act as a surfactant to stabilize the emulsion layers by reducing the liquid liquid interfacial tension and prolong the emulsion breaking time 48 without pheq adjustment pfad aqueous system took the shortest time to break up the emulsion layer due to its relatively low viscosity 24 3 mpa s 50 c table 1 and lowest water solubility 0 389 wt 50 c table 1 among the ffa rich oils the low viscosity of pfad enhanced the creaming rate of pfad droplets from emulsion to organic layer according to stoke s law 47 while the lowest water solubility in pfad indicates its lowest polarity among the ffa rich oils which prompted its separation from the polar aqueous solution based on the like dissolves like aphorism 19 between pkfad and jo aqueous systems without pheq adjustment the former was faster in breaking up the emulsion layer due to its much lower viscosity 23 0 mpa s 50 c vs 50 2 mpa s 50 c table 1 albeit its higher water solubility 0 983 wt 50 c vs 0 511 wt 50 c table 1 than the latter with pheq adjustment however soap was formed in both the pfad and pkfad aqueous systems following the addition of 1 m naoh during pheq adjustment which in turn increased the emulsion breaking time i e from 1 67 min without pheq adjustment fig 1b i to 300 min with pheq adjustment fig 1b ii for pfad aqueous system and from 3 min without pheq adjustment fig 1c i to 5 min with pheq adjustment fig 1c ii for pkfad aqueous system the substantially larger increment in the emulsion breaking time encountered by the pfad aqueous system than that by the pkfad aqueous system when pheq was adjusted from 3 4 to 4 0 may be attributed to the greater amount of soap surfactant formed in the pfad aqueous system fig 1b ii as a result of its higher proportion of unsaturated fas unsaturated to saturated fa ratio of 1 1 vs 1 7 table 1 which were more reactive than their saturated counterparts due to their double bonds 49 this finding is consistent with that of kamba et al 48 who reported the increasing emulsion stability with surfactant concentration meanwhile no soap was formed in jo aqueous system when pheq was adjusted from 5 4 to 4 0 due to the addition of 1 m h2so4 instead of 1 m naoh into the system consequently jo aqueous system did not undergo a significant change in the emulsion breaking time when pheq was adjusted i e from 5 min without pheq adjustment fig 1a i to 5 5 min with pheq adjustment fig 1a ii on top of the variations observed in the emulsion breaking time among the organic aqueous systems and between those without and with pheq adjustment within an organic aqueous system the color intensity of the organic layer within an organic aqueous system also experienced notable changes when pheq was adjusted particularly for pfad fig 1b i ii and pkfad aqueous fig 1c i ii systems where the color intensity of the organic layers changed from somewhat lighter to much darker this suggests that there may have been a steep rise in the concentration of cu ii ions in the organic layers of pfad and pfkad aqueous systems when pheq was adjusted from 3 4 to 4 0 for jo aqueous system on the other hand a subtle change in the color intensity of the organic layer from darker to lighter implies a decline in the cu ii ion concentrations in the organic layer of jo aqueous system when pheq was adjusted from 5 4 to 4 0 fig 1a i ii 3 3 effect of initial cu ii ion concentration on extraction efficiency since the initial solute concentration in aqueous solutions often varies from one source to another it is vital to study the effect of initial solute concentration on the extraction efficiency of a solvent for the solute fig 2 shows the effect of different initial cu ii ion concentrations 100 500 and 1000 mg l on the e of cu ii ions by various ffa rich oils jo pfad and pkfad at pheq of 4 0 it reveals that pfad achieved the highest e of cu ii ions throughout the different initial cu ii ion concentrations studied followed closely by pkfad and then jo regardless of the types of ffa rich oil studied e of cu ii ions were the lowest at 100 mg l of initial cu ii ion concentration i e 23 for jo 85 for pfad and 75 for pkfad they then enhanced steadily with the initial cu ii ion concentration from 100 to 500 mg l reached or closely approached a small peak at 500 mg l i e 36 for jo 95 for pfad and 91 for pkfad and plateaued or declined somewhat thereafter to 1000 mg l fig 2 the rise in the e of cu ii ions from 100 to 500 mg l attained by all ffa rich oils fig 2 was ascribed to the increase in the driving force for cu ii ion transfer which caused the equilibrium position of the extraction reaction of cu ii ions with ffas to shift to the right and improved the extraction the extraction reaction of cu ii ions with ffas is expressed as 4 c u a q 2 2 m 2 h r 2 o r g c u r 2 h r m o r g 2 h a q where the subscripts aq and org correspond to the aqueous and organic phases respectively hr 2 represents the dimeric form of ffas and m is the number of monomeric ffas engaged in the cu ii organic complex meanwhile the peaks achieved at 500 mg l fig 2 as well as the plateaus or drops obtained subsequently fig 2 denote the increasing mass transfer resistance of cu ii ions from aqueous to organic phases which aggravated the extraction nevertheless it should be noted that the absolute amounts of cu ii ion extracted increased with the initial cu ii ion concentration for all faa rich oils these findings are comparable with other similar previous work 50 51 considering the typical range of cu ii ion concentration in real electroplating wastewater of 1 1 283 mg l 52 54 the initial cu ii ion concentration of 100 mg l was selected for further study 3 4 pheq extraction isotherms a pheq extraction isotherm is crucial to predicting the extraction characteristics of an organic solvent with respect to a solute under a variety of conditions hence the pheq extraction isotherms of cu ii ions with various ffa rich oils were investigated and the results were shown in fig 3 the initial cu ii ion concentration in the aqueous solutions was maintained at 100 mg l throughout the investigation in general a sigmoid curve was obtained for all the pheq extraction isotherms where the e of cu ii ions was minimum 20 at pheq of less than 3 40 for all ffa rich oils followed by a dramatic increase from 23 to 88 at pheq of 4 0 to 4 8 18 to 93 at pheq of 3 4 to 4 2 and from 8 to 92 at pheq of 3 4 to 4 5 for jo pfad and pkfad respectively achieving the maximum 95 at pheq of 5 4 4 7 and 4 7 for jo pfad and pkfad respectively and plateauing thereafter for all ffa rich oils fig 3 owing to the high pheq dependency of different ffa rich oils in cu ii ion extraction it is presumed that the active components that bound with cu ii ions during the extraction process were the ffas contained in ffa rich oils since they possessed acidic protons h in their free oh groups of carboxylic acid moieties 55 and thus could function as cationic extractants 56 according to the extraction reaction of cu ii ions with ffas eq 4 ffa molecules extract cu ii ions by releasing and exchanging their h reversibly with cu ii ions where its equilibrium position shifts to the right and increases the e when h decreases increasing pheq and shifts to the left and reduces the e when h increases decreasing pheq the ph extraction isotherms fig 3 obtained in this work are consistent with those reported in similar previous studies 19 57 59 they also justify the earlier conjectures about the plausible drastic increments in the cu ii ion concentrations in the organic layers of both pfad and pfkad aqueous systems when adjusting the pheq from 3 4 to 4 0 fig 1 b i ii and c i ii based upon the remarkable rise in the e of cu ii ions from pheq of 3 4 18 for pfad and 8 for pkfad fig 3 to 4 0 85 for pfad and 75 for pkfad fig 3 as well as the possible reduction in the cu ii ion concentrations in the organic layers of jo aqueous system when adjusting the pheq from 5 4 to 4 0 fig 1 a i ii due to the decline in the e of cu ii ions from pheq of 5 4 96 fig 3 to 4 0 23 fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3 the pheq extraction isotherm of cu ii ions with pfad exhibited the greatest steepness of the sigmoid curve followed by those with pkfad and jo this implies that pfad was the strongest extractant with a ph50 pheq at which 50 of cu ii ions was extracted of 3 5 pkfad was the intermediate extractant with a ph50 of 3 8 and jo was the weakest extractant with a ph50 of 4 3 fig 3 this is the characteristic of cationic extractants in which a low ph50 of the extractant for a solute signifies its high strength and propensity in extracting the solute from highly acidic aqueous media whereas a high ph50 indicates its low strength and inclination in extracting the solute from lowly acidic aqueous media 55 the ascending order of cu ii ion extraction strength of jo pkfad pfad obtained could be elucidated from the major fa contained in each of the oils jo which contained predominantly oleic acid 18 1 cis table 1 was the weakest extractant due to the steric hindrance imposed by its long chain length of 18 carbons and cis configuration that inhibited the access to the complexing sites 49 this finding agrees well with the decline in the extraction strength of different carboxylic acids for ni ii ions with their steric bulkiness as reported by preston preez 60 nevertheless between pfad and pkfad which were mainly composed of palmitic acid 16 0 and lauric acid 12 0 table 1 respectively the greater steric hindrance imposed on palmitic acid by its longer chain length of 16 carbons did not seem to reduce its extraction strength for cu ii ions this may be ascribed to the relatively lower polarity of pfad than pkfad as reflected by its lower water solubility 0 389 wt 50 c vs 0 983 wt 50 c table 1 since cu ii organic complexes were practically nonpolar due to their long nonpolar hydrocarbon tails more cu ii organic complexes could dissolve in pfad rather than in pkfad once again based on the principle of like dissolves like in spite of the deviations in the extraction strength for cu ii ions among the ffa rich oils all of them were capable to extract more than 95 of cu ii ions from aqueous solutions at distinct pheq i e 4 7 for pfad and pkfad and 5 4 for jo fig 2 which were as good as if not better than the classical extractants for cu ii ions such as d2ehpa 61 cyanex 272 62 and lix 84 i 63 diluted in various kinds of diluents 3 5 verification of the roles of ffa rich oils as extractants to verify the roles of ffa rich oils as extractants with ffas being the active components in cu ii ion extraction as proposed in sec 3 4 the pheq of the aqueous phases in jo pfad and pkfad aqueous systems were measured before and after extraction without pheq adjustment fig 4 it was discovered that the aqueous phases experienced considerable pheq drops before and after extraction i e from 5 7 to 5 4 for jo aqueous system and from 5 7 to 3 4 for both pfad and pkfad aqueous systems as shown in fig 4 these pheq drops denote the release of acidic h from ffa rich oils into aqueous phases which were presumed to be derived from the ffas contained in ffa rich oils as shown in eq 4 this presumption was supported by the ftir analysis of ffa rich oils loaded with cu ii ions where the amplitudes of the strong and broad co stretching bands of carboxylic acids which spanned over a range from 1650 to 1790 cm 1 64 decreased with the cu ii ion concentration loaded in the oils fig 5 this may be attributed to the increasing cleavage of oh bonds in the carboxylic acid moieties at one end of the ffas to liberate more acidic h for cation exchange with cu ii ions which in turn diminished the intensity of co stretching bands of carboxylic acids with cu ii ions loaded in the oils in fact similar findings have been reported in our previous works 19 65 3 6 stripping of cu ii ions from cu ii loaded pkfad stripping of extracted solutes from solute loaded solvents is vital for solute recovery and solvent regeneration in this work stripping of cu ii ions from cu ii loaded pkfad was investigated with h2so4 hno3 and hcl at different concentrations 0 5 2 0 m as the stripping agents and the findings obtained are depicted in fig 6 it was found that the s of cu ii ions increased with the stripping agent concentration 0 5 2 0 m from 90 to 95 and 88 to 93 for hno3 and hcl respectively but decreased from 94 to 83 for h2so4 the former was due to the higher h concentration at a greater molarity of hno3 and hcl while the latter was attributed to the substantially higher viscosity of h2so4 24 m pa s 20 c 66 than the viscosities of hno3 0 75 m pa s 25 c 67 and hcl 1 8 m pa s 15 c 68 which increased with its concentration 69 a similar finding was reported by hu et al 69 who observed the decline in s of vanadium from vanadium loaded hexane with h2so4 concentration despite the negative effect of h2so4 on s of cu ii ions at high concentrations its s accomplished at a low concentration of 0 5 m 94 was compatible with the s of hno3 95 and hcl 93 achieved at a high concentration of 2 0 m this could be elucidated from the greater number of moles of h 2 mol produced when one mole of h2so4 dissociated compared to that 1 mol of hno3 or hcl when one mole of hno3 or hcl dissociated the greater number of moles of h liberated by h2so4 moved the equilibrium position of the extraction equation eq 4 to the left and enhanced the s owing to the high efficiency of h2so4 at low concentrations coupled with its low volatility b p 335 c 66 compared to those of hno3 b p 83 c 67 and hcl b p 57 c 68 0 5 m h2so4 was the most preferable stripping agent for cu ii ion stripping from cu ii loaded pkfad from safety and environmental perspectives 4 conclusions among all ffa rich oils studied palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad exhibited the most favorable physicochemical properties for solvent extraction owing to its low melting point of 22 c low density of 0 89 g cm3 70 c moderate viscosity of 23 0 mpa s 50 c high ffa content of 92 2 wt and low water solubility of 0 983 wt 50 c palm fatty acid distillate pfad and jatropha oil jo were less favorable due to the high melting point of 45 c for the former and the high viscosity of 50 2 mpa s 50 c for the latter pkfad also showed the fastest 5 min phase separation with cu ii containing aqueous solutions at an equilibrium ph pheq of 4 0 followed closely by jo 5 5 min and then pfad 300 min they also shared a similar pattern increased reached a peak and plateaued or declined slightly of the initial cu ii ion concentration effect on cu ii ion extraction a sigmoid curve was obtained for all the ph extraction isotherms of cu ii ions investigated with different ffa rich oils and their extraction strengths for cu ii ions were found to be in the ascending order of jo pkfad pfad despite their dissimilarities in extraction strengths all ffa rich oils were capable to extract more than 95 of cu ii ions from aqueous solutions at distinct pheq i e 4 7 for pfad and pkfad and 5 4 for jo the roles of ffa rich oils as extractants with ffas being the active components in cu ii ion extraction were examined and verified by the decreasing amplitudes of the carboxylic acid co stretching bands with the cu ii ion concentration loaded in ffa rich oils the most preferable stripping agent was found to be 0 5 m h2so4 which stripped 94 of cu ii ions from cu ii loaded pkfad author contributions all authors have participated in a conception and design or analysis and interpretation of the data b drafting the

14172,the efficacy of the synthesized 4a zeolite and the 4a zeolite based carbon composites were examined for the removal of cobalt ions from an aqueous solution by ion exchange two types of agricultural waste were chosen as precursors to prepare the porous supports for composites synthesized at hydrothermal conditions the maximum exchange capacity of zeolite portions present in 4a zeolite almond shells carbon aas and 4a zeolite walnut shells carbon aws reached to 235 175 and 202 887 mg ion g zeolite but it reached to 99 525 mg ion g zeolite for 4a zeolite a at same conditions removal of cobalt ions by ion exchange process enhanced when the temperature and ph of the cobalt solution increased the equilibrium data are precisely fitted by the freundlich model with a correlation factor r2 of 0 9807 0 9859 and 0 9857 for a aas and aws the cobalt uptake by zeolite based carbon composites process is controlled by ion exchange the weber and morris intra particle diffusion kinetics and boyd model equations confirmed enhancement of cobalt removal using the composites the seepage of cobalt ions from the solidified ion exchangers encapsulating ions reduced to 0 01 ppm in h2o and to 0 05 0 25 ppm in 0 5 n nacl solution keywords hierarchical porosity zeolite carbon composites ion exchange vitrification 1 introduction human and industrial activities produce streams of wastewater associating with manufacturing and processing different materials these effluents are considered as polluted waters when containing an unallowable concentration lethal dose of potential pollutants causing harmful changes to the receiving water bodies 1 2 engineers and scientists consider treating industrial wastewaters as a big issue due to increasing the industrial activities especially wastewater containing heavy metals and radionuclides because they hazardously influence human health and other organisms in the environment 3 4 about 20 metals are released into the environment are classified as toxic and 50 of those are discharged with quantities harmful to human health 5 numerous industries release effluents containing surplus heavy metals into the aqueous environment such as paper pulp cloth and leather plastics industries microelectronics and electroplating industries fertilizers and pesticides productions mining operations metal smelters and cleaning paint dyes and pigments tannery galvanizing and refining industries 6 8 untreated or poorly treated industrial effluents contain heavy metals such as ni cr pb cd hg co as cu and zn which are highly toxic highly soluble and extremely tend to bioaccumulate in the tissues of living organisms and causes major problems to the environment 2 9 cobalt is one of the harmful radioactive elements discharged into the effluents of many industries such as electronic and semiconductors industries nuclear medicine catalysts for petrochemical industry mining grinding wheels manufacturing vitamin b12 pigments electroplating paints and varnishes and metallurgy 10 12 the physical property of the pure cobalt is shiny hard metal odorless steely grey cobalt is naturally present in the earth s shell in form of metals or salts and it is present in the sea water soil and dust it is also present in the human body according to the epa the acceptable level of cobalt in drinking water is 0 002 0 107 ppm 13 while it is 0 05 1 ppm for the irrigation water according to environmental bureau of investigation and canadian water quality guidelines which means that everybody is subjected to cobalt through water food and air 10 the presence of cobalt in the contaminated water causes serious problems due to its toxic nature and harmful effects to the humans health such as allergy nausea asthma vomiting loss of smell either completely or partially genetic changes in living cells damage to the thyroid heart failure damage to the heart damage to the liver in addition it causes neuro toxicological symptoms like headaches and changes in reflexes cancer risks resulting of exposure to cobalt radiation also cobalt isotopes send ionizing radiation 10 12 14 that all elucidate the significant increase in the studies related to eliminate pollution with cobalt several methods have been improved over the years to achieve best and cheapest removal of cobalt the most commonly used techniques to remove heavy metals and radioactive elements from wastewater are chemical precipitation electroflotation evaporation adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration reverse osmosis electrodialysis coagulation flocculation and solvent extraction 15 16 however most of these methods are there are generally expensive generating toxic sludge or secondary wastes and not appropriate for low metal concentrations and small scale industries 14 17 18 adsorption and ion exchange methods have been diagnosed as effective cheap and easy adaption methods for cobalt removal especially when inexpensive and chemico physically feasible adsorbents are used to minimize the hazards of harmful contaminates 15 many different media have been used for adsorption and ion exchange purposes to remove co ions and other heavy metals such as coir pith 14 wood ash 19 black carrot residue 20 lemon peel 11 trichoderma reesei 21 spirulina platensis 22 coal dust 23 cashew nut shells 24 sunflower shell 25 al khriet 16 iron based water treatment residuals 26 chitosan egg shells humate potassium and sugar beet factory lime 27 also rice shells lentil shells wheat shells sawdust peanut hulls wheat straw rubber tree leaf oil palm leaf powders polyethylenimine modified aerobic granules and modified meranti sawdust were used as low cost adsorbents 28 however works of literature have mentioned several works based on developing synthetic materials as effective adsorbents for heavy metals removal such as acetonitrile stannic iv selenite composite cation exchanger 29 nano sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide zr iv selenite composite cation exchanger 30 alizarin red s modified amberlite ira 400 resin 31 moreover other work used some materials to provide required surface area for adsorption and rapid degradation of hazardous metals such as zro2 fe3o4 chitosan nanocomposite 32 zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicates of alkali and alkaline earth metals with a crystalline microporous structure consisting of tetrahedral units linked with each other through a shared oxygen 33 utilizing of zeolites to treat wastewater is very effective especially when they are natural zeolite this is because they are inexpensive abundant easily regenerated and have a good cation exchange capacity good selectivity for cations high surface area a rigid porous structure and good stability in acidic conditions 34 synthetic zeolites have been utilized to eliminate cobalt such as pure zeolite x 35 pure zeolite y 36 and cancrinite 13 the ion exchange performance of zeolite can be enhanced when it is synthesized in form of composites incorporating inexpensive porous supports such as carbon made from natural agricultural waste materials 37 40 presence of macro mesoporous supports adds advantages of reducing the resistance to mass transfer and enhancing the rate of diffusion of ions and molecules to and from active sites also composites contain only a small portion of zeolites which adds the advantages of the small volume of vitrified capsules in comparison with pure zeolite used for the same purpose 37 38 for example composite zeolite y carbon was used to remove cobalt ion from an aqueous solution 41 the current work present a detailed study about removal of cobalt ion using 4a zeolite based carbon composites at different conditions also the experimental data would be fitted using isotherm models available in the literature to elucidate the trend of the cobalt in the removal process 2 experimental work 2 1 chemicals and materials hydrous sodium metasilicate na2sio3 5h2o from bdh technical was used as a silica and sodium oxide source anhydrous sodium aluminate 55 56 wt al2o3 from riedel dehaën was used as alumina and sodium oxide source naoh pellets 99 9 wt from fisher scientific was used as sodium oxide source deionised water was implemented for different uses in this study cobalt nitrate hexahydrate 99 wt from lancaster synthesis to prepare cobalt solution a commercial zeolite a supplied by bdh chemicals ltd was used to prepare nanoparticles suspension solution agricultural waste namely almond and walnut shells were collected from yards located in the north of iraq 2 2 preparation of 4a zeolite 4a zeolite with a gel composition of 4 na2o al2o3 2 sio2 180 h2o was prepared according to the procedures mentioned in the previous work 42 43 preparation of the gel started with dissolving 0 377 g of sodium hydroxide pellets in 20 g of deionized water then 2 785 g of hydrous sodium metasilicate was mixed with only half of the naoh solution for 15 30 min 1 19 g of anhydrous sodium aluminate was mixed with the other half of the hydroxide solution for 15 30 min until the solution became clear silica solution was then added to the alumina solution and mixed for 20 30 min until the formation of a thick creamy gel crystallization of the gel produced was conducted using a teflon lined autoclave at 100 c for 4 h after that the autoclave was quenched and the product was taken out washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 50 80 c then characterization by xrd sem edax and n2 adsorption desorption was conducted for the samples 2 3 preparation of 4a zeolite based carbon composites a nanoparticles suspension solution was prepared from commercial 4a zeolite using a ball mill according to procedures mentioned in 39 to create nucleation sites on the support surface via ultrasonication almond shells and walnut shells were used as precursors for a porous support both almond and walnut are abundant crops in the north of iraq and their extensive consumption generates a huge amount of shells which is considered as municipal solid waste the procedures and conditions followed in this study were chosen in accordance with the literature 37 38 the precursors were properly cleaned washed with deionized water dried and imaged by sem then the shells were weighed and heated at 800 c for 3 h using a tubular furnace in an atmosphere of nitrogen gas the product was weighed manually ground and sieved to obtain the support characterizing of samples before and after being used as supports was conducted by both sem edax and n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the surface of the carbonous support was modified using the nanoparticle suspension prior to be used in the hydrothermal treatment according to the producers used in a previously published work 39 the procedures used for the preparation of composites were the same as those used to prepare pure 4 a zeolite just one step was introduced to the process this step is adding carbon support to the aluminosilicates gel before crystallization the weight of support added to a batch of the prepared gel was according to the weight ratio of 2 5 carbon 1 silica in the silica source the mixture of carbon and gel was continuously stirred for 15 min and then crystallized inside teflon lined autoclaves at 100 c for 4 h the resulting composites were recovered filtered washed with deionised water and dried at 50 80 c samples of the composites were taken to be characterized by xrd sem edax tga and n2 adsorption desorption isotherms 2 4 ion exchange experiments ion exchange experiments were conducted using a series of 125 ml glass containers batch system includes 100 ml of cobalt solution under continuous shacking cobalt solution showed a graduated pink color according to the concentrations initially two ion exchange experiments were conducted to examine the uptake ability of the carbonized almond shells and carbonized walnut shells without zeolitization where 0 2 g of carbon support was added to 100 ml of 200 ppm cobalt solution under continuous shaking at 250 rpm and temperature 15 c for 24 h the ph of cobalt solution was measured and it was 6 the samples were taken after 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 24 h to be filtered diluted and measured by icp oes for the effect of initial ion concentration a fixed weight of ion exchange material 0 2 g was placed in several container filled with 100 ml of cobalt solution 50 200 400 and 500 ppm and shaken for 4 h at room temperature the equilibrium isotherms were studied by varying the amount of ion exchange material used as 2 4 8 10 g l at a fixed initial cobalt concentration of 200 ppm and room temperature the temperature effect on the ion exchange process was performed at 15 35 45 and 55 0 5 ⁰c for ion exchangers dose of 0 2 g and the initial ion concentration of 200 ppm during the above studies the ph of cobalt solutions was not modified but it was changed to study the effect of the solution ph on the performance of ion exchange media the ph of solutions was altered using 1 n naoh solution and 1 n hcl solution 1 ml of the solution was taken from each container to obtain the initial cobalt concentration before conducting the ion exchange step then samples were taken periodically to obtain the concentration of cobalt remaining in the solution by icp oes calibration was conducted for icp oes before being utilized and the samples were diluted before the analysis the wavelengths used to detect cobalt ions for all samples was 228 615 nm 2 5 immobilization of cobalt ion the immobilization of cobalt ion which has a boiling point of 2870⁰c carried by the spent materials was conducted by vitrification certain weights of the spent materials were heated in a muffle furnace at 1200⁰c for 2 h then the resulted solidified product was weighed and removed from the boats after that 0 04 g of the solidified materials were placed in tubes containing 20 ml of deionized water and 0 5 n nacl and left in contact for 9 months to examine leaching of cobalt ions from the solidified samples also 0 04 g of the non vitrified a aas and aws were placed in another group of tubes containing 20 ml of deionized water and 0 5 n nacl 0 5 ml of liquid was taken from the tubes at intervals of 1 day 1 week 1 month and 9 months to be analyzed 2 6 analytical techniques a miniflex rigaku x ray analytical instrument was used to obtain xrd patterns of the zeolite samples with cuk α radiation source λ 1 5418 å voltage 30 kv current 30 ma scan speed 3 min 1 step size 0 03 2θ 5 50 and total time 20 min the morphology and chemical composition of the synthesized zeolite were examined by conducting scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive analysis by x ray edax using a model fei quanta 200 a sputter coater was used to coat the samples with gold to conduct the sem imaging imagej software 44 was used for sem images to obtain the crystal size of 4a zeolite thermogravimetric analysis was conducted using tga model q5000 ir by ta instruments company to obtain the weight of zeolite present on the composite materials the temperature of composite samples was raised from room temperature to 400 c in the presence of nitrogen gas to discard the moisture volatile materials and other wastes then the temperature was raised from 400 c to 600 c in the presence of air to burn off carbon the surface area of zeolite and zeolite composites were measured using nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms performed using a micrometrics accelerated surface area and porosimetry asap 2010 the samples were degased using nitrogen gas at 200 c manganese concentration in the liquid samples was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes model vista mpx by varian 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the sem images of almond shells and walnut shells before carbonization are shown in fig 1 almond shells shows almost a uniform porous surface whereas walnut shells shows apparently different pore sizes the porous system of the two precursors reflected on the porosity of carbon produced as shown by the sem images presented in fig 2 approximately almond shells produced a favorable porous carbon with more uniform pores after removing moisture and high volatiles materials during the carbonization process but walnut shells produced carbon with less apparent voids the weight of carbon resulted from these two precursors was 26 3 and 27 6 of the initial precursors weight almond shells and walnut shells respectively the results of edax analysis of almond and walnut shells before and after carbonization are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively these results indicate that carbon is the major element in the support chemical composition also al and si consist very small percentage within the composition of the carbon support the small surface area of the carbon supports are 13 287 and 10 636 m2 g indicating the macro mesoporosity of the carbon supports the xrd pattern of the synthesized 4a zeolite was identical to the pattern of its counterpart commercial 4a zeolite as shown in fig 3 also the produced zeolite formed as high crystalline cubic shaped crystals with well defined edges and has si al ratio of 1 the xrd patterns of 4a zeolite almond shells carbon composite aas and 4a zeolite walnut shells carbon composite aws are shown in fig 3 the composites showed similar xrd patterns to this of the synthesized 4a and the peaks kept the same intensity as this of pure 4a zeolite since presence of carbon support did not affect crystallization of the required phase and no other phases or impurities generated during the synthesis fig 4 shows sem images of the 4a zeolite based carbon composites the images show a homogeneous distribution and coverage of 4a zeolite crystals over the supports surface since modification of the support surface via ultrasonication in the presence of nanoparticles facilitated the growth of zeolite crystals on the nucleation centres created on the support structure 39 thus a homogeneous growth and coverage and favourable attachment of crystals were obtained over the carbon surface table 3 present the elemental analysis and structural properties of a aas and aws the average crystal size of a was 1916 and it was 1050 and 1452 nm for aas and aws respectively the composites grew with relatively smaller crystal size due to the effect of nucleation sites created on the support surface by the impact of ultrasonication in the presence of nanoparticles 39 the si al ratio of aas and aws was 1 as obtained by edax results the percentage of zeolite in aas and aws was obtained using tga results and it was 40 81 and 44 69 respectively the bet surface area of a aas and aws was 246 47 183 36 and 157 65 m2 g respectively the small zeolite content in the composites gave rise to the reduction in the microporous surface area of the composites 3 2 ion exchange the results of ion exchange experiments are presented in the form of ion exchange capacity q mg ions g ion exchange material calculated using eq 1 against parameters 1 q t c o c t w v where qt is the amount of cobalt ions removed per the amount of ion exchanger mg g at time is t co is the initial cobalt concentration mg l ct is the remaining cobalt ion concentration mg l w is the weight of ion exchanger g and v is the volume of cobalt ion solution l moreover some results are presented in the form of qtga mg ions g zeolite plotted against t where qtga represents the amount of metal ions removed by the actual weight of zeolite present in a composite based on tga results using eq 2 therefore qtga was calculated for both aas and aws only 2 q t g a q t a f r a c t i o n o f z e o l i t e i n w fig 5 shows the results of a comparative study which was conducted using carbonized almond shells and walnut shells without an activation since there is no detectable change in the cobalt concentration along 24 h of contact with cobalt solution fig 6 shows that a distinguished cobalt ion removal from an aqueous solution was obtained using the synthesized 4a zeolite this is because 4a zeolite possesses low si al ratio which provides a high concentration of easily exchangeable cations the ion exchange occurring between cobalt cations and na cations present in the structure of zeolite 4a can be represented by the following equation 2na z co2 s 2na s co2 z where s refers for solution and z refers to zeolite when a comparison based on the total weight of ion exchange material used in the experiment the ion exchange capacity which was calculated using eq 1 of pure 4a zeolite is higher than this of both aas and aws this is because the percentage of zeolite present in aas and aws is 40 81 and 44 69 as given by tga results presented in table 3 and this small percent decreases the number of ion exchange sites provided per weight of media however both aas and aws showed higher ion exchange capacity 235 175 and 202 887 mg ion g zeolite than pure 4a zeolite 99 525 mg ion g zeolite when the capacity was calculated with respect to the actual weight of zeolite using eq 2 spreading the zeolite crystals over a macro mesoporous carbon support reduces the film resistance and improves the cations diffusivity into the zeolite micropores and hence increases ion exchange efficacy providing a hierarchical porosity within the composite prevents the accumulation of zeolites crystals and restrict creation of died zones which are difficult to be accessed by ions fig 7 shows sem image and edax result of a after ion exchange with cobalt where the zeolite crystals kept there morphology and the si al reminded 1after being utilized for cobalt removal also a peak belongs to cobalt appeared in the edax plot figs 8 and 9 show sem images and edax results of aas and aws after ion exchange with cobalt 4a zeolite crystals remained to attach on the supports surface even after 24 h of shaking edax results for these materials shows additional peak relevant to cobalt ion and the si al ratio remained 1 also the peak of cobalt appeared in the edax plot of both aas and aws 3 2 1 equilibrium isotherms study the linear regression of freundlich isotherm model and dubinin radushkevitch isotherm model d r were chosen to fit the experimental data numerous papers have been published on applying those models to the equilibrium data of metals removal the linearized form of freunlich isotherm model represented by eq 3 includes the heterogeneity of a surface and the exponential distribution and the energies of active sites 45 3 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where qe is the amount of cobalt ions removed per the amount of ion exchanger at equilibrium mg g ce is an equilibrium cobalt ions concentration mg l kf mg g and 1 n are freundlich constants indicating the ion exchanger relative capacity and the intensity of the process respectively freundlich constants listed in table 4 can be easily obtained from plotting lnqe against lnce 46 the linearized form of d r isotherm model represented by eq 4 predicts the process mechanism and assumes occurring of adsorption process on a homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces 4 l n q e l n q m k ε 2 5 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where qm is the maximum capacity of ion exchange mg g k is a constant related to the energy of ion

cobalt concentration mg l 47 48 estimating the mechanism nature of the process can be conducted by calculating the energy of transferring mole of ion from solution to the adsorbent surface eq 6 can be used to obtain the uptake energy e kj mol 6 e 2 k 1 2 when e is in the range of 20 40 kj mol indicates chemisorption while e is in the range of 8 16 kj mol indicates adsorption is governed by ion exchange however adsorption is affected by physical forces when e 8 kj mol 49 d r model constants listed in table 4 can be obtained by plotting lnqe versus ɛ2 the correlation factor r2 is a statistical amount shows how the experimental data fit the regression line was depended to compare between freundlich and d r models the results presented in table 4 shows that the uptake of cobalt ions occurred at the external heterogeneous surface of the media because 1 n 1 and controlled by physical forces because e is in the range of 8 16 kj mol 50 3 2 2 effect of initial ion concentration the amount of co2 ions removed increased with increasing the initial cobalt concentration for a specified weight of ion exchange material as shown in fig 10 this trend can be because of increasing the number of ions vying for the same number of sites existing in a fixed amount of ion exchanger the ion exchange process is motivated by increasing the concentration gradient mass transfer driving force resulting from increasing the initial cobalt concentration 3 2 3 effect of cobalt solution temperature temperature is significantly studied because it associates with some thermodynamic parameters the results describing the effect of solution temperature on the removal of cobalt ion from aqueous solution are presented in fig 11 a solution with higher temperature 50⁰c showed significant removal of cobalt ion from the solution this is because the ion exchange process of cobalt ion is an endothermic process as proved in 37 similarly literature work showed that removal of pb ii ions by mwcnts tho2 nano composite 51 and removal of th iv and u vi ions by a novel magnetic metal organic framework composite consisting iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles and amca mil 53 al 52 are endothermic process understanding the ion exchange mechanism and the rate determining step in the cobalt removal process was achieved using the weber and morris intra particle diffusion kinetics equations shown in eq 7 49 and the linearized form of boyd model shown in eq 8 7 7 q t k i t 0 5 c 8 β t 0 4977 l n 1 q t q e where ki is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min0 5 and c is a constant related to the liquid film thickness mg g if c which is the intercept has a smaller value it indicates that the liquid boundary layer has less contribution in the rate controlling step β is a boyed equation constant which can be used to calculate the effective diffusivity di m2 s according to eq 9 9 β π 2 d i r 2 where r is the media particles radius m the linear plots of the intra particle diffusion model presented in fig 12 shows that the intercept c values which refers to the effect of boundary layer for the composites and enhancing the ion diffusivity however the boundary layer still contributes to the rate limiting step in the process as confirmed by the results of boyd model presented in fig 13 the linear plots of boyed models did not pass through origin revealing that the film diffusion controls the ion exchange process also the intra particle diffusion which is represented by the slope in fig 12 enhanced for composites since the slope seems higher for them this outcome can be attributed to the outstanding distribution of zeolite crystals covering the carbon support surface and this leads to enhance the diffusion of ions and reduce the resistance arisen from the boundary film approximately comparable findings obtained by al othman and naushad 53 when used activated carbon prepared from peanut shell to remove for the removal of cr vi from aqueous solutions 3 2 4 effect of ph of cobalt solution the results representing the effect of solution ph on the removal of cobalt ions are shown in fig 14 it was difficult to increase the ph of cobalt solution beyond 6 8 due to precipitation of cobalt hydroxide in the solution increasing the ph of solution enhanced the removal of cobalt ions the ion exchange process using zeolitic materials is strongly influenced by the ph of solutions because it highly affects zeolite structure and the concentration of active sites moreover the ph of solutions affects the concentration of hydrogen ions competing with metal ions for actives sites during the exchange process in the same context naushada and alothmana 54 found that the removal of pb2 ions using the amberlite ir 120 resin increased with increasing the ph however awual et al 55 found that acidic and alkaline media inhibit removal of hg2 ions by conjugate nano materials 3 3 solidification the samples of the used zeolitic materials bearing cobalt ions before and after vitrification are shown in fig 15 and the concentration of co2 ions leached to solutions are shown in table 5 the samples encapsulating cobalt ions showed blue glassy solid due to formation a melt of al and co at elevated temperature the weight of 4a zeolite sample reduced to 44 of the sample weight before vitrification however in the case of composites the sample weight reduced to 25 during the vitrification carbon supports burned to co2 leaving a melt of silica alumina metal because 4a zeolite composes about 45 of the weight of composites after nine months the concentration of cobalt ions leached to h2o was of 0 01 ppm and to 0 5 n nacl solution ranged of 0 05 0 25 ppm therefore leaching of cobalt ions from the spent materials to the solutions was nearly eliminated when samples vitrified even after nine months in contact with 0 5 n nacl solution 3 4 comparison based on cost and performance this section presents a general comparison made among hierarchical composites prepared from 4a zeolite in this study and composites made using x zeolite and clinoptilolite presented in the previously published works 37 38 based on cost and performance in term of cost the hierarchical composites prepared from 4a zeolite in the presented work is better than the composites made using x zeolite and clinoptilolite this is because the cost required to prepare 4a zeolite composites is lower than the cost required to prepare x zeolite and clinoptilolite composites this low cost is due to that preparation of 4a zeolite composites does not require overnight aging step under continuous aging like x zeolite also crystallization of 4a zeolite composites does not require long crystallization time like x zeolite composites 8 h and more and clinoptilolite composites 4 days and more and in term of performance 4a zeolite and its composites show higher performance of ion exchange than both x zeolite and clinoptilolite and their composites because 4a zeolite owns lower si al ratio providing higher concentration of easy exchangeable cations 4 conclusions this study presents implementation of hierarchically porous 4azeolite carbon composites for removal of cobalt ions from aqueous solution inclusion of carbon supports prepared from almond shells and walnut shells within the composites structure did not alter the required crystallization time to obtain fully crystallized zeolite crystals modifying of the carbon surface by nanoparticles achieved a permanent attachment of crystals on the carbon surface even though after using the composites for the ion exchange process to remove cobalt ions according to a comparison made based on the actual weight of zeolite used for ion exchange with cobalt ions it was found that the ion exchange capacity of zeolite significantly increased when zeolite based carbon composites was used ion exchange controls the removal process and it was found to be dependent on initial ion concentration temperature and ph also cobalt ion exchange by 4a zeolite composites was found to be an endothermic process as ion exchange capacity increased with increasing temperatures the experimental data of the ion exchange were successfully fitted by the linear regression of freundlich isotherm model and dubinin radushkevitch isotherm model the ion exchange process was found to be controlled by intra particle diffusion and less by liquid boundary film as confirmed by weber morris intra particle diffusion and boyd models for successful immobilizing of cobalt ions vitrification was applied to the composites bearing cobalt ions declaration of competing interest this paper presents a reproducible work dealing with preparation of hierarchically porous 4a zeolite based carbon composites using agricultural waste and implementing them for best removal of harmful ions from wastewater also it presents a detailed study about the encapsulation of cobalt ions via vitrification process in conclusion the effect of boundary film reduced and the intra particle diffusion of cobalt ion enhanced due to creating hierarchically porosity hereby this statement we are the work team declare there is no conflict of interest to this work acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the higher committee for education development in iraq for financially supporting sama m al jubouri to conduct this work on the university of manchester labs also the authors would like to specifically thank dr patrick hill for help with samples measurement 
14172,the efficacy of the synthesized 4a zeolite and the 4a zeolite based carbon composites were examined for the removal of cobalt ions from an aqueous solution by ion exchange two types of agricultural waste were chosen as precursors to prepare the porous supports for composites synthesized at hydrothermal conditions the maximum exchange capacity of zeolite portions present in 4a zeolite almond shells carbon aas and 4a zeolite walnut shells carbon aws reached to 235 175 and 202 887 mg ion g zeolite but it reached to 99 525 mg ion g zeolite for 4a zeolite a at same conditions removal of cobalt ions by ion exchange process enhanced when the temperature and ph of the cobalt solution increased the equilibrium data are precisely fitted by the freundlich model with a correlation factor r2 of 0 9807 0 9859 and 0 9857 for a aas and aws the cobalt uptake by zeolite based carbon composites process is controlled by ion exchange the weber and morris intra particle diffusion kinetics and boyd model equations confirmed enhancement of cobalt removal using the composites the seepage of cobalt ions from the solidified ion exchangers encapsulating ions reduced to 0 01 ppm in h2o and to 0 05 0 25 ppm in 0 5 n nacl solution keywords hierarchical porosity zeolite carbon composites ion exchange vitrification 1 introduction human and industrial activities produce streams of wastewater associating with manufacturing and processing different materials these effluents are considered as polluted waters when containing an unallowable concentration lethal dose of potential pollutants causing harmful changes to the receiving water bodies 1 2 engineers and scientists consider treating industrial wastewaters as a big issue due to increasing the industrial activities especially wastewater containing heavy metals and radionuclides because they hazardously influence human health and other organisms in the environment 3 4 about 20 metals are released into the environment are classified as toxic and 50 of those are discharged with quantities harmful to human health 5 numerous industries release effluents containing surplus heavy metals into the aqueous environment such as paper pulp cloth and leather plastics industries microelectronics and electroplating industries fertilizers and pesticides productions mining operations metal smelters and cleaning paint dyes and pigments tannery galvanizing and refining industries 6 8 untreated or poorly treated industrial effluents contain heavy metals such as ni cr pb cd hg co as cu and zn which are highly toxic highly soluble and extremely tend to bioaccumulate in the tissues of living organisms and causes major problems to the environment 2 9 cobalt is one of the harmful radioactive elements discharged into the effluents of many industries such as electronic and semiconductors industries nuclear medicine catalysts for petrochemical industry mining grinding wheels manufacturing vitamin b12 pigments electroplating paints and varnishes and metallurgy 10 12 the physical property of the pure cobalt is shiny hard metal odorless steely grey cobalt is naturally present in the earth s shell in form of metals or salts and it is present in the sea water soil and dust it is also present in the human body according to the epa the acceptable level of cobalt in drinking water is 0 002 0 107 ppm 13 while it is 0 05 1 ppm for the irrigation water according to environmental bureau of investigation and canadian water quality guidelines which means that everybody is subjected to cobalt through water food and air 10 the presence of cobalt in the contaminated water causes serious problems due to its toxic nature and harmful effects to the humans health such as allergy nausea asthma vomiting loss of smell either completely or partially genetic changes in living cells damage to the thyroid heart failure damage to the heart damage to the liver in addition it causes neuro toxicological symptoms like headaches and changes in reflexes cancer risks resulting of exposure to cobalt radiation also cobalt isotopes send ionizing radiation 10 12 14 that all elucidate the significant increase in the studies related to eliminate pollution with cobalt several methods have been improved over the years to achieve best and cheapest removal of cobalt the most commonly used techniques to remove heavy metals and radioactive elements from wastewater are chemical precipitation electroflotation evaporation adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration reverse osmosis electrodialysis coagulation flocculation and solvent extraction 15 16 however most of these methods are there are generally expensive generating toxic sludge or secondary wastes and not appropriate for low metal concentrations and small scale industries 14 17 18 adsorption and ion exchange methods have been diagnosed as effective cheap and easy adaption methods for cobalt removal especially when inexpensive and chemico physically feasible adsorbents are used to minimize the hazards of harmful contaminates 15 many different media have been used for adsorption and ion exchange purposes to remove co ions and other heavy metals such as coir pith 14 wood ash 19 black carrot residue 20 lemon peel 11 trichoderma reesei 21 spirulina platensis 22 coal dust 23 cashew nut shells 24 sunflower shell 25 al khriet 16 iron based water treatment residuals 26 chitosan egg shells humate potassium and sugar beet factory lime 27 also rice shells lentil shells wheat shells sawdust peanut hulls wheat straw rubber tree leaf oil palm leaf powders polyethylenimine modified aerobic granules and modified meranti sawdust were used as low cost adsorbents 28 however works of literature have mentioned several works based on developing synthetic materials as effective adsorbents for heavy metals removal such as acetonitrile stannic iv selenite composite cation exchanger 29 nano sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide zr iv selenite composite cation exchanger 30 alizarin red s modified amberlite ira 400 resin 31 moreover other work used some materials to provide required surface area for adsorption and rapid degradation of hazardous metals such as zro2 fe3o4 chitosan nanocomposite 32 zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicates of alkali and alkaline earth metals with a crystalline microporous structure consisting of tetrahedral units linked with each other through a shared oxygen 33 utilizing of zeolites to treat wastewater is very effective especially when they are natural zeolite this is because they are inexpensive abundant easily regenerated and have a good cation exchange capacity good selectivity for cations high surface area a rigid porous structure and good stability in acidic conditions 34 synthetic zeolites have been utilized to eliminate cobalt such as pure zeolite x 35 pure zeolite y 36 and cancrinite 13 the ion exchange performance of zeolite can be enhanced when it is synthesized in form of composites incorporating inexpensive porous supports such as carbon made from natural agricultural waste materials 37 40 presence of macro mesoporous supports adds advantages of reducing the resistance to mass transfer and enhancing the rate of diffusion of ions and molecules to and from active sites also composites contain only a small portion of zeolites which adds the advantages of the small volume of vitrified capsules in comparison with pure zeolite used for the same purpose 37 38 for example composite zeolite y carbon was used to remove cobalt ion from an aqueous solution 41 the current work present a detailed study about removal of cobalt ion using 4a zeolite based carbon composites at different conditions also the experimental data would be fitted using isotherm models available in the literature to elucidate the trend of the cobalt in the removal process 2 experimental work 2 1 chemicals and materials hydrous sodium metasilicate na2sio3 5h2o from bdh technical was used as a silica and sodium oxide source anhydrous sodium aluminate 55 56 wt al2o3 from riedel dehaën was used as alumina and sodium oxide source naoh pellets 99 9 wt from fisher scientific was used as sodium oxide source deionised water was implemented for different uses in this study cobalt nitrate hexahydrate 99 wt from lancaster synthesis to prepare cobalt solution a commercial zeolite a supplied by bdh chemicals ltd was used to prepare nanoparticles suspension solution agricultural waste namely almond and walnut shells were collected from yards located in the north of iraq 2 2 preparation of 4a zeolite 4a zeolite with a gel composition of 4 na2o al2o3 2 sio2 180 h2o was prepared according to the procedures mentioned in the previous work 42 43 preparation of the gel started with dissolving 0 377 g of sodium hydroxide pellets in 20 g of deionized water then 2 785 g of hydrous sodium metasilicate was mixed with only half of the naoh solution for 15 30 min 1 19 g of anhydrous sodium aluminate was mixed with the other half of the hydroxide solution for 15 30 min until the solution became clear silica solution was then added to the alumina solution and mixed for 20 30 min until the formation of a thick creamy gel crystallization of the gel produced was conducted using a teflon lined autoclave at 100 c for 4 h after that the autoclave was quenched and the product was taken out washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 50 80 c then characterization by xrd sem edax and n2 adsorption desorption was conducted for the samples 2 3 preparation of 4a zeolite based carbon composites a nanoparticles suspension solution was prepared from commercial 4a zeolite using a ball mill according to procedures mentioned in 39 to create nucleation sites on the support surface via ultrasonication almond shells and walnut shells were used as precursors for a porous support both almond and walnut are abundant crops in the north of iraq and their extensive consumption generates a huge amount of shells which is considered as municipal solid waste the procedures and conditions followed in this study were chosen in accordance with the literature 37 38 the precursors were properly cleaned washed with deionized water dried and imaged by sem then the shells were weighed and heated at 800 c for 3 h using a tubular furnace in an atmosphere of nitrogen gas the product was weighed manually ground and sieved to obtain the support characterizing of samples before and after being used as supports was conducted by both sem edax and n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the surface of the carbonous support was modified using the nanoparticle suspension prior to be used in the hydrothermal treatment according to the producers used in a previously published work 39 the procedures used for the preparation of composites were the same as those used to prepare pure 4 a zeolite just one step was introduced to the process this step is adding carbon support to the aluminosilicates gel before crystallization the weight of support added to a batch of the prepared gel was according to the weight ratio of 2 5 carbon 1 silica in the silica source the mixture of carbon and gel was continuously stirred for 15 min and then crystallized inside teflon lined autoclaves at 100 c for 4 h the resulting composites were recovered filtered washed with deionised water and dried at 50 80 c samples of the composites were taken to be characterized by xrd sem edax tga and n2 adsorption desorption isotherms 2 4 ion exchange experiments ion exchange experiments were conducted using a series of 125 ml glass containers batch system includes 100 ml of cobalt solution under continuous shacking cobalt solution showed a graduated pink color according to the concentrations initially two ion exchange experiments were conducted to examine the uptake ability of the carbonized almond shells and carbonized walnut shells without zeolitization where 0 2 g of carbon support was added to 100 ml of 200 ppm cobalt solution under continuous shaking at 250 rpm and temperature 15 c for 24 h the ph of cobalt solution was measured and it was 6 the samples were taken after 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 24 h to be filtered diluted and measured by icp oes for the effect of initial ion concentration a fixed weight of ion exchange material 0 2 g was placed in several container filled with 100 ml of cobalt solution 50 200 400 and 500 ppm and shaken for 4 h at room temperature the equilibrium isotherms were studied by varying the amount of ion exchange material used as 2 4 8 10 g l at a fixed initial cobalt concentration of 200 ppm and room temperature the temperature effect on the ion exchange process was performed at 15 35 45 and 55 0 5 ⁰c for ion exchangers dose of 0 2 g and the initial ion concentration of 200 ppm during the above studies the ph of cobalt solutions was not modified but it was changed to study the effect of the solution ph on the performance of ion exchange media the ph of solutions was altered using 1 n naoh solution and 1 n hcl solution 1 ml of the solution was taken from each container to obtain the initial cobalt concentration before conducting the ion exchange step then samples were taken periodically to obtain the concentration of cobalt remaining in the solution by icp oes calibration was conducted for icp oes before being utilized and the samples were diluted before the analysis the wavelengths used to detect cobalt ions for all samples was 228 615 nm 2 5 immobilization of cobalt ion the immobilization of cobalt ion which has a boiling point of 2870⁰c carried by the spent materials was conducted by vitrification certain weights of the spent materials were heated in a muffle furnace at 1200⁰c for 2 h then the resulted solidified product was weighed and removed from the boats after that 0 04 g of the solidified materials were placed in tubes containing 20 ml of deionized water and 0 5 n nacl and left in contact for 9 months to examine leaching of cobalt ions from the solidified samples also 0 04 g of the non vitrified a aas and aws were placed in another group of tubes containing 20 ml of deionized water and 0 5 n nacl 0 5 ml of liquid was taken from the tubes at intervals of 1 day 1 week 1 month and 9 months to be analyzed 2 6 analytical techniques a miniflex rigaku x ray analytical instrument was used to obtain xrd patterns of the zeolite samples with cuk α radiation source λ 1 5418 å voltage 30 kv current 30 ma scan speed 3 min 1 step size 0 03 2θ 5 50 and total time 20 min the morphology and chemical composition of the synthesized zeolite were examined by conducting scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive analysis by x ray edax using a model fei quanta 200 a sputter coater was used to coat the samples with gold to conduct the sem imaging imagej software 44 was used for sem images to obtain the crystal size of 4a zeolite thermogravimetric analysis was conducted using tga model q5000 ir by ta instruments company to obtain the weight of zeolite present on the composite materials the temperature of composite samples was raised from room temperature to 400 c in the presence of nitrogen gas to discard the moisture volatile materials and other wastes then the temperature was raised from 400 c to 600 c in the presence of air to burn off carbon the surface area of zeolite and zeolite composites were measured using nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms performed using a micrometrics accelerated surface area and porosimetry asap 2010 the samples were degased using nitrogen gas at 200 c manganese concentration in the liquid samples was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes model vista mpx by varian 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the sem images of almond shells and walnut shells before carbonization are shown in fig 1 almond shells shows almost a uniform porous surface whereas walnut shells shows apparently different pore sizes the porous system of the two precursors reflected on the porosity of carbon produced as shown by the sem images presented in fig 2 approximately almond shells produced a favorable porous carbon with more uniform pores after removing moisture and high volatiles materials during the carbonization process but walnut shells produced carbon with less apparent voids the weight of carbon resulted from these two precursors was 26 3 and 27 6 of the initial precursors weight almond shells and walnut shells respectively the results of edax analysis of almond and walnut shells before and after carbonization are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively these results indicate that carbon is the major element in the support chemical composition also al and si consist very small percentage within the composition of the carbon support the small surface area of the carbon supports are 13 287 and 10 636 m2 g indicating the macro mesoporosity of the carbon supports the xrd pattern of the synthesized 4a zeolite was identical to the pattern of its counterpart commercial 4a zeolite as shown in fig 3 also the produced zeolite formed as high crystalline cubic shaped crystals with well defined edges and has si al ratio of 1 the xrd patterns of 4a zeolite almond shells carbon composite aas and 4a zeolite walnut shells carbon composite aws are shown in fig 3 the composites showed similar xrd patterns to this of the synthesized 4a and the peaks kept the same intensity as this of pure 4a zeolite since presence of carbon support did not affect crystallization of the required phase and no other phases or impurities generated during the synthesis fig 4 shows sem images of the 4a zeolite based carbon composites the images show a homogeneous distribution and coverage of 4a zeolite crystals over the supports surface since modification of the support surface via ultrasonication in the presence of nanoparticles facilitated the growth of zeolite crystals on the nucleation centres created on the support structure 39 thus a homogeneous growth and coverage and favourable attachment of crystals were obtained over the carbon surface table 3 present the elemental analysis and structural properties of a aas and aws the average crystal size of a was 1916 and it was 1050 and 1452 nm for aas and aws respectively the composites grew with relatively smaller crystal size due to the effect of nucleation sites created on the support surface by the impact of ultrasonication in the presence of nanoparticles 39 the si al ratio of aas and aws was 1 as obtained by edax results the percentage of zeolite in aas and aws was obtained using tga results and it was 40 81 and 44 69 respectively the bet surface area of a aas and aws was 246 47 183 36 and 157 65 m2 g respectively the small zeolite content in the composites gave rise to the reduction in the microporous surface area of the composites 3 2 ion exchange the results of ion exchange experiments are presented in the form of ion exchange capacity q mg ions g ion exchange material calculated using eq 1 against parameters 1 q t c o c t w v where qt is the amount of cobalt ions removed per the amount of ion exchanger mg g at time is t co is the initial cobalt concentration mg l ct is the remaining cobalt ion concentration mg l w is the weight of ion exchanger g and v is the volume of cobalt ion solution l moreover some results are presented in the form of qtga mg ions g zeolite plotted against t where qtga represents the amount of metal ions removed by the actual weight of zeolite present in a composite based on tga results using eq 2 therefore qtga was calculated for both aas and aws only 2 q t g a q t a f r a c t i o n o f z e o l i t e i n w fig 5 shows the results of a comparative study which was conducted using carbonized almond shells and walnut shells without an activation since there is no detectable change in the cobalt concentration along 24 h of contact with cobalt solution fig 6 shows that a distinguished cobalt ion removal from an aqueous solution was obtained using the synthesized 4a zeolite this is because 4a zeolite possesses low si al ratio which provides a high concentration of easily exchangeable cations the ion exchange occurring between cobalt cations and na cations present in the structure of zeolite 4a can be represented by the following equation 2na z co2 s 2na s co2 z where s refers for solution and z refers to zeolite when a comparison based on the total weight of ion exchange material used in the experiment the ion exchange capacity which was calculated using eq 1 of pure 4a zeolite is higher than this of both aas and aws this is because the percentage of zeolite present in aas and aws is 40 81 and 44 69 as given by tga results presented in table 3 and this small percent decreases the number of ion exchange sites provided per weight of media however both aas and aws showed higher ion exchange capacity 235 175 and 202 887 mg ion g zeolite than pure 4a zeolite 99 525 mg ion g zeolite when the capacity was calculated with respect to the actual weight of zeolite using eq 2 spreading the zeolite crystals over a macro mesoporous carbon support reduces the film resistance and improves the cations diffusivity into the zeolite micropores and hence increases ion exchange efficacy providing a hierarchical porosity within the composite prevents the accumulation of zeolites crystals and restrict creation of died zones which are difficult to be accessed by ions fig 7 shows sem image and edax result of a after ion exchange with cobalt where the zeolite crystals kept there morphology and the si al reminded 1after being utilized for cobalt removal also a peak belongs to cobalt appeared in the edax plot figs 8 and 9 show sem images and edax results of aas and aws after ion exchange with cobalt 4a zeolite crystals remained to attach on the supports surface even after 24 h of shaking edax results for these materials shows additional peak relevant to cobalt ion and the si al ratio remained 1 also the peak of cobalt appeared in the edax plot of both aas and aws 3 2 1 equilibrium isotherms study the linear regression of freundlich isotherm model and dubinin radushkevitch isotherm model d r were chosen to fit the experimental data numerous papers have been published on applying those models to the equilibrium data of metals removal the linearized form of freunlich isotherm model represented by eq 3 includes the heterogeneity of a surface and the exponential distribution and the energies of active sites 45 3 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where qe is the amount of cobalt ions removed per the amount of ion exchanger at equilibrium mg g ce is an equilibrium cobalt ions concentration mg l kf mg g and 1 n are freundlich constants indicating the ion exchanger relative capacity and the intensity of the process respectively freundlich constants listed in table 4 can be easily obtained from plotting lnqe against lnce 46 the linearized form of d r isotherm model represented by eq 4 predicts the process mechanism and assumes occurring of adsorption process on a homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces 4 l n q e l n q m k ε 2 5 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where qm is the maximum capacity of ion exchange mg g k is a constant related to the energy of ion exchange mol2 kj2 ɛ is the polanyi potential kj mol r is the gas law constant kj kmol k t is the absolute temperature k qe is the equilibrium capacity of ion exchange mg g and ce is the equilibrium cobalt concentration mg l 47 48 estimating the mechanism nature of the process can be conducted by calculating the energy of transferring mole of ion from solution to the adsorbent surface eq 6 can be used to obtain the uptake energy e kj mol 6 e 2 k 1 2 when e is in the range of 20 40 kj mol indicates chemisorption while e is in the range of 8 16 kj mol indicates adsorption is governed by ion exchange however adsorption is affected by physical forces when e 8 kj mol 49 d r model constants listed in table 4 can be obtained by plotting lnqe versus ɛ2 the correlation factor r2 is a statistical amount shows how the experimental data fit the regression line was depended to compare between freundlich and d r models the results presented in table 4 shows that the uptake of cobalt ions occurred at the external heterogeneous surface of the media because 1 n 1 and controlled by physical forces because e is in the range of 8 16 kj mol 50 3 2 2 effect of initial ion concentration the amount of co2 ions removed increased with increasing the initial cobalt concentration for a specified weight of ion exchange material as shown in fig 10 this trend can be because of increasing the number of ions vying for the same number of sites existing in a fixed amount of ion exchanger the ion exchange process is motivated by increasing the concentration gradient mass transfer driving force resulting from increasing the initial cobalt concentration 3 2 3 effect of cobalt solution temperature temperature is significantly studied because it associates with some thermodynamic parameters the results describing the effect of solution temperature on the removal of cobalt ion from aqueous solution are presented in fig 11 a solution with higher temperature 50⁰c showed significant removal of cobalt ion from the solution this is because the ion exchange process of cobalt ion is an endothermic process as proved in 37 similarly literature work showed that removal of pb ii ions by mwcnts tho2 nano composite 51 and removal of th iv and u vi ions by a novel magnetic metal organic framework composite consisting iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles and amca mil 53 al 52 are endothermic process understanding the ion exchange mechanism and the rate determining step in the cobalt removal process was achieved using the weber and morris intra particle diffusion kinetics equations shown in eq 7 49 and the linearized form of boyd model shown in eq 8 7 7 q t k i t 0 5 c 8 β t 0 4977 l n 1 q t q e where ki is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min0 5 and c is a constant related to the liquid film thickness mg g if c which is the intercept has a smaller value it indicates that the liquid boundary layer has less contribution in the rate controlling step β is a boyed equation constant which can be used to calculate the effective diffusivity di m2 s according to eq 9 9 β π 2 d i r 2 where r is the media particles radius m the linear plots of the intra particle diffusion model presented in fig 12 shows that the intercept c values which refers to the effect of boundary layer for the composites and enhancing the ion diffusivity however the boundary layer still contributes to the rate limiting step in the process as confirmed by the results of boyd model presented in fig 13 the linear plots of boyed models did not pass through origin revealing that the film diffusion controls the ion exchange process also the intra particle diffusion which is represented by the slope in fig 12 enhanced for composites since the slope seems higher for them this outcome can be attributed to the outstanding distribution of zeolite crystals covering the carbon support surface and this leads to enhance the diffusion of ions and reduce the resistance arisen from the boundary film approximately comparable findings obtained by al othman and naushad 53 when used activated carbon prepared from peanut shell to remove for the removal of cr vi from aqueous solutions 3 2 4 effect of ph of cobalt solution the results representing the effect of solution ph on the removal of cobalt ions are shown in fig 14 it was difficult to increase the ph of cobalt solution beyond 6 8 due to precipitation of cobalt hydroxide in the solution increasing the ph of solution enhanced the removal of cobalt ions the ion exchange process using zeolitic materials is strongly influenced by the ph of solutions because it highly affects zeolite structure and the concentration of active sites moreover the ph of solutions affects the concentration of hydrogen ions competing with metal ions for actives sites during the exchange process in the same context naushada and alothmana 54 found that the removal of pb2 ions using the amberlite ir 120 resin increased with increasing the ph however awual et al 55 found that acidic and alkaline media inhibit removal of hg2 ions by conjugate nano materials 3 3 solidification the samples of the used zeolitic materials bearing cobalt ions before and after vitrification are shown in fig 15 and the concentration of co2 ions leached to solutions are shown in table 5 the samples encapsulating cobalt ions showed blue glassy solid due to formation a melt of al and co at elevated temperature the weight of 4a zeolite sample reduced to 44 of the sample weight before vitrification however in the case of composites the sample weight reduced to 25 during the vitrification carbon supports burned to co2 leaving a melt of silica alumina metal because 4a zeolite composes about 45 of the weight of composites after nine months the concentration of cobalt ions leached to h2o was of 0 01 ppm and to 0 5 n nacl solution ranged of 0 05 0 25 ppm therefore leaching of cobalt ions from the spent materials to the solutions was nearly eliminated when samples vitrified even after nine months in contact with 0 5 n nacl solution 3 4 comparison based on cost and performance this section presents a general comparison made among hierarchical composites prepared from 4a zeolite in this study and composites made using x zeolite and clinoptilolite presented in the previously published works 37 38 based on cost and performance in term of cost the hierarchical composites prepared from 4a zeolite in the presented work is better than the composites made using x zeolite and clinoptilolite this is because the cost required to prepare 4a zeolite composites is lower than the cost required to prepare x zeolite and clinoptilolite composites this low cost is due to that preparation of 4a zeolite composites does not require overnight aging step under continuous aging like x zeolite also crystallization of 4a zeolite composites does not require long crystallization time like x zeolite composites 8 h and more and clinoptilolite composites 4 days and more and in term of performance 4a zeolite and its composites show higher performance of ion exchange than both x zeolite and clinoptilolite and their composites because 4a zeolite owns lower si al ratio providing higher concentration of easy exchangeable cations 4 conclusions this study presents implementation of hierarchically porous 4azeolite carbon composites for removal of cobalt ions from aqueous solution inclusion of carbon supports prepared from almond shells and walnut shells within the composites structure did not alter the required crystallization time to obtain fully crystallized zeolite crystals modifying of the carbon surface by nanoparticles achieved a permanent attachment of crystals on the carbon surface even though after using the composites for the ion exchange process to remove cobalt ions according to a comparison made based on the actual weight of zeolite used for ion exchange with cobalt ions it was found that the ion exchange capacity of zeolite significantly increased when zeolite based carbon composites was used ion exchange controls the removal process and it was found to be dependent on initial ion concentration temperature and ph also cobalt ion exchange by 4a zeolite composites was found to be an endothermic process as ion exchange capacity increased with increasing temperatures the experimental data of the ion exchange were successfully fitted by the linear regression of freundlich isotherm model and dubinin radushkevitch isotherm model the ion exchange process was found to be controlled by intra particle diffusion and less by liquid boundary film as confirmed by weber morris intra particle diffusion and boyd models for successful immobilizing of cobalt ions vitrification was applied to the composites bearing cobalt ions declaration of competing interest this paper presents a reproducible work dealing with preparation of hierarchically porous 4a zeolite based carbon composites using agricultural waste and implementing them for best removal of harmful ions from wastewater also it presents a detailed study about the encapsulation of cobalt ions via vitrification process in conclusion the effect of boundary film reduced and the intra particle diffusion of cobalt ion enhanced due to creating hierarchically porosity hereby this statement we are the work team declare there is no conflict of

14173,volatile fatty acid vfa is the intermediate product of the anaerobic digestion generally the amount of acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms will affect the output vfa concentration in a wastewater treatment process in this study sequencing batch reactor sbr was used to enhance vfa production during the anaerobic treatment of palm oil mill effluent the system managed to suppress the growth of methanogens and increased vfa output by elevating the growth of acidogens the sbr managed to achieve stable accumulation of vfa throughout the operation it was found that the vfa produced increased from 7300 mg l to 10 500 mg l however the vfa composition remains unchanged the balanced composition of short chain vfa could be used as the feed for the production of biodegradable polymer

wastewater treatment has been focused on the removal of nutrients and organic content in wastewater in recent years however the focus has shifted toward the recovery of nutrients and valuable by products during wastewater treatment for example many studies managed to utilize the organic content of wastewater for the production of biogas and polyhydroxyalkanoate pha a biodegradable polymer through the wastewater treatment process 1 3 wastewater of high chemical oxygen demand cod especially agricultural wastewater has high potential for the mass production of pha and biogas due to the abundance of carbon content 4 5 the conventional biological treatment of high organic content wastewater includes anaerobic and aerobic processes in anaerobic treatment a sequence of processes occurs namely hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis wastewater will first undergo hydrolysis to breakdown the complex organic content e g carbohydrates proteins lipids to simpler organic compounds such as simple sugars amino acids and long chain fatty acids in the second phase acidification phase the simpler organic compounds undergo acidogenesis to produce organic vfas alcohol and carbon dioxide in the third phase methanogenic phase the products of acidogenesis are used by methanogenic microorganisms to produce methane carbon dioxide and hydrogen 6 in the subsequent aerobic treatment the aerobic microorganisms utilize oxygen to oxidize the organic content of the wastewater carried over from the anaerobic treatment to meet discharge requirements although the conventional treatment system successfully minimizes the organic content as well as nutrient content it misses the opportunity to harness useful nutrients and by products during the treatment therefore it is beneficial to revise the treatment system to maximize the potential recovery of resources one of such highly valuable intermediate products during the wastewater treatment is vfa during the acidogenesis process vfa will be produced however these vfa will be converted into methane gas in the following methanogenic phase methane gas is proven as an energy source which can be converted into electricity but not all treatment plants have the facility to convert the energy source into electricity alternatively vfa can be used as the substrate to produce pha pha is a biodegradable plastic monomer accumulated naturally inside certain microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment to utilize vfa as a substrate to accumulate pha inside microorganisms the production of vfa has to be optimized the operating conditions play an important role in optimizing the production of vfa among the parameters proven to have an effect on promoting vfa are hydraulic retention time hrt solid retention time srt temperature ph and the availability of micronutrient in the treatment system 7 9 in general methanogens have longer generation time than facultative anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms an anaerobic digestion unit that includes methane gas generation usually has srt more than 12 days to allow methanogen to grow 10 11 earlier studies suggested that an anaerobic reactor operated at shorter srt lower than 10 days could achieve an vfa increase of about 10 25 by eliminating the methanogen 12 however conventional anaerobic digester favours high srt value to achieve higher cod removal efficiency provides buffer capacity for resistance against shock loadings and maintain population of mixed culture however studies on enhanced vfa production and microorganisms responsible for the vfa enhancement are still limited it was previously found that bacteria of phylum firmicutes is dominant in anaerobic reactor 13 14 nevertheless information on the relationship between the microbial community and the output vfa composition is still scarce the complete reaction in anaerobic digestion will yield methane carbon dioxide and hydrogen to avoid the complete reaction the methanogenesis process need to be ceased the elimination of methanogenesis can be carried out by limiting the growth of methanogens through the reduction of retention time of biomass in the reactor as such the slower growing methanogen will be washed out from the system furthermore the characterization of the microorganisms in enhanced vfa production has not been fully investigated it is generally accepted that the abundance of both acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms are predominant factors in the output vfa concentration thus in this study the shift of the microbial community associated with the enhancement of vfa production will be investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 palm oil mill effluent pome and seed sludge the pome used in this study was collected from the effluent of hilltop

assignment of otus was performed by using the silva database 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of sbr 3 1 1 start up of sbr raw pome without dilution was used as feed for the sbr in general a wastewater treatment unit needs about 3 4 srt to achieve steady state condition 11 steady state condition implies that the generation of biomass represented by mlvss and the biomass wasted in the reactor are the same in this study it took about 12 days for the reactor to achieve steady state with an average mlvss value of 1220 mg l stable mlvss in the reactor once the reactor achieved steady state solid liquid and gas samples were taken from the reactor for analysis and the average values were presented in table 2 and table 3 in this study the sbr achieved a cod removal of 23 because the organic content in the feed did not undergo the complete anaerobic treatment process fig 1 shows the profile of mlvss and vfa in the sbr throughout the operation in this study the input concentration of the vfa in the sbr was 7300 mg l the total vfa concentration in the sbr increased to about 8530 mg l in the first 5 days meanwhile the total vfa concentration after 15 days 3 hrt of operation managed to reach a concentration of about 10 500 mg l beyond this point the total vfa concentration level in the sbr was stable around 10 500 500 mg l throughout the operation although the biomass concentration in the reactor experienced a reduction it did not reduce the performance to accumulate vfa instead the total vfa concentration remained at about 10 500 mg l on the other hand methane was not detected in the gas collected from the sbr table 3 the absence of methane in the output gas has proven that the sbr carried out a partial anaerobic wastewater treatment where it did not undergo the methanogenesis stage thus the low cod removal 23 cod removal in this reactor suggested that the cod organic component in the reactor was transformed from a complex organic substance into simpler molecules vfa but not removed from the system in terms of methane gas the lack of the methanogenesis stage in the sbr was closely related to the microbial population in the mixed culture various group of bacteria are needed to enhance the vfa concentration in the sbr for pha production there were two major groups of microorganisms present in the anaerobic digestion reactor namely acidogens and methanogens the acidogens utilized the organic content carbohydrates proteins and lipids and produced short chain fatty acids scfa hydrogen and carbon dioxide in contrast the methanogens utilized the scfa produced by the acidogens to produce methane and carbon dioxide a biological wastewater treatment unit needs both acidogens and methanogens to perform complete anaerobic treatment the growth of both acidogens and methanogens is affected by the operational parameters of the anaerobic reactor such as srt hrt ph and temperature in sbr the growth of acidogens was faster than the growth of methanogens this could be observed in fig 1 where the vfa concentration increased rapidly and reached the plateau stage the average vfa production was 43 8 of the original vfa content in raw pome wong et al 2014 16 used anaerobic reactor to produce methane gas their study showed that the pome of 12 170 mgcod l day 1 organic loading rate was able to accumulate about 2584 mg l as acetic acid vfa which was lower than the findings of this study in terms of percentage vfa produced per influent cod increasing the hrt of reactor might be good for vfa accumulation since the contact time of microorganisms and feed increases 17 however it was also suggested that the reactor operating at prolonged hrt could lead to stagnant accumulation of vfa 18 lim et al 18 had observed that the yield of vfa at hrt of 4 8 and 12 days were in the range of 0 26 0 32 0 34 0 37 and 0 36 0 39 mgvfa mgcod respectively showing that the prolonged hrt did not affect vfa accumulation significantly some of the vfa was converted to methane gas and h2 through methanogenesis in this study the vfa yield in the sbr was about 0 41 0 05 mgvfa mgcod at an hrt of 5 days which was higher than the reported value by lim et al 18 table 4 shows the concentration and composition of vfa in the feed and in the sbr on day 1 and 30 on the first day of the operation of the sbr the concentration of acetic acid and propionic acid were reduced slightly meanwhile the concentration of butyric acid valeric acid caproic acid and heptanoic acid increased once the sbr acclimatized and reached steady state day 30 the concentration of all the detected vfa species had increased yet the composition of the vfa species present in the sbr was balanced and did not change significantly compared to the initial composition in the feed however the vfa accumulated through complete anaerobic digestion generally had a higher acetic acid composition than the other vfa propionic butyric valeric caproic and heptanoic acid previously it was reported that microorganisms could accumulate pha at around 80 wt in the form of polyhydroxybutyrate phb when the vfa consisting of high acetic acid composition was used as the feed 19 however it is well known that a biopolymer with only one type of pha scl homopolymer in its composition such as phb has limited usage as it is brittle and stiff 20 in comparison pha of variable short chain length monomers scl copolymer such as polyhydroxybutyrate co valerate phb co hv is more desirable because it is less crystalline has a lower melting point is easier to mold and is tougher than phb 21 vfa which contains both even acetic and butyric acids and odd numbered propionic and valeric acids carbon sources is essential for the production of such biopolymers 22 thus the balanced composition of vfa in this study could be the better option for pha production because the balance odd and even numbered vfa can produce phb co hv polymer 3 2 microbial population shift in sbr in this study samples were collected for microbial analysis at different stages the analyzed microbial population were listed in table 5 as day 0 seed sludge pome and day 30 at day 0 the microbial population consisted of about 48 0 archaea and 52 0 bacteria about 99 98 of the identified archaea was assigned to the order methanosarcinales which belongs to the phyla euryarchaeota on the other hand the identified bacteria were affiliated with the phyla mentioned proteobacteria 31 0 bacteroidetes 12 0 firmicutes 6 0 actinobacteria 2 0 and unclassified phyla 13 5 on day 30 it was observed that the total archaea had been reduced from 48 0 to 0 005 while the total bacteria increased from 52 0 99 99 at this stage the bacteria in the reactor was assigned to actinobacteria 49 0 firmicutes 41 0 bacteroidetes 6 0 and proteobacteria 3 0 in general the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea in the sbr had been reduced to a very small amount the observation of the microbial shift suggested that the microorganism communities in the sbr were highly affected by the characteristics of the operating conditions previous studies have suggested that acidogens are more dominant under low srt conditions srt 8 days while methanogens are more dominant under conditions of more than 10 days 23 therefore an srt lower than 8 days does not favor the growth of methanogens in biological wastewater treatment units microorganisms of phyla methanosarcinales are able to produce methane gas as the end product of their biochemical activity 24 25 in this study after the acidogenic reactor reached steady state condition 30 days the amount of methanogen in the reactor was reduced to a negligible amount the low population of methanogenic archaea agrees with earlier observations that suggested that there was no methane gas detected in the sbr this shows that the applied operating condition in the sbr successfully suppressed the growth of methanogens perhaps due to the fact that the methanogens has a slower growth rate than acidogens and methanogens are more dominant at srt 10 days 23 since the methanogens are the major converter of organic acids into methane gas the incomplete anaerobic treatment of wastewater often leads to the acidification of the treatment unit causing process failure in the system however this study took advantage of the acidification in the reactor to enhance the vfa production through eliminating the consumption of vfa by methanogens therefore manipulating the srt of the treatment unit is the key factor to influencing the vfa accumulation in the reactor this prevents the generated vfa from being used by methanogens as a carbon source the relative abundance of actinobacteria and firmicutes increased significantly during the acclimatization stage the relative abundance of bacteria of phyla actinobacteria increased from 2 0 49 0 while the bacteria of phyla of firmicutes increased from 6 0 41 0 on the other hand the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from 31 0 3 0 while that of bacteroidetes decreased from 12 0 6 0 the results show that the operational condition applied was favorable to the growth of bacteria in the phyla group of actinobacteria and firmicutes but unsupportive to the growth of the phyla group of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria this might be due to the acidic environment in the sbr most of the bacteria associated with the phyla actinobacteria and firmicutes in this study are gram positive bacteria so they are more tolerable of acidic conditions than gram negative bacteria in that sense the gram positive bacteria could imply several countermeasures toward acidic conditions such as alteration of cell membrane composition changing metabolic pathways extrusion of protons protection of macro molecules and generation of alkali 26 the information about the phyla group is valuable to understanding the activity of microorganisms this study showed that some of the anaerobic bacteria in the phylum firmicutes and actinobacteria such as lactobacillus and olsenella were able to adapt to the operating condition and thus became the dominant group in the reactor the mentioned groups were able to grow and produce vfa as a product of their biochemical activity in the sbr similar group of microorganism was found to produce vfa through fermentation of acidic wastewater 27 28 the production of organic acids reduces the ph in the sbr and leads to acidification in the reactor the acidic condition was hostile to some dominant species in the seed such as methanosaeta phylum methanosarcinales pseudomonas phylum proteobacteria and bacteroides phylum bacteroidetes causing their population in the sbr to decline as the population of acid utilizing methanogens declined less vfa was converted to methane instigating the accumulation of vfa in the reactor the cycle of acid generation and methanogen inhibition continued and eventually the genus methanosaeta was eliminated from the sbr the dominance of actinobacteria and firmicutes suggested that they are the major bacteria that contributes to the accumulation of vfa in the sbr bacteria such as bacteroidetes and clostridium secretes the hydrolytic enzymes needed for the degradation of carbohydrates proteins and lipids 29 corresponding to the first step in anaerobic digestion the availability of bacteroidetes in this study suggests that the hydrolysis stage was not the limiting process in the sbr in the second step of anaerobic digestion long chain fatty acids are broken down to shorter chain fatty acids the bacteria in the phyla group of firmicutes are related to the conversion of simple sugars into organic acids bacteria of classes clostridia phylum firmicutes were found to degrade organic matter to produce various organic acids meanwhile some actinobacteria were found to be the bacteria that contribute to propionic acid accumulation 29 in the sbr the bacteria of phyla firmicutes and actinobacteria were abundant firmicutes such as lactobacillus were able to produce lactic acid through the embden meyerhof pathway while actinobacteria such as the bifidobacteriaceae family and coriobacteriaceae family were able to convert the lactic acid into acetic acid and propionic acid furthermore the presence of pseudoramibacter phylum firmicutes in the sbr also explained the accumulation of vfa since the genus was able to convert fermentable carbohydrates into various organic acid at the genus level the bacteria detected can provide valuable information about the function of the communities in the reactor in the seed sludge the dominant genera were methanosaeta 48 pseudomonas 28 and bacteroides 8 the population of genus methanosaeta was high which is common due to the seed sludge that was originated from the anaerobic reactor in actual palm oil mill under anoxic conditions where the light source and alternate electron acceptors other than carbon dioxide are lacking the members of the genus methanosaeta were capable to catabolize acetate into methane and carbon dioxide 29 they could be the major cause for the decrease in the acetate concentration in anaerobic reactors the absence of the genus methanosaeta in the sbr explained the build up of acetate without being utilized the genus with the second highest population in the seed sludge was pseudomonas most species in this genus are aerobic bacteria which utilized oxygen as the electron acceptor some of the species in the genus pseudomonas were able to convert carbohydrate monomers of more than four carbon chains into polyhydroxyalkanoates during growth 30 none of the members in genus pseudomonas can tolerate acidic conditions with total inhibition occurring at ph 4 5 30 the third largest genus in the seed sludge was bacteroides this genus is anaerobic and saccharolytic 31 the major end product of their growth through fermentation are succinate and acetate 31 the population of bacteroides was low compared to that of methanosaeta and pseudomonas perhaps due to sources that do not suit the optimum growth condition 37 c ph 7 0 31 meanwhile after achieving steady state in the sbr the population percentage of the bacteria of genera lactobacillus olsenella aeriscardovia pseudoramibacter atopobium unidentified coriobacteriaceae and prevotella increased significantly these genera share some common characteristics as most of them are obligate anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria gram positive tolerant to mildly acidic environments mesophilic bacteria and able to produce organic acids from fermentable carbohydrates 32 34 the genus lactobacillus was the largest genus in the sbr the group is strictly fermentative and able to utilize carbon sources fermentatively in two ways during the homofermentative process a carbon source was utilized to produce lactic acid meanwhile in the heterofermentative process glucose was converted to lactic acid carbon dioxide ethanol and acetic acid 32 due to the increase in carbon dioxide gas concentrate in the earlier observation it was believed that the genus lactobacillus in this study underwent the heterofermentative process as it grew in the sbr several other genera such as olsenella aeriscardovia atopobium and unidentified coriobacteriaceae are the major bacteria population in the sbr the mentioned genera were classified in the family coriobacteriaceae 33 35 similar to genus lactobacillus the members of the coriobacteriaceae family are also able to convert carbohydrates to acetic acid and lactic acid as the end product of metabolic activity 32 in addition genus pseudoramibacter was also present in the sbr the genus can produce a variety of organic acids such as formate acetate butyrate and caproate as the end product of fermentation in the presence of glucose 36 4 conclusions this study shows that the microbial population is crucial to the accumulation of vfa the microbial population shift analysis indicates that the operating condition of the sbr favors the growth of acidogens and limits the growth of methanogens the anaerobic bacteria of genera lactobacillus olsenella aeriscardovia pseudoramibacter and atopobium managed to prevail and generate vfa in the sbr meanwhile the operating condition did not favor the growth of methanosaeta pseudomonas and bacteroides additionally the sbr managed to increase the vfa accumulation to about 10 500 mg l total vfa which is an accumulation of about 43 8 of vfa in the feed the output of the sbr had a balanced composition of vfa which is suitable for production of scl

assignment of otus was performed by using the silva database 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of sbr 3 1 1 start up of sbr raw pome without dilution was used as feed for the sbr in general a wastewater treatment unit needs about 3 4 srt to achieve steady state condition 11 steady state condition implies that the generation of biomass represented by mlvss and the biomass wasted in the reactor are the same in this study it took about 12 days for the reactor to achieve steady state with an average mlvss value of 1220 mg l stable mlvss in the reactor once the reactor achieved steady state solid liquid and gas samples were taken from the reactor for analysis and the average values were presented in table 2 and table 3 in this study the sbr achieved a cod removal of 23 because the organic content in the feed did not undergo the complete anaerobic treatment process fig 1 shows the profile of mlvss and vfa in the sbr throughout the operation in this study the input concentration of the vfa in the sbr was 7300 mg l the total vfa concentration in the sbr increased to about 8530 mg l in the first 5 days meanwhile the total vfa concentration after 15 days 3 hrt of operation managed to reach a concentration of about 10 500 mg l beyond this point the total vfa concentration level in the sbr was stable around 10 500 500 mg l throughout the operation although the biomass concentration in the reactor experienced a reduction it did not reduce the performance to accumulate vfa instead the total vfa concentration remained at about 10 500 mg l on the other hand methane was not detected in the gas collected from the sbr table 3 the absence of methane in the output gas has proven that the sbr carried out a partial anaerobic wastewater treatment where it did not undergo the methanogenesis stage thus the low cod removal 23 cod removal in this reactor suggested that the cod organic component in the reactor was transformed from a complex organic substance into simpler molecules vfa but not removed from the system in terms of methane gas the lack of the methanogenesis stage in the sbr was closely related to the microbial population in the mixed culture various group of bacteria are needed to enhance the vfa concentration in the sbr for pha production there were two major groups of microorganisms present in the anaerobic digestion reactor namely acidogens and methanogens the acidogens utilized the organic content carbohydrates proteins and lipids and produced short chain fatty acids scfa hydrogen and carbon dioxide in contrast the methanogens utilized the scfa produced by the acidogens to produce methane and carbon dioxide a biological wastewater treatment unit needs both acidogens and methanogens to perform complete anaerobic treatment the growth of both acidogens and methanogens is affected by the operational parameters of the anaerobic reactor such as srt hrt ph and temperature in sbr the growth of acidogens was faster than the growth of methanogens this could be observed in fig 1 where the vfa concentration increased rapidly and reached the plateau stage the average vfa production was 43 8 of the original vfa content in raw pome wong et al 2014 16 used anaerobic reactor to produce methane gas their study showed that the pome of 12 170 mgcod l day 1 organic loading rate was able to accumulate about 2584 mg l as acetic acid vfa which was lower than the findings of this study in terms of percentage vfa produced per influent cod increasing the hrt of reactor might be good for vfa accumulation since the contact time of microorganisms and feed increases 17 however it was also suggested that the reactor operating at prolonged hrt could lead to stagnant accumulation of vfa 18 lim et al 18 had observed that the yield of vfa at hrt of 4 8 and 12 days were in the range of 0 26 0 32 0 34 0 37 and 0 36 0 39 mgvfa mgcod respectively showing that the prolonged hrt did not affect vfa accumulation significantly some of the vfa was converted to methane gas and h2 through methanogenesis in this study the vfa yield in the sbr was about 0 41 0 05 mgvfa mgcod at an hrt of 5 days which was higher than the reported value by lim et al 18 table 4 shows the concentration and composition of vfa in the feed and in the sbr on day 1 and 30 on the first day of the operation of the sbr the concentration of acetic acid and propionic acid were reduced slightly meanwhile the concentration of butyric acid valeric acid caproic acid and heptanoic acid increased once the sbr acclimatized and reached steady state day 30 the concentration of all the detected vfa species had increased yet the composition of the vfa species present in the sbr was balanced and did not change significantly compared to the initial composition in the feed however the vfa accumulated through complete anaerobic digestion generally had a higher acetic acid composition than the other vfa propionic butyric valeric caproic and heptanoic acid previously it was reported that microorganisms could accumulate pha at around 80 wt in the form of polyhydroxybutyrate phb when the vfa consisting of high acetic acid composition was used as the feed 19 however it is well known that a biopolymer with only one type of pha scl homopolymer in its composition such as phb has limited usage as it is brittle and stiff 20 in comparison pha of variable short chain length monomers scl copolymer such as polyhydroxybutyrate co valerate phb co hv is more desirable because it is less crystalline has a lower melting point is easier to mold and is tougher than phb 21 vfa which contains both even acetic and butyric acids and odd numbered propionic and valeric acids carbon sources is essential for the production of such biopolymers 22 thus the balanced composition of vfa in this study could be the better option for pha production because the balance odd and even numbered vfa can produce phb co hv polymer 3 2 microbial population shift in sbr in this study samples were collected for microbial analysis at different stages the analyzed microbial population were listed in table 5 as day 0 seed sludge pome and day 30 at day 0 the microbial population consisted of about 48 0 archaea and 52 0 bacteria about 99 98 of the identified archaea was assigned to the order methanosarcinales which belongs to the phyla euryarchaeota on the other hand the identified bacteria were affiliated with the phyla mentioned proteobacteria 31 0 bacteroidetes 12 0 firmicutes 6 0 actinobacteria 2 0 and unclassified phyla 13 5 on day 30 it was observed that the total archaea had been reduced from 48 0 to 0 005 while the total bacteria increased from 52 0 99 99 at this stage the bacteria in the reactor was assigned to actinobacteria 49 0 firmicutes 41 0 bacteroidetes 6 0 and proteobacteria 3 0 in general the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea in the sbr had been reduced to a very small amount the observation of the microbial shift suggested that the microorganism communities in the sbr were highly affected by the characteristics of the operating conditions previous studies have suggested that acidogens are more dominant under low srt conditions srt 8 days while methanogens are more dominant under conditions of more than 10 days 23 therefore an srt lower than 8 days does not favor the growth of methanogens in biological wastewater treatment units microorganisms of phyla methanosarcinales are able to produce methane gas as the end product of their biochemical activity 24 25 in this study after the acidogenic reactor reached steady state condition 30 days the amount of methanogen in the reactor was reduced to a negligible amount the low population of methanogenic archaea agrees with earlier observations that suggested that there was no methane gas detected in the sbr this shows that the applied operating condition in the sbr successfully suppressed the growth of methanogens perhaps due to the fact that the methanogens has a slower growth rate than acidogens and methanogens are more dominant at srt 10 days 23 since the methanogens are the major converter of organic acids into methane gas the incomplete anaerobic treatment of wastewater often leads to the acidification of the treatment unit causing process failure in the system however this study took advantage of the acidification in the reactor to enhance the vfa production through eliminating the consumption of vfa by methanogens therefore manipulating the srt of the treatment unit is the key factor to influencing the vfa accumulation in the reactor this prevents the generated vfa from being used by methanogens as a carbon source the relative abundance of actinobacteria and firmicutes increased significantly during the acclimatization stage the relative abundance of bacteria of phyla actinobacteria increased from 2 0 49 0 while the bacteria of phyla of firmicutes increased from 6 0 41 0 on the other hand the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from 31 0 3 0 while that of bacteroidetes decreased from 12 0 6 0 the results show that the operational condition applied was favorable to the growth of bacteria in the phyla group of actinobacteria and firmicutes but unsupportive to the growth of the phyla group of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria this might be due to the acidic environment in the sbr most of the bacteria associated with the phyla actinobacteria and firmicutes in this study are gram positive bacteria so they are more tolerable of acidic conditions than gram negative bacteria in that sense the gram positive bacteria could imply several countermeasures toward acidic conditions such as alteration of cell membrane composition changing metabolic pathways extrusion of protons protection of macro molecules and generation of alkali 26 the information about the phyla group is valuable to understanding the activity of microorganisms this study showed that some of the anaerobic bacteria in the phylum firmicutes and actinobacteria such as lactobacillus and olsenella were able to adapt to the operating condition and thus became the dominant group in the reactor the mentioned groups were able to grow and produce vfa as a product of their biochemical activity in the sbr similar group of microorganism was found to produce vfa through fermentation of acidic wastewater 27 28 the production of organic acids reduces the ph in the sbr and leads to acidification in the reactor the acidic condition was hostile to some dominant species in the seed such as methanosaeta phylum methanosarcinales pseudomonas phylum proteobacteria and bacteroides phylum bacteroidetes causing their population in the sbr to decline as the population of acid utilizing methanogens declined less vfa was converted to methane instigating the accumulation of vfa in the reactor the cycle of acid generation and methanogen inhibition continued and eventually the genus methanosaeta was eliminated from the sbr the dominance of actinobacteria and firmicutes suggested that they are the major bacteria that contributes to the accumulation of vfa in the sbr bacteria such as bacteroidetes and clostridium secretes the hydrolytic enzymes needed for the degradation of carbohydrates proteins and lipids 29 corresponding to the first step in anaerobic digestion the availability of bacteroidetes in this study suggests that the hydrolysis stage was not the limiting process in the sbr in the second step of anaerobic digestion long chain fatty acids are broken down to shorter chain fatty acids the bacteria in the phyla group of firmicutes are related to the conversion of simple sugars into organic acids bacteria of classes clostridia phylum firmicutes were found to degrade organic matter to produce various organic acids meanwhile some actinobacteria were found to be the bacteria that contribute to propionic acid accumulation 29 in the sbr the bacteria of phyla firmicutes and actinobacteria were abundant firmicutes such as lactobacillus were able to produce lactic acid through the embden meyerhof pathway while actinobacteria such as the bifidobacteriaceae family and coriobacteriaceae family were able to convert the lactic acid into acetic acid and propionic acid furthermore the presence of pseudoramibacter phylum firmicutes in the sbr also explained the accumulation of vfa since the genus was able to convert fermentable carbohydrates into various organic acid at the genus level the bacteria detected can provide valuable information about the function of the communities in the reactor in the seed sludge the dominant genera were methanosaeta 48 pseudomonas 28 and bacteroides 8 the population of genus methanosaeta was high which is common due to the seed sludge that was originated from the anaerobic reactor in actual palm oil mill under anoxic conditions where the light source and alternate electron acceptors other than carbon dioxide are lacking the members of the genus methanosaeta were capable to catabolize acetate into methane and carbon dioxide 29 they could be the major cause for the decrease in the acetate concentration in anaerobic reactors the absence of the genus methanosaeta in the sbr explained the build up of acetate without being utilized the genus with the second highest population in the seed sludge was pseudomonas most species in this genus are aerobic bacteria which utilized oxygen as the electron acceptor some of the species in the genus pseudomonas were able to convert carbohydrate monomers of more than four carbon chains into polyhydroxyalkanoates during growth 30 none of the members in genus pseudomonas can tolerate acidic conditions with total inhibition occurring at ph 4 5 30 the third largest genus in the seed sludge was bacteroides this genus is anaerobic and saccharolytic 31 the major end product of their growth through fermentation are succinate and acetate 31 the population of bacteroides was low compared to that of methanosaeta and pseudomonas perhaps due to sources that do not suit the optimum growth condition 37 c ph 7 0 31 meanwhile after achieving steady state in the sbr the population percentage of the bacteria of genera lactobacillus olsenella aeriscardovia pseudoramibacter atopobium unidentified coriobacteriaceae and prevotella increased significantly these genera share some common characteristics as most of them are obligate anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria gram positive tolerant to mildly acidic environments mesophilic bacteria and able to produce organic acids from fermentable carbohydrates 32 34 the genus lactobacillus was the largest genus in the sbr the group is strictly fermentative and able to utilize carbon sources fermentatively in two ways during the homofermentative process a carbon source was utilized to produce lactic acid meanwhile in the heterofermentative process glucose was converted to lactic acid carbon dioxide ethanol and acetic acid 32 due to the increase in carbon dioxide gas concentrate in the earlier observation it was believed that the genus lactobacillus in this study underwent the heterofermentative process as it grew in the sbr several other genera such as olsenella aeriscardovia atopobium and unidentified coriobacteriaceae are the major bacteria population in the sbr the mentioned genera were classified in the family coriobacteriaceae 33 35 similar to genus lactobacillus the members of the coriobacteriaceae family are also able to convert carbohydrates to acetic acid and lactic acid as the end product of metabolic activity 32 in addition genus pseudoramibacter was also present in the sbr the genus can produce a variety of organic acids such as formate acetate butyrate and caproate as the end product of fermentation in the presence of glucose 36 4 conclusions this study shows that the microbial population is crucial to the accumulation of vfa the microbial population shift analysis indicates that the operating condition of the sbr favors the growth of acidogens and limits the growth of methanogens the anaerobic bacteria of genera lactobacillus olsenella aeriscardovia pseudoramibacter and atopobium managed to prevail and generate vfa in the sbr meanwhile the operating condition did not favor the growth of methanosaeta pseudomonas and bacteroides additionally the sbr managed to increase the vfa accumulation to about 10 500 mg l total vfa which is an accumulation of about 43 8 of vfa in the feed the output of the sbr had a balanced composition of vfa which is suitable for production of scl

14174,this study reported a novel synthetic zeolite based adsorbent developed from the municipal wastewater sludge molten slag bio slag through the hydrothermal modification process for removal of cesium cs from simulated wastewater the artificial zeolites were produced from the raw bio slag which was identified by the several physicochemical experimental procedures such as the surface area analysis the bet technique the fesem the xrf and the xrd the cs adsorption process of modified bio slag was exmined by the linear pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particles diffusion models whilst the second order kinetic model confirmed a better agreement with the correlation coefficient r2 0 999 1 000 for 20 400 mg l cs solution the langmuir freundlich and the temkin isotherm model were investigated using the adsorption isotherm data a satisfactory correlation coefficient value r2 0 980 proved that the isotherm parameters were perfectly fitted to the langmuir and freundlich model and the highest cs adsorption ability of modified bio slag were 51 02 51 02 and 49 51 mg g at 288 298 and 308 k respectively the better agreement of adsorption data with the second order kinetic model and the langmuir model proved the adsorption mechanism was controlled by the chemical reaction ion exchange thermodynamic studies under the different temperatures proved that the adsorption reaction was endothermic δ h 20 53 kj mol and δ s 0 021 kj mol k and non spontaneous δ g 0 moreover the modified bio slag effectively removed cs even in the co existence of na and k as competitive ions at their wide range of concentrations upto 300 mm although the higher concentration slightly affected the cs adsorption keywords modified bio slag cesium high adsorption and isotherm high kinetic performance highly selective 1 introduction the removal of long lasting radionuclides from the nuclear wastewater has become an important environmental concern following the large nuclear power plant npp accident at fukushima daiichi japan in 2011 when a large quantity of the radioisotopes were scattered in the environment the major radioosotopes were 134cs and 137cs which can easily incorporated to food chain and congregate to the human body 1 3 in the consequence the radioactive cesium can causes thyroid cancer and many other serious diseases 4 the radioactive cs can shows a radiation risk due to the external contact of radiation or internal radiation demolition after breathing of polluted air food or water 4 5 therefore in the recent years a significant effort has been made to separate and remove cesium from aquatic environment due to the limitations of the other methods such as precipitation solvent extraction and membrane separation for the removal of the cs the adsorption process is mostly used due to the effective removal performance high removal efficiency and abundantly of cost effective adsorbents 6 9 in the recent years different biomass based activated carbons 2 10 11 clay materials 7 12 13 and also inorganic synthetic adsorbents 12 14 17 have been studied for this purpose among these adsorbents natural and inorganic cation exchangers such as prussian blue pb and other hexacyanoferrates hcf have been used for the selective removal of cesium 16 18 however the practical application of the hcfs is quite difficult the hcfs is usually found as micro particles form which are hard to filtrate from aqueous solution due to clogging of fixed bed reactors and causing significant pressure loss 11 19 moreover in the recent years several activated carbons were studied to capture the cs ions since activated carbons have high surface area with a developed porosity and easily made from the biomass however the poor cs removal capacity by different activated carbon coconut shell almond shell pine cone walnut shell etc draw the attention to find highly effective and low cost adsorbents 11 18 20 21 furthermore the high production and disposal cost of activated carbon makes unsuitable for cutting edges applications in the developing cointries 22 in 2013 more than 2 2 million tons sewage sludge on a dry basis was produced in japan and this quantity has been significantly increased day by day in the current disposal systems most of the sludge 70 is incinerated to reduce the volume for land filling 23 however in the recent years sewage sludge is pyrolyzed at comparatively low temperature 400 500 c to produce biochar and applied for the removal of different wastewater contaminants 24 27 however the disposal of the spent adsorbents is a major concern as it contains toxic pollutants that might leaches to the environment and causes serious environmental problem 27 therefore the sewage sludge is melt at higher temperature to covert into the bio slag the bio slag is the by product of sewage treatment process which is made by the pyrolyzing of the sewage sludge at higher temperature above 1300 c currently the slag has been widely used as construction materials it can be a unique adsorbent to capture heavy metals or radioactive materials from contaminated water due to its unique properties generally the bio slag contains silicon dioxide s i o 2 aluminum oxide a l 2 o 3 magnesium oxide m g o calcium oxide c a o and other metal oxides this chemical composition of the bio slag is similar to the coal fly ash and blast oxygen furnace slag which have been used for making synthetic zeolites 13 28 29 therefore it is assumed that synthetic zeolite can be prepared by hydrothermal treatment process from the bio slag zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals which actually occurred naturally due to the volcanic eruption 30 the three dimentioanl structure of the zeolite made of s i o 4 and a l o 4 tetrahedra the net negative charge of the tetrahydra unit is stabled by the replaceable cations n a k c a 2 these exchangeable cations can be exchanged with different heavy metals such as lead cadmium zinc manganese and cesium by the ion exchange reaction 31 33 in order to the clean the nuclear waste the inorganic ion exchangers are always incompareable with other ion exchangers due to having the higher radiation stability 34 currently a number of efficient inorganic exchangers are available in the market for large scale applications natural and artifitial zeolites have been mostly applied in several npp and other nuclear facilities for 137cs contaminated water purification therefore the purpose of this research is to modify the bio slag in order to produce synthetic zeolites for cs ions adsorption in batch method and investigate the equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic model based on the experimental data 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the bio slag was obtained from a secret municipal sludge melting industry situated in the middle part of japan the municipal wastewater treatment facility is designed with the biological purification method the dewatered sludge is pyrolyzed at higher temperature 1300 c and followed by air cooled the collected slag stone size 2 3 mm of the slag was powdered by a ball mills machine mixer mill mm 400 retsch japan the slag powder was sieved at 75 μm and named as bio slag the hydrothermal modification process was followed in order to prepare artificial zeolites from this bio slag 13 28 briefly a small amount of bio slag 10 0 g were treated with 80 ml solid to liquid 1 8 of 1 0 n naoh at 120 c for 24 h and washed properly with deionized water elix millipore japan until ph of the treated bio slag obtained neutral then the treated slag was dried at 70 c for 12 h the obtained slag through this modification process was named as modified bio slag due to hazardous effect of radioactive cesium 137cs non radioactive cesium chloride cscl fw 168 36 g was purchased from wako pure chemical industries ltd japan for using in this study sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were obtained from the same supplier all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade purity ultrapure water elix millipore japan was used throughout the experiments all working solutions were freshly prepared before using 2 2 analytical procedures the proposed material surface area and pore sizes of raw and modified bio slag were measured following the brunauer emmett teller bet method using a belsorp mini ii japan the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were obtained at 196 c 77 k for this analysis the fesem model su 8000 hitachi japan images and the xrf model edx 7000 8000 shimadzu japan analysis was carried out to investigate the suface structure and chemical identity of the adsorbents respectively the mineralogical composition was identified by using xrd rigaku japan 2 3 adsorption experiments the batch method was employed for the experimental study of cs adsorption using a reciprocating shaker eyela mms 3010 japan with 140 rpm at 25 c and the experiments were triplicated and the results were taken as an average after the cs adsorption experiments samples were collected by using a syringe and filtered by 0 45 μ membrane filter papers advantec mfs japan the cs concentration in initial and supernatant was determined by the aas aa 7000 shimadzu japan the instrument was calibrated using five standard solutions containing 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 mg l for each element and the correlation coefficient of the calibration curve was higher than 0 9999 in addition sample solutions having complicated matrices were not used and no significant interference of matrices was observed the cs removal results were calculated based on the following equations 1 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q t m g g c 0 c t v m 2 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y r c 0 c t c 0 100 3 d i s t r i b u t i o n c o e f f i c i e n t k d m l g c 0 c t c t v m here c 0 mg l and c t m g l are the initial and the final concentration of the cs in solution respectively v ml is the volume of cs solution and m g is the mass of the adsorbent used in the experiments 2 3 1 effect of solution ph on cs adsorption the effect of ph on cs adsorption was determined by changing ph of the cs solution from 2 0 to 12 0 here 0 3 g of modified slag was added to the different ph 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 12 0 adjusted 30 ml solution 100 mg l the agitation time was considered 120 min to reach at the equilibrium conditions 2 3 2 effect of reaction time and kinetic studies for determining the effect of reaction time on cs adsorption 1 0 g of modified bio slag was added with 100 ml of adsorbtae solution 100 mg l and the conical flask was shaken for 360 min supernatants about 3 ml were taken at preordered time period and the concentration of cs was measured the obtained experimental data were used to investigate the adsorption kinetic by using the widely used lagergren pseudo first order kinetic model 35 pseudo second order 36 and intra partical diffusion model 37 the linearized form of these models was shown in below 4 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t l i n e a r f o r m 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t l i n e a r f o r m 5 q t k i d t 1 2 c where t min is the reaction time k 1 m i n 1 and k 2 g m g 1 m i n 1 are adsorption rate constants for first order and second order kinetic model respectively k i d m g g 1 m i n 1 2 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant q e and q t indicate the adsorption quantity of ions by the adsorbent at the equilibrium condition and the time t respectively the first order rate constant is computed from the slope of the log q e q t versus t the second order rate constant is obtained from the intercept of t q t and t the intra particle diffusion rate constant is acheived from the linear plot of q t versus t 1 2 2 3 3 initial cs concentration and equilibrium studies a fixed amount of modified bio slag 0 30 g was incorporated to the 30 ml of different concentrated cs solution 20 800 mg l under the equilibrium time and at the most favorable adsorption ph to determine the consequence of primary cs concentration on the cs uptake the achievd adsorption data were used to investigate the widely practiced different isotherms models such as the langmuir isotherm 38 the freundlich isotherm 39 and the temkin isotherm 40 the linearized forms of these isotherms are as below 7 l a n g m u i r i s o t h e r m c e q e 1 q m c e 1 q m k l 8 f r e u n d l i c h i s o t h e r m l o g q e l o g k f 1 n

respectively the q m m g g a n d k l l mg are the langmuir constant which represents the highest quantity of cs adsorption and the energy of adsorption respectively the q m a n d k l can be obtained from the intercept and slope of the linear plot with c e q e versus c e on the other hand k f l mg and 1 n are the freundlich constants which specify the adsorption capability and the adsorption intensity respectively these parametrs are computed from the linear plot of l o g q e versus l o g c e the degree of the exponent 1 n specifies the suitability of adsorption values of n where n 1 indicate the favourable adsorption conditions for temkin isotherm the values of b k j mol and a l g are calculated from the slope and intercept of the liner plot of q e versus ln c e r is the gas constant 8 314 10 3 k j mol and t is the absolute temperature k 2 3 4 effect of temperature and thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic indicators such as the gibbs free energy δ g the standard enthalpy change δ h and entropy change δ s were investigated by studying the adsorption process at the various temperatures 288 298 and 308 k to know the thermodynamic properties of the adsorption reaction the van t hoff equation 41 was used to calculated these parameters as below 10 l n k d δ h r t δ s r where kd ml g is the distribution coefficient in cs adsorption r is the universal gas constant 8 314 10 3 k j mol and t is the absolute temperature k the linear plot of of lnkd versus 1 t used to obtain the value of δ h and δ s then the gibbs free energy δ g can be obtained from the subsequent equation 11 δ g δ h t δ s 2 3 5 effect of competitive ions to evaluate the cs removal efficiency at the presence of competitive ions a fixed concentration 0 15 mm of cs solution was added with a wide range of concentration of na k ions solutions 5 300 mm at 25 0c temperature the optimum experimental conditions ph and reaction time were consider for this experiment 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of bio slag the bet surface area of the unmodified bio slag was 1 178 m2 g with a total pore volume of 0 003 cm3 g however the surface area and the total pore volume of the original slag drastically increased to 103 631 m2 g and 0 280 cm3 g respectively after the hydrothermal treatment the method exhibited the low surface area of the material compared to the sol gel fabricated mesoporous silica 42 43 hence it is expected that the higher surface area of modified bio slag has made it more favorable for cs adsorption the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms are shown in fig 1 according to the international union of the pure applied chemistry iupac classification system the majority of physisorption isotherms can be grouped into six types 44 the isotherm of the hydrothermal modified bio slag belongs to type iv with an h3 hysteresis loop which denoted that the allocation of the pore size of the modified material is like mesoporous however the non modified bio slag can be marked as isotherm types ii according to the iupac classification system which representing the non porous material therefore it is estimated that the surface area total pore volume opening of the channels enlargement of the space diameter and also the microporosity of the material have significantly increased due to the hydrothermal modification the morphological micrographs of the initial and treated bio slag are shown in fig 2 it can be percieved that the surface of the original bio slag was compact crystal structure and the modified bio slag showed a clear porous structure with thin channels it is clear that a significant difference was observed in the surface of the bio slag prior and subsequent to the modification as remarked by the arrows in fig 2 according to the xrf analysis the untreated and treated bio slag consist mainly of sio2 al2 o3 fe2o3 cr2o3 and p2o5 more than 95 by mass a small portion of al2o3 increased from 4 20 to 5 76 into the modified bio slag moreover the quantity of other oxides was also changed in modified bio slag during the modification the increase of the al2o3 can enhance the active sites in the zeolite structure which can exchange cs ions in solutions 45 46 the xrd pattern of the untreated and treated bio slag is shown in fig 3 the raw bio slag contains some mineralogical phases such as quartz eskolite albite gehlenite which are very commonly found in oxygen furnace slag coal fly ash as described by several researchers 7 46 47 however several synthetic zeolites were identified in hydrothermal modified bio slag by the xrd analysis as it is observed that the bio slag contains necessary portion of sio2 and al2o3 for the formation of zeolites therefore it can be estimated that in the alkali hydrothermal modification process the bio slag dissolved at higher temperature by hydroxyl ions oh in the next step condensation is occurred to form the aluminosilicate gel which is subsequently crystalized with the help of na and form the different artificial zeolites structure 28 48 3 2 the effect of ph on cs adsorption the adsorption of metals from aqueous phase decisively affected by the solution ph due to the protonation of metal ion e g speciation and deposition 10 49 the effect of ph on cs adsorption percentage by the proposed bio slag is shown in fig 4 it is obviously understood that the suitable cs uptake ph was between 4 0 to 10 0 however cs adsorption was seriously interrupted at lower ph 4 0 this observation could be clarified by two facts 9 10 i the competition of h3o with cs at acidic conditions ii the electrostatic repulsion occurred with positive ions between cs and h in solution on the contrary the cs adsorption was also notably influenced under alkaline state 10 0 possibly due to the creation of cesium hydroxide the negative ions of the cesium hydroxide cs oh 2 might be increased an electrostatic repulsion which inhibited the cs adsorption 10 50 hence the following experimentation were conducted at ph 7 0 3 3 effect of reaction time and kinetics study the fig 5 represents the consequence of reaction period on cs adsorption and the various kinetic models first order kinetic second order kinetic and intra particle diffusion model to cs adsorption by bio slag it can be understand from the fig 5 a that the cs removal efficiency by the treated bio slag was a rapid process the cs adsorption yield was attained within first 5 minutes from 20 and 100 mg l cs solution while it took almost 120 minutes from 400 mg l solution the fast uptake speed at the initial phase could be assisted to the increasing of the driving force which is contributed by the availability of cs in aqueous solutions moreover the potentiality of free active sites on the the modified bio slag enhance the adsorption of cs 51 at the equilibrium condition the cs uptake was 1 995 9 457 and 27 818 mg g from 20 mg l 100 mg l and 400 mg l solution respectively the kinetic of uptake process illustrates the rate of cs uptake onto bio slag and the rate regulates the equilibrium time for adsorption the kinetics of the adsorption procedure is essential to know the most favorable working environment for the commercially applicable batch process the kinetic specification allow for understanding the rate of adsorption and also a guidline to design the process 52 the kinetic specifications and garph of the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra partical diffusion models are presented in table 1 and fig 5 b c and d it is observed that the analytical results were better agreement by the second order kinetic model with the high regression coefficient 0 999 1 000 compared with pseudo first order model 0 561 0 916 moreover the experimental values of qe for the second order kinetic model are near to the computed values of qe in contrast the calculated values of qe were much lower than that of the experimental value for the first order kinetic model thus considering the value of regression coefficient r2 and the closeness the value of experimental and calculated qe it can be summarized that the second order kinetic model shows a optimum fit to explain the cs uptake mechanism these findings unequivocally indicate that the cs adsorption mechanism appears to be dominated by the chemical reaction 53 54 intra particle diffusion model was verified by the analytical data to explore the diffusion mechanism in this adorption process the r2 values table 1 obtained from this model were fairly lesser when evaluated to that of the second order kinetic model however the calculated value of qe is quite near to the investigational value of qe which actually indicate the satisfactorily well for the intra particle diffusion model generally intra particle diffusion model is separated into three steps at the begining phase is fast adsorption by the outer surface followed by intra particle diffusion stage and finally the slow equilibrium stage which caused for the reason of the small adsorbate concentration left in solution consequently slowing down the intra particle diffusion 55 3 4 effect of the initial cs concentration and isotherm modeling the adsorption isotherm shows the allotment of the adsorbate molecules in the liquid phase and the adsorbents solid surface at the equilibrium conditions at the time of the uptake process 56 57 in this study the langmuir the freundlich and the temkin models were investigated and isotherm data of these models are demonstrated in table 2 according to the langmuir isotherm the highest cs adsorptions qm were obtained 51 02 51 02 and 49 51 mg g at the temperatures of 288 298 and 308 k respectively the regression co efficient r2 values were found to be 0 988 0 986 and 0 982 at 288 298 and 308 k respectively the higher r2 values confirm the validity of the langmuir model for the cs uptake the separation factor rl is one of the dimensionless parameter of langmuir isotherm the rl is defined as below 12 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where k l is the langmuir constant and c 0 is the maximum initial cs ions concentration mg l the adsorption process might be linear r l 1 favorable 0 r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 based on the r l value 19 58 the value of r l found to be 0 0137 0 0175 and 0 0204 at cs solution temperature of 288 298 and 308 k respectively which further confirmed the favorability of the langmuir isotherm the reassuring of the experimental data by the langmuir isotherm model specifies the homogenous character of the bio slag and also the formation of mono layer coverage of cs during adsorption process according to the assumption of this model for the freundlich isotherm the values of r 2 were 0 9872 0 9948 and 0 9868 at the temperature of 288 298 and 308 k respectively which ensured the favourability of the cs adsorption by the bio slag moreover the calculated values of n for the cs uptake were 2 76 2 81 and 2 89 mg g at 288 298 and 308 k respectively these values of n are in the limit of 1 n 10 which reflects the good adsorption properties 59 for temkin isotherm model the r 2 value at 288 k was 0 9271 which follow the model whereas at the higher temperature 298 k and 308 k temkin isotherm was inappropriate to explain the cs adsorption onto bio slag due to the lower r 2 value 0 8983 and 0 886 respectively as presented in table 2 according to the langmuir model the highest cs qm uptake of treated bio slag was 51 02 mg g the maximum cs adsorption is considerable larger than many other adsorbents derived from natural zeolites and clay minerals 60 65 as summarized in table 3 3 5 effect of the temperature and thermodynamic study the consequence of the temperature on cs removal efficiency by treated bio slag is shown in the fig 6 the performance of cs ions removal did not remarkably affected due to the changing of the temperature from 288 k to 308 k for the 20 100 and 400 mg l concentrated solution the thermodynamic parameters were identified to investigate the character of the cs ions adsorption on the surface of the bio slag thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy δ g kj mol standard enthalpy change δ h kj mol and standard entropy change δ s j k mol were calculated from the equation 10 and 11 for 100 mg l cs solution at temperature from 288 k to 308 k the thermodynamic parameters are shown in table 4 the positive value of δ h 20 53 kj mol and δ s 0 021 kj mol k indicate the endothermic nature of cs ions adsorption on to bio slag moreover the positive value of δ g denotes that the adsorption reaction is non spontaneous moreover it is also observed that the values of δg were found to reduce as the temperature amplified signifying the lesser amount of driving force which the consequence of less adsorption performance 3 6 effect of competitive ions selective elimination of cs ion is one of the important factors for the practical application of an adsorbent for the real radioactive wastewater treatment where different salts enriched seawater used as cooling water at the npp 9 10 it is well known that the target metal ions adsorption depend on the contest between the adsorbing ions and competing ions moreover the adsorbing sites of the adsorbents can be surrounded by the competing ions during adsorption process which causes the fractional drop their charge and reduce the necessary energy by an electrostatic attraction 58 the cs adsorption efficiency in the presence of diverse competitive ions na k is shown in the fig 7 the results clearly points out that the company of large amount of na up to 300 mm has no remarkable negative influence on cs adsorption by bio slag similarly there was no serious adverse effect was observed for the presence of k ions up to 50 mm more than 97 of cs was removed at the coexistence of k up to this concentration level however when the coexistence of the k ions was increased above the 50 mm the removal efficiency of cs gradually decreased it needs to be noted that a fixed concentration of cs 0 15 mm was used with the variable concentration of na and k in this experiment the cs adsorption was faintly affected in the existence of k since the hydration radius of k 3 3 å is near to the cs 3 25 å than that of the other cation of na 3 6 å 58 59 the optimum cs removal performance of modified bio slag at the presence of na and k is comparatively better than the other adsorbents as they reports 9 10 56 4 conclusions in this study the cs removal performance onto modified bio salg from liquid phase was experimented and the adsorption isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics were discussed in details the physicochemical analysis of the materials by xrd xrf fesem and bet analysis indicated that the bio slag effectively transformed to the artificial powerful zeolites which enhance the cs adsorption properties of modified slag the rapid cs adsorption reation strongly depends on the adsorbate solution ph the adsorption data of cs by modified bio slag storongly obeyed by the second order kinetic model r2 0 999 1 0 which specify that the adsorption process was dominated by the chemical reaction in the first phase then proceeded by pore diffusion and equilibrium in the last stage of the adsorption process equilibrium adsorption parameters were better fitted to langmuir and freundlich model in comparison with the temkin isotherm the highest monolayer adsorption capability of modified bio slag was 51 02 mg g at 25 c moreover the changing of the temperature did not remarkable affect the cs removal performance although slightly decreased at higher temperature the thermodynamic parameters revealed that the character of adsorption operation was endothermic and non spontaneous the modified bio slag is highly effective to capture cs even in the existence of the competitive ions like na and k at their wide range of concentrations up to 300 mm although higher concentration of k affected the cs adsorption based on the findings of this study it is expected that the suitable hydrothermal treatment could improve the amount of zeolites portion into modified bio slag which could be applied for real radioactive wastewater treatment in future declaration of competing interest all authors are confirming that there is no conflict of interest of this work acknowledgements we are thankful to dr

university for her genial support for the fesem xrf and xrd analysis 
14174,this study reported a novel synthetic zeolite based adsorbent developed from the municipal wastewater sludge molten slag bio slag through the hydrothermal modification process for removal of cesium cs from simulated wastewater the artificial zeolites were produced from the raw bio slag which was identified by the several physicochemical experimental procedures such as the surface area analysis the bet technique the fesem the xrf and the xrd the cs adsorption process of modified bio slag was exmined by the linear pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particles diffusion models whilst the second order kinetic model confirmed a better agreement with the correlation coefficient r2 0 999 1 000 for 20 400 mg l cs solution the langmuir freundlich and the temkin isotherm model were investigated using the adsorption isotherm data a satisfactory correlation coefficient value r2 0 980 proved that the isotherm parameters were perfectly fitted to the langmuir and freundlich model and the highest cs adsorption ability of modified bio slag were 51 02 51 02 and 49 51 mg g at 288 298 and 308 k respectively the better agreement of adsorption data with the second order kinetic model and the langmuir model proved the adsorption mechanism was controlled by the chemical reaction ion exchange thermodynamic studies under the different temperatures proved that the adsorption reaction was endothermic δ h 20 53 kj mol and δ s 0 021 kj mol k and non spontaneous δ g 0 moreover the modified bio slag effectively removed cs even in the co existence of na and k as competitive ions at their wide range of concentrations upto 300 mm although the higher concentration slightly affected the cs adsorption keywords modified bio slag cesium high adsorption and isotherm high kinetic performance highly selective 1 introduction the removal of long lasting radionuclides from the nuclear wastewater has become an important environmental concern following the large nuclear power plant npp accident at fukushima daiichi japan in 2011 when a large quantity of the radioisotopes were scattered in the environment the major radioosotopes were 134cs and 137cs which can easily incorporated to food chain and congregate to the human body 1 3 in the consequence the radioactive cesium can causes thyroid cancer and many other serious diseases 4 the radioactive cs can shows a radiation risk due to the external contact of radiation or internal radiation demolition after breathing of polluted air food or water 4 5 therefore in the recent years a significant effort has been made to separate and remove cesium from aquatic environment due to the limitations of the other methods such as precipitation solvent extraction and membrane separation for the removal of the cs the adsorption process is mostly used due to the effective removal performance high removal efficiency and abundantly of cost effective adsorbents 6 9 in the recent years different biomass based activated carbons 2 10 11 clay materials 7 12 13 and also inorganic synthetic adsorbents 12 14 17 have been studied for this purpose among these adsorbents natural and inorganic cation exchangers such as prussian blue pb and other hexacyanoferrates hcf have been used for the selective removal of cesium 16 18 however the practical application of the hcfs is quite difficult the hcfs is usually found as micro particles form which are hard to filtrate from aqueous solution due to clogging of fixed bed reactors and causing significant pressure loss 11 19 moreover in the recent years several activated carbons were studied to capture the cs ions since activated carbons have high surface area with a developed porosity and easily made from the biomass however the poor cs removal capacity by different activated carbon coconut shell almond shell pine cone walnut shell etc draw the attention to find highly effective and low cost adsorbents 11 18 20 21 furthermore the high production and disposal cost of activated carbon makes unsuitable for cutting edges applications in the developing cointries 22 in 2013 more than 2 2 million tons sewage sludge on a dry basis was produced in japan and this quantity has been significantly increased day by day in the current disposal systems most of the sludge 70 is incinerated to reduce the volume for land filling 23 however in the recent years sewage sludge is pyrolyzed at comparatively low temperature 400 500 c to produce biochar and applied for the removal of different wastewater contaminants 24 27 however the disposal of the spent adsorbents is a major concern as it contains toxic pollutants that might leaches to the environment and causes serious environmental problem 27 therefore the sewage sludge is melt at higher temperature to covert into the bio slag the bio slag is the by product of sewage treatment process which is made by the pyrolyzing of the sewage sludge at higher temperature above 1300 c currently the slag has been widely used as construction materials it can be a unique adsorbent to capture heavy metals or radioactive materials from contaminated water due to its unique properties generally the bio slag contains silicon dioxide s i o 2 aluminum oxide a l 2 o 3 magnesium oxide m g o calcium oxide c a o and other metal oxides this chemical composition of the bio slag is similar to the coal fly ash and blast oxygen furnace slag which have been used for making synthetic zeolites 13 28 29 therefore it is assumed that synthetic zeolite can be prepared by hydrothermal treatment process from the bio slag zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals which actually occurred naturally due to the volcanic eruption 30 the three dimentioanl structure of the zeolite made of s i o 4 and a l o 4 tetrahedra the net negative charge of the tetrahydra unit is stabled by the replaceable cations n a k c a 2 these exchangeable cations can be exchanged with different heavy metals such as lead cadmium zinc manganese and cesium by the ion exchange reaction 31 33 in order to the clean the nuclear waste the inorganic ion exchangers are always incompareable with other ion exchangers due to having the higher radiation stability 34 currently a number of efficient inorganic exchangers are available in the market for large scale applications natural and artifitial zeolites have been mostly applied in several npp and other nuclear facilities for 137cs contaminated water purification therefore the purpose of this research is to modify the bio slag in order to produce synthetic zeolites for cs ions adsorption in batch method and investigate the equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic model based on the experimental data 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the bio slag was obtained from a secret municipal sludge melting industry situated in the middle part of japan the municipal wastewater treatment facility is designed with the biological purification method the dewatered sludge is pyrolyzed at higher temperature 1300 c and followed by air cooled the collected slag stone size 2 3 mm of the slag was powdered by a ball mills machine mixer mill mm 400 retsch japan the slag powder was sieved at 75 μm and named as bio slag the hydrothermal modification process was followed in order to prepare artificial zeolites from this bio slag 13 28 briefly a small amount of bio slag 10 0 g were treated with 80 ml solid to liquid 1 8 of 1 0 n naoh at 120 c for 24 h and washed properly with deionized water elix millipore japan until ph of the treated bio slag obtained neutral then the treated slag was dried at 70 c for 12 h the obtained slag through this modification process was named as modified bio slag due to hazardous effect of radioactive cesium 137cs non radioactive cesium chloride cscl fw 168 36 g was purchased from wako pure chemical industries ltd japan for using in this study sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were obtained from the same supplier all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade purity ultrapure water elix millipore japan was used throughout the experiments all working solutions were freshly prepared before using 2 2 analytical procedures the proposed material surface area and pore sizes of raw and modified bio slag were measured following the brunauer emmett teller bet method using a belsorp mini ii japan the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were obtained at 196 c 77 k for this analysis the fesem model su 8000 hitachi japan images and the xrf model edx 7000 8000 shimadzu japan analysis was carried out to investigate the suface structure and chemical identity of the adsorbents respectively the mineralogical composition was identified by using xrd rigaku japan 2 3 adsorption experiments the batch method was employed for the experimental study of cs adsorption using a reciprocating shaker eyela mms 3010 japan with 140 rpm at 25 c and the experiments were triplicated and the results were taken as an average after the cs adsorption experiments samples were collected by using a syringe and filtered by 0 45 μ membrane filter papers advantec mfs japan the cs concentration in initial and supernatant was determined by the aas aa 7000 shimadzu japan the instrument was calibrated using five standard solutions containing 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 mg l for each element and the correlation coefficient of the calibration curve was higher than 0 9999 in addition sample solutions having complicated matrices were not used and no significant interference of matrices was observed the cs removal results were calculated based on the following equations 1 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q t m g g c 0 c t v m 2 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y r c 0 c t c 0 100 3 d i s t r i b u t i o n c o e f f i c i e n t k d m l g c 0

the experiments 2 3 1 effect of solution ph on cs adsorption the effect of ph on cs adsorption was determined by changing ph of the cs solution from 2 0 to 12 0 here 0 3 g of modified slag was added to the different ph 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 12 0 adjusted 30 ml solution 100 mg l the agitation time was considered 120 min to reach at the equilibrium conditions 2 3 2 effect of reaction time and kinetic studies for determining the effect of reaction time on cs adsorption 1 0 g of modified bio slag was added with 100 ml of adsorbtae solution 100 mg l and the conical flask was shaken for 360 min supernatants about 3 ml were taken at preordered time period and the concentration of cs was measured the obtained experimental data were used to investigate the adsorption kinetic by using the widely used lagergren pseudo first order kinetic model 35 pseudo second order 36 and intra partical diffusion model 37 the linearized form of these models was shown in below 4 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t l i n e a r f o r m 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t l i n e a r f o r m 5 q t k i d t 1 2 c where t min is the reaction time k 1 m i n 1 and k 2 g m g 1 m i n 1 are adsorption rate constants for first order and second order kinetic model respectively k i d m g g 1 m i n 1 2 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant q e and q t indicate the adsorption quantity of ions by the adsorbent at the equilibrium condition and the time t respectively the first order rate constant is computed from the slope of the log q e q t versus t the second order rate constant is obtained from the intercept of t q t and t the intra particle diffusion rate constant is acheived from the linear plot of q t versus t 1 2 2 3 3 initial cs concentration and equilibrium studies a fixed amount of modified bio slag 0 30 g was incorporated to the 30 ml of different concentrated cs solution 20 800 mg l under the equilibrium time and at the most favorable adsorption ph to determine the consequence of primary cs concentration on the cs uptake the achievd adsorption data were used to investigate the widely practiced different isotherms models such as the langmuir isotherm 38 the freundlich isotherm 39 and the temkin isotherm 40 the linearized forms of these isotherms are as below 7 l a n g m u i r i s o t h e r m c e q e 1 q m c e 1 q m k l 8 f r e u n d l i c h i s o t h e r m l o g q e l o g k f 1 n

respectively the q m m g g a n d k l l mg are the langmuir constant which represents the highest quantity of cs adsorption and the energy of adsorption respectively the q m a n d k l can be obtained from the intercept and slope of the linear plot with c e q e versus c e on the other hand k f l mg and 1 n are the freundlich constants which specify the adsorption capability and the adsorption intensity respectively these parametrs are computed from the linear plot of l o g q e versus l o g c e the degree of the exponent 1 n specifies the suitability of adsorption values of n where n 1 indicate the favourable adsorption conditions for temkin isotherm the values of b k j mol and a l g are calculated from the slope and intercept of the liner plot of q e versus ln c e r is the gas constant 8 314 10 3 k j mol and t is the absolute temperature k 2 3 4 effect of temperature and thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic indicators such as the gibbs free energy δ g the standard enthalpy change δ h and entropy change δ s were investigated by studying the adsorption process at the various temperatures 288 298 and 308 k to know the thermodynamic properties of the adsorption reaction the van t hoff equation 41 was used to calculated these parameters as below 10 l n k d δ h r t δ s r where kd ml g is the distribution coefficient in cs adsorption r is the universal gas constant 8 314 10 3 k j mol and t is the absolute temperature k the linear plot of of lnkd versus 1 t used to obtain the value of δ h and δ s then the gibbs free energy δ g can be obtained from the subsequent equation 11 δ g δ h t δ s 2 3 5 effect of competitive ions to evaluate the cs removal efficiency at the presence of competitive ions a fixed concentration 0 15 mm of cs solution was added with a wide range of concentration of na k ions solutions 5 300 mm at 25 0c temperature the optimum experimental conditions ph and reaction time were consider for this experiment 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of bio slag the bet surface area of the unmodified bio slag was 1 178 m2 g with a total pore volume of 0 003 cm3 g however the surface area and the total pore volume of the original slag drastically increased to 103 631 m2 g and 0 280 cm3 g respectively after the hydrothermal treatment the method exhibited the low surface area of the material compared to the sol gel fabricated mesoporous silica 42 43 hence it is expected that the higher surface area of modified bio slag has made it more favorable for cs adsorption the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms are shown in fig 1 according to the international union of the pure applied chemistry iupac classification system the majority of physisorption isotherms can be grouped into six types 44 the isotherm of the hydrothermal modified bio slag belongs to type iv with an h3 hysteresis loop which denoted that the allocation of the pore size of the modified material is like mesoporous however the non modified bio slag can be marked as isotherm types ii according to the iupac classification system which representing the non porous material therefore it is estimated that the surface area total pore volume opening of the channels enlargement of the space diameter and also the microporosity of the material have significantly increased due to the hydrothermal modification the morphological micrographs of the initial and treated bio slag are shown in fig 2 it can be percieved that the surface of the original bio slag was compact crystal structure and the modified bio slag showed a clear porous structure with thin channels it is clear that a significant difference was observed in the surface of the bio slag prior and subsequent to the modification as remarked by the arrows in fig 2 according to the xrf analysis the untreated and treated bio slag consist mainly of sio2 al2 o3 fe2o3 cr2o3 and p2o5 more than 95 by mass a small portion of al2o3 increased from 4 20 to 5 76 into the modified bio slag moreover the quantity of other oxides was also changed in modified bio slag during the modification the increase of the al2o3 can enhance the active sites in the zeolite structure which can exchange cs ions in solutions 45 46 the xrd pattern of the untreated and treated bio slag is shown in fig 3 the raw bio slag contains some mineralogical phases such as quartz eskolite albite gehlenite which are very commonly found in oxygen furnace slag coal fly ash as described by several researchers 7 46 47 however several synthetic zeolites were identified in hydrothermal modified bio slag by the xrd analysis as it is observed that the bio slag contains necessary portion of sio2 and al2o3 for the formation of zeolites therefore it can be estimated that in the alkali hydrothermal modification process the bio slag dissolved at higher temperature by hydroxyl ions oh in the next step condensation is occurred to form the aluminosilicate gel which is subsequently crystalized with the help of na and form the different artificial zeolites structure 28 48 3 2 the effect of ph on cs adsorption the adsorption of metals from aqueous phase decisively affected by the solution ph due to the protonation of metal ion e g speciation and deposition 10 49 the effect of ph on cs adsorption percentage by the proposed bio slag is shown in fig 4 it is obviously understood that the suitable cs uptake ph was between 4 0 to 10 0 however cs adsorption was seriously interrupted at lower ph 4 0 this observation could be clarified by two facts 9 10 i the competition of h3o with cs at acidic conditions ii the electrostatic repulsion occurred with positive ions between cs and h in solution on the contrary the cs adsorption was also notably influenced under alkaline state 10 0 possibly due to the creation of cesium hydroxide the negative ions of the cesium hydroxide cs oh 2 might be increased an electrostatic repulsion which inhibited the cs adsorption 10 50 hence the following

bio slag enhance the adsorption of cs 51 at the equilibrium condition the cs uptake was 1 995 9 457 and 27 818 mg g from 20 mg l 100 mg l and 400 mg l solution respectively the kinetic of uptake process illustrates the rate of cs uptake onto bio slag and the rate regulates the equilibrium time for adsorption the kinetics of the adsorption procedure is essential to know the most favorable working environment for the commercially applicable batch process the kinetic specification allow for understanding the rate of adsorption and also a guidline to design the process 52 the kinetic specifications and garph of the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra partical diffusion models are presented in table 1 and fig 5 b c and d it is observed that the analytical results were better agreement by the second order kinetic model with the high regression coefficient 0 999 1 000 compared with pseudo first order model 0 561 0 916 moreover the experimental values of qe for the second order kinetic model are near to the computed values of qe in contrast the calculated values of qe were much lower than that of the experimental value for the first order kinetic model thus considering the value of regression coefficient r2 and the closeness the value of experimental and calculated qe it can be summarized that the second order kinetic model shows a optimum fit to explain

diffusion model is separated into three steps at the begining phase is fast adsorption by the outer surface followed by intra particle diffusion stage and finally the slow equilibrium stage which caused for the reason of the small adsorbate concentration left in solution consequently slowing down the intra particle diffusion 55 3 4 effect of the initial cs concentration and isotherm modeling the adsorption isotherm shows the allotment of the adsorbate molecules in the liquid phase and the adsorbents solid surface at the equilibrium conditions at the time of the uptake process 56 57 in this study the langmuir the freundlich and the temkin models were investigated and isotherm data of these models are demonstrated in table 2 according to the langmuir isotherm the highest cs adsorptions qm were obtained 51 02 51 02 and 49 51 mg g at the temperatures of 288 298 and 308 k respectively the regression co efficient r2 values were found to be 0 988 0 986 and 0 982 at 288 298 and 308 k respectively the higher r2 values confirm the validity of the langmuir model for the cs uptake the separation factor rl is one of the dimensionless parameter of langmuir isotherm the rl is defined as below 12 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where k l is the langmuir constant and c 0 is the maximum initial cs ions concentration mg l the adsorption process might be linear r l 1 favorable 0 r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 based on the r l value 19 58 the value of r l found to be 0 0137 0 0175 and 0 0204 at cs solution temperature of 288 298 and 308 k respectively which further confirmed the favorability of the langmuir isotherm the reassuring of the experimental data by the langmuir isotherm model specifies the homogenous character of the bio slag and also the formation of mono layer coverage of cs during adsorption process according to the assumption of this model for the freundlich isotherm the values of r 2 were 0 9872 0 9948 and 0 9868 at the temperature of 288 298 and 308 k respectively which ensured the favourability of the cs adsorption by the bio slag moreover the calculated values of n for the cs uptake were 2 76 2 81 and 2 89 mg g at 288 298 and 308 k respectively these values of n are in the limit of 1 n 10 which reflects the good adsorption properties 59 for temkin isotherm model the r 2 value at 288 k was 0 9271 which follow the model whereas at the higher temperature 298 k and 308 k temkin isotherm was inappropriate to explain the cs adsorption onto bio slag due to the lower r 2 value 0 8983 and 0 886 respectively as presented in table 2 according to the langmuir model the highest cs qm uptake of treated bio slag was 51 02 mg g the maximum cs adsorption is considerable larger than many other adsorbents derived from natural zeolites and clay minerals 60 65 as summarized in table 3 3 5 effect of the temperature and thermodynamic study the consequence of the temperature on cs removal efficiency by treated bio slag is shown in the fig 6 the performance of cs ions removal did not remarkably affected due to the changing of the temperature from 288 k to 308 k for the 20 100 and 400 mg l concentrated solution the thermodynamic parameters were identified to investigate the character of the cs ions adsorption on the surface of the bio slag thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy δ g kj mol standard enthalpy change δ h kj mol and standard entropy change δ s j k mol were calculated from the equation 10 and 11 for 100 mg l cs solution at temperature from 288 k to 308 k the thermodynamic parameters are shown in table 4 the positive value of δ h 20 53 kj mol and δ s 0 021 kj mol k indicate the endothermic nature of cs ions adsorption on to bio slag moreover the positive value of δ g denotes that the adsorption reaction is non spontaneous moreover it is also observed that the values of δg were found to reduce as the temperature amplified signifying the lesser amount of driving force which the consequence of less adsorption performance 3 6 effect of competitive ions selective elimination of cs ion is one of the important factors for the practical application of an adsorbent for the real radioactive wastewater treatment where different salts enriched seawater used as cooling water at the npp 9 10 it is well known that the target metal ions adsorption depend on the contest between the adsorbing ions and competing ions moreover the adsorbing sites of the adsorbents can be surrounded by the competing ions during adsorption process which causes the fractional drop their charge and reduce the necessary energy by an electrostatic attraction 58 the cs adsorption efficiency in the presence of diverse competitive ions na k is shown in the fig 7 the results clearly points out that the company of large amount of na up to 300 mm has no remarkable negative influence on cs adsorption by bio slag similarly there was no serious adverse effect was observed for the presence of k ions up to 50 mm more than 97 of cs was removed at the coexistence of k up to this concentration level however when the coexistence of the k ions was increased above the 50 mm the removal efficiency of cs gradually decreased it needs to be noted that a fixed concentration of cs 0 15 mm was used with the variable concentration of na and k in this experiment the cs adsorption was faintly affected in the existence of k since the hydration radius of k 3 3 å is near to the cs 3 25 å than that of the other cation of na 3 6 å 58 59 the optimum cs removal performance of modified bio slag at the presence of na and k is comparatively better than the other adsorbents as they reports 9 10 56 4 conclusions in this study the cs removal performance onto modified bio salg from liquid phase was experimented and the adsorption isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics were discussed in details the physicochemical analysis of the materials by xrd xrf fesem and bet analysis indicated that the bio slag effectively transformed to the artificial powerful zeolites which enhance the cs adsorption properties of modified slag the rapid cs adsorption reation strongly depends on the adsorbate solution ph the adsorption data of cs by modified bio slag storongly obeyed by the second order kinetic model r2 0 999 1 0 which specify that the adsorption process was dominated by the chemical reaction in the first phase then proceeded by pore diffusion and equilibrium in the last stage of the adsorption process equilibrium adsorption parameters were better fitted to langmuir and freundlich model in comparison with the temkin isotherm the highest monolayer adsorption capability of modified bio slag was 51 02 mg g at 25 c moreover the changing of the temperature did not remarkable affect the cs removal performance although slightly decreased at higher temperature the thermodynamic parameters revealed that the character of adsorption operation was endothermic and non spontaneous the modified bio slag is highly effective to capture cs even in the existence of the competitive ions like na and k at their wide range of concentrations up to 300 mm although higher concentration of k affected the cs adsorption based on the findings of this study it is expected that the suitable hydrothermal treatment could improve the amount of zeolites portion into modified bio slag which could be applied for real radioactive wastewater treatment in future declaration of competing interest all authors are confirming that there is no conflict of interest of this work acknowledgements we are thankful to dr
