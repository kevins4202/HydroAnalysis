13970,performance of rotating packed bed rpb contactor in the removal of nickel from water was investigated from two aspects i effect of operating parameters and ii effect of mode of operation the results showed that the performance of rpb was highly governed by the rotational speed and activated carbon dosage the increase in centrifugal force generated by the rpb from 200 rpm 875 rpm was found to displace the activated carbon to the outer side of the rpb which reduced the liquid flow path length and contact time between the packed bed and nickel solution and this reduced the removal efficiency nevertheless a further increase in rotational speed from 875 rpm to 1200 rpm improved the removal efficiency as the enhancement in mass transfer process had outperformed the effect given by reduced path length higher activated carbon dosage also improved rpb performance by providing higher number of adsorption sites as well as improving the packing density of the packed bed which minimized the reduced path length effect the study also revealed that the mode of operation for a rpb contactor has crucial impact on the nickel adsorption the removal efficiency was found to follow the sequence of multiple cycle mode operation batch mode operation continuous mode operation as a result of better contact time and consistent contact between the solution and the packed bed keywords nickel rotating packed bed operating parameters mode of operation rotating speed 1 introduction nickel is one of the hazardous heavy metals which can enter the environment through two ways i natural resources such as weathering of minerals and rocks and ii geothermal emissions and anthropogenic activities nickel can be released into the water bodies via effluent from various activities such as nickel electroplating industry battery industry mining industry and refineries 1 3 the presence of low amount of nickel in natural water can cause high toxicity to human 4 and lead to chronic disorder such as gastrointestinal distress skin dermatitis renal edema pulmonary fibrosis and lung and kidney damage 5 according to world health organization 6 the tolerance limit for nickel is 0 02 mg l therefore a proper treatment method for removing nickel from water is necessary before the industrial effluent is discharged to the environment as a divalent heavy metal nickel can be removed from water wastewater through a number of techniques such as solvent extraction 7 chemical precipitation 8 membrane separation 9 10 and electrolysis 11 however it is worth noting that these removal methods are normally suffer from drawbacks such as high operational cost high energy consumption membrane fouling issue and the disposal of toxic metal sludge 12 13 in contrast adsorption which is a process that an adsorbate is attracted and retained on the surface of an adsorbent is a preferred method due to its simplicity reduced operational cost and minimum waste disposal 2 adsorption process is one of the most effective methods for the removal of heavy metals and organic compounds in water and wastewater treatment however as the volume of water to be treated in a treatment plant is generally large a large amount of activated carbon is often required 14 which is the main drawback for adsorption process therefore another technique that can provide good adsorption for high volume of effluent at smaller reactor size is to be investigated it is reported that enhanced mass transfer can be achieved with the aid of a centrifugal force field through high gravimetric technology higee the mass transfer process is carried out in a doughnut shaped bed known as rotating packed bed rpb the rpb designed by ramshaw and mallinson 15 is rotated at high speed to achieve high centrifugal force that is several times higher in magnitude than the gravitational force due to the elevated force very tiny droplets and or thin liquid films are created in the packing therefore the gas liquid or liquid liquid interfaces are renewed constantly and this provides considerable intensification of mass transfer between the phases through mixing 16 several advantages are reported for this system such as higher throughput of thinner liquid film over the packing which in turn results in improved external mass transfer lower static holdup and better distribution of liquid over the packing 14 these enhancements aid in reducing the size of the processing equipment significantly in comparison to a conventional packed bed therefore it is likely to reduce the overall cost of the process 15 17 the use of rpb contactor has been reported to give promising results for liquid gas processes such as co2 capture 18 20 h2s absorption 21 volatile organic compounds removal from air stream 22 and degradation of nitrobenzene 23 several studies also reported that the application of rpb in water and wastewater treatment is feasible for the removal of ammonium 24 phenol 25 dyes 26 27 pesticides 28 and heavy metals 14 29 nevertheless it is worth noting that the investigation on the application of this process in liquid solid system is still relatively scarce the objective of this study was to investigate the performance of rpb contactor in the removal of nickel from water using commercial activated carbon the effect of different operating parameters such as initial nickel concentration feed rate rotating speed and activated carbon dosage on the adsorption of nickel in rpb contactor was evaluated in addition the effect of three modes of operation for rpb contactor on nickel adsorption namely batch mode continuous mode and multiple cycle mode was also investigated in this study 2 methodology 2 1 materials commercial granular coconut shell activated carbon pellets of size 0 5 cm were used as the adsorbent in this study nickel nitrate hexahydrate nitric acid and sodium hydroxide were of analytical grades and were supplied by r m chemicals the nickel solution was prepared by dissolving nickel nitrate hexahydrate into deionized water depending on the experiments the ph of the solution was adjusted using nitric acid or sodium hydroxide 2 2 rotating packed bed contactor fig 1 shows the setup of the rpb contactor the doughnut shaped packed bed reactor is connected to a 0 5 hp motor for the rotating process gravitational force generation on the basis of the arithmetic mean radius the height of the reactor bed is 2 5 cm with an annulus space of 1 2 cm wide for the placement of the activated carbon as shown in fig 1 the sides of the inner and outer walls are made of 50 μm opening stainless steel mesh for nickel solution to flow out from the contactor while retaining the activated carbon bed 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 effect of operating parameters a mass of activated carbon was weighed and was transferred into the rpb contactor the contactor was then connected to the motor box as shown in fig 1 the motor was switched on for the rotation of the contactor then 1 l of nickel solution was placed in a reservoir and the solution was transferred into the contactor via the liquid injector through a peristaltic pump at specific feed rate the solution that passed through the rpb was recycled back to the reservoir this operation was conducted for one hour after the experiment a volume of 1 ml aqueous sample was taken from the reservoir and the nickel concentration was analyzed the effect of operating parameters was investigated via two sets of experiments firstly the effect of solution ph was evaluated at a range of 2 12 while the other operating parameters were held constant at level 0 as shown in table 1 the solution ph that provided the best nickel adsorption was further applied in the second section which was to evaluate the performance of rpb at different operating parameters namely i initial concentration ii feed rate iii rotating speed and iv activated carbon dosage these were evaluated using response surface methodology box behnken design response surface methodology rsm is a statistical technique for the analysis and modeling of problems in which the response outcome is influenced by several variables 30 rsm requires less number of experiments in comparison to factorial experiment design and the analysis of variance anova can provide an approximation for the true functional relationship between the independent variables and the response in the form of polynomial equation as shown in eq 1 where y is the response β is the regression coefficient and x is the independent parameter 30 based on the ranges and levels of the parameters in table 1 29 experiments were suggested for box behnken design the experimental sequence and the results are as shown in table 2 1 y β 0 i 1 3 β i x i i 1 3 β i i x i 2 i 1 2 j i 1 3 β i j x i x j 2 3 2 effect of mode of operation the effect of mode of operation on the removal of nickel from water using rpb was carried out using the optimum parameters that were obtained from the study in section 2 3 1 three operational modes were investigated namely i batch mode ii continuous mode and iii multiple cycle mode the procedure for batch mode operation was elaborated in section 2 3 1 for continuous mode operation the activated carbon dosage was weighed and was transferred into the rpb contactor the reactor was then connected to the motor box and was rotated then 1 l of nickel solution was transferred from the reservoir into the contactor via the liquid injector through a peristaltic pump the solution was passed through the rpb and was collected in another beaker instead of recycling back to the reservoir the experiment ended when all the solution in the reservoir had passed through the rpb a volume of 1 ml aqueous sample was taken and the nickel concentration was analyzed for multiple cycle mode operation the nickel solution was passed through the rpb and was collected in another beaker until all the solution in the reservoir had passed through the rpb then 1 ml of aqueous sample was taken after that the solution was directed into the rpb again for another cycle of adsorption operation this procedure was repeated for five cycles 2 4 analytical method the aqueous samples which were taken were diluted and acidified with diluted hno3 solution the concentrations of nickel in the samples were then analyzed by inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the measurement was conducted in triplicates and the mean was recorded from the nickel concentrations obtained from the aqueous samples the removal efficiency can be calculated using equation 2 where ci is the initial nickel concentration in the aqueous sample mg l cf is the final nickel concentration in the aqueous sample mg l 2 removal efficiency c i c f c i 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of solution ph the investigation on the effect of solution ph on nickel adsorption using rpb was conducted at level 0 operating conditions table 1 using batch mode operation the ph range investigated was set from acidic condition ph 2 6 to alkaline condition ph 8 12 the results as shown in fig 2 a illustrate that the increase in solution ph from 2 to 4 increases the removal efficiency from 2 to 14 nevertheless it is worth noting that further increase of solution ph from 4 to 6 only increases the removal efficiency slightly to 16 this observation can be explained by the eh ph diagram for nickel as shown in fig 2b 31 where nickel is normally present in divalent cationic form at low ph condition ph 2 6 it will be more favorable for cationic nickel to adsorb on the negative charged activated carbon however the adsorption was found to be poor at highly acidic condition ph 2 mainly due to the competitive adsorption between hydrogen ions and nickel ions as well as because of the protonation of the activated carbon surface which hinders the adsorption of cations 32 33 these mechanisms were mitigated at a higher ph condition of 4 6 as a result of low competition by the hydrogen ions on the adsorption thereby the adsorption of nickel was improved in contrast a further increase in solution ph to alkaline condition ph 8 12 is found to achieve nearly 100 removal efficiency nevertheless the main removal mechanism at these phs is the precipitation of water insoluble nickel hydroxide instead of adsorption 32 33 this is well supported by the eh ph diagram in fig 2b whereby nickel is mainly in the form of water insoluble compounds at high ph condition 31 therefore it can be concluded that the nickel adsorption was best at the ph range of 4 6 the subsequent study was investigated at solution ph of 4 5 5 5 fig 2 a effect of ph on the removal of nickel from water using rpb contactor b eh ph diagram for nickel water system at 25 c 31 3 2 effect of operating parameters on the performance of rotating packed bed contactor four operating parameters were investigated using the response surface methodology box behnken design which were i initial concentration ii feed rate of the solution into the rpb iii rotating speed of the rpb and iv activated carbon dosage the experimental results were analyzed statistically using anova and the results were evaluated based on the mathematical model generated from rsm 3 2 1 analysis of variance anova the anova for the experimental results is as shown in table 3 the model has an f value of 28 85 with probability f of less than 0 0001 this indicates that the mathematical model generated has significant confidence level of 99 as there is only 0 01 chance that the f value this large could occur due to noise the lack of fit for this model is not significant as there is 12 23 chance that the f value this large could occur due to noise which further indicates that the experimental data fits the model well among the parameters initial concentration a rotating speed c and activated carbon dosage d show relatively higher effect in comparison to feed rate b as they have lower probability f value 0 0001 table 3 also shows that the goodness of fit of the data is justified via a close predicted r2 and adjusted r2 with a difference of less than 0 2 lastly an adequate precision of 19 734 for this model further confirms the adequacy of the model the validity of the model is further strengthened by linear normal probability plot and close predicted results and actual results as shown in fig 3 a and b respectively thus the mathematical model generated is valid and is suitable to be used for navigation on the effect of operating parameters on the removal efficiency the mathematical model is as shown in eq 3 where a b c and d are the coded factors for initial concentration feed rate rotating speed and activated carbon dosage respectively with the level range of 1 to 1 3 removal efficiency 14 74 8 45 a 2 26 b 5 91 c 9 90 d 4 32 a 2 8 63 c 2 5 91 a d 5 28 c d 3 2 2 effect of operating parameters on the removal efficiency fig 4 a illustrates the effect of initial concentration on nickel removal efficiency the results show that the increase in initial concentration from 50 mg l to 150 mg l reduces the removal efficiency from 27 51 to 10 61 this was mainly due to higher competition between the amount of nickel to be adsorbed on limited adsorption sites at higher initial concentration 25 the percentage of nickel that can be adsorbed was reduced and this consequently reduced the removal efficiency nevertheless it was worth noting that the nickel uptake by the activated carbon in rpb was increased from 1719 38 mg kg to 1989 38 mg kg when the initial concentration was increased from 50 mg l to 150 mg l as more nickel was readily adsorbed in contrast the increase in feed rate from 20 l h to 50 l h is found to slightly improve the removal efficiency from 12 48 to 17 00 as shown in fig 4b this observation was in line with the works of chang and lee 28 and kundu et al 14 which also operated the rpb in batch mode operation as the system was operated with flow circulation the increase in feed rate will improve the total contact time and mixing between the nickel solution and the activated carbon which enhanced the rate of effective collision for better adsorption efficiency 14 28 nevertheless the effect of feed rate was relatively lower in comparison to other parameters as shown in fig 4 the use of centrifugal force in an rpb is often reported to improve mass transfer diffusion rate by forming tiny liquid droplets which not only decreases the diffusion distance between the packed bed and the solution 24 but also enlarges the liquid solid area for enhancing effective intraparticle diffusion and wetting efficiency of the system 25 28 however a different trend was observed in this study fig 4c shows that the increase of rotating speed from 200 rpm to 875 rpm reduces the removal efficiency from 29 27 to 13 72 then a further increase from 875 rpm to 1200 rpm improves the removal efficiency from 13 72 to 17 46 this could be due to the effect of rotating speed on two aspects i the reduce in liquid flow path length and contact time for adsorption due to the displacement of activated carbon in the packed bed and ii enhancement in mass transfer by centrifugal force 14 25 29 the exert of centrifugal force in the rpb system displaced the activated carbon bed to the outer wall of the rpb the formation of the cone in the rpb bed caused uneven thickness of the activated carbon bed and this reduced the path length for the liquid flow within the packed bed 14 29 especially the upper layer of the bed as shown in fig 5 the reduced path length for the bed and liquid hold up reduced the contact time between the activated carbon and nickel solution 25 at low rotational speed of 200 rpm 875 rpm the effect given by liquid flow path length decrement had outperformed the increase in mass transfer coefficient by centrifugal force and thus the removal efficiency was decreased nevertheless the removal efficiency was found to increase again when the rotational speed was increased from 875 rpm to 1200 rpm it was suggested that the decrement in liquid flow path length had reached a stable condition at 875 rpm further increase in the rotation speed provided higher centrifugal force which enhanced the effective collision rate for adsorption in this case the improve in mass transfer had outperformed the effect of liquid flow path length decrement 14 29 thus higher removal efficiency was achieved the increase in activated carbon dosage from 3 g to 13 g is found to improve the removal efficiency from 4 84 to 24 64 as shown in fig 4d the increase in activated carbon dosage in the rpb provided higher number of adsorption sites and contact surface area for higher adsorption rate nevertheless the improvement given by activated carbon dosage was dependent on the rotational speed of the rpb this is well observed in the interaction effect between the rotational speed and activated carbon dosage on the removal efficiency as shown in fig 6 the removal efficiency is improved from 14 09 to 44 45 when the activated carbon dosage is increased from 3 g to 13 g at 200 rpm on the other hand the improvement was found to increase from 12 85 to 22 07 only at similar increment in activated carbon dosage when the system was operated at 1200 rpm higher removal enhancement at low rotational speed could be due to the fact that the increase in activated carbon dosage not only provided more adsorption sites but also provided higher packing density of the carbon bed which reduced the effect of the liquid flow path length and contact time reduction in the rpb as a result of centrifugal force 29 in contrast the enhancement given by high packing density was relatively lower at higher rotational speed this suggested that the interaction effect between the activated carbon dosage and rotational speed were the crucial factors that must be considered in designing a rotating packed bed contactor 3 2 3 validation of the model an experiment was conducted to validate the accuracy of the model based on the optimum operating conditions suggested by the software the operating conditions are as shown in table 4 the experimental result showed that a removal efficiency of 36 30 was achieved whereby the predicted removal efficiency was at 38 12 thus the mathematical model generated is validated as there is a close agreement between the predicted result and the experimental result 3 3 effect of modes of operations the effect of different modes of operation on removal of nickel from water using rpb was investigated under three configurations namely i batch mode ii continuous mode and iii multiple cycle mode using the operating conditions that are shown in table 4 the experimental results were tabulated based on the contact time between the solution and the rpb where the time required for a fully single pass of the nickel solution through the rpb was 1 2 min fig 7 suggests that multiple cycle mode has the highest removal efficiency 21 22 followed by batch mode 17 61 and continuous mode 9 00 the difference in removal efficiency may be attributed to the effective contact time between the nickel solution and the rpb under similar operating conditions continuous mode operation provided relatively lower contact time of 1 2 min in comparison to batch mode and multiple cycle mode which were operated for 9 min and 6 min respectively the contact time is the crucial factor for the adsorption process as it governs the effective collision rate between nickel and activated carbon this is well observed in the results whereby the removal efficiencies are in the range of 9 11 for all the three modes when their contact times are similar at 1 2 min as shown in fig 7 the prolonged contact time in batch mode and multiple cycle mode improved nickel adsorption onto the activated carbon bed in the rpb this is in line with chang and lee 28 who reported that the liquid hold up time contact time plays crucial role in the performance of rpb nevertheless it was also found that the use of multiple cycle mode showed higher removal efficiency at 21 22 in comparison to batch mode at 17 61 at shorter contact time as shown in fig 7 higher increment in the removal efficiency is observed in multiple cycle mode in comparison to batch mode regardless of contact time this was probably due to the effective contact between the solution and the activated carbon unlike batch mode operation the use of multiple cycle ensured all nickel solution had passed through the rpb and contacted with the activated carbon for nickel adsorption in contrast the use of batch mode may have caused isolated regions in the reservoir which is not contacted with rpb throughout the experiment as shown in fig 8 this may cause concentration polarization at the respective regions and therefore lower removal efficiency was obtained 4 conclusions the removal of nickel from water has been successfully carried out using a rpb contactor the study revealed that the rotational speed and activated carbon dosage played the most important roles in affecting nickel adsorption in an rpb system at low rotational speed 200 rpm 875 rpm the centrifugal force did not provide improvement to adsorption instead it decreased the thickness and liquid flow path length of the carbon bed which further reduced the contact time between the bed and nickel solution eventually the removal efficiency in contrast higher rotational speed 875 rpm 1200 rpm was found to improve nickel adsorption as the reduction in bed thickness and liquid flow path length had reached a stable condition and further increase in centrifugal force improved the effective collision rate between nickel and the activated carbon bed this condition can also be improved using higher activated carbon dosage as it not only provided higher number of active sites for adsorption but also improved the packing density which minimized the bed thickness reduction under centrifugal force from the view of mode of operation multiple cycle operation showed better performance 21 22 in 6 min due to its advantages of more consistent contact between the solution and the packed bed and higher contact time than batch operation 17 61 in 9 min and continuous operation 9 in 1 2 min respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the

13970,performance of rotating packed bed rpb contactor in the removal of nickel from water was investigated from two aspects i effect of operating parameters and ii effect of mode of operation the results showed that the performance of rpb was highly governed by the rotational speed and activated carbon dosage the increase in centrifugal force generated by the rpb from 200 rpm 875 rpm was found to displace the activated carbon to the outer side of the rpb which reduced the liquid flow path length and contact time between the packed bed and nickel solution and this reduced the removal efficiency nevertheless a further increase in rotational speed from 875 rpm to 1200 rpm improved the removal efficiency as the enhancement in mass transfer process had outperformed the effect given by reduced path length higher activated carbon dosage also improved rpb performance by providing higher number of adsorption sites as well as improving the packing density of the packed bed which minimized the reduced path length effect the study also revealed that the mode of operation for a rpb contactor has crucial impact on the nickel adsorption the removal efficiency was found to follow

nickel rotating packed bed operating parameters mode of operation rotating speed 1 introduction nickel is one of the hazardous heavy metals which can enter the environment through two ways i natural resources such as weathering of minerals and rocks and ii geothermal emissions and anthropogenic activities nickel can be released into the water bodies via effluent from various activities such as nickel electroplating industry battery industry mining industry and refineries 1 3 the presence of low amount of nickel in natural water can cause high toxicity to human 4 and lead to chronic disorder such as gastrointestinal distress skin dermatitis renal edema pulmonary fibrosis and lung and kidney damage 5 according to world health organization 6 the tolerance limit for nickel is 0 02 mg l therefore a proper treatment method for removing nickel from water is necessary before the industrial effluent is discharged to the environment as a divalent heavy metal nickel can be removed from water wastewater through a number of techniques such as solvent extraction 7 chemical precipitation 8 membrane separation 9 10 and electrolysis 11 however it is worth noting that these removal methods are normally suffer from drawbacks such as high operational cost high energy consumption membrane fouling issue and the disposal of toxic metal sludge 12 13 in contrast adsorption which is a process that an adsorbate is attracted and retained on the surface of an adsorbent is a preferred method due to its simplicity reduced operational cost and minimum waste disposal 2 adsorption process is one of the most effective methods for the removal of heavy metals and organic compounds in water and wastewater treatment however as the volume of water to be treated in a treatment plant is generally large a large amount of activated carbon is often required 14 which is the main drawback for adsorption process therefore another technique that can provide good adsorption for high volume of effluent at smaller reactor size is to be investigated it is reported that enhanced mass transfer can be achieved with the aid of a centrifugal force field through high gravimetric technology higee the mass

higher throughput of thinner liquid film over the packing which in turn results in improved external mass transfer lower static holdup and better distribution of liquid over the packing 14 these enhancements aid in reducing the size of the processing equipment significantly in comparison to a conventional packed bed therefore it is likely to reduce the overall cost of the process 15 17 the use of rpb contactor has been reported to give promising results for liquid gas processes such as co2 capture 18 20 h2s absorption 21 volatile organic compounds removal from air stream 22 and degradation of nitrobenzene 23 several studies also reported that the application of rpb in water and wastewater treatment is feasible for the removal of ammonium 24 phenol 25 dyes 26 27 pesticides 28

while the other operating parameters were held constant at level 0 as shown in table 1 the solution ph that provided the best nickel adsorption was further applied in the second section which was to

conditions table 1 using batch mode operation the ph range investigated was set from acidic condition ph 2 6 to alkaline condition ph 8 12 the results as shown in fig 2 a illustrate that the increase in solution ph from 2 to 4 increases the removal efficiency from 2 to 14 nevertheless it is worth noting that further increase of solution ph from 4 to 6 only increases the removal efficiency slightly to 16 this observation can be explained by the eh ph diagram for nickel as shown in fig 2b 31 where nickel is normally present in divalent cationic form at low ph condition ph 2 6 it will be more favorable for cationic nickel to adsorb on the negative charged activated carbon however the adsorption was found to be poor at highly acidic condition ph 2 mainly due to the competitive adsorption between hydrogen ions and nickel ions as well as because of the protonation of the activated carbon surface which hinders the adsorption of cations 32 33 these mechanisms were mitigated at a higher ph condition of 4 6 as a result of low competition by the hydrogen ions on the adsorption thereby the adsorption of nickel was improved in contrast a further increase in solution ph to alkaline condition ph 8 12 is found to achieve nearly 100 removal efficiency nevertheless the main removal mechanism at these phs is the precipitation of water insoluble nickel hydroxide instead of adsorption 32 33 this is well supported by the eh ph diagram in fig 2b whereby nickel is mainly in the form of water insoluble compounds at high ph condition 31 therefore it can be concluded that the nickel adsorption was best at the ph range of 4 6 the subsequent study was investigated at solution ph of 4 5 5 5 fig 2 a effect of ph on the removal of nickel from water using rpb contactor b eh ph diagram for nickel

that the experimental data fits the model well among the parameters initial concentration a rotating speed c and activated carbon dosage d show relatively higher effect in comparison to feed rate b as they have lower probability f value 0 0001 table 3 also shows that the goodness of fit of the data is justified via a close predicted r2 and adjusted r2 with a difference of less than 0 2 lastly an adequate precision of 19 734 for this model further confirms the adequacy of the model the validity of the model is further strengthened by linear normal probability plot and close predicted results and actual results as shown in fig 3 a and b respectively thus the mathematical model generated is valid and is suitable to be used for navigation on the effect of operating parameters on the removal efficiency the mathematical model is as shown in eq 3 where a b c and d are the coded factors for initial concentration feed rate rotating speed and activated carbon dosage respectively with the level range of 1 to 1 3 removal efficiency 14 74 8 45 a 2 26 b 5 91 c 9 90 d 4 32 a 2 8 63 c 2 5 91 a d 5 28 c d 3 2 2 effect of operating parameters on the removal efficiency fig 4 a illustrates the effect of initial concentration on nickel removal efficiency the results show that the increase in initial concentration from 50 mg l to 150 mg l reduces the removal efficiency from 27 51 to 10 61 this was mainly due to higher competition between the amount of nickel to be adsorbed on limited adsorption sites at higher initial concentration 25 the percentage of nickel that can be adsorbed was reduced and this consequently reduced the removal efficiency nevertheless it was worth noting that the nickel uptake by the activated carbon in rpb was increased from 1719 38 mg kg to 1989 38 mg kg when the initial concentration was increased from 50 mg l to 150 mg l as more nickel was readily adsorbed in contrast the increase in feed rate from 20 l h to 50 l h is found to slightly improve the removal efficiency from 12 48 to 17 00 as shown in fig 4b this observation was in line with the works of chang and lee 28 and kundu et al 14 which also operated the rpb in batch mode operation as the system was operated with flow circulation the increase in feed rate will improve the total contact time and mixing between the nickel solution and the activated carbon which enhanced the rate of effective collision for better adsorption efficiency 14 28 nevertheless the effect of feed rate was relatively lower in comparison to other parameters as shown in fig 4 the use of centrifugal force in an rpb is often reported to improve mass transfer diffusion rate by forming tiny liquid droplets which not only decreases the diffusion distance between the packed bed and the solution 24 but also enlarges the liquid solid area for enhancing effective intraparticle diffusion and wetting efficiency of the system 25 28 however a different trend was observed in this study fig 4c shows that the increase of rotating speed from 200 rpm to 875 rpm reduces the removal efficiency from 29 27 to 13 72 then a further increase from 875 rpm to 1200 rpm improves the removal efficiency from 13 72 to 17 46 this could be due to the effect of rotating speed on two aspects i the reduce in liquid flow path length and contact time for adsorption due to the displacement of activated carbon in the packed bed and ii enhancement in mass transfer by centrifugal force 14 25 29 the exert of centrifugal force in the rpb system displaced the activated carbon bed to the outer wall of the rpb the formation of the cone in the rpb bed caused uneven thickness of the activated carbon bed and this reduced the path length for the liquid flow within the packed bed 14 29 especially the upper layer of the bed as shown in fig 5 the reduced path length for the bed and liquid hold up reduced the contact time between the activated carbon and nickel solution 25 at low rotational speed of 200 rpm 875 rpm the effect given by liquid flow path length decrement had outperformed the increase in mass transfer coefficient by centrifugal force and thus the removal efficiency was decreased nevertheless the removal efficiency was found to increase again when the rotational speed was increased from 875 rpm to 1200 rpm it was suggested that the decrement in liquid flow path length had reached a stable condition at 875 rpm further increase in the rotation speed provided higher centrifugal force which enhanced the effective collision rate for adsorption in this case the improve in mass transfer had outperformed the effect of liquid flow path length decrement 14 29 thus higher removal efficiency was achieved the increase in activated carbon dosage from 3 g to 13 g is found to improve the removal efficiency from 4 84 to 24 64 as shown in fig 4d the increase in activated carbon dosage in the rpb provided higher number of adsorption sites and contact surface area for higher adsorption rate nevertheless the improvement given by activated carbon dosage was dependent on the rotational speed of the rpb this is well observed in the interaction effect between the rotational speed and activated carbon dosage on the removal efficiency as shown in fig 6 the removal efficiency is improved from 14 09 to 44 45 when the activated carbon dosage is increased from 3 g to 13 g at 200 rpm on the other hand the improvement was found to increase from 12 85 to 22 07 only at similar increment in activated carbon dosage when the system was operated at 1200 rpm higher removal enhancement at low rotational speed could be due to the fact that the increase in activated carbon dosage not only provided more adsorption sites but also provided higher packing density of the carbon bed which reduced the effect of the liquid flow path length and contact time reduction in the rpb as a result of centrifugal force 29 in contrast the enhancement given by high packing density was relatively lower at higher rotational speed this suggested that the interaction effect between the activated carbon dosage and rotational speed were the crucial factors that must be considered in designing a rotating packed bed contactor 3 2 3 validation of the model an experiment was conducted to validate the accuracy of the model based on the optimum operating conditions suggested by the software the operating conditions are as shown in table 4 the experimental result showed that a removal efficiency of 36 30 was achieved whereby the predicted removal efficiency was at 38 12 thus the mathematical model generated is validated as there is a close agreement between the predicted result and the experimental result 3 3 effect of modes of operations the effect of different modes of operation on removal of nickel from water using rpb was investigated under three configurations namely i batch mode ii continuous mode and iii multiple cycle mode using the operating conditions that are shown in table 4 the experimental results were tabulated based on the contact time between the solution and the rpb where the time required for a fully single pass of the nickel solution through the rpb was 1 2 min fig 7 suggests that multiple cycle mode has the highest removal efficiency 21 22 followed by batch mode 17 61 and continuous mode 9 00 the difference in removal efficiency may be attributed to the effective contact time between the nickel solution and the rpb under similar operating conditions continuous mode operation provided relatively lower contact time of 1 2 min in comparison to batch mode and multiple cycle mode which were operated for 9 min and 6 min respectively the contact time is the crucial factor for the adsorption process as it governs the effective collision rate between nickel and activated carbon this is well observed in the results whereby the removal efficiencies are in the range of 9 11 for all the three modes when their contact times are similar at 1 2 min as shown in fig 7 the prolonged contact time in batch mode and multiple cycle mode improved nickel adsorption onto the activated carbon bed in the rpb this is in line with chang and lee 28 who reported that the liquid hold up time contact time plays crucial role in the performance of rpb nevertheless it was also found that the use of multiple cycle mode showed higher removal efficiency at 21 22 in comparison to batch mode at 17 61 at shorter contact time as shown in fig 7 higher increment in the removal efficiency is observed in multiple cycle mode in comparison to batch mode regardless of contact time this was probably due to the effective contact between the solution and the activated carbon unlike batch mode operation the use of multiple cycle ensured all nickel solution had passed through the rpb and contacted with the activated carbon for nickel adsorption in contrast the use of batch mode may have caused isolated regions in the reservoir which is not contacted with rpb throughout the experiment as shown in fig 8 this may cause concentration polarization at the respective regions and therefore lower removal efficiency was obtained 4 conclusions the removal of nickel from water has been successfully carried out using a rpb contactor the study revealed that the rotational speed and activated carbon dosage played the most important roles in affecting nickel adsorption in an rpb system at low rotational speed 200 rpm 875 rpm the centrifugal force did not provide improvement to adsorption instead it decreased the thickness and liquid flow path length of the carbon bed which further reduced the contact time between the bed and nickel solution eventually the removal efficiency in contrast higher rotational speed 875 rpm 1200 rpm was found to improve nickel adsorption as the reduction in bed thickness and liquid flow path length had reached a stable condition and further increase in centrifugal force improved the effective collision rate between nickel and the activated carbon bed this condition can also be improved using higher activated carbon dosage as it not only provided higher number of active sites for adsorption but also improved the packing density which minimized the bed thickness reduction under centrifugal force from the view of mode of operation multiple cycle operation showed better performance 21 22 in 6 min due to its advantages of more consistent contact between the solution and the packed bed and higher contact time than batch operation 17 61 in 9 min and continuous operation 9 in 1 2 min respectively declaration of competing

13971,the dynamic biosorption of multi metal samples of copper and silver ions was studied in a fixed bed column employing an alternative biosorbent derived from brown seaweed three sets of assays were performed to investigate 1 the effects of the inlet flow rate and 2 the feed composition of the samples and 3 the selective ion desorption and regeneration of the bed the greater biosorption capacities 0 642 and 0 387 mmol g 1 for cu2 and ag and removal rates 79 47 and 55 37 were obtained in the lowest flow 0 5 ml min 1 the higher residence time is believed to be associated with more favorable mass transfer rates silver breakthrough curves evidenced the overshoot effect which demonstrated to be directly proportional to copper inlet concentration due to the higher affinity for cu2 cations the statistical analysis revealed that the initial concentration of the competitive metal is directly proportional to the biosorption capacity and inversely proportional to the breakthrough time the height of the mass transfer zone was not statistically influenced by the feed composition in this study high recovery rates of copper 99 8 and silver 90 7 were achieved with na2 edta and hno3 in selective desorption operation respectively a second biosorption cycle exhibited a considerable loss in biosorption capacity up to a breakthrough point keywords dynamic biosorption multi metal systems brown macro algae toxic metal removal wastewater treatment 1 introduction ionic copper and silver are lewis acids able to complex with oxygen sulfur and nitrogen compounds and take part in physiological and biochemical activities that may represent a threat to aquatic environments and human health 1 3 since these noble metals present similar properties of excellent thermal and electrical conductivity and high corrosion resistance they are employed in several common applications by electroplating electrical transport coin and jewelry industries copper silver alloys are employed in electrical and electronic devices production coins solders and jewelry manufacturing and their applications are also extended as anti microbial agents 4 7 silver is not reported as taking part in any physiologic or chemical process of any form of life and in human beings it can damage cellular respiration and oxidize cell components to free radicals these radicals are able to deteriorate lipids protein and dna 8 9 copper on the other hand is an essential metal to many animals including humans playing a key role in enzymatic synthesis and tissue and bone growth however it can damage cell membranes and accumulate in the liver brain pancreas and disrupt iron functions when at higher concentrations than the tolerable levels 10 12 the release of high amounts of silver and copper in the environment as a consequence of industrial activity is therefore a public health issue and calls the attention of scientists worldwide chemical precipitation electrochemical processes reverse osmosis and other membrane operations are alternatives to reduce metal concentration in water samples although they may be related to some technical and economic disadvantages 13 15 adsorption has been presented as a viable method to remove toxic metals from wastewater due to the capability of retrieving the pollutants efficiently even at very low concentrations 16 the use of alternative materials as adsorbents is not only able to reduce the costs of operation when compared to activated carbon but also to attribute new applications to the waste biomass as investigated by nishikawa et al 2018 17 the biosorption operation consists in employing inactive biomass such as marine algae able to restrain metal cations in functional groups present on the surface of cell components through physicochemical mechanisms 13 14 18 biosorption phenomenon is mainly attributed to the components of the cell wall which consists of cellulose based material with high protein content in green macroalgae sulfated polysaccharides in red and brown macroalgae and the alginic acid also in brown species 13 brown macroalgae from the genus sargassum have been extensively exploited in metal biosorption processes 10 14 although a few reports have recently investigated the potential of dealginated sargassum due to the presence of remaining alginic acid fucoidan and other chemicals in the external cell wall matrix of the biomass 19 20 freitas et al 2018 21 freitas et al 2019 22 and nascimento júnior et al 2019 23 have pointed out that oxygenated groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl ethers alcohols and sulphonic acids have taken part in binding cu2 and ag ions by ion exchange and complexation mechanisms fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and energy dispersive x ray spectrometry eds coupled with scanning electron microscopy sem corroborated the release of soft metal cations na in large amounts and ca2 in lower degree and a balance of chemical and physical interactions in the competitive system nascimento júnior 2019 24 observed the presence of cu and ag species on the surface of sargassum filipendula waste by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and the presence of the metals in zero oxidation state could not be discarded 25 many reports in the literature deal with batch adsorption operation since it is of great importance to evaluate how the parameters affect the adsorption equilibrium and kinetics 16 26 nonetheless batch systems are in general not able to treat large volumes of water and reach saturation with very diluted samples 27 continuous adsorption systems are still scarcely exploited by the literature and it is of major concern to comprehend mass transfer processes and the behavior of macro algae in saturation regeneration and washing cycles 28 29 packed bed columns are traditionally employed in continuous adsorption systems for the treatment of wastewater and groundwater at feasible times 30 the investigation of hydrodynamic behavior is important because the dynamic operation may present different characteristics than the exhibited in batch equilibrium particle size head loss feed composition and bed dimensions are to be considered in the bed design 31 32 multicomponent samples are expected to have its efficiency reduced for individual targeted compounds due to the competition the complexity of the system may also influence the process 30 data obtained in batch experiments often manifest inaccuracies to optimize packed bed reactors and practical information in terms of breakthrough curves is required 33 these curves exhibit the outlet adsorbate concentration profiles and the behavior of the mass transfer zone mtz where the adsorption rate is greater 32 the height of mzt is desirable to be as close as possible to zero which would indicate more favorable mass transfer rates 34 35 in general the scale up operation lasts until one of the pollutants reaches the breakthrough point thereafter it will not be able to assemble clean water at the top of the column 36 in this work the competitive binary biosorption of copper ii and silver i ions was studied in a packed bed column filled with dealginated brown seaweed waste what are the features regarding the behavior of competing silver and copper metal ions in dynamic biosorption would it be possible to retrieve silver and copper ions in two different outlet streams in order to be furtherly precipitated the effects of the inlet flow rate and the initial composition of the system were investigated in order to optimize the efficiency parameters of the bed selective desorption cycles for each metal ion were carried out in order to evaluate the recovery capability and regeneration of biosorbent for future large scale applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 biosorbent particles preparation the seaweed biomass was collected from the north coast of são paulo state brazil washed dried 60 c for 24 h and stored 4 c until use in order to perform the solid liquid extraction of alginate from the cell wall matrix the biomass was sieved 0 5 1 0 mm and mchugh 1987 37 method was employed the method consisted of a pre washing step of the sieved particles with formaldehyde ch2o 0 4 v v for 30 minutes and hydrochloric acid hcl 0 1 m for 120 minutes the extraction was performed with a sodium carbonate solution na2co3 2 for 5 h at 60 c to promote the dissolution of sodium alginate the waste of the extraction operation was dried 60 c for 24 h and undergone an acidification step as proposed by freitas et al 2018 21 then the biosorbent particles were dried and stored at room temperature the macro algae based biosorbent has been investigated previously by sem eds ftir 20 38 39 xps 40 gas picnometry mercury porosimetry and n2 physisorption 22 39 and the metal loaded biosorbent particles with copper and silver have been searched for sem eds ftir mercury porosimetry gas pycnometry 22 23 xps and thermogravimetric analysis 24 the authors have discussed the active functional groups and the possible mechanisms of adsorption along with the thermal properties and porosity of the material 2 2 multi metal synthetic samples metal samples were prepared from the nitrate salts cu no3 2 3h2o acquired from sinergia científica brazil and agno3 acquired from dinâmica brazil the methodology for quantification of metal ions employed atomic absorption spectroscopy shimadzu a 700 and all the samples were kept in dark vessels due to silver photosensitivity properties 4 41 the ph of the samples was adjusted before each experiment to less than 5 0 by adding hno3 0 1 m to assure the whole presence of cu2 ions according to its speciation characteristics 23 this step was carried out to avoid precipitation effects in the study 2 3 experimental setting a glass column 0 6 cm inner diameter 9 0 cm height operating upwards was filled with 0 26 g of biosorbent particles for each assay the samples were fed by a peristaltic pump masterflex into the bottom of the column and were collected at predefined intervals by an automatic fraction collector gilson fc203b at the top as shown in fig 1 a glass wool layer was used at the top of the column to pack the adsorbent before each assay deionized water was pumped into the column for 12 hours at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min in order to promote the biosorbent expansion the temperature was controlled at around 25 c by room cooling breakthrough curves c t c0 versus t were built to study the behavior of metal cations during the operation breakthrough conditions were set when the concentration of the respective metal ion reached 5 of the inlet concentration the efficiency of the column was assessed by biosorption capacities up to breakthrough and exhaustion qb and qe respectively removal rates until breakthrough and exhaustion rb and re and the mass zone transfer height mtz the efficiency parameters were calculated according to equations 1 5 1 q b c i q 1000 m b 0

saturation point min and hb is the bed height 9 cm for all experiments in reactor design it is desired that the mtz be as small as possible to maximize bed capacity but without decreasing dramatically particle size or increasing the pressure drop along the bed magnifying the undesirable effect of head loss 32 42 the selectivity of the metal ions equation 6 in the dynamic assays was calculated according to freitas et al 2018 43 and ruthven 1984 31 in order to discuss the effects of diffusional resistances and its dependence with the inlet flow rate 6 α a b q a q b c a c b where q is the total amount removed of each metal ion mmol g 1 and c is the equilibrium concentration when bed reaches exhaustion mmol l 1 a and b are the index for the metal species in the binary systems 2 4 effect of inlet flow rate in order to investigate the feasibility of breakthrough and saturation times and its dependence on the flow rate the biosorption assays were operated at 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 ml min 1 for 800 minutes the inlet flow rates were based on previous studies employing the biosorbent in single metal systems 21 39 44 breakthrough curves were built and efficiency parameters were calculated furthermore the volume removal rates were estimated up to the breakthrough point an important parameter for large scale operation 2 5 effect of feed composition in order to study the effect of the feed composition a 2² experimental planning was performed at the inlet flow rate selected by the previous assays the total concentration of metal cations 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mmol l 1 and molar fraction of each of them 25 50 and 75 were used as variables and the central point was performed in triplicate to estimate the experimental error the seven assays were carried out randomly for 1000 minutes and the data was analyzed in statistic experimental design the responses of the study were the time to reach the breakthrough point tb biosorption capacity up to saturation point qb and mtz height hmtz the inlet flow rate was previously investigated instead of being one of the variables in experimental planning design because of the lack of information about the behavior of the dynamic binary biosorption at the beginning of the assays since the influence degree of the inlet flow rates in the breakthrough times was unknown a slight variation in one of the parameters interacting with the inlet flow rate could provide a curve with breakthrough time very close to zero and the data could not be analyzed statistically in the studied range 2 6 selective desorption cycles to evaluate the regeneration of the biosorbent and selective recovery of metal ions two desorption cycles were performed after the biosorption assay under the conditions of the central point a previous study has demonstrated the efficiency of edta a chelating agent in recovering selectively copper ions from sargassum filipendula waste in batch mode 24 in addition nitric acid demonstrated superior efficiency in retrieving silver ions than other acids tested in the study for this reason two eluents were employed in selective desorption steps 1 na2edta 0 001 m and ca no3 2 0 001 m 2 hno3 1 0 m outlet concentrations of both metals were monitored at the top of the column until they reached the slopes of adsorption desorption a mass balance was used to calculate the recovery rates from the biosorption capacity 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of inlet flow rate breakthrough curves for the competitive binary biosorption are displayed in fig 2 the graphs exhibit the behavior of copper fig 2 a and silver fig 2 b dynamic biosorption separately at each flow rate in order to ease its insight it can be observed that copper breakthrough times fig 2a are typically greater than silver ones and the sigmoidal shape of the curves are elongated as expected indicating a considerable mass transfer resistance in the adsorption operation although they are not very different from a step function because exhaustion of the column is reached shortly after breakthrough point 45 46 copper breakthrough times were enhanced when q0 decreased since saturation is expected to be reached faster at higher flow rates due to the shorter residence time of adsorbate in the column silver curves fig 2b demonstrated a more complex behavior breakthrough times also increased when the inlet flow rate is decreased and the curves exhibited a closer profile to the step function than copper this result was not expected since the ag ion has a larger ionic radius and lower charge and should be associated with lower external mass transfer rates than cu2 ion 47 nonetheless this feature may be correlated to an excessive amount of silver released after breakthrough which caused c c0 to be higher than one until it reaches a maximum and starts to be reduced until saturation of both ions is reached this phenomenon is known as overshoot in multi component adsorption systems one previous adsorbed ion can be replaced by a competitive adsorbate that presents a higher affinity for the active sites via ion exchange mechanisms other works have reported cu2 replacing other metal cations in the active sites in dynamic systems with ag in bentonite clay 43 zn2 in vermiculite 48 ni2 in raw sargassum filipendula 49 cr3 in agar extraction waste 35 and in other multicomponent metal samples such as zn2 ni2 in red macro algae 28 it is well known that for an ion exchanger the properties of the ions such as charge electronegativity ionic radius molar content among others will influence the selectivity and binding strength since cu2 and ag ions are from the same chemical family they present similar properties e g electronegativity 2 0 and 1 9 respectively but also differ in some others cu2 cation is expected to exhibit higher diffusion rates since its radius is twice smaller 0 73 ǻ than ag 1 15 ǻ 47 additionally haug and smidsrod 1965 50 have reported that the guluronic acid one of alginic acids monomer exhibits higher selectivity for divalent cations due to the eggshell structure in alginate net oxygen groups such as carboxyl groups were pointed by nascimento júnior 2019 24 as the main binders in the operation with cu2 and ag ions and according to the hard soft acid bases hsab theory 2 copper ii is also favored by the active sites since it is a stronger electron acceptor according to fig 2 the overshoot effect seems to be intensified when the inlet flow rate decreases since residence time is expected to rise when q0 decreases longer contact time to retrieve silver ions is provided and consequently more occupied active sites for copper ion exchange according to oliveira and alfaya 2018 46 high flow rates to feed the column can also cause excessive packing of the particles leading to a partial blockage of active sites decreasing the adsorption capacity as a consequence in accordance with previous results reported in the literature the silver ions breakthrough is reached in shorter times freitas et al 2018 21 and freitas et al 2019 22 have found higher adsorption rates for silver in the modeling of single metal biosorption on sargassum filipendula waste the increase in the inlet flow rate is followed by a higher increment in ag adsorption rates from 0 028 to 0 037 l mmol 1 min 1 than the cu2 rate increment from 0 023 to 0 031 l mmol 1 min 1 then it is believed that the intraparticle mass transfer resistance is the rate limiting resistance for both ions since the operation was favored by slower q0 values 51 table 1 displays the efficiency parameters taken into consideration to select the inlet flow rate for further operation additionally it was calculated the treated volume rates up to breakthrough in relation to the total volume employed up to the exhaustion of the column vt according to the results presented in table 1 the highest qb and qe values were achieved when q0 0 5 ml min 1 as well as the highest removal rates up to the exhaustion of the column rb is expected to be close to 100 since it represents the removal rate up to the breakthrough point before the breakthrough point is reached it is expected that the bed delivers samples with very low levels of metal cations although it seemed to vary randomly for copper ions it decreased considerably for silver ions at 1 0 ml min 1 the mtz height for cu2 shrank when the inlet flow rate is lowered although it demonstrated to be optimized at q0 0 75 ml min 1 for silver ions regarding the selectivity of the column it can be observed that the increase in q0 promoted an increase in copper selectivity from 1 973 to 2 130 and then to 3 120 while silver selectivity decreased from 0 507 to 0 469 and then to 0 320 in general acute toxic levels of silver ions are achieved at lower concentrations for the living organisms than copper ones 52 54 and silver also represents a more valuable resource and therefore more claimed in recovery processes under these circumstances it is desired that α ag is to be as high as possible over α cu in the binary system freitas et al 2018 43 have reported a considerable decrease in α cu fixed bed binary biosorption on bentonite clay however α ag was not substantially enhanced when q0 was raised from 1 0 to 5 0 ml min 1 in a 1 4 x 14 cm cylindrical bed the treated volume rates were calculated based on volume spent up to tb for each metal and they displayed attractive rates for wastewater treatment for silver and copper respectively 64 24 and 49 75 of volume samples were able to reach acceptable disposal standards 54 operating up to the saturation of the column for these reasons the 0 5 ml min 1 inlet flow rate was selected for the later studies although it required longer operation times 273 and 155 minutes for copper and silver breakthrough respectively this condition can be considered a feasible response for scale up adsorption operation 27 freitas et al 2018 21 and freitas et al 2019 22 have studied silver and copper ions single biosorption in a 0 6 x 7 cm column and also obtained the best efficiency parameters for both metals at the same inlet flow rate 3 2 effect of feed composition breakthrough curves for the 2² experimental planning assays are exhibited in fig 3 the central point data were plotted comparatively in a single chart as it can be seen by the biosorption dynamic profiles tb values are shortened when metal feed concentrations are enhanced in the studied range of concentration this behavior is expected due to higher amounts of adsorbates available to bind active sites breakthrough curves for the central point assays are similar in shape and exhibited similar tb and te values guaranteeing the reproducibility of the experiments overshoot was once again noticed in all the curves however at lower levels when the relation between silver and copper feed concentrations is increased thus copper feed concentration is expected to have a positive effect on the removal rates of preabsorbed silver ions at a fixed silver feed concentration 49 55 freitas et al 2018 43 reported similar results for the dynamic binary adsorption of ag cu2 ions on verde lodo bentonite clay exhibiting curves where the overshoot effect was not even noticed at the highest relations between silver and copper feed concentration barquilha et al 2019 10 also reported similar effects in the dynamic binary adsorption of ni cu on sargassum sp from the breakthrough curves the efficiency parameters of each assay were calculated table 2 displays the studied variables according to each assay along with the responses obtained for the experimental planning statistical analysis pareto charts and response surfaces were generated for each one of the responses figs 4 and 5 for ag and cu2 ions for silver biosorption the statistical analyses demonstrated that both cations concentrations and also the interaction between them are statistically significant for tb and qb as responses fig 4a b although ag 0 presented to be the most significant in both cases cu2 0 and ag 0 cu2 0 also displayed considerable significance since tb and qb depend mostly on the binding rate of silver ions which was suggested to be linked to the overshoot and competition effects and thus to the competitive metal concentration nascimento júnior et al 2019 24 revealed that the equilibrium times of silver biosorption in batch systems were reasonably enhanced from 60 to 600 minutes at higher copper initial concentrations despite copper equilibrium times were not affected by silver initial concentration 75 minutes in kinetic experiments from the figs 4a and 4b it is possible to conclude that tb and qb are directly proportional to silver feed concentration while inversely proportional to cu2 0 only the interaction of the metal feed concentrations exhibited statistical significance in hmtz in the studied range according to the response surface analysis silver mtz height is increased when one of the metal feed concentrations is increased individually this suggests that either copper or silver feed concentration upturn is responsible to lower mass transfer rates however when both metal concentrations are raised the effect seems to cause lower mass transfer resistances what is evidenced is that the ion exchange process between silver and copper ions is present in all the extension of the experiment and since silver mtz moves faster than copper one along the column displaced silver ions are believed to bind other active sites before reaching the breakthrough point in the continuous operation this would explain why only after the breakthrough point silver outlet concentration is highly increased the feed concentration of both metals and their interaction also exhibited statistical significance in tb and qb responses for copper fig 5a b although differently from silver cu2 0 displayed much higher statistical significance in breakthrough times and similarly ag 0 for biosorption capacity this behavior is evidenced in the response surfaces at a fixed silver feed concentration for tb fig 5a and at a fixed copper concentration for qb fig 5b breakthrough time is inversely proportional and biosorption capacity is directly proportional to cu2 0 none of the variables presented statistical significance in copper hmtz and higher feed concentrations of both cations lead to greater heights as a result of inferior external mass transfer resistance fig 5c pure error for the experiments may be considered low for all the parameters freitas et al 2018 43 also reported a positive dependence on copper feed concentration and a negative dependence of silver feed concentration in breakthrough times in verde lodo bentonite clay the authors also reported the inversely proportional dependence of hmtz values and the total concentration of metals for column feed the experimental planning study revealed that the biosorption capacities up to breakthrough for both metal cations are influenced by the composition of the mixture total inlet concentration and molar fraction of each cation and the interaction of these variables silver profiles demonstrated to be more sensitive to the changes in feed composition corroborating with the competition for common active sites as pointed out by nascimento júnior et al 2019 24 according to the response surface analyses the biosorption capacity of a metal cation is positively influenced by the increase in its feed composition and the decrease of the competitive cation composition thus none of the metal cations inlet concentration was in excess in any of the assays in addition the selectivity of metal ions was calculated for the assays table 3 according to the equimolar assays 1 to 5 the enhancement in total inlet concentration of metals is known to cause higher selectivity of silver and lower α cu values even though the triplicate presented considerable differences among the values they were all intermediate among the results of assays 1 and 2 the lower and higher levels of experimental planning respectively the α cu dropped quite in non equimolar assays regardless of the fraction of copper in c0 25 and 75 similarly α ag presented maximum values at these assays and this effect seemed to be intensified when silver is at 75 assay 6 rather than 25 assay 7 as expected nascimento júnior et al 2019 24 have found that α ag values were magnified when the relation c0 ag c0 cu is enhanced which was easily explained by the higher diffusion rates and affinity with the functional groups of copper ions the result is that in batch systems copper ions will inhibit silver biosorption directly proportional to its concentration and also broadened the time to reach silver biosorption equilibrium when the biosorption is processed in a fixed bed column not only silver biosorption capacity is improved at more concentrated equimolar samples but it is also improved when there are lower or higher amounts of copper ions than silver ones preferably higher these results may indicate that copper presence induces silver biosorption instead of inhibiting it when the dynamic operation is handled with non equimolar samples which is often the case of real wastewater matrices in the dynamic adsorption of cu2 and ag onto bentonite clay freitas et al 2018 43 have found that α cu α ag is enhanced at higher copper molar fractions in inlet column samples and it is pointed out the inductive effect of silver ions presence in copper adsorption capacities contrarily muthusamy and venkatachalam 2015 51 have found inhibitory effects in zn ii cr vi biosorption on each other when compared to the single metal biosorption onto a biodiesel waste the effects can be synergic or antagonist when referring to multi component adsorption according to vilar et al 2008 35 the adsorption capacity of the metal components in a multimetal mixture will vary from the batch behavior since there are dissolved organics released during the operation these organics which are able to bind to active sites are carried out through the column flow in the dynamic operation this could explain why the selectivity of silver ions is altered differently when the composition of the mixture is altered in batch systems 24 the ph may also influence the results because in the dynamic operation the released h ions influence the ion interactions with the binding sites 51 3 3 selective desorption cycles and column regeneration two steps of desorption were carried out after saturation of the column was reached for both metal cations the eluents employed in each step were previously selected for copper na2edta 0 001 m ca no3 2 0 001 m and for remaining silver afterward hno3 1 0 m and their concentration optimized in batch experiments by nascimento júnior 2019 24 fig 6 demonstrates the results obtained in adsorption desorption rates related to the biosorption capacity of the first adsorption step for each metal ion in two cycles high rates were achieved selectively in copper and silver recovery as can be seen in fig 6 both eluents demonstrated satisfactory selective rates in desorption steps as in batch experiments nitric acid was able to retrieve a considerable amount of silver in the first desorption cycle however the adsorption efficiency in the second cycle is relatively low compared to amount of adsorbed silver ions in the first cycle 20 2 which could be explained by the predominance of copper ions in occupying the active sites in the overshoot effect remarkably concentrated samples of copper were attained with edta based eluent which is desired to favor the posterior recuperation of metals by alternative methods as pointed out by kratochvil and volesky 1998 56 the metal ions concentration profiles in the adsorption and desorption steps are displayed in fig 7 the overshoot effect is also evidenced in the concentration profiles of adsorption steps a and d in fig 7 copper recovery steps b and e demonstrate a fast desorption equilibrium that releases an almost free copper sample in the outlet flow as a consequence of high rates of recoverable copper by edta based eluent minimum amounts of copper are present in the following steps c and f respectively which corroborates the high stability of cu edta complex in the acidic medium 57 furthermore it makes ideal the application of the edta based eluent in the operation because it can be used at very low concentrations and yet attains highly concentrated copper samples at short operation times these combined facts allow copper to be retrieved by other alternative methods such as precipitation for large scale applications 34 56 as it can be seen in fig 7 edta based eluent was not able to remove an expressive concentration of silver ions 7b and hno3 based eluent presented a slow decay of silver concentration rate at the top of the column and the absence of silver was not observed even after 600 minutes of desorption operation 7c this behavior supports the results of binary equilibrium biosorption performed by nascimento júnior 2019 24 that revealed multilayer adsorption of silver ions and consequently gradually removal of ag i layers until it reaches equilibrium the cations may also be displaced from the active sites by no3 anion at some lower point of the column and be reattached to other active sites at a superior level before reaches the top due to electrostatic interactions since the nitrate silver salt was employed to prepare the synthetic metal samples there may be comparable chemical energies between biosorbent ag and agno3 the well known complexity and heterogeneity in the energy distribution of active sites may inflict this process and slow down the silver ions recovery rates xps analyses demonstrated ag at 1 valence state after biosorption which means at least part of silver ions is not covalently bonded to the biosorbent functional groups which eases its displacement and reattachment 24 in the second cycle time up to the breakthrough point of the column was reduced from 148 to 10 minutes indicating a broad loss in biosorption capacity when compared to copper behavior from 229 to 179 minutes a high silver amount is released in edta eluent probably because of the ph change caused by the first cycle silver can complex with edta in alkaline conditions 58 elution with hno3 also exhibited a long decay of silver concentration at the top of the column in the second cycle nitric acid presented the highest desorption rates among the eluent tested by nascimento júnior 2019 24 to retrieve silver from the brown algae waste and it has also achieved great rates with other adsorbents 4 43 59 thiourea for example is employed by other authors 4 26 due to sulfur and nitrogen interactions with ag although it is known to be highly toxic at this point it is also highlighted the need for substances able to retrieve efficiently the metal ions posing as fewer risks as possible to the environment and human health efficiency parameters qb and hmtz were estimated for the first and second biosorption steps in table 4 the capacity up to the end of the assay qe was also estimated similarly to the capacity up to exhaustion the selectivity of metals in the biosorption cycles was not estimated because the second biosorption cycle assay was not operated up to equilibrium according to table 4 it is possible to observe the decrease of 27 and 74 in biosorption capacity up to breakthrough where the industrial operation normally ceases for copper and silver respectively these results are supported by the hmtz rise of 134 and 256 which indicates the mass transfer resistance is higher in the second cycle due to the results obtained a third adsorption desorption cycle may not be a feasible alternative since silver biosorption capacity is not expected to be satisfactory the reuse of adsorbents in multiple cycles is inevitably associated with efficiency loss due to incomplete desorption processes and chemisorption rates 60 nascimento júnior et al 2019 24 have already reported the occurrence of chemisorption in silver interaction in the acidified biomass waste cardoso et al 2017b 44 have obtained similar results in zn ii biosorption on the dealginated sargassum filipendula the authors excluded the possibility of a third cycle in fixed bed operation although the biomass usage is highly recommended since it is a waste abundant and low cost material easy to prepare besides presenting high biosorption capacities when compared to conventional metal ions adsorbents 4 conclusions it is possible to conclude from this work that dealginated sargassum filipendula waste proved to be a suitable tool in the treatment of ag and cu2 accomplishing feasible adsorption capacities in continuous fixed bed biosorption the influence of the feed operational parameters in the efficiency and selectivity of the packed bed column was investigated and the overshoot effect of silver ions was observed due to competition for active sites the intensity of the effect demonstrated to be influenced by the copper and silver concentration ratio selective desorption study with edta salts opened up the possibility of recovering copper ions individually to ease posterior applications nitric acid also demonstrated to retrieve a considerable amount of silver ions in addition to demonstrating the potential to metal recovery and biosorbent reuse the abundance and easiness in preparation make it a great tool for scale up processes the reduction in environmental impact attained by the application of the waste instead of its discharge into the sea is also to be encouraged modifications in the surface structure of the biosorbent may be used to promote the affinity for silver ions in order to enhance the total biosorption capacity of the column or in the efficiency of silver desorption the results obtained in the present research may be of assistance in the treatment of silver and copper samples in real matrices declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study was financed in part by the coordenação de aperfeiçoamento de pessoal de nível superior brasil capes 2018

13971,the dynamic biosorption of multi metal samples of copper and silver ions was studied in a fixed bed column employing an alternative biosorbent derived from brown seaweed three sets of assays were performed to investigate 1 the effects of the inlet flow rate and 2 the feed composition of the samples and 3 the selective ion desorption and regeneration of the bed the greater biosorption capacities 0 642 and 0 387 mmol g 1 for cu2 and ag and removal rates 79 47 and 55 37 were obtained in the lowest flow 0 5 ml min 1 the higher residence time is believed to be associated with more favorable mass transfer rates silver breakthrough curves evidenced the overshoot effect which demonstrated to be directly proportional to copper inlet concentration due to the higher affinity for cu2 cations the statistical analysis revealed that the initial concentration of the competitive metal is directly proportional to the biosorption capacity and inversely proportional to the breakthrough time the height of the mass transfer zone was not statistically influenced by the feed composition in this study high recovery rates of copper 99 8 and silver 90 7 were achieved with na2 edta and hno3 in selective desorption operation respectively a second biosorption cycle exhibited a considerable loss in biosorption capacity up to a breakthrough point keywords dynamic biosorption multi metal systems brown macro algae toxic metal removal wastewater treatment 1 introduction ionic copper and silver are lewis acids able to complex with oxygen sulfur and nitrogen compounds and take part in physiological and biochemical activities that may represent a threat to aquatic environments and human health 1 3 since these noble metals present similar properties of excellent thermal and electrical conductivity and high corrosion resistance they are employed in several common applications by electroplating electrical transport coin and jewelry industries copper silver alloys are employed in electrical and electronic devices production coins solders and jewelry manufacturing and their applications are also extended as anti microbial agents 4 7 silver is not reported as taking part in any physiologic or chemical process of any form of life and in human beings it can damage cellular respiration and oxidize cell components to free radicals these radicals are able to deteriorate lipids protein and dna 8 9 copper on the other hand is an essential metal to many animals including humans playing a key role in enzymatic synthesis and tissue and bone growth however it can damage cell membranes and accumulate in the liver brain pancreas and disrupt iron functions when at higher concentrations than the tolerable levels 10 12 the release of high amounts of silver and copper in the environment as a consequence of industrial activity is therefore a public health issue and calls the attention of scientists worldwide chemical precipitation electrochemical processes reverse osmosis and other membrane operations are alternatives to reduce metal concentration in water samples although they may be related to some technical and economic disadvantages 13 15 adsorption has been presented as a viable method to remove toxic metals from wastewater due to the capability of retrieving the pollutants efficiently even at very low concentrations 16 the use of alternative materials as adsorbents is not only able to reduce the costs of operation when compared to activated carbon but also to attribute new applications to the waste biomass as investigated by nishikawa et al 2018 17 the biosorption operation consists in employing inactive biomass such as marine algae able to restrain metal cations in functional groups present on the surface of cell components through physicochemical mechanisms 13 14 18 biosorption phenomenon is mainly attributed to the components of the cell wall which consists of cellulose based material with high protein content in green macroalgae sulfated polysaccharides in red and brown macroalgae and the alginic acid also in brown species 13 brown macroalgae from the genus sargassum have been extensively exploited in metal biosorption processes 10 14 although a few reports have recently investigated the potential of dealginated sargassum due to the presence of remaining alginic acid fucoidan and other chemicals in the external cell wall matrix of the biomass 19 20 freitas et al 2018 21 freitas et al 2019 22 and nascimento júnior et al 2019 23 have pointed out that oxygenated groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl ethers alcohols and sulphonic acids have taken part in binding cu2 and ag ions by ion exchange and complexation mechanisms fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and energy dispersive x ray spectrometry eds coupled with scanning electron microscopy sem corroborated the release of soft metal cations na in large amounts and ca2 in lower degree and a balance of chemical and physical interactions in the competitive system nascimento júnior 2019 24 observed the presence of cu and ag species on the surface of sargassum filipendula waste by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and the presence of the metals in zero oxidation state could not be discarded 25 many reports in the literature deal with batch adsorption operation since it is of great importance to evaluate how the parameters affect the adsorption equilibrium and kinetics 16 26 nonetheless batch systems are in general not able to treat large volumes of water and reach saturation with very diluted samples 27 continuous adsorption systems are still scarcely exploited by the literature and it is of major concern to comprehend mass transfer processes and the behavior of macro algae in saturation regeneration and washing cycles 28 29 packed bed columns are traditionally employed in continuous adsorption systems for the treatment of wastewater and groundwater at feasible times 30 the investigation of hydrodynamic behavior is important because the dynamic operation may present different characteristics than the exhibited in batch equilibrium particle size head loss feed composition and bed dimensions are to be considered in the bed design 31 32 multicomponent samples are expected to have its efficiency reduced for individual targeted compounds due to the competition the complexity of the system may also influence the process 30 data obtained in batch experiments often manifest inaccuracies to optimize packed bed reactors and practical information in terms of breakthrough curves is required 33 these curves exhibit the outlet adsorbate concentration profiles and the behavior of the mass transfer zone mtz where the adsorption rate is greater 32 the height of mzt is desirable to be as close as possible to zero which would indicate more favorable mass transfer rates 34 35 in general the scale up operation lasts until one of the pollutants reaches the breakthrough point thereafter it will not be able to assemble clean water at the top of the column 36 in this work the competitive binary biosorption of copper ii and silver i ions was studied in a packed bed column filled with dealginated brown seaweed waste what are the features regarding the behavior of competing silver and copper metal ions in dynamic biosorption would it be possible to retrieve silver and copper ions in two different outlet streams in order to be furtherly precipitated the effects of the inlet flow rate and the initial composition of the system were investigated in order to optimize the efficiency parameters of the bed selective desorption cycles for each metal ion were carried out in order to evaluate the recovery capability and regeneration of biosorbent for future large scale applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 biosorbent particles preparation the seaweed biomass was collected from the north coast of são paulo state brazil washed dried 60 c for 24 h and stored 4 c until use in order to perform the solid liquid extraction of alginate from the cell wall matrix the biomass was sieved 0 5 1 0 mm and mchugh 1987 37 method was employed the method consisted of a pre washing step of the sieved particles with formaldehyde ch2o 0 4 v v for 30 minutes and hydrochloric acid hcl 0 1 m for 120 minutes the extraction was performed with a sodium carbonate solution na2co3 2 for 5 h at 60 c to promote the dissolution of sodium alginate the waste of the extraction operation was dried 60 c for 24 h and undergone an acidification step as proposed by freitas et al 2018 21 then the biosorbent particles were dried and stored at room temperature the macro algae based biosorbent has been investigated previously by sem eds ftir 20 38 39 xps 40 gas picnometry mercury porosimetry and n2 physisorption 22 39 and the metal loaded biosorbent particles with copper and silver have been searched for sem eds ftir mercury porosimetry gas pycnometry 22 23 xps and thermogravimetric analysis 24 the authors have discussed the active functional groups and the possible mechanisms of adsorption along with the thermal properties and porosity of the material 2 2 multi metal synthetic samples metal samples were prepared from the nitrate salts cu no3 2 3h2o acquired from sinergia científica brazil and agno3 acquired from dinâmica brazil the methodology for quantification of metal ions employed atomic absorption spectroscopy shimadzu a 700 and all the samples were kept in dark vessels due to silver photosensitivity properties 4 41 the ph of the samples was adjusted before each experiment to less than 5 0 by adding hno3 0 1 m to assure the whole presence of cu2 ions according to its speciation characteristics 23 this step was carried out to avoid precipitation effects in the study 2 3 experimental setting a glass column 0 6 cm inner diameter 9 0 cm height operating upwards was filled with 0 26 g of biosorbent particles for each assay the samples were fed by a peristaltic pump masterflex into the bottom of the column and were collected at predefined intervals by an automatic fraction collector gilson fc203b at the top as shown in fig 1 a glass wool layer was used at the top of the column to pack the adsorbent before each assay deionized water was pumped into the column for 12 hours at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min in order to promote the biosorbent expansion the temperature was controlled at around 25 c by room cooling breakthrough curves c t c0 versus t were built to study the behavior of metal cations during the operation breakthrough conditions were set when the concentration of the respective metal ion reached 5 of the inlet concentration the efficiency of the column was assessed by biosorption capacities up to breakthrough and exhaustion qb and qe respectively removal rates until breakthrough and exhaustion rb and re and the mass zone transfer height mtz the efficiency parameters were calculated according to equations 1 5 1 q b c i q 1000 m b 0

saturation point min and hb is the bed height 9 cm for all experiments in reactor design it is desired that the mtz be as small as possible to maximize bed capacity but without decreasing dramatically particle size or increasing the pressure drop along the bed magnifying the undesirable effect of head loss 32 42 the selectivity of the metal ions equation 6 in the dynamic assays was calculated according to freitas et al 2018 43 and ruthven 1984 31 in order to discuss the effects of diffusional resistances and its dependence with the inlet flow rate 6 α a b q a q b c a c b where q is the total amount removed of each metal ion mmol g 1 and c is the equilibrium concentration when bed reaches exhaustion mmol l 1 a and b are the index for the metal species in the binary systems 2 4 effect of inlet flow rate in order to investigate the feasibility of breakthrough and saturation times and its dependence on the flow rate the biosorption assays were operated at 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 ml min 1 for 800 minutes the inlet flow rates were based on previous studies employing the biosorbent in single metal systems 21 39 44 breakthrough curves were built and efficiency parameters were calculated furthermore the volume removal rates were estimated up to the breakthrough point an important parameter for large scale operation 2 5 effect of feed composition in order to study the effect of the feed composition a 2² experimental planning was performed at the inlet flow rate selected by the previous assays the total concentration of metal cations 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mmol l 1 and molar fraction of each of them 25 50 and 75 were used as variables and the central point was performed in triplicate to estimate the experimental error the seven assays were carried out randomly for 1000 minutes and the data was analyzed in statistic experimental design the responses of the study were the time to reach the breakthrough point tb biosorption capacity up to saturation point qb and mtz height hmtz the inlet flow rate was previously investigated instead of being one of the variables in experimental planning design because of the lack of information about the behavior of the dynamic binary biosorption at the beginning of the assays since the influence degree of the inlet flow rates in the breakthrough times was unknown a slight variation in one of the parameters interacting with the inlet flow rate could provide a curve with breakthrough time very close to zero and the data could not be analyzed statistically in the studied range 2 6 selective desorption cycles to evaluate the regeneration of the biosorbent and selective recovery of metal ions two desorption cycles were performed after the biosorption assay under the conditions of the central point a previous study has demonstrated the efficiency of edta a chelating agent in recovering selectively copper ions from sargassum filipendula waste in batch mode 24 in addition nitric acid demonstrated superior efficiency in retrieving silver ions than other acids tested in the study for this reason two eluents were employed in selective desorption steps 1 na2edta 0 001 m and ca no3 2 0 001 m 2 hno3 1 0 m outlet concentrations of both metals were monitored at the top of the column until they reached the slopes of adsorption desorption a mass balance was used to calculate the recovery rates from the biosorption capacity 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of inlet flow rate breakthrough curves for the competitive binary biosorption are displayed in fig 2 the graphs exhibit the behavior of copper fig 2 a and silver fig 2 b dynamic biosorption separately at each flow rate in order to ease its insight it can be observed that copper breakthrough times fig 2a are typically greater than silver ones and the sigmoidal shape of the curves are elongated as expected indicating a considerable mass transfer resistance in the adsorption operation although they are not very different from a step function because exhaustion of the column is reached shortly after breakthrough point 45 46 copper breakthrough times were enhanced when q0 decreased since saturation is expected to be reached faster at higher flow rates due to the shorter residence time of adsorbate in the column silver curves fig 2b demonstrated a more complex behavior breakthrough times also increased when the inlet flow rate is decreased and the curves exhibited a closer profile to the step function than copper this result was not expected since the ag ion has a larger ionic radius and lower charge and should be associated with lower external mass transfer rates than cu2 ion 47 nonetheless this feature may be correlated to an excessive amount of silver released after breakthrough which caused c c0 to be higher than one until it reaches a maximum and starts to be reduced until saturation of both ions is reached this phenomenon is known as overshoot in multi component adsorption systems one previous adsorbed ion can be replaced by a competitive adsorbate that presents a higher affinity for the active sites via ion exchange mechanisms other works have reported cu2 replacing other metal cations in the active sites in dynamic systems with ag in bentonite clay 43 zn2 in vermiculite 48 ni2 in raw sargassum filipendula 49 cr3 in agar extraction waste 35 and in other multicomponent metal samples such as zn2 ni2 in red macro algae 28 it is well known that for an ion exchanger the properties of the ions such as charge electronegativity ionic radius molar content among others will influence the selectivity and binding strength since cu2 and ag ions are from the same chemical family they present similar properties e g electronegativity 2 0 and 1 9 respectively but also differ in some others cu2 cation is expected to exhibit higher diffusion rates since its radius is twice smaller 0 73 ǻ than ag 1 15 ǻ 47 additionally haug and smidsrod 1965 50 have reported that the guluronic acid one of alginic acids monomer exhibits higher selectivity for divalent cations due to the eggshell structure in alginate net oxygen groups such as carboxyl groups were pointed by nascimento júnior 2019 24 as the main binders in the operation with cu2 and ag ions and according to the hard soft acid bases hsab theory 2 copper ii is also favored by the active sites since it is a stronger electron acceptor according to fig 2 the overshoot effect seems to be intensified when the inlet flow rate decreases since residence time is expected to rise when q0 decreases longer contact time to retrieve silver ions is provided and consequently more occupied active sites for copper ion exchange according to oliveira and alfaya 2018 46 high flow rates to feed the column can also cause excessive packing of the particles leading to a partial blockage of active sites decreasing the adsorption capacity as a consequence in accordance with previous results reported in the literature the silver ions breakthrough is reached in shorter times freitas et al 2018 21 and freitas et al 2019 22 have found higher adsorption rates for silver in the modeling of single metal biosorption on sargassum filipendula waste the increase in the inlet flow rate is followed by a higher increment in ag adsorption rates from 0 028 to 0 037 l mmol 1 min 1 than the cu2 rate increment from 0 023 to 0 031 l mmol 1 min 1 then it is believed that the intraparticle mass transfer resistance is the rate limiting resistance for both ions since the operation was favored by slower q0 values 51 table 1 displays the efficiency parameters taken into consideration to select the inlet flow rate for further operation additionally it was calculated the treated volume rates up to breakthrough in relation to the total volume employed up to the exhaustion of the column vt according to the results presented in table 1 the highest qb and qe values were achieved when q0 0 5 ml min 1 as well as the highest removal rates up to the exhaustion of the column rb is expected to be close to 100 since it represents the removal rate up to the breakthrough point before the breakthrough point is reached it is expected that the bed delivers samples with very low levels of metal cations although it seemed to vary randomly for copper ions it decreased considerably for silver ions at 1 0 ml min 1 the mtz height for cu2 shrank when the inlet flow rate is lowered although it demonstrated to be optimized at q0 0 75 ml min 1 for silver ions regarding the selectivity of the column it can be observed that the increase in q0 promoted an increase in copper selectivity from 1 973 to 2 130 and then to 3 120 while silver selectivity decreased from 0 507 to 0 469 and then to 0 320 in general acute toxic levels of silver ions are achieved at lower concentrations for the living organisms than copper ones 52 54 and silver also represents a more valuable resource and therefore more claimed in recovery processes under these circumstances it is desired that α ag is to be as high as possible over α cu in the binary system freitas et al 2018 43 have reported a considerable decrease in α cu fixed bed binary biosorption on bentonite clay however α ag was not substantially enhanced when q0 was raised from 1 0 to 5 0 ml min 1 in a 1 4 x 14 cm cylindrical bed the treated volume rates were calculated based on volume spent up to tb for each metal and they displayed attractive rates for wastewater treatment for silver and copper respectively 64 24 and 49 75 of volume samples were able to reach acceptable disposal standards 54 operating up to the saturation of the column for these reasons the 0 5 ml min 1 inlet flow rate was selected for the later studies although it required longer operation times 273 and 155 minutes for copper and silver breakthrough respectively this condition can be considered a feasible response for scale up adsorption operation 27 freitas et al 2018 21 and freitas et al 2019 22 have studied silver and copper ions single biosorption in a 0 6 x 7 cm column and also obtained the best efficiency parameters for both metals at the same inlet flow rate 3 2 effect of feed composition breakthrough curves for the 2² experimental planning assays are exhibited in fig 3 the central point data were plotted comparatively in a single chart as it can be seen by the biosorption dynamic profiles tb values are shortened when metal feed concentrations are enhanced in the studied range of concentration this behavior is expected due to higher amounts of adsorbates available to bind active sites breakthrough curves for the central point assays are similar in shape and exhibited similar tb and te values guaranteeing the reproducibility of the experiments overshoot was once again noticed in all the curves however at lower levels when the relation between silver and copper feed concentrations is increased thus copper feed concentration is expected to have a positive effect on the removal rates of preabsorbed silver ions at a fixed silver feed concentration 49 55 freitas et al 2018 43 reported similar results for the dynamic binary adsorption of ag cu2 ions on verde lodo bentonite clay exhibiting curves where the overshoot effect was not even noticed at the highest relations between silver and copper feed concentration barquilha et al 2019 10 also reported similar effects in the dynamic binary adsorption of ni cu on sargassum sp from the breakthrough curves the efficiency parameters of each assay were calculated table 2 displays the studied variables according to each assay along with the responses obtained for the experimental planning statistical analysis pareto charts and response surfaces were generated for each one of the responses figs 4 and 5 for ag and cu2 ions for silver biosorption the statistical analyses demonstrated that both cations concentrations and also the interaction between them are statistically significant for tb and qb as responses fig 4a b although ag 0 presented to be the most significant in both cases cu2 0 and ag 0 cu2 0 also displayed considerable significance since tb and qb depend mostly on the binding rate of silver ions which was suggested to be linked to the overshoot and competition effects and thus to the competitive metal concentration nascimento júnior et al 2019 24 revealed that the equilibrium times of silver biosorption in batch systems were reasonably enhanced from 60 to 600 minutes at higher copper initial concentrations despite copper equilibrium times were not affected by silver initial concentration 75 minutes in kinetic experiments from the figs 4a and 4b it is possible to conclude that tb and qb are directly proportional to silver feed concentration while inversely proportional to cu2 0 only the interaction of the metal feed concentrations exhibited statistical significance in hmtz in the studied range according to the response surface analysis silver mtz height is increased when one of the metal feed concentrations is increased individually this suggests that either copper or silver feed concentration upturn is responsible to lower mass transfer rates however when both metal concentrations are raised the effect seems to cause lower mass transfer resistances what is evidenced is that the ion exchange process between silver and copper ions is present in all the extension of the experiment and since silver mtz moves faster than copper one along the column displaced silver ions are believed to bind other active sites before reaching the breakthrough point in the continuous operation this would explain why only after the breakthrough point silver outlet concentration is highly increased the feed concentration of both metals and their interaction also exhibited statistical significance in tb and qb responses for copper fig 5a b although differently from silver cu2 0 displayed much higher statistical significance in breakthrough times and similarly ag 0 for biosorption capacity this behavior is evidenced in the response surfaces at a fixed silver feed concentration for tb fig 5a and at a fixed copper concentration for qb fig 5b breakthrough time is inversely proportional and biosorption capacity is directly proportional to cu2 0 none of the variables presented statistical significance in copper hmtz and higher feed concentrations of both cations lead to greater heights as a result of inferior external mass transfer resistance fig 5c pure error for the experiments may be considered low for all the parameters freitas et al 2018 43 also reported a positive dependence on copper feed concentration and a negative dependence of silver feed concentration in breakthrough times in verde lodo bentonite clay the authors also reported the inversely proportional dependence of hmtz values and the total concentration of metals for column feed the experimental planning study revealed that the biosorption capacities up to breakthrough for both metal cations are influenced by the composition of the mixture total inlet concentration and molar fraction of each cation and the interaction of these variables silver profiles demonstrated to be more sensitive to the changes in feed composition corroborating with the competition for common active sites as pointed out by nascimento júnior et al 2019 24 according to the response surface analyses the biosorption capacity of a metal cation is positively influenced by the increase in its feed composition and the decrease of the competitive cation composition thus none of the metal cations inlet concentration was in excess in any of the assays in addition the selectivity of metal ions was calculated for the assays table 3 according to the equimolar assays 1 to 5 the enhancement in total inlet concentration of metals is known to cause higher selectivity of silver and lower α cu values even though the triplicate presented considerable differences among the values they were all intermediate among the results of assays 1 and 2 the lower and higher levels of experimental planning respectively the α cu dropped quite in non equimolar assays regardless of the fraction of copper in c0 25 and 75 similarly α ag presented maximum values at these assays and this effect seemed to be intensified when silver is at 75 assay 6 rather than 25 assay 7 as expected nascimento júnior et al 2019 24 have found that α ag values were magnified when the relation c0 ag c0 cu is enhanced which was easily explained by the higher diffusion rates and affinity with the functional groups of copper ions the result is that in batch systems copper ions will inhibit silver biosorption directly proportional to its concentration and also broadened the time to reach silver biosorption equilibrium when the biosorption is processed in a fixed bed column not only silver biosorption capacity is improved at more concentrated equimolar samples but it is also improved when there are lower or higher amounts of copper ions than silver ones preferably higher these results may indicate that copper presence induces silver biosorption instead of inhibiting it when the dynamic operation is handled with non equimolar samples which is often the case of real wastewater matrices in the dynamic adsorption of cu2 and ag onto bentonite clay freitas et al 2018 43 have found that α cu α ag is enhanced at higher copper molar fractions in inlet column samples and it is pointed out the inductive effect of silver ions presence in copper adsorption capacities contrarily muthusamy and venkatachalam 2015 51 have found inhibitory effects in zn ii cr vi biosorption on each other when compared to the single metal biosorption onto a biodiesel waste the effects can be synergic or antagonist when referring to multi component adsorption according to vilar et al 2008 35 the adsorption capacity of the metal components in a multimetal mixture will vary from the batch behavior since there are dissolved organics released during the operation these organics which are able to bind to active sites are carried out through the column flow in the dynamic operation this could explain why the selectivity of silver ions is altered differently when the composition of the mixture is altered in batch systems 24 the ph may also influence the results because in the dynamic operation the released h ions influence the ion interactions with the binding sites 51 3 3 selective desorption cycles and column regeneration two steps of desorption were carried out after saturation of the column was reached for both metal cations the eluents employed in each step were previously selected for copper na2edta 0 001 m ca no3 2 0 001 m and for remaining silver afterward hno3 1 0 m and their concentration optimized in batch experiments by nascimento júnior 2019 24 fig 6 demonstrates the results obtained in adsorption desorption rates related to the biosorption capacity of the first adsorption step for each metal ion in two cycles high rates were achieved selectively in copper and silver recovery as can be seen in fig 6 both eluents demonstrated satisfactory selective rates in desorption steps as in batch experiments nitric acid was able to retrieve a considerable amount of silver in the first desorption cycle however the adsorption efficiency in the second cycle is relatively low compared to amount of adsorbed silver ions in the first cycle 20 2 which could be explained by the predominance of copper ions in occupying the active sites in the overshoot effect remarkably concentrated samples of copper were attained with edta based eluent which is desired to favor the posterior recuperation of metals by alternative methods as pointed out by kratochvil and volesky 1998 56 the metal ions concentration profiles in the adsorption and desorption steps are displayed in fig 7 the overshoot effect is also evidenced in the concentration profiles of adsorption steps a and d in fig 7 copper recovery steps b and e demonstrate a fast desorption equilibrium that releases an almost free copper sample in the outlet flow as a consequence of high rates of recoverable copper by edta based eluent minimum amounts of copper are present in the following steps c and f respectively which corroborates the high stability of cu edta complex in the acidic medium 57 furthermore it makes ideal the application of the edta based eluent in the operation because it can be used at very low concentrations and yet attains highly concentrated copper samples at short operation times these combined facts allow copper to be retrieved by other alternative methods such as precipitation for large scale applications 34 56 as it can be seen in fig 7 edta based eluent was not able to remove an expressive concentration of silver ions 7b and hno3 based eluent presented a slow decay of silver concentration rate at the top of the column and the absence of silver was not observed even after 600 minutes of desorption operation 7c this behavior supports the results of binary equilibrium biosorption performed by nascimento júnior 2019 24 that revealed multilayer adsorption of silver ions and consequently gradually removal of ag i layers until it reaches equilibrium the cations may also be displaced from the active sites by no3 anion at some lower point of the column and be reattached to other active sites at a superior level before reaches the top due to electrostatic interactions since the nitrate silver salt was employed to prepare the synthetic metal samples there may be comparable chemical energies between biosorbent ag and agno3 the well known complexity and heterogeneity in the energy distribution of active sites may inflict this process and slow down the silver ions recovery rates xps analyses demonstrated ag at 1 valence state after biosorption which means at least part of silver ions is not covalently bonded to the biosorbent functional groups which eases its displacement and reattachment 24 in the second cycle time up to the breakthrough point of the column was reduced from 148 to 10 minutes indicating a broad loss in biosorption capacity when compared to copper behavior from 229 to 179 minutes a high silver amount is released in edta eluent probably because of the ph change caused by the first cycle silver can complex with edta in alkaline conditions 58 elution with hno3 also exhibited a long decay of silver concentration at the top of the column in the second cycle nitric acid presented the highest desorption rates among the eluent tested by nascimento júnior 2019 24 to retrieve silver from the brown algae waste and it has also achieved great rates with other adsorbents 4 43 59 thiourea for example is employed by other authors 4 26 due to sulfur and nitrogen interactions with ag although it is known to be highly toxic at this point it is also highlighted the need for substances able to retrieve efficiently the metal ions posing as fewer risks as possible to the environment and human health efficiency parameters qb and hmtz were estimated for the first and second biosorption steps in table 4 the capacity up to the end of the assay qe was also estimated similarly to the capacity up to exhaustion the selectivity of metals in the biosorption cycles was not estimated because the second biosorption cycle assay was not operated up to equilibrium according to table 4 it is possible to observe the decrease of 27 and 74 in biosorption capacity up to breakthrough where the industrial operation normally ceases for copper and silver respectively these results are supported by the hmtz rise of 134 and 256 which indicates the mass transfer resistance is higher in the second cycle due to the results obtained a third adsorption desorption cycle may not be a feasible alternative since silver biosorption capacity is not expected to be satisfactory the reuse of adsorbents in multiple cycles is inevitably associated with efficiency loss due to incomplete desorption processes and chemisorption rates 60 nascimento júnior et al 2019 24 have already reported the occurrence of chemisorption in silver interaction in the acidified biomass waste cardoso et al 2017b 44 have obtained similar results in zn ii biosorption on the dealginated sargassum filipendula the authors excluded the possibility of a third cycle in fixed bed operation although the biomass usage is highly recommended since it is a waste abundant and low cost material easy to prepare besides presenting high biosorption capacities when compared to conventional metal ions adsorbents 4 conclusions it is possible to conclude from this work that dealginated sargassum filipendula waste proved to be a suitable tool in the treatment of ag and cu2 accomplishing feasible adsorption capacities in continuous fixed bed biosorption the influence of the feed operational parameters in the efficiency and selectivity of the packed bed column was investigated and the overshoot effect of silver ions was observed due to competition for active sites the intensity of the effect demonstrated to be influenced by the copper and silver concentration ratio selective desorption study with edta salts opened up the possibility of recovering copper ions individually to ease posterior applications nitric acid also demonstrated to retrieve a considerable amount of silver ions in addition to demonstrating the potential to metal recovery and biosorbent reuse the abundance and easiness in preparation make it a great tool for scale up processes the reduction in environmental impact attained by the application of the waste instead of its discharge into the sea is also to be encouraged modifications in the surface structure of the biosorbent may be used to promote the affinity for silver ions in order to enhance the total biosorption capacity of the column or in the efficiency of silver desorption the results obtained in the present research may be of assistance in the treatment of silver and copper

13972,in alkaline surfactant polymer flooding processes the adsorption of residual surfactants in the oil water interface significantly affected the emulsification and stabilization of produced water in order to thoroughly investigate the effect of that on oil water separation efficiencies the adsorption behaviors of a surfactant sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs were carried out by using both molecular simulation and experimental approaches the effects of temperature on the stability of monolayer sdbs films and the interfacial film thicknesses and interface formation energies of sdbs at n dodecane water interface were obtained and then compared with the tested values of adsorption heat of the surfactant within the simulated produced water samples and with experimentally determined interfacial tensions of the samples the experimental and computational results are consistent in the variation of adsorption heat keywords oil water interface surfactant adsorption molecular simulation 1 introduction surfactants have been widely used as displacement agents in tertiary oil recovery technology to improve oil extraction 1 compared with conventional water flooding alkaline surfactant polymer asp flooding technology has 20 higher oil recovery 2 however large amounts of produced water from asp flooding have been produced that is difficult to treat and can cause damage to oilfield production and the environment for example ternary complexes produce high degrees of oil emulsification with a preponderance of fine sized oil droplets in water solutions having high viscosity and salinity these characteristics complicate the treatment of oil bearing wastewater because residual surfactants alkalis and polymers change the interfacial properties of oil droplets that enhance the strength of oil water interfacial films 3 5 if produced water treatment technologies are to be improved it is necessary to more thoroughly understand ternary complex oil water emulsions studies have shown that ternary compounds used for produced water from asp flooding have a profound influence on the stability and coalescence of oil droplets 6 and of the effects of surfactants alkalis and polymers water film strengths in oil water emulsions are significant for surfactants 7 in a previous study that related the characteristics of produced water from laboratory preparations and oilfield sampling the microstructures and oil water separation characteristics of water produced in a laboratory using ternary complexes of petroleum sulfonate surfactants were compared to the compositions of asp flooding agents and their resultant oil water interface properties for produced water from the daqing oilfield it contained a weak base petroleum sulfonate surfactant 8 it was concluded that the presence of the petroleum sulfonate is a main reason for the low dynamic interfacial tension within the crude oil from daqing oilfield the study of surfactant adsorption at oil water interface has provided meaningful insight into the behavior of crude oil emulsions 9 12 rather than relying completely on often time consuming experimentation recent developments in computer technologies and molecular simulations have ushered in new approaches for uncovering complex microscopic interactions related to kinetics thermodynamics and structural and chemical properties at molecular levels 13 16 although many studies have examined the adsorption properties of surfactants at the interfaces of oil water and rock 17 20 no known study has specifically attempted to use simulations for understanding and then improving asp flooding treatments through a study of oil water separation interfacial characteristics this topic is to be addressed herein through fundamental experimentation both laboratory and molecular simulation the anionic sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs surfactant was used in experimentation of oil water interface and molecular simulations were used to reveal adsorption properties of the surfactant at the oil water interface surfactant concentrations and temperatures were varied during both experimentation and simulation with a focus on the surfactant heat of adsorption surface tensions density distributions and interface formation forces and then comparisons between these results were accomplished in addition the interfacial tensions of water with sdbs and simulated samples of produced water from asp flooding were obtained to provide insight into stabilities and microscopic behaviors of molecular structures at oil water interface 2 simulations and experiments 2 1 molecular simulation method calculations for constructing and analyzing molecular models were performed using materials studio ms 8 0 software accelrys company the components within the reactions were sdbs water and oil n dodecane models of which are presented in fig 1 and these were constructed by using the visualizer module within the ms software energy minimization using a smart minimizer method 21 decreased the duration of the needed computations force fields of the molecules applied to calculate intramolecular and intermolecular interactions were obtained by the pcff polymer consistent force field method 22 van der waals and coulomb interactions were determined via the charge group method 23 these molecules configurations were defined within 5000 optimization steps after which the dynamic operations were devoted to establishing the most stable structures to construct the water and oil n dodecane phases and the surfactant monolayer film a hypothetical simulation space with parameters shown in table 1 was built using the visualizer all of the initial systems were comprised of 300 n dodecane molecules and 1000 water molecules and covered a rectangular volume with x y dimensions of 26 å and a z dimension of 150 0 å the dimensions of the simulation volume were also adjusted to ensure the surfactant fit properly in newly formed monolayer films during reaction interactions 24 as depicted in fig 2 two surfactant monolayer films occupied the sides of the simulated volume with the water in the center 25 26 and the z point of the surfactant was in contact with the water and n dodecane as a consequence the volume was greater in the z direction than in the x y directions four interfaces were actually developed with this geometry as displayed in fig 2a with the lipophilic group close to the oil phase and the polar group close to the water surface all simulated models consisted of a regular three dimensional structure thereby eliminating the influence of periodic boundary conditions it was to be noted that as depicted in fig 2b the gap within the liquid interface became fused and the interaction volume was smaller when a balanced system was simulated than at the onset of simulation computations although the usable interfaces tended to evaporate and thereby expand the interaction volume this vaporization expansion effect was minimal 2 2 experiments the nvt canonical and npt isothermal isobaric systems md simulations were implemented in which the nvt md simulation was performed for 20 ps at 300 k with the water compensation molecules and the surfactant polar group fixed prevention and control of local minima were accomplished by applying the heat energy in a constant volume 27 then the npt md simulation was accomplished for 400 ps at 300 k the total duration of the md simulation was 2 ns throughout this work the temperatures were controlled by an andersen thermostat 28 with a relaxation time of 0 1 ps the pressure was controlled at 1 atm using a berendsen voltage regulator 29 the initial velocity of motion generated random distributions controlled by maxwell boltzmann laws with a time step recorded in 1 0 fs the evolution curve for temperature and energy was an equilibrium standard in the system and the fluctuation range in the simulation process was adjusted within 5 the adsorption heat analyses on the oil water interfacial layer were carried out using a c80 micro calorimeter setaram france using specific mass ratio of the surfactant in the oil water mixtures at 303 k tests were performed upon attaining a constant heat flux at room temperature 298 k with water and n dodecane as the oil phase and with varying surfactant concentrations of 0 mg l 300 mg l 500 mg l 700 mg l and 900 mg l also tests were accomplished with a constant 300 mg l surfactant concentration and different temperatures of 298 k 313 k 328 k 333 k 338 k 343 k 348 k 353 k and 363 k the curve of heat flux with time was measured by microcalorimeter to transfer the adsorption heat of sdbs in n dodecane water through the integral algorithm interfacial tensions of simulated water samples were measured using a surface tensiometer k100 krüss germany with a quartz plate which was suspended by a thin wire through an electronic balance on the two phase interface for all tests the water samples originated from a single batch of simulated produced water samples having a composition of 0 07 naoh and 0 05 hpam 30 a 50 ml solution of 0 07 naoh and 0 05 hpam without surfactants was used as a reference for comparison during the tests the sdbs at concentrations of 100 mg l 300 mg l 500 mg l 700 mg l and 900 mg l were injected manually into the simulated produced water samples and the changes in interfacial tension with time were measured each test was repeated three times 3 results and discussion 3 1 interface formation energy ife of the surfactant the interface formation energy ife of sdbs was used to compare the average adsorption energy per surfactant molecule at the oil water interface the ife of n dodecane and water system was defined as follows 31 ife e total n e single e dodecane water n where etotal is the overall energy of the system which contains the van der waals the electrostatic force and the torsion energies of bond length and bond angle esingle is the energy of a single surfactant molecule when the single molecule is in dynamic equilibrium under vacuum the structural energy is optimized and then the molecular dynamics is simulated to obtain the value of equilibrium energy n denotes the number of surfactant molecules used edodecane water is the energy of n dodecane water only at kinetic equilibrium with the same numbers of n dodecane water the ife values are shown in table 2 as the surfactant concentration was increased ife decreased by 36 and total energy by over 560 these data are also plotted in fig 3 the system became more stable at the higher sdbs concentration of 900 mg l a result of which was that oil water separation would be become more difficult in other words the energy of the molecular framework and their interfacial interactions were affected strongly by changing in the surfactant concentrations values of ife calculated using 300 mg l sdbs at various temperatures are presented in table 3 and show the values decreased nonlinearly between 290 343 k but then increased between 343 358 k these data are plotted in fig 4 the ife decreased by 16 and the total energy by 7 between 298 343 k decreases that represented increased stability of the oil water interface then the ife and total energy increased between 343 358 k signifying a slight decrease in the stability of the oil water interface such a change indicated that oil water interfacial interactions were dynamic and possibly signified the formation of an initial complete adsorptive layer with stable architecture at 343 k the adsorption mechanism at 343 k was expected to involve the oil hydrophobic chain coupling with the water polar groups 32 creating the strongest interactions with sdbs while the repulsive forces and interfacial tensions were the smallest also as the temperature was increased from 298 to 358 k the solubility of sdbs was increased while the interfacial tensions became smaller because of the presence of the sdbs benzene ring structure that would enhance polar groups having high temperature resistance 33 after the maximum negative ife at 343 k increasing temperature to 358 k might have disrupted the orderly structure of sdbs at the oil water interface thereby demonstrating how increasing temperature would affect properties of a surfactant monolayer 3 2 simulations of interface characteristics of surfactant monolayer film density profile simulations were accomplished to analyze density distributions of the components in an interface 34 the density distributions along the z axis away from the surface i e perpendicular to it for each of the components in the system are shown in the plots displayed in fig 5 at various sdbs concentrations and fig 6 at various temperatures with a constant sdbs concentration the results presented densities distributions of the alkane chains for the n dodecane sdbs and the water in general the highest simulated densities of the water and oil phases were near 0 992 g cm3 and 0 720 g cm3 respectively which were very close to the density of pure bulk phases of water 0 997 g cm3 and n dodecane 0 725 g cm3 hence it was expected that the simulations provided reliable results all the data displayed in fig 5 and fig 6 show two distinct phases and two symmetrical interfaces when sdbs formed a monolayer as sdbs concentrations were varied at constant temperature and as temperatures were varied at constant sdbs concentration as sdbs concentrations were increased fig 5 the oil and water phase distributions were distinctly separated whereas as temperatures were increased the overlap between the phases was more evident as shown in fig 6d the surfactant distribution presented a wider region with more effective hydrophilic and lipophilic groups at 343 k the overlap region of surfactant concentration within oil phase and water phase was large when the sdbs monolayer film formed at the n dodecane water interface with high interfacial energy and stability the overlap regions created transition zones that contained specific thicknesses in which the water and n dodecane molecules were dissolved with each other the adsorption mechanism in the transition zones was expected to be a result of the strong electronegativity of the surfactant polar group 35 in the transition zones a strong electrostatic attraction exists between the surfactant and water molecules 27 36 with some water molecules adsorbing onto the surfactant polar group thereby expanding the region of the transition zone at the oil water interface simultaneously the lipophilic group of sdbs could penetrate into the oil phase because of van der waals forces and some n dodecane molecules could be dissolved by the sdbs the stability of the n dodecane water interface increase because of the overlap region of surfactant concentration within oil phase and water phase in addition at constant temperature with increasing sdbs concentrations the density of the sdbs was increased with distances from the z axis this effect may be a result of increasing stability of the system with increasing sdbs content however it is also possible that the n dodecane water interface is not strictly planar such that the surfactant molecules are not well arranged neatly at the oil water interface 36 37 3 3 interfacial film thickness although the density profiles provided distinct information about molecule distributions no information plainly reflected the ability of the surfactant to reduce the oil water interfacial tension to develop this insight it would be necessary to probe correlations between interfacial film thicknesses and interfacial tensions 38 hence the interfacial film thicknesses were estimated by using the 90 90 standard 39 a dimensional representation between 90 and 10 of the bulk concentration phase accordingly the interfacial film thicknesses of water and n dodecane were represented by tw and t0 respectively and ttotal represented the interfacial film thickness at 90 of bulk concentration relative the bulk density profile the gibbs interfacial distribution z0 and a parameter defining the thickness of the interfacial film d the density distribution could be calculated by p i z 0 5 p i b u l k tanh 2 z z 0 d using this equation and densities from a value of 10 to 90 the interfacial film thicknesses as a function of increasing sdbs are presented in table 4 the data in table 4 point to adsorption occurring with hydrophilic and the lipophilic interactions of the surfactant components with the water and n dodecane respectively 40 because of the tw and t0 values it was inferred that the sdbs molecule had a stratified adsorption distribution at the oil water interface and that the extent of its extension was more pronounced in the oil phase thereby the sdbs alkane chain extension enhanced interactions between the hydrophobic chain of sdbs and n dodecane hence it was concluded that as the proportion of sdbs was increased interfacial tensions decreased which then resulted in increased interfacial film thicknesses 3 4 adsorption heat of sdbs at n dodecane water interface fig 7 a and 7b show the adsorption heat of sdbs at n dodecane water interface when using different sdbs concentrations at 300 k and different temperatures with 300 mg l of sdbs respectively the adsorption process was exothermic with 17 8 j g 100 mg l heat released at monolayer coverage at 300 k the heat of adsorption grew linearly with increasing sdbs concentrations and attained a value of 39 9 j g at 900 mg l sdbs at a temperature of 300 k as temperatures were increased at a constant sdbs concentration of 300 mg l the heat of adsorption also became greater and attained a maximum value of 31 6 j g at 343 k this temperature was the same as the temperature in the maximum ife in fig 4 above 343 k the heat of adsorption decreased the data in fig 7 provide conspicuous support for the simulation results discussed in the foregoing discussions 41 3 5 effect of sdbs alkali and polymer on surface tension of simulated water samples the surface tension of simulated produced water from asp flooding samples displayed in fig 8 a showed decreasing values between 45 7 to 33 1 mn m the solution conditions of simulated samples maintained constant alkali and polymer hpam decreasing surface tensions as the dosages of sdbs were increased which was in agreement with the expectations of sdbs as an anionic surfactant 42 however vigorous interfacial interactions from produced waters could also result from inherent surfactant activity caused by the presence of asphaltene like molecules these were known to participate in the formation of interfacial films nevertheless the data shown in fig 8a demonstrates that sdbs interactions to reduce surface tension overwhelmed any activity associated with asphaltene type constituents the effects of alkali and polymer dosages on surface tension of simulated produced water samples were investigated and shown in fig 8b and 8c it could be found that the varied dosages of alkali and polymer do not appear to significantly affect the surface tension showed varying values between 37 7 to 36 3 mn m and between 37 2 to 36 9 mn m respectively this result suggests the significance of considering sdbs to become adopted as a surfactant within produced water from asp flooding 4 conclusions oil water interface in the produced water from asp flooding reacted very favorably to the surfactant action of sdbs as evidenced by simulation and experimental data both temperature dependent data at constant temperature and sdbs concentration dependent data were in agreement with simulations showing that sdbs effectively caused decreased surface tensions and ife values and increased adsorption heat and interfacial film thicknesses the experimental data and simulation results suggest that sdbs may be an attractive surfactant of choice for treating produced water from asp flooding although only produced water from the daqing oilfield is studied in this study declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the national natural science foundation of

surfactant monolayer film density profile simulations were accomplished to analyze density distributions of the components in an interface 34 the density distributions along the z axis away from the surface i e perpendicular to it for each of the components in the system are shown in the plots displayed in fig 5 at various sdbs concentrations and fig 6 at various temperatures with a constant sdbs concentration the results presented densities distributions of the alkane chains for the n dodecane sdbs and the water in general the highest simulated densities of the water and oil phases were near 0 992 g cm3 and 0 720 g cm3 respectively which were very close to the density of pure bulk phases of water 0 997 g cm3 and n dodecane 0 725 g cm3 hence it was expected that the simulations provided reliable results all the data displayed in fig 5 and fig 6 show two distinct phases and two symmetrical interfaces when sdbs formed a monolayer as sdbs concentrations were varied at constant temperature and as temperatures were varied at constant sdbs concentration as sdbs concentrations were increased fig 5 the oil and water phase distributions were distinctly separated whereas as temperatures were increased the overlap between the phases was more evident as shown in fig 6d the surfactant distribution presented a wider region with more effective hydrophilic and lipophilic groups at 343 k the overlap region of surfactant concentration within oil phase and water phase was large when the sdbs monolayer film formed at the n dodecane water interface with high interfacial energy and stability the overlap regions created transition zones that contained specific thicknesses in which the water and n dodecane molecules were dissolved with each other the adsorption mechanism in the transition zones was expected to be a result of the strong electronegativity of the surfactant polar group 35 in the transition zones a strong electrostatic attraction exists between the surfactant and water molecules 27 36 with some water molecules adsorbing onto the surfactant polar group thereby expanding the region of the transition zone at the oil water interface simultaneously the lipophilic group of sdbs could penetrate into the oil phase because of van der waals forces and some n dodecane molecules could be dissolved by the sdbs the stability of the n dodecane water interface increase because of the overlap region of surfactant concentration within oil phase and water phase in addition at constant temperature with increasing sdbs concentrations the density of the sdbs was increased with distances from the z axis this effect may be a result of increasing stability of the system with increasing sdbs content however it is also possible that the n dodecane water interface is not strictly planar such that the surfactant molecules are not well arranged neatly at the oil water interface 36 37 3 3 interfacial film thickness although the density profiles provided distinct information about molecule distributions no information plainly reflected the ability of the surfactant to reduce the oil water interfacial tension to develop this insight it would be necessary to probe correlations between interfacial film thicknesses and interfacial tensions 38 hence the interfacial film thicknesses were estimated by using the 90 90 standard 39 a dimensional representation between 90 and 10 of the bulk concentration phase accordingly the interfacial film thicknesses of water and n dodecane were represented by tw and t0 respectively and ttotal represented the interfacial film thickness at 90 of bulk concentration relative the bulk density profile the gibbs interfacial distribution z0 and a parameter defining the thickness of the interfacial film d the density distribution could be calculated by p i z 0 5 p i b u l k tanh 2 z z 0 d using this equation and densities from a value of 10 to 90 the interfacial film thicknesses as a function of increasing sdbs are presented in table 4 the data in table 4 point to adsorption occurring with hydrophilic and the lipophilic interactions of the surfactant components with the water and n dodecane respectively 40 because of the tw and t0 values it was inferred that the sdbs molecule had a stratified adsorption distribution at the oil water interface and that the extent of its extension was more pronounced in the oil phase thereby the sdbs alkane chain extension enhanced interactions between the hydrophobic chain of sdbs and n dodecane hence it was concluded that as the proportion of sdbs was increased interfacial tensions decreased which then resulted in increased interfacial film thicknesses 3 4 adsorption heat of sdbs at n dodecane water interface fig 7 a and 7b show the adsorption heat of sdbs at n dodecane water interface when using different sdbs concentrations at 300 k and different temperatures with 300 mg l of sdbs respectively the adsorption process was exothermic with 17 8 j g 100 mg l heat released at monolayer coverage at 300 k the heat of adsorption grew linearly with increasing sdbs concentrations and attained a value of 39 9 j g at 900 mg l sdbs at a temperature of 300 k as temperatures were increased at a constant sdbs concentration of 300 mg l the heat of adsorption also became greater and attained a maximum value of 31 6 j g at 343 k this temperature was the same as the temperature in the maximum ife in fig 4 above 343 k the heat of adsorption decreased the data in fig 7 provide conspicuous support for the simulation results discussed in the foregoing discussions 41 3 5 effect of sdbs alkali and polymer on surface tension of simulated water samples the surface tension of simulated produced water from asp flooding samples displayed in fig 8 a showed decreasing values between 45 7 to 33 1 mn m the solution conditions of simulated samples maintained constant alkali and polymer hpam decreasing surface tensions as the dosages of sdbs were increased which was in agreement with the expectations of sdbs as an anionic surfactant 42 however vigorous interfacial interactions from produced waters could also result from inherent surfactant activity caused by the presence of asphaltene like molecules these were known to participate in the formation of interfacial films nevertheless the data shown in fig 8a demonstrates that sdbs interactions to reduce surface tension overwhelmed any activity associated with asphaltene type constituents the effects of alkali and polymer dosages on surface tension of simulated produced water samples were investigated and shown in fig 8b and 8c it could be found that the varied dosages of alkali and polymer do not appear to significantly affect the surface tension showed varying values between 37 7 to 36 3 mn m and between 37 2 to 36 9 mn m respectively this result suggests the significance of considering sdbs to become adopted as a surfactant within produced water from asp flooding 4 conclusions oil water interface in the produced water from asp flooding reacted very favorably to the surfactant action of sdbs as evidenced by simulation and experimental data both temperature dependent data at constant temperature and sdbs concentration dependent data were in agreement with simulations showing that sdbs effectively caused decreased surface tensions and ife values and increased adsorption heat and interfacial film thicknesses the experimental data and simulation results suggest that sdbs may be an attractive surfactant of choice for treating produced water from asp flooding although only produced water from the daqing oilfield is studied in this study declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the national natural science foundation of

13973,at present the most considerable defects of electro catalytic process lie in low current efficiency and high specific energy consumption besides electrodes current parameters and reaction system the power supply mode is also of great significance for optimization of electrochemical oxidation traditional power supply modes include constant voltage mode constant current mode and pulse mode based on the concept of limiting current density this paper proposed a linear attenuation power supply mode and set up three different application modes this novel power supply mode is to make the current input into the electro catalytic system continuously decay over reaction time which were simulated adopting a computer controlled programmable dc power acid red g phenol guaiacol salicylic acid and actual water samples from sewage treatment plant were taken as the target organic substance furthermore the advantages and disadvantages of three linear attenuation modes and traditional constant current mode were compared through electrochemical oxidation experiments in terms of varying evaluation parameters the experimental results indicated that mode i same initial current density different attenuation rates obtained higher average current efficiency and lower specific energy consumption than constant current mode in order to achieve the equivalent degradation performance however the decolorization rate and cod removal rate of mode i were lower than those of traditional constant current mode mode ii direct linear attenuation and mode iii constant current before linear attenuation were superior to the traditional constant current mode with the same input total power in the aspects of decolorization rate cod removal rate average current efficiency specific energy consumption and etc those results were further verified in different organic matters wastewater samples and actual wastewater samples for actual wastewater samples treatment the experimental average current efficiency and specific energy consumption of mode ii 6 96 0 237 kwh gcod 1 mode iii 8 89 0 209 kwh gcod 1 and traditional constant current mode 5 18 0 343 kwh gcod 1 indicated that in practical engineering more preferable current efficiency and lower energy consumption can be achieved by mode ii and mode iii over traditional constant current mode those demonstrated that the newly proposed linear attenuation mode especially mode iii can effectively improve the current efficiency of electrochemical oxidation process and reduce the specific energy consumption keywords electrochemical oxidation current input mode linear attenuation mode average current efficiency specific energy consumption 1 introduction electrochemical oxidation eco has been universally acknowledged as a frontier technology and a promising method for treatment of wastewater with organic compounds 1 4 in recent years that technique has been increasingly concerned and investigated by many researchers and has been applied into engineering practice to some extent 5 9 at present the significant shortcomings of eco are relatively low efficiency of current utilization and high energy consumption of degradation which are the most two crucial obstacles during promoting the practical application of that technique 4 10 11 for solving those problems current researches mainly focus on the following aspects 1 electrochemical anode modification anode the core of the eco processes substantially determines whether the effects and results of that technology are satisfactory the catalytic capability improvement stability enhancement and energy consumption reduction are currently the main objectives for the most researchers who concentration on the technical modification of eco anode material 12 16 2 electrochemical oxidation system promotion the novel eco system form namely 2 5d 17 20 and 3d 21 23 electrode system has superiority in terms of improving eco process mass transfer heightening eco degradation performance and reducing energy consumption than the conventional 2d electrode system with an obvious mass transfer restriction 3 electrochemical oxidation operating parameters optimization 13 24 31 current density concentration of organic matter etc are deemed as the influencing factors for the eco performance thereby the optimum conditions for eco degradation of a specific organic substance could be obtained via relevant experiments among the aforesaid operating parameters of the electrochemical oxidation process the current density is a crucial index that affects the current efficiency and energy consumption of the eco degradation process the literature demonstrated that there is a specific limited current density jlim when organic matter of different concentrations is degraded according to the model proposed by c comninellis 32 34 et al the limited current density can be estimated by the following eq 1 1 j lim t 4 f k m c o d t where jlim t corresponds to the limited current density at time t in a m2 f is faraday constant f 96 487 c mol km is mass transfer coefficient in m s and cod t is the concentration of chemical oxygen demand at time t in mol m3 when the actual current density is lower than jlim the electrons derived from eco system is too deficient to completely oxidized the total organic molecules to be processed contraposing the case of using cod to calculate the current efficiency the eco process is in the charge control stage i e the rate is controlled by charge transfer in this step during which the current efficiency is maintained at 100 when the actual current density iapp is higher than jlim the organic molecules can be fully oxidized or mineralized by means of the electrons from eco system at that time there is excess electrons available for side reactions such as oxygen evolution and the eco process is in the mass transfer control stage i e the rate is controlled by mass transfer in this step during which the current efficiency is less than 100 this leads to low current efficiency and high energy consumption in eco process at present most of researches concentrated in the literature were primarily on to investigate the influence of current density on the treatment process while there was scarce report on the impact of current supply mode on the degradation process common power supply modes include constant voltage power supply mode constant current power supply mode and pulsed power supply mode 9 35 the fixed input current is derived from the constant current supply mode where the voltage varies generally increases as the eco proceeds the vast majority of eco degradation processes were carried out through constant current power supply mode currently 36 39 which was attributed to the reasons as follows 1 simple mode with inexpensive equipment easy operation and amenability to automation 2 expedient and straightforward to calculate various process indexes in the sequencing batch electrocatalysis process the solution cod value decreases continuously with the passage of time thus causing the jlim to decline continuously with time as shown in scheme 1 if constant current supply mode is employed for degradation line ab in scheme 1 assuming that the given current density i0 point a in scheme 1 is equal to jlim corresponding to the incipient concentration of organics in solution the current efficiency in the initial reaction stage will be extremely high close to 100 as the solution cod value dropping after a period of reaction jlim corresponding to the solution cod is less than i0 line ad in scheme 1 during which the reaction steps into the mass transfer control stage along with the current efficiency decreasing lower than 100 from the point of view of current efficiency that change is adverse and results in additional energy consumption side reactions increase the effect of current value on the degradation processes has been studied extensively nevertheless the influences of supply mode of current i e power supply mode on the eco processes were seldom reported in the literature to solve that problem a novel current supply mode named current linear attenuation input mode was accordingly proposed and adopted this mode is to make the current input into the electrocatalytic system continuously decay with the passage of reaction time thus reducing the waste of electricity in the later stage of electrocatalytic reaction and improving the average current efficiency of the whole process in this study based on the ti pbo2 electrode acid red g c18h13n3na2o8s2 cas no 3734 67 6 and four other organics including salicylic acid cas no 69 72 7 phenol cas no 108 95 2 guaiacol cas no 90 05 1 and actual water samples from sewage treatment plant were selected for eco processes with current linear attenuation input mode which is a novel current input mode for eco process the degradation performance i e organic removal

chemicals and reagents all chemicals used in the experiment were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent xi an co ltd xi an china and were of analytical grade without further purification the pure water was fabricated in a water purification system eped s2 d eped nanjing china 2 2 electrode preparation titanium mesh purity 99 6 baoti ltd baoji china with a dimension of 5 cm 5 cm were used as the electrode substrate the sb sno2 layer was coated on the titanium mesh through a brush coating method the precursor solution for coating was prepared by dissolving 10 wt sncl4 6h2o and 1 wt sbcl3 in a solution consisting of 10 ml n butanol 10 ml iso propanol 10 ml ethanol and 2 ml hydrochloric acid 37 that precursor solution was brushed onto the titanium mesh and then calcined in a muffle oven at 450 c for 15 min which was repeated for 10 times after annealing at 450 c for 1 h the average oxide loading amount on electrode was 1 1 mg cm 2 after that the pbo2 coating was fabricated by electrodeposition with an inner layer α pbo2 and an outer layer β pbo2 the electrodeposition process was conducted in a two electrode system undercurrent of 10 ma cm 2 the α pbo2 and the β pbo2 layers were prepared by electrodeposition at 40 c for 30 min and at 65 c for 120 min respectively the as prepared ti sb sno2 α pbo2 β pbo2 was adopted as the anode during the eco process details for the brush coating of sb sno2 layer and the electrodeposition process of pbo2 coating can be found in our previous work 15 40 42 2 3 eco process the eco process was conducted in a thermostatic rectangular plexiglass cell using the two electrode configuration and the electrolyte circulated through a peristaltic pump the schematic diagram of eco system is shown in scheme 2 the ti sb sno2 α pbo2 β pbo2 electrode was used as the anode the anode surface area was 37 5 cm2 and two ti mesh with the same size were employed as the cathode the distance between the electrodes was 2 0 cm in the experiment the used power was a programmable dc power itech dc power supply 1t6132b 30v5a and controlled by computer through data design three different current input modes can be realized as shown in scheme 2 before each experiment the experimental data was designed by a date software in terms of the experimental purpose the date software copyright number is 2019sr0998731 then the data was input into the computer and the computer controlled the power supply to output the corresponding current value the volume of the electrolyte solution was 500 ml to maintain the conductivity of the solution 0 1 mol l 1 na2so4 was added into the aqueous solution the experiment was carried out at 25 c maintained through a thermostatic water bath during the 120 mins experiments liquid samples were withdrawn from the electrolytic cell every 20 min a uv visible spectrophotometer uv2600a unico shanghai china was employed to measure the absorbance spectra of arg and the maximum absorption peak of arg was at 505 nm cod of the sample was measured with a water quality tester et99722 lovibond shanghai china toc was analyzed by et1020a toc analyzer 2 4 data analysis the calculation methods of relevant indexes such as arg removal efficiency ηcolor cod removal efficiency ηcod toc removal efficiency ηtoc average current efficiency ce specific energy consumption eccod kwh gcod 1 are shown as the following formulas

the volume of the electrolyte in m3 t is the treatment time in min 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct linear attenuation mode 3 1 1 mode i the same initial current density the direct linear attenuation mode refers to a power supply mode that the current density decreases continuously from the beginning at an invariable rate to facilitate the comparison mode i was established namely different degradation processes started from the same initial current density but decreased at various attenuation rates until the reaction was completed the curves displayed in fig 1 a represent the attenuation process at several different attenuation rates applied herein among which 50 10 illustrates the current density declining uniformly from 50 ma cm 2 to 10 ma cm 2 within 120 min and the other cases can be interpreted in the same analogy fig 1b and c demonstrate the decolorization rate and cod removal rate when regarding reaction time as the x axis according to fig 1b although the decolorization rate could achieve 100 at 120 min the reaction mode with higher attenuation rate showed a relatively lower reaction rate between 20 and 80 min the similar consequence can be acquired through fig 1c the ηcod after 120 min electrolysis was 68 92 67 67 65 73 62 98 and 56 71 when the attenuation mode was 50 50 50 40 50 30 50 20 and 50 10 respectively under identical conditions the ηtoc after 120 min electrolysis was 53 11 48 41 46 07 43 24 and 41 93 those results may reveal that the decolorization rate cod and toc removal rate achieved in degradation process by the linear attenuation mode are not as favorable as that achieved by the constant current mode furthermore the effects of decolorization and degradation were increasingly worse with the growth of attenuation rate whereas the results shown the inset of fig 1b and c were obtained when the index of the x axis was altered from reaction time to input electric quantity q indicating that decolorization rate and cod removal rate of different attenuation rate modes were almost the same under the identical input electric quantity the mathematical relationship between the decolorization rate and input power for all the input mode is ηcolor 105 54 105 7exp q 2364 2 r2 0 999 the mathematical relationship between the cod removal rate and input power for all the input mode is ηcod 0 00808q 0 484 r2 0 999 this indicated that the alteration of the power input mode did not affect the degradation ability of eco process in essence the average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption in different attenuation rate mode are shown as fig 1d demonstrating that the average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption increased and decreased with the attenuation rate reduction respectively it can be concluded that compared with the constant current degradation mode the direct linear attenuation mode was capable to improve the average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption in the degradation process without impairing the degradation capacity moreover better degradation performance can be attained with higher attenuation rate nevertheless the decolorization rate and cod degradation rate of the process with a high attenuation rate were lower than that with the constant current degradation mode which is ascribed to the fact that the input electric quantity in the eco process was not consistent as shown in the inset of fig 1a hence to compare the performance of the constant current mode and the attenuation mode it is necessary to ensure the identical input electric quantity 3 1 2 mode ii the same input electric quantity the characteristic of mode ii was to maintain the input electric quantity consistent during the degradation process which meant that different degradation processes were required to start with different initial current density and different current attenuation rate the variation processes of current density with three different attenuation rates are exhibited in fig 2 a among which 60 0 represents that the current density attenuated steadily from 60 ma cm 2 to 0 ma cm 2 within 120 minutes and the other cases can be interpreted in the same analogy those four power input modes corresponded to an equal input electric quantity over a period of 120 min as shown in the inset of fig 2a fig 2b to c shows the degradation effects with four different power input modes according to fig 2b although the decolorization rate of the four input modes can reach 100 after 120 min of degradation the performance of the linear attenuation mode was more favorable than that of the constant current mode during 20 to 80 min the decolorization rate constant kcolor can be obtained by quasi first order fitting of the decolorization rate data and the results are plotted as inset in fig 2b the kcolor was 0 05622 min 1 0 04201 min 1 0 03654 min 1 and 0 03596 min 1 when the attenuation mode was 60 0 50 10 40 20 and 30 30 respectively the kcolor rose with the increase of attenuation rate the similar result can be acquired from fig 2b and table 1 the ηcod after 120 min electrolysis was 58 5 56 7 53 4 and 52 1 when the attenuation mode was 60 0 50 10 40 20 and 30 30 respectively under identical conditions the ηtoc for arg after 120 min electrolysis was 44 23 41 93 39 41 and 34 27 the cod and toc removal effect was promoted as the attenuation rate went up on the basis of all the experimental results the three removal efficiency indexes were in the following order decolorization rate cod removal rate toc removal rate indicating that the hydroxyl radical attacked the azo bond first hence the destruction process of chromophore i e decolorization process eq 8 is more easily achieved than ring opening and bond breaking process of organic compounds i e cod removal process eq 9 and eq 10 and mineralization process of inorganic matters i e toc removal process eq 9 and eq 10 10 35 39 7 pbo2 h2o pbo2 oh h e 8 r1 n n r2 oh r3 r4 9 r3 oh intermediate co2 h2o 10 r4 oh intermediate co2 h2o the average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption in different attenuation rate modes are shown as fig 2d it can be observed from fig 2d that the average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption increased and decreased with the growth of the attenuation rate respectively which illustrated that compared with the constant current mode the direct linear attenuation mode could accelerate the decolorization reaction improve the cod and toc removal rate and the average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption on the premise that the input electric quantity was consistent and the performance can be optimized with higher attenuation rate although the total power input is consistent the power input in the mode with large attenuation rate is large at the initial stage of the reaction as shown in the inset of fig 2a the amount of organic matters in the solution at the initial stage of the reaction is large direct attenuation mode makes the input of electricity mainly concentratat the initial stage of the reaction which can effectively ensure the production of oh eq 7 when the oh is concentrated in the early stages of the electrocatalytic reaction the huge organic matters are degraded by oh eq 9 and eq 10 which can effectively ensure the efficient use of electrons 3 1 3 mode ii for different organic materials to verify the reliability of mode ii the same eco system and the same current attenuation mode were employed for degradation of three other organics phenol guaiacol and salicylic acid the results are shown as fig 3 table 1 and table 2 as can be seen from fig 3a ηcod for aniline after 120 min electrolysis was 55 9 54 4 53 0 and 46 3 when the attenuation mode was 60 0 50 10 40 20 and 30 30 respectively under identical conditions the ηtoc was 47 28 44 10 41 75 and 35 73 as shown in table 1 the ace for phenol increased from 7 65 to 9 38 with the raising of the attenuation rate from 30 30 to 60 0 and eccod decreased from 0 219 kw h gcod 1 to 0 172 kw h gcod 1 as shown in table 2 similar results can be obtained when guaiacol and salicylic acid were electrolyzed all these results repeatedly indicates that compared with constant current degradation mode the direct linear attenuation mode could effectively improve the cod and toc removal rate and average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption on the premise that the input electric quantity was consistent regardless of the type of organic matters furthermore a higher attenuation rate can result in a more favorable effect which convincingly demonstrate that mode ii has universality to some extent 3 2 mode iii constant current density followed by linear attenuation mode 3 2 1 mode iii for arg it can be deduced from the degradation result of mode ii that at the preliminary stage of eco process supplying large electric quantity for system was favorable to enhance the degradation effect mode iii was consequently proposed namely the constant current degradation mode was maintained for a period at the initial stage of reaction and the current density was subsequently reduced at a certain attenuation rate until the end of the reaction to compare the degradation effect of mode iii with that of constant current mode as same as mode ii three input modes were designed on the premise of ensuring the identical input electric quantity as shown in fig 4 a 60 60 0 represented that within 120 minutes the current density maintained at 60 ma cm 2 during the first 40 minutes and then steadily attenuated to 0 ma cm 2 the other cases can be interpreted in the same analogy the degradation effects in four different input mode are plotted in fig 4b c and table 1 as observed from fig 4b ηcod after 120 min electrolysis was 56 1 54 1 54 1 and 43 2 when the attenuation mode was 60 60 0 60 60 7 60 60 12 and 40 40 40 respectively the ηtoc for arg after 120 min electrolysis was 46 91 44 39 44 20 and 32 60 under the aforementioned conditions fig 4c illustrated that the same conclusion as cod removal rate can be drawn in the aspect of average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption these results indicated that mode iii was significantly superior to the constant current mode in terms of cod removal rate average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption besides the degradation performance was prompted by longer constant current time and higher attenuation rate 3 2 2 mode iii for different organic materials to verify the reliability of mode iii the same eco system and the same current attenuation mode were employed for degradation of three other organics phenol guaiacol and salicylic acid the results are shown as fig 5 table 1 and table 2 as can be seen from fig 5b ηcod for guaiacol after 120 min electrolysis was 47 5 41 2 38 9 and 35 0 when the attenuation mode was 60 60 0 60 60 7 60 60 12 and 40 40 40 respectively the ace for guaiacol increased from 9 92 to 11 89 with the raising of the attenuation rate from 40 40 40 to 60 60 0 and eccod decreases from 0 189 kw h gcod 1 to 0 159 kw h gcod 1 as shown in table 2 similar results can be obtained when aniline and salicylic acid are electrolyzed all these results repeatedly indicated that compared with constant current degradation mode mode iii i e the constant current followed by linear attenuation mode could effectively improve the cod removal rate and average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption on the premise that the input electric quantity was consistent regardless of the type of organic matters 3 3 comparison of different power supply modes with ensuring the uniform input electric quantity the effects of varying power supply modes i e constant current mode mode ii and mode iii on the electrochemical degradation performance for organic compounds were compared 60 0 represents the same meaning as described in 3 1 2 the degradation result under the constant current mode in 30 ma cm 2 is plotted as curve 30 30 60 60 0 signifies the condition of which the current density was maintained at 60 ma cm 2 for the first 20 min and was then reduced to 0 ma cm 2 for the last 80 min hence there was a difference that the total reaction time of 60 60 0 for 100 min was shorter than those of 60 0 and 30 30 for 120 min attributed to maintaining consistent input electric quantity table 3 the results of electrochemical degradation for arg in different power supply mode are exhibited in fig 6 and table 4 according to fig 6a although the decolorization rate of three modes could reach 100 at 120 min there still was disparity among those modes in efficiency respect especially in the early stage that is the efficiency of 60 60 0 ranked first followed by mode 60 0 and the constant current supply mode presented the most unsatisfactory decolorization efficiency the decolorization rate constant shown in the inset of fig 6a also conforms to this variation rule fig 6b and table 4 indicates that the cod removal rate of modes 60 60 0 60 0 and 30 30 at the end of reaction were 63 57 58 50 and 42 81 besides 46 69 44 23 and 34 27 of the toc removal rate could be achieved respectively table 4 reveals that the mode 60 60 0 showed the most favorable performance in terms of average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption followed by 60 0 while the constant current mode 30 30 had the worst effect on both aspects therefore it could be reasonably deduced that with the consistent power input linear attenuation power supply mode had the superiority to effectively improve the performance of electrochemical degradation i e decolorization rate cod removal rate toc removal rate and average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption by controlling the distribution of input power during the reaction namely provide the majority of power in the early reaction stage instead of the late period furthermore the prominent merits of the mode 60 60 0 implied that the mode supplying constant current first and linear attenuation current later was superior to the mode of simple linear attenuation current in regard to promoting the degradation performance more effectively the actual wastewater sample aws were adopted and tested for verifying the practical applicability of the linear attenuation power supply mode for which the actual wastewater with the cod of around 230 mg l 1 sampled from a secondary sink in the sewage treatment system of an industrial enterprise in shaanxi province was used the experiment was conducted in accordance with the previous approach that is the constant current mode mode ii and mode iii were employed for electrochemical degradation of the aforesaid actual water sample under the condition of identical total input power the results exhibited in fig 7 and table 4 demonstrate that the consistent consequences with the aforementioned inference could be concluded as well whether the experimental treatment subject was arg dye wastewater or aws namely the linear attenuation power supply mode especially the mode input constant current first and linear attenuation current later showed the most favorable performance on vast majority of evaluation parameters i e cod removal rate average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption 4 conclusion a linear attenuation power supply mode was proposed in this paper and three application modes were set up which were respectively compared with the traditional constant current power supply mode the experimental results revealed that the higher average current efficiency and lower specific energy consumption could be obtained by mode i i e same initial current density different attenuation rates than by constant current mode in the premise of ensuring the identical degradation capacity however the decolorization rate and cod

13973,at present the most considerable defects of electro catalytic process lie in low current efficiency and high specific energy consumption besides electrodes current parameters and reaction system the power supply mode is also of great significance for optimization of electrochemical oxidation traditional power supply modes include constant voltage mode constant current mode and pulse mode based on the concept of limiting current density this paper proposed a linear attenuation power supply mode and set up three different application modes this novel power supply mode is to make the current input into the electro catalytic system continuously decay over reaction time which were simulated adopting a computer controlled programmable dc power acid red g phenol guaiacol salicylic acid and actual water samples from sewage treatment plant were taken as the target organic substance furthermore the advantages and disadvantages of three linear attenuation modes and traditional constant current mode were compared through electrochemical oxidation experiments in terms of varying evaluation parameters the experimental results indicated that mode i same initial current density different attenuation rates obtained higher average current efficiency and lower specific energy consumption than constant current mode in order to achieve the equivalent degradation performance however the decolorization rate and cod removal rate of mode i were lower than those of traditional constant current mode mode ii direct linear attenuation and mode iii constant current before linear attenuation were superior to the traditional constant current mode with the same input total power in the aspects of decolorization rate cod removal rate average current efficiency specific energy consumption and etc those results were further verified in different organic matters wastewater samples and actual wastewater samples for actual wastewater samples treatment the experimental average

practical engineering more preferable current efficiency and lower energy consumption can be achieved by mode ii and mode iii over traditional constant current mode those demonstrated that the newly proposed linear attenuation mode especially mode iii can effectively improve the current efficiency of electrochemical oxidation process and reduce the specific energy consumption keywords electrochemical oxidation current input mode linear attenuation mode average current efficiency specific energy consumption 1 introduction electrochemical oxidation eco has been universally acknowledged as a frontier technology and a promising method for treatment of wastewater with organic compounds 1 4 in recent years that technique has been increasingly concerned and investigated by many researchers and has been applied into engineering practice to some extent 5 9 at present the significant shortcomings of eco are relatively low efficiency of current utilization and high energy consumption of degradation which are the most two crucial obstacles during promoting the practical application of that technique 4 10 11 for solving those problems current researches mainly focus on the following aspects 1 electrochemical anode modification anode the core of the eco processes substantially determines whether the effects and results of that technology are satisfactory the catalytic capability improvement stability enhancement and energy consumption reduction are currently the main objectives for the most researchers who concentration on the technical modification of eco anode material 12 16 2 electrochemical oxidation system promotion the novel eco system form namely 2 5d 17 20 and 3d 21 23 electrode system has superiority in terms of improving eco process mass transfer heightening eco degradation performance and reducing energy consumption than the conventional 2d electrode system with an obvious mass transfer restriction 3 electrochemical oxidation operating parameters optimization 13 24 31 current density concentration of organic matter etc are deemed as the influencing factors for the eco performance thereby the optimum conditions for eco degradation of a specific organic substance could be obtained via relevant experiments among the aforesaid operating parameters of the electrochemical oxidation process the current density is a crucial index that affects the current efficiency and energy consumption of the eco degradation process the literature demonstrated that there is a specific limited current density jlim when organic matter of different concentrations is degraded according to the model proposed by c comninellis 32 34 et al the limited current density can be estimated by the following eq 1 1 j lim t 4 f k m c o d t where jlim t corresponds to the limited current density at time t in a m2 f is faraday constant f 96 487 c mol km is mass transfer coefficient in m s and cod t is the concentration of chemical oxygen demand at time t in mol m3 when the actual current density is lower than jlim the electrons derived from eco system is too deficient to completely oxidized the total organic molecules to be processed contraposing the case of using cod to calculate the current efficiency the eco process is in the charge control stage i e the rate is controlled by charge transfer in this step during which the current efficiency is maintained at 100 when the actual current density iapp is higher than jlim the organic molecules can be fully oxidized or mineralized by means of the electrons from eco system at that time there is excess electrons available for side reactions such as oxygen evolution and the eco process is in the mass transfer control stage i e the rate is controlled by mass transfer in this step during which the current efficiency is less than 100 this leads to low current efficiency and high energy consumption in eco process at present most of researches concentrated in the literature were primarily on to investigate the influence of current density on the treatment process while there was scarce report on the impact of current supply mode on the degradation process common power supply modes include constant voltage power supply mode constant current power supply mode and pulsed power supply mode 9 35 the fixed input current is derived from the constant current supply mode where the voltage varies generally increases as the eco proceeds the vast majority of eco degradation processes were carried out through constant current power supply mode currently 36 39 which was attributed to the reasons as follows 1 simple mode with inexpensive equipment easy operation and amenability to automation 2 expedient and straightforward to calculate various process indexes in the sequencing batch electrocatalysis process the solution cod value decreases continuously with the passage of time thus causing the jlim to decline continuously with time as shown in scheme 1 if constant current supply mode is employed for degradation line ab in scheme 1 assuming that the given current density i0 point a in scheme 1 is equal to jlim corresponding to the incipient concentration of organics in solution the current efficiency in the initial reaction stage will be extremely high close to 100 as the solution cod value dropping after a period of reaction jlim corresponding to the solution cod is less than i0 line ad in scheme 1 during which the reaction steps into the mass transfer control stage along with the current efficiency decreasing lower than 100 from the point of view of current efficiency that change is adverse and results in additional energy consumption side reactions increase the effect of current value on the degradation processes has been studied extensively nevertheless the influences of supply mode of current i e power supply mode on the eco processes were seldom reported in the literature to solve that problem a novel current supply mode named current linear attenuation input mode was accordingly proposed and adopted this mode is to make the current input into the electrocatalytic system continuously decay with the passage of reaction time thus reducing the waste of electricity in the later stage of electrocatalytic reaction and improving the average current efficiency of the whole process in this study based on the ti pbo2 electrode acid red g c18h13n3na2o8s2 cas no 3734 67 6 and four other organics including salicylic acid cas no 69 72 7 phenol cas no 108 95 2 guaiacol cas no 90 05 1 and actual water samples from sewage treatment plant were selected for eco processes with current linear attenuation input mode which is a novel current input mode for eco process the degradation performance i e organic removal efficiency cod removal efficiency toc removal efficiency average current efficiency and specific energy consumption was analyzed for different power supply modes 2 materials and experiment 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals used in the experiment were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent xi an co ltd xi an china and were of analytical grade without further purification the pure water was fabricated in a water purification system eped s2 d eped nanjing china 2 2 electrode preparation titanium mesh purity 99 6 baoti ltd baoji china with a dimension of 5 cm 5 cm were used as the electrode substrate the sb sno2 layer was coated on the titanium mesh through a brush coating method the precursor solution for coating was prepared by dissolving 10 wt sncl4 6h2o and 1 wt sbcl3 in a solution consisting of 10 ml n butanol 10 ml iso propanol 10 ml ethanol and 2 ml hydrochloric acid 37 that precursor solution was brushed onto the titanium mesh and then calcined in a muffle oven at 450 c for 15 min which was repeated for 10 times after annealing at 450 c for 1 h the average oxide loading amount on electrode was 1 1 mg cm 2 after that the pbo2 coating was fabricated by electrodeposition with an inner layer α pbo2 and an outer layer β pbo2 the electrodeposition process was conducted in a two electrode system undercurrent of 10 ma cm 2 the α pbo2 and the β pbo2 layers were prepared by electrodeposition at 40 c for 30 min and at 65 c for 120 min respectively the as prepared ti sb sno2 α pbo2 β pbo2 was adopted as the anode during the eco process details for the brush coating of sb sno2 layer and the electrodeposition process of pbo2 coating can be found in our previous work 15 40 42 2 3 eco process the eco process was conducted in a thermostatic rectangular plexiglass cell using the two electrode configuration and the electrolyte circulated through a peristaltic pump the schematic diagram of eco system is shown in scheme 2 the ti sb sno2 α pbo2 β pbo2 electrode was used as the anode the anode surface area was 37 5 cm2 and two ti mesh with the same size were employed as the cathode the distance between the electrodes was 2 0 cm in the experiment the used power was a programmable dc power itech dc power supply 1t6132b 30v5a and controlled by computer through data design three different current input modes can be realized as shown in scheme 2 before each experiment the experimental data was designed by a date software in terms of the experimental purpose the date software copyright number is 2019sr0998731 then the data was input into the computer and the computer controlled the power supply to output the corresponding current value the volume of the electrolyte solution was 500 ml to maintain the conductivity of the solution 0 1 mol l 1 na2so4 was added into the aqueous solution the experiment was carried out at 25 c maintained through a thermostatic water bath during the 120 mins experiments liquid samples were withdrawn from the electrolytic cell every 20 min a uv visible spectrophotometer uv2600a unico shanghai china was employed to measure the absorbance spectra of arg and the maximum absorption peak of arg was at 505 nm cod of the sample was measured with a water quality tester et99722 lovibond shanghai china toc was analyzed by et1020a toc analyzer 2 4 data analysis the calculation methods of relevant indexes such as arg removal efficiency ηcolor cod removal efficiency ηcod toc removal efficiency ηtoc average current efficiency ce specific energy consumption eccod kwh gcod 1 are shown as the following formulas

the volume of the electrolyte in m3 t is the treatment time in min 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct linear attenuation mode 3 1 1 mode i the same initial current density the direct linear attenuation mode refers to a power supply mode that the current density decreases continuously from the beginning at an invariable rate to facilitate the comparison mode i was established namely different degradation processes started from the same initial current density but decreased at various attenuation rates until the reaction was completed the curves displayed in fig 1 a represent the attenuation process at several different attenuation rates applied herein among which 50 10 illustrates the current density declining uniformly from 50 ma cm 2 to 10 ma cm 2 within 120 min and the other cases can be interpreted in the same analogy fig 1b and c demonstrate the decolorization rate and cod removal rate when regarding reaction time as the x axis according to fig 1b although the decolorization rate could achieve 100 at 120 min the reaction mode with higher attenuation rate showed a relatively lower reaction rate between 20 and 80 min the similar consequence can be acquired through fig 1c the ηcod after 120 min electrolysis was 68 92 67 67 65 73 62 98 and 56 71 when the attenuation mode was 50 50 50 40 50 30 50 20 and 50 10 respectively under identical conditions the ηtoc after 120 min electrolysis was 53 11 48 41 46 07 43 24 and 41 93 those results may reveal that the decolorization rate cod and toc removal rate achieved in degradation process by the linear attenuation mode are not as favorable as that achieved by the constant current mode furthermore the effects of decolorization and degradation were increasingly worse with the growth of attenuation rate whereas the results shown the inset of fig 1b and c were obtained when the index of the x axis was altered from reaction time to input electric quantity q indicating that decolorization rate and cod removal rate of different attenuation rate modes were almost the same under the identical input electric quantity the mathematical relationship between the decolorization rate and input power for all the input mode is ηcolor 105 54 105 7exp q 2364 2 r2 0 999 the mathematical relationship between the cod removal rate and input power for all the input mode is ηcod 0 00808q 0 484 r2 0 999 this indicated that the alteration of the power input mode did not affect the degradation ability of eco process in essence the average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption in different attenuation rate mode are shown as fig 1d demonstrating that the average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption increased and decreased with the attenuation rate reduction respectively it can be concluded that compared with the constant current degradation mode the direct linear attenuation mode was capable to improve the average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption in the degradation process without impairing the degradation capacity moreover better degradation performance can be attained with higher attenuation rate nevertheless the decolorization rate and cod degradation rate of the process with a high attenuation rate were lower than that with the constant current degradation mode which is ascribed to the fact that the input electric quantity in the eco process was not consistent as shown in the inset of fig 1a hence to compare the performance of the constant current mode and the attenuation mode it is necessary to ensure the identical input electric quantity 3 1 2 mode ii the same input electric quantity the characteristic of mode ii was to maintain the input electric quantity consistent during the degradation process which meant that different degradation processes were required to start with different initial current density and different current attenuation rate the variation processes of current density with three different attenuation rates are exhibited in fig 2 a among which 60 0 represents that the current density attenuated steadily from 60 ma cm 2 to 0 ma cm 2 within 120 minutes and the other cases can be interpreted in the same analogy those four power input modes corresponded to an equal input electric quantity over a period of 120 min as shown in the inset of fig 2a fig 2b to c shows the degradation effects with four different power input modes according to fig 2b although the decolorization rate of the four input modes can reach 100 after 120 min of degradation the performance of the linear attenuation mode was more favorable than that of the constant current mode during 20 to 80 min the decolorization rate constant kcolor can be obtained by quasi first order fitting of the decolorization rate data and the results are plotted as inset in fig 2b the kcolor was 0 05622 min 1 0 04201 min 1 0 03654 min 1 and 0 03596 min 1 when the attenuation mode was 60 0 50 10 40 20 and 30 30 respectively the kcolor rose with the increase of attenuation rate the similar result can be acquired from fig 2b and table 1 the ηcod after 120 min electrolysis was 58 5 56 7 53 4 and 52 1 when the attenuation mode was 60 0 50 10 40 20 and 30 30 respectively under identical conditions the ηtoc for arg after 120 min electrolysis was 44 23 41 93 39 41 and 34 27 the cod and toc removal effect was promoted as the attenuation rate went up on the basis of all the experimental results the three removal efficiency indexes were in the following order decolorization rate cod removal rate toc removal rate indicating that the hydroxyl radical attacked the azo bond first hence the destruction process of chromophore i e decolorization process eq 8 is more easily achieved than ring opening and bond breaking process of organic compounds i e cod removal process eq 9 and eq 10 and mineralization process of inorganic matters i e toc removal process eq 9 and eq 10 10 35 39 7 pbo2 h2o pbo2 oh h e 8 r1 n n r2 oh r3 r4 9 r3 oh intermediate co2 h2o 10 r4 oh intermediate co2 h2o the average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption in different attenuation rate modes are shown as fig 2d it can be observed from fig 2d that the average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption increased and decreased with the growth of the attenuation rate respectively which illustrated that compared with the constant current mode the direct linear attenuation mode could accelerate the decolorization reaction improve the cod and toc removal rate and the average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption on the premise that the input electric quantity was consistent and the performance can be optimized with higher attenuation rate although the total power input is consistent the power input in the mode with large attenuation rate is large at the initial stage of the reaction as shown in the inset of fig 2a the amount of organic matters in the solution at the initial stage of the reaction is large direct attenuation mode makes the input of electricity mainly concentratat the initial stage of the reaction which can effectively ensure the production of oh eq 7 when the oh is concentrated in the early stages of the electrocatalytic reaction the huge organic matters are degraded by oh eq 9 and eq 10 which can effectively ensure the efficient use of electrons 3 1 3 mode ii for different organic materials to verify the reliability of mode ii the same eco system and the same current attenuation mode were employed for degradation of three other organics phenol guaiacol and salicylic acid the results are shown as fig 3 table 1 and table 2 as can be seen from fig 3a ηcod for aniline after 120 min electrolysis was 55 9 54 4 53 0 and 46 3 when the attenuation mode was 60 0 50 10 40 20 and 30 30 respectively under identical conditions the ηtoc was 47 28 44 10 41 75 and 35 73 as shown in table 1 the ace for phenol increased from 7 65 to 9 38 with the raising of the attenuation rate from 30 30 to 60 0 and eccod decreased from 0 219 kw h gcod 1 to 0 172 kw h gcod 1 as shown in table 2 similar results can be obtained when guaiacol and salicylic acid were electrolyzed all these results repeatedly indicates that compared with constant current degradation mode the direct linear attenuation mode could effectively improve the cod and toc removal rate and average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption on the premise that the input electric quantity was consistent regardless of the type of organic matters furthermore a higher attenuation rate can result in a more favorable effect which convincingly demonstrate that mode ii has universality to some extent 3 2 mode iii constant current density followed by linear attenuation mode 3 2 1 mode iii for arg it can be deduced from the degradation result of mode ii that at the preliminary stage of eco process supplying large electric quantity for system was favorable to enhance the degradation effect mode iii was consequently proposed namely the constant current degradation mode was maintained for a period at the initial stage of reaction and the current density was subsequently reduced at a certain attenuation rate until the end of the reaction to compare the degradation effect of mode iii with that of constant current mode as same as mode ii three input modes were designed on the premise of ensuring the identical input electric quantity as shown in fig 4 a 60 60 0 represented that within 120 minutes the current density maintained at 60 ma cm 2 during the first 40 minutes and then steadily attenuated to 0 ma cm 2 the other cases can be interpreted in the same analogy the degradation effects in four different input mode are plotted in fig 4b c and table 1 as observed from fig 4b ηcod after 120 min electrolysis was 56 1 54 1 54 1 and 43 2 when the attenuation mode was 60 60 0 60 60 7 60 60 12 and 40 40 40 respectively the ηtoc for arg after 120 min electrolysis was 46 91 44 39 44 20 and 32 60 under the aforementioned conditions fig 4c illustrated that the same conclusion as cod removal rate can be drawn in the aspect of average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption these results indicated that mode iii was significantly superior to the constant current mode in terms of cod removal rate average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption besides the degradation performance was prompted by longer constant current time and higher attenuation rate 3 2 2 mode iii for different organic materials to verify the reliability of mode iii the same eco system and the same current attenuation mode were employed for degradation of three other organics phenol guaiacol and salicylic acid the results are shown as fig 5 table 1 and table 2 as can be seen from fig 5b ηcod for guaiacol after 120 min electrolysis was 47 5 41 2 38 9 and 35 0 when the attenuation mode was 60 60 0 60 60 7 60 60 12 and 40 40 40 respectively the ace for guaiacol increased from 9 92 to 11 89 with the raising of the attenuation rate from 40 40 40 to 60 60 0 and eccod decreases from 0 189 kw h gcod 1 to 0 159 kw h gcod 1 as shown in table 2 similar results can be obtained when aniline and salicylic acid are electrolyzed all these results repeatedly indicated that compared with constant current degradation mode mode iii i e the constant current followed by linear attenuation mode could effectively improve the cod removal rate and average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption on the premise that the input electric quantity was consistent regardless of the type of organic matters 3 3 comparison of different power supply modes with ensuring the uniform input electric quantity the effects of varying power supply modes i e constant current mode mode ii and mode iii on the electrochemical degradation performance for organic compounds were compared 60 0 represents the same meaning as described in 3 1 2 the degradation result under the constant current mode in 30 ma cm 2 is plotted as curve 30 30 60 60 0 signifies the condition of which the current density was maintained at 60 ma cm 2 for the first 20 min and was then reduced to 0 ma cm 2 for the last 80 min hence there was a difference that the total reaction time of 60 60 0 for 100 min was shorter than those of 60 0 and 30 30 for 120 min attributed to maintaining consistent input electric quantity table 3 the results of electrochemical degradation for arg in different power supply mode are exhibited in fig 6 and table 4 according to fig 6a although the decolorization rate of three modes could reach 100 at 120 min there still was disparity among those modes in efficiency respect especially in the early stage that is the efficiency of 60 60 0 ranked first followed by mode 60 0 and the constant current supply mode presented the most unsatisfactory decolorization efficiency the decolorization rate constant shown in the inset of fig 6a also conforms to this variation rule fig 6b and table 4 indicates that the cod removal rate of modes 60 60 0 60 0 and 30 30 at the end of reaction were 63 57 58 50 and 42 81 besides 46 69 44 23 and 34 27 of the toc removal rate could be achieved respectively table 4 reveals that the mode 60 60 0 showed the most favorable performance in terms of average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption followed by 60 0 while the constant current mode 30 30 had the worst effect on both aspects therefore it could be reasonably deduced that with the consistent power input linear attenuation power supply mode had the superiority to effectively improve the performance of electrochemical degradation i e decolorization rate cod removal rate toc removal rate and average current efficiency and reduce the specific energy consumption by controlling the distribution of input power during the reaction namely provide the majority of power in the early reaction stage instead of the late period furthermore the prominent merits of the mode 60 60 0 implied that the mode supplying constant current first and linear attenuation current later was superior to the mode of simple linear attenuation current in regard to promoting the degradation performance more effectively the actual wastewater sample aws were adopted and tested for verifying the practical applicability of the linear attenuation power supply mode for which the actual wastewater with the cod of around 230 mg l 1 sampled from a secondary sink in the sewage treatment system of an industrial enterprise in shaanxi province was used the experiment was conducted in accordance with the previous approach that is the constant current mode mode ii and mode iii were employed for electrochemical degradation of the aforesaid actual water sample under the condition of identical total input power the results exhibited in fig 7 and table 4 demonstrate that the consistent consequences with the aforementioned inference could be concluded as well whether the experimental treatment subject was arg dye wastewater or aws namely the linear attenuation power supply mode especially the mode input constant current first and linear attenuation current later showed the most favorable performance on vast majority of evaluation parameters i e cod removal rate average current efficiency and the specific energy consumption 4 conclusion a linear attenuation power supply mode was proposed in this paper and three application modes were set up which were respectively compared with the traditional constant current power supply mode the experimental results revealed that the higher average current efficiency and lower specific energy consumption could be obtained by mode i i e same initial current density different attenuation rates than by constant current mode in the premise of ensuring the identical degradation capacity however the decolorization rate and cod removal rate of mode i were lower than those of traditional constant current mode mode ii i e direct linear attenuation and mode iii i e constant current before linear attenuation were superior to the traditional constant current mode with the same input total power in terms of decolorization rate cod removal rate average current efficiency specific energy consumption and etc especially among those modes involved in this research mode iii adopting the constant current first and the linear attenuation current later presented the most favorable superiority in the aspects of those evaluation parameter the inferences were further verified in different organic substance indicating that the effective current efficiency improvement of the eco process and the reduction of energy consumption

synthesized cu cu2o cuo c was collected washed with water and then dried for experimental usage 2 4 characterizations the d8 advance bruker powder diffractometer was used to record the x ray powder

fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra were recorded on the nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer thermo fischer scientiﬁc waltham ma usa the uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu kyoto japan was used to determine ciprofloxacin and tetracycline concentrations at 278 and 272 nm respectively 2 5 adsorption test herein experimental batches were separately carried out at neutral ph for a typical run the adsorbent of cu cu2o cuo c 0 5 g l was added into a triangular beaker 250 ml containing 50 ml each cip or ttc solution the samples were shaken 200 rpm at room temperature firstly we investigated the effect of contact time on adsorption capacity of antibiotic solutions 40 mg l over cu cu2o cuo c at the moments 0 10 30 60 90 120 240 and 360 min at the same trend we employed the effect of cip 10 60 mg l and ttc 10 100 mg l concentrations at equilibrium time the concentration was measured by uv vis spectrophotometer based on the beer lambert law the relationship between removal efficiency h and equilibrium concentration eq 1 between adsorption capacity q mg g and dosage g l eq 2 could be described by two equations below 1 h c o c e c o 100 2 q c o c e m v where co and ce mg l are defined as initial and equilibrium concentration of cip and ttc m g and v l are the mass of adsorbent and volume of solution respectively 2 6 statistical error analysis of the modelling the experimental data were converted to fit with nonlinear kinetic and isotherm models using error functions such as radj 2 mre and sse as described carefully in supporting material file in addition the nonlinear models for kinetics pseudo first order and pseudo second order isotherms langmuir freundlich and temkin intraparticle diffusion and thermodynamic study were described in the supporting material 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characterization of hkust 1 and cu cu2o cuo c materials initially we explored the morphological characteristics of hkust 1 framework and cu cu2o cuo c composite through sem and tem techniques at various scales accordingly octahedral crystals of hkust 1 as shown in fig 1 a b can be apparently observed although there are some smaller crystals hanging on the edges of larger crystal the size of these edges is ranged from 10 to 20 μm in length this observation is highly in line with previous studies by phan et al when they successfully synthesized the hkust 1 crystals by the same solvothermal method 6 by contrast the morphology of cu cu2o cuo c is found to be very different with that of hkust 1 indeed fig 1 c show a noticeable deficiency in crystallinity trending an amorphous nature of cu cu2o cuo c with a strongly defective surface tem images in fig 1 d f also many affirm the encapsulation of cu cu2o cuo particles dark aggregation in carbon coatings bright region pyrolyzing at high temperature 700 c mostly deconstructed the crystallinity of hkust 1 increasing the aggregation of particles within hollow carbon matrix kar and srivastava found the same phenomenon since preparing cu cu2o c and cuo cu2o c catalysts supported carbon material 20 the remarkable change in morphological properties between hkust 1 and cu cu2o cuo c can lead to a respective movement in crystalline structure which could also be supported by the xrd diffraction technique fig 2 at a glance the crystalline diffraction profiles of composite and its precursor is absolutely distinctive while most of the typical peaks of hkust 1 clearly distributed at very low degrees 10 30 the figure for cu cu2o cuo c is ranged from 30 to 80 with some peaks at 11 7 220 17 3 551 and 19 0 440 the diffraction profile for hkust 1 herein is perfectly commensurate with one previous publication 6 combining with sem image data mentioned above to confirm the successful carbonization of this cu mof moreover we observed the presence of cu jcpds no 04 0836 cu2o jcpds no 75 1531 and cuo trace jcpds no 45 0937 on cu cu2o cuo c fig 3 the position of these peaks is well correspondent with the reports by karimzadeh et al 21 and zhao et al 22 suggesting that cu cu2o cuo c composite has been synthesized successfully note that oxidation states for cu found here including 0 1 and 2 are very typical peng et al demonstrated the deconstruction of hkust 1 mof structure at 600 c along with the transformation of cu ii o coordination bonds into cu ii o ionic bonds 14 also kar and srivastava indicated that the release of volatile molecules h2o co2 etc from carboxylic acid of mof crystals under such high temperature could leave c skeletons and chains 20 liu et al interpreted that these carbon atoms are very active because they can join in situ reduction of copper i ii oxides summarily we found all of the most common oxidation states of copper after pyrolysis of hkust 1 to gain insight into chemical bonds on the surface of materials fourier transform infrared spectroscopy profiles of hkust 1 and cu cu2o cuo c were recorded and shown in fig 3 most importantly chemical bonds of cu i o and cu ii o have been found on cu cu2o cuo c through two very typical footprints at around 630 cm 1 and 500 cm 1 respectively these outcomes are highly agreeable with recent studies by huang et al which detected the same cu ii o position on fe3o4 cuo 23 and by ho et al which revealed cu i o on faceted cu2o particles 24 zhang et al reported the same results of cuo cu2o porous composites derived from cu btc btc 1 3 5 benzenetricarboxylicacid 25 finally other chemical bonds are also observed on ft ir profiles of both hkust 1 and cu cu2o cuo c ch stretching oh deformation 1370 cm 1 co aromatic cc stretching 1620 cm 1 oh alcohol adsorbed h2o 3340 cm 1 the raman spectrum of cu cu2o cuo c aids to better understand the graphitic nature of supported carbon in composite structure according to fig 4 two conspicuous peaks at around 1350 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 were depicted for d band and g band of the carbon material respectively in theory the crystal structure of supported carbon matrix can be reflected by the ratio between d band and g band intensities i d i g 26 as shown in fig 4 we found the following ratio in cu cu2o cuo c composite i d i g 1 1 which was slightly higher than that of cu cu2o c and cuo cu2o c by kar and srivastava revealing that amorphous carbon herein is more dominant than graphitic carbon domain at higher temperature 700 c 20 in addition we employed the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm measurement of cu cu2o cuo c the result implies that this carbonized material exhibited an outstanding porous structure with specific surface area of 80 m2 g but it was significantly lower than that of hkust 1 precursor 1050 m2 g the decrease of pyrolysis product in surface area is in line with the work by peng et al 14 hkust 1 achieves such large bet surface area pore volume thanks to its a very high porous organic network while the pyrolysis process collapsed this framework decreasing the porosity of cu cu2o cuo c however with an enough good surface area it is expected to reach enhanced diffusion of adsorbate during adsorption process in this study finally we explored the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy profile of cu cu2o cuo c composite to shed light on the oxidation state of copper as well as other chemical bonds on the surface of the material fig 5 a shows a general survey of atoms incorporated in cu cu2o cuo c composite with the existence of typical signals at three various binding energies c 1s 284 291 ev o 1s 528 538 ev and cu 2p 936 967 ev a general comparison in peak intensity among c o and cu signals evidently reveals a higher density for carbon elements than others offering a larger degree of graphitic carbon 27 this phenomenon may affect the dispersion of cu species supported in hollow carbon matrix hence expect to improve adsorption performance of cu cu2o cuo c composite in detail the spectrum data of c 1s can be divided into four well fitted curves confirming the presence of c containing chemical bonds co bonds of alcoholic groups 286 1 ev oco bonds of carboxyl groups 287 4 ev co bonds of carbonyl carboxyl groups 288 0 ev and π π bonds 290 0 ev 22 28 more important the calculated quantity of carbonyl and carboxyl groups accounts for 80 indicating that a large amount of these groups on the surface of cu cu2o cuo c can contribute to the adsorption efficiency towards antibiotics at the same trend we found some important chemical bonds on o 1s xps profile which helps to consolidate the evidence of o containing functional groups accordingly raw data in fig 5 c can be analyzed into four curves corresponding to carbonyl co 531 0 ev alcoholic co 532 2 ev phenolic coh 533 4 ev and carboxyl oco 535 0 ev 27 again the carbonyl and carboxyl groups were found to be more dominant and hence commensurate with c 1s xps profile mentioned above xps analysis of cu 2p in fig 5 d illustrates two typical oxidation states of cu species including cu2 in cupric oxide and cu in cuprous oxide 29 firstly two sub levels of cu ii are cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 ascribed by binding energies 941 1 ev 947 3 ev and 957 4 ev 964 0 ev respectively similarly cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 of cu i may be attributable to the appearance of signals at binding energies 940 4 949 3 and 956 4 ev herein the existence of zero valent cu was not detected on xps profile but observed on xrd diffraction spectrum of cu cu2o cuo c partly because hollow carbon matrix may decorate cu cu2o cuo particles and cu i ii layers may encapsulate zero valent cu hampering the xps signals to metal atoms 30 in another interpretation zhao et al claimed that binding energies between cu i and cu 0 may be overlapped making cu signals difficult to distinguish cu2o signals 22 after all our xps results are well consistent with other reports 29 31 3 2 adsorption study of cu cu2o cuo c composite 3 2 1 effect of solution ph and ionic strength solution ph plays a fundamental role in the adsorption of cip and ttc antibiotics onto cu cu2o cuo c adsorbent this factor can be adjusted by adding appropriate hcl and naoh solutions into antibiotic solutions using online ph meter herein the range of solution ph was alterable from 3 to 11 as shown in fig 6 a it is noticeable that adsorption capacities of cu cu2o cuo c enhanced significanly with raising ph from 3 to nearly neutral ph 6 7 then reduced abruptly at solutions having stronger basicity ph 8 the optimum ph points were determined at ph 6 for ttc and ph 7 for cip strange ions in the solution can affect the competitiveness between adsorbate species and them in general na is one of the most prevalent cations existing in pratical samples in this study we investigated the effect of ionic strength by emplying the adsorption of cip and ttc in the presence of na cations the concentration of na cations was ranged from 25 mm to 400 mm as observed in fig 6 b the adsorption capacities of both cip and ttc antibiotics on cu cu2o cuo c gradually decreased 39 2 and 18 0 respectively with the increase of na concentrations this phenonmenon may be due to the fact that na cations enhanced competition interaction between salt ions and cu cu2o cuo c surface then the adsorption was depleted 32 ma et al explained the higher possibility of compressing the electric double layers covering the surface of adsorbent at stronger ionic strength conditions 33 hence the adsorbent surface becomes more unconducive with less availability of adsorption sites 34 zhang et al also concluded that more cations may weaken the electrostatic attraction between positively charged adsorbate molecules and negatively charged surface of adsorbent 35 3 2 2 adsorption kinetic modelling generally the uptake process of adsorbate molecules over solid adsorbent may experience various mechanisms controlled by the heterogeneity of adsorption sites as well as the physicochemical properties of aqueous media 36 better understanding adsorption mechanism towards cip and ttc antibiotics aids to enhance the removal efficiency along with feasibility within industrial scales therefore to investigate the parameters of kinetic models for cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c composite we determined the adsorption capacity at the regular time 0 360 min the experimental data points and their fitting using nonlinear adsorption kinetics including pseudo ﬁrst order model and pseudo second order were shown in fig 7 at a glance the adsorption process swiftly occurred within first 120 min then reached to be equilibrium after 360 min moreover adsorption capacity of cu cu2o cuo c towards ttc was larger than towards cip antibiotic and the nonlinear adsorption kinetics were well fitted showing the good compatibility between actual and theoretical adsorption capacity table 1 summarized the equations units and values for calculated parameters of pseudo ﬁrst order model and pseudo second order models the suitability level of these models could be clarified by the error functions analysis with higher coefficient of determination adjusted r2 0 9854 9897 and lower function errors the kinetic adsorption of cip and ttc on cu cu2o cuo c adhered to the pseudo second order equation it is therefore suggested that pseudo second order yielded correlations towards kinetic data and could be utilized to predict the overall adsorption rate controlled by chemisorption mechanism which the surface functional groups play a decisive role 37 the herein outcomes asserted the dominance of pseudo second order in adsorption kinetic and seemed strongly suitable with other works 38 39 in our previous publications above results were very expectable for adsorption models for cip and ttc 30 40 3 2 3 adsorption isotherm modelling in the case of existing uptake equilibrium it is important to study the relationship between adsorbent and adsorbate in liquid phase and grasp the adsorption mechanism and optimize the utilization of adsorbent dosage 41 therefore we introduced the nonlinear isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and temkin to calculate the sorption parameters and predict the experimental modes a constant amount of cu cu2o cuo c 0 5 g l was used to adsorb cip and ttc at various concentrations 0 100 mg l experimental data were plotted using the fitting curves by origin program and shown in fig 8 initially equilibrium uptake of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c is very dependent on the concentration of the solution increasing initial concentration helps to improve adsorption capacity as same as kinetic studies equilibrium adsorption capacity of ttc was larger than that of cip using cu cu2o cuo c composite again the nonlinear models applied for isothermal adsorption were fitted well with experimental data fig 8 to explore more parameters of isothermal models we listed values and error function analysis in table 2 nonlinear isotherm curves langmuir freundlich and temkin offered an excellent correlation factors for cip and ttc adsorption since all adjusted r2 values were larger than 0 96 speaking of ttc uptake behavior over cu cu2o cuo c langmuir was considered as the best fitted model because of higher r2 0 9838 together with lower mre 7 19 and sse 83 66 values implying the monolayer coverage property of ttc over cu cu2o cuo c furthermore r l values were found from 0 10 to 0 13 revealing that adsorption of antibiotic over cu cu2o cuo c was a favorable process 42 this phenomenon may be due to the role of carbonyl carboxyl groups fig 5 wang et al also explained that high adsorption capacity of cip might benefit from some functional groups containing rich electron atoms e g oxygen 43 on the other hand temkin was fitted better for cip adsorption model because its adjusted r2 reached 0 99 and very small errors mre 3 32 sse 10 46 temkin was also found the best fitted isothermal model for cip adsorption in a recent study on adsorption of cip over biocomposite fibers based graphene oxide calcium alginate 38 for example gulen et al demonstrated that temkin isotherm fitted well with experimental adsorption data r2 0 996 when reporting the adsorption behavior of cip over montmorillonite mmt clay 39 to compare the uptake capacities qm calculated through langmuir equation we listed the previous studies reporting the use of various adsorbents for cip and ttc antibiotics treatment according to table 3 the surveyed results indicated that in this study maximum adsorption capacity values for cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c performed are higher than those over other materials therefore cu cu2o cuo c composite can be a good alternative for cip and ttc remediation 3 2 4 intraparticle diffusion modelling the adsorption of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c can experience many steps the first step is characterized by the migration of cip and ttc molecules from the solution to cu cu2o cuo c surface via bulk diffusion this stage often takes place swiftly owing to random motion of individual molecules 49 the second can occur mass transfer across the boundary of films this process is complicated to predict and its rate relies on many system parameters such as temperature particle size concentration 50 the third proceeds intra particle pore diffusion of cip and ttc antibiotics and can occur the formation of chemical reaction or complex 49 the final equilibrium step is often assumed to be extremely slow because the residual concentration of cip and ttc is very dilute weber morris equation is one of the most common equations to describe the intraparticle diffusion which its functions and parameters are shown in the supporting information file fig 9 illustrates the multi linear plots of the intraparticle diffusion divided into three stages as observed in fig 9 the rate of each intraparticle diffusion step qt versus t0 5 decreased with increasing the contact time which is similar as previous studies 49 51 table 4 listed weber morris parameters along with very high adjusted coefficients of determination for evaluating the good suitability of cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c the first and second steps occurred rapidly because high rate constants kid 1 3 71 4 33 mg g min1 2 and kid 2 3 90 5 12 mg g min1 2 wu et al also observed the same for intraparticle diffusion phenomenon of cip and ttc on montmorillonite 51 meanwhile the final step occurred more slowly with small kid 2 0 61 1 14 mg g min1 2 this process shows slow intraparticle diffusion mostly due to very low content of cip and ttc in aqueous residuals 3 2 5 adsorption thermodynamic modelling the uptake of cip and ttc antibiotics on cu cu2o cuo c can be prognosticated through calculating relevant thermodynamic parameters enthalpy entropy and free energy which the gibbs equation was described in the supporting information to begin with we determined the influence of various temperatures 288 318 k on uptake capacity of cip and ttc using cu cu2o cuo c fig 10 disposes the correlation between 1 t and ln kc indicating that the temperature played a crucial role in adsorption thermodynamic system moreover some parameters slopes y axis intercepts of two variable linear equations can determine the values of enthalpy δh and entropy δs hence δg can be calculated to clarify the spontaneity and favorability of the thermodynamic system 52 table 5 summarizes the thermodynamic parameters along with high coefficient of determination r2 0 98 as increasing the temperature of the system values of free energy decreased which means that cip and ttc uptake over cu cu2o cuo c is an energetic and more favorable process the positive enthalpy values of δh 7 014 8 789 kj mol indicate the endothermic nature of cip and ttc adsorption while the positive values of entropy δs 28 03 40 97 j mol k imply high affinity of cu cu2o cuo c towards these compounds because of the migration between solvent and adsorbate molecules in heterogeneous phases 53 finally the negative values of gibbs free energy confirm the spontaneous nature of cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c 30 3 2 6 plausible adsorption mechanism to gain more insight into adsorption mechanism of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c composite we assumed several hypotheses based on experimental results including characterization and adsorption test studies typically chemical properties of cip and ttc antibiotic molecules represent as amphoteric compounds having both protonability and deprotonability which means that their ionization is strongly dependent on the solution ph speaking of cip antibiotic drug its dissociation constants pka include pka 1 5 9 and pka 2 8 9 40 therefore cip can present at three different ionized states involving cationic species ciph2 ph 5 9 nearly neutral zwitterion ciph 5 9 ph 8 9 and anionic species cip ph 8 9 meanwhile ttc has three dissociation constants pka 1 3 3 pka 3 7 7 and pka 3 9 7 thereby presenting in the solution at cationic species ttch3 ph 3 3 nearly neutral zwitterions ttch2 3 7 ph 7 7 and anionic species ttch 7 7 ph 9 7 and ttc2 ph 9 7 18 according to fig 6 a the optimum solution ph for cip and ttc were found at 7 and 6 respectively with such ph values both cip and ttc species mostly exist neutral zwitterions ciph and ttch2 respectively which can provide many h donors and h acceptors this result can lead to an assumption in the primary role of several interactions i e hydrogen bonding between antibiotic species and cu cu2o cuo c surface via donor acceptor pathway 54 this mechanism can work out because the same functional groups were found on the surface of cu cu2o cuo c according to analytical results of ft ir fig 3 and xps spectra fig 5 the cu cu2o cuo c structure contains many chemical bonds of main functional groups such as oh bonds co bonds of alcoholic groups oco bonds of carboxyl groups co bonds of carbonyl carboxyl groups and cooh of carboxylic groups fig 11 as a result there are hydrogen interactions between functional groups of cip ttc and cu cu2o cuo c which may vitally contribute to adsorption enhancement otherwise cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c could still be observed even at unfavorable ph points i e ph 3 and 11 the second proposal for adsorption mechanism may rely on the important role of other interactions including π π interactions and n π interactions as illustrated in fig 11 firstly both antibiotic molecules have many aromatic rings which can provide many π conjugated systems according to the raman result in fig 4 the cu cu2o cuo c composite can contain graphitic carbon which can be constituted by π electron rich aromatic rings in addition c 1s xps spectra found the π π bonds on cu cu2o cuo c surface as shown in fig 5 b therefore the interaction between π electron systems of the aromatic rings π conjugated systems between cip ttc and cu cu2o cuo c can occur jung et al also evaluated the same role of π π electron donor acceptor interactions between α fe fe3c composite and π electron acceptors from ttc molecules 55 to better consolidate these assumptions we observed the higher adsorption capacity of ttc 112 5 mg g than that of cip 67 5 mg g which may be attributable to higher amount of h donors and h acceptors on ttc 6 h donors and 18 h acceptors than those on cip 2 h donors and 12 h acceptors and more n π π conjugated systems of ttc than those of cip 3 2 7 regeneration study regarding wastewater treatment models cost effective feasibility of cu cu2o cuo c through the regenerated and reusable possibility needs to be fully investigated herein we carried out several steps as described to assert whether cu cu2o cuo c can be reused within some adsorption regeneration cycles in detail cu cu2o cuo c composite 0 5 g l was poured into each cip 100 mg l and ttc 60 mg l solution and employed for the first run then cip and ttc loaded cu cu2o cuo c materials were extracted immersed in methanol 3 10 ml and distilled water 3 50 ml the solid was centrifuged then collected and dried for using in the next reusability study recyclability study for the adsorption of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c composite as illustrated in fig 12 affirmed that this material still maintained a stable level and uptake capacity for both cip and ttc nearly unchanged in the case of fourth cycle therefore the cu cu2o cuo c composite may by a typical representative for new adsorbent generation in antibiotic remediation 4 conclusion both hkust 1 precursor and cu cu2o cuo c composite have been successfully synthesized and characterized by some physical techniques the cu cu2o cuo c was found to possess a porously hollow structure accompanying with many chemical bonds co oco coh etc existing on the surface the existence of cu i ii oxidation states was also demonstrated via xps spectroscopy the maximum adsorption capacities of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c were found at 67 5 and 112 5 mg g higher than those of various adsorbents from previous studies with excellent reusability properties cu cu2o cuo c can be reused up to 4 cycles making it the promising candidate for the removal of

13974,we reported a direct and tunable strategy to obtain a highly porous nanostructured cu cu2o cuo c by self sacrificial hkust 1 template pyrolysis the as synthesized composite was structurally characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray powder diffraction xrd scanning electron microscope sem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir the characteristic results demonstrated the existence of various species of copper oxides supported on carbon matrix the surface of cu cu2o cuo c monitored many functional groups chemical bonds hollow structure as well as high surface area 80 m2 g in addition the effect of contact time initial concentration solution ph and ionic strength on the adsorption of ciprofloxacin cip and tetracycline ttc on cu cu2o cuo c have been vigorously indicated the results also revealed the adsorption of cip and ttc obeyed pseudo second order model and this process was endothermic and spontaneous we also proposed several plausible adsorption mechanisms based on hydrogen bonding π π and n π interactions the adsorbability efficiencies qm mg g of cu cu2o cuo c towards cip and ttc from water were found at 67 5 and 112 5 mg g respectively along with excellent recyclability in comparison with other adsorbents keywords hkust 1 metal organic framework cu cu2o cuo c composite antibiotics treatment porous carbon adsorption modelling 1 introduction copper based metal organic frameworks cu mofs with the self assembly of metal clusters and carboxylic ligands by various covalent bonds and inter molecular forces have been synthesized and applied for emergent material fields 1 typically a hybrid cu3 btc 2 btc benzene 1 3 5 tricarboxylate or known as hkust 1 with each cu nodes coordinated with four oxygen atoms exhibited high porosity as well as promising physical chemical properties for membranes coatings sensors gas storage and drug delivery 2 4 compared with other traditional porous materials i e zeolites activated carbons etc each hkust 1 crystal attains the structurally characteristic kind of bimodal pore size distribution 5 due to highly active open metal sites many efforts orientated new utilizations especially in heterogeneous catalysis and molecule separation for example phan et al solvothermally synthesized a highly crystalline hkust 1 as an effective catalyst for the arylation of acetylacetones 6 jin et al demonstrated that hkust 1 supported composite namely cuo hkust 1 also displayed a promising photocatalytic activity towards methylene blue dye photodegradation 7 besides the literatures mentioned mofs based general precursors have been recently used as novel efficient templates to fabricate functional materials 8 11 the principle for this strategy relies on the transformation of mofs into metals metal oxides and organic matters for the advent of functional groups thus this functionalization process aids surface modification 12 under the controllable thermolysis conditions volatile molecules including carbon oxides vapor etc can be rapidly released from the mother precursors then leaving a porously hollow nanostructured residue 13 in situ synthesized composite generations derived from mofs templates have been found a series of applications in adsorption fields 11 take for example peng et al pyrolyzed hkust 1 template at 600 c under nitrogen flow targeting octahedral cuo supported on carbon matrix which exhibited a highly selective no conversion 14 at the same trend zhang et al reported strong photocatalysis of core shell structural magnetic fe3o4 c cu composite through one step thermolysis procedure of fe3o4 hkust 1 15 under n2 at 500 c li et al created oxidized g c3n4 cu2o c derived from g c3n4 hkust 1 exhibiting an amazing stability within 4 reused cycles and 87 4 degradation efficiency 16 these works have obviously attempted to extend the potentials of cu mofs for catalysis applications however very few studies investigated the pyrolysis products of hkust 1 as cu cu2o cuo c composite for environmental remediation e g adsorptive removal of antibiotics in wastewater in this context expanding the applicability of composite from hkust 1 mof directing the treatment of antibiotic pollutants is highly desirable in our previous studies some composites produced from fe based mofs have been reported as potential candidates for antibiotics treatment 17 18 cu3 btc 2 dervied porous carbon also showed a good adsorption capacity 37 2 mg g and removal efficiency 87 6 towards chloramphenicol antibiotic 19 therefore we expect the good results to prove uptake ability of hkust 1 based cu cu2o cuo c composite for water purification 2 experimental section 2 1 materials ciprofloxacin cip tetracycline ttc 1 3 5 benzene tricarboxylic acid h3btc n n dimethylformamide dmf ethanol c2h5oh and copper nitrate trihydrate cu no3 2 3h2o were commercially purchased from sigma aldrich and were used without further purification distilled water was used to synthesize and dilute the aqueous solutions 2 2 the preparation of hkust 1 precursor the metal organic framework hkust 1 could be solvothermally prepared according to the previous report 6 in a typical experiment cu no3 2 3h2o 2 19 g 9 0 mmol and h3btc 1 18 g 5 6 mmol was completely dissolved in a homogeneous mixture of dmf 15 ml c2h5oh 20 ml and h2o 10 ml under stirring magnetically during 10 min the mixture was evenly allocated in 4 vials 20 ml type and heated at 85 c during 1 day to reach light blue crystals hkust 1 the solid was collected in a beaker and washed with dmf 3 10 ml exchanged with ethanol 3 10 ml dried for use 2 3 the preparation of cu cu2o cuo c composite the cu cu2o cuo c composite can be synthesized followed by the following one pot fabrication procedure typically the hkust 1 was pyrolyzed gradually 3 c min under n2 atmosphere 100 cc min the temperature was set from room temperature to 700 c and hold it during 240 min the as synthesized cu cu2o cuo c was collected washed with water and then dried for experimental usage 2 4 characterizations the d8 advance bruker powder diffractometer was used to record the x ray powder

used to determine ciprofloxacin and tetracycline concentrations at 278 and 272 nm respectively 2 5 adsorption test herein experimental batches were separately carried out at neutral ph for a typical run the adsorbent of cu cu2o cuo c 0 5 g l was added into a triangular beaker 250 ml containing 50 ml each cip or ttc solution the samples were shaken 200 rpm at room temperature firstly we investigated the effect of contact time on adsorption capacity of antibiotic solutions 40 mg l over cu cu2o cuo c at the moments 0 10 30 60 90 120 240 and 360 min at the same trend we employed the effect of cip 10 60 mg l and ttc 10 100 mg l concentrations at equilibrium time the concentration was measured by uv vis spectrophotometer based on the beer lambert law the relationship between removal efficiency h and equilibrium concentration eq 1 between adsorption capacity q mg g and dosage g l eq 2 could be described by two equations below 1 h c o c e c o 100 2 q c o c e m v where co and ce mg l are defined as initial and equilibrium concentration of cip and ttc m g and v l are the mass of adsorbent and volume of solution respectively 2 6 statistical error analysis of the modelling the experimental data were converted to fit with nonlinear kinetic and isotherm models using error functions such as radj 2 mre and sse as described carefully in supporting material file in addition the nonlinear models for kinetics pseudo first order and pseudo second order isotherms langmuir freundlich and temkin intraparticle diffusion and thermodynamic study were described in the supporting material 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characterization of hkust 1 and cu cu2o cuo c materials initially we explored the morphological characteristics of hkust 1 framework and cu cu2o cuo c composite through sem and tem techniques at various scales accordingly octahedral crystals of hkust 1 as shown in fig 1 a b can be apparently observed although there are some smaller crystals hanging on the edges of larger crystal the size of these edges is ranged from 10 to 20 μm in length this observation is highly in line with previous studies by phan et al when they successfully synthesized the hkust 1 crystals by the same solvothermal method 6 by contrast the morphology of cu cu2o cuo c is found to be very different with that of hkust 1 indeed fig 1 c show a noticeable deficiency in crystallinity trending an amorphous nature of cu cu2o cuo c with a strongly defective surface tem images in fig 1 d f also many affirm the encapsulation of cu cu2o cuo particles dark aggregation in carbon coatings bright region pyrolyzing at high temperature 700 c mostly deconstructed the crystallinity of hkust 1 increasing the aggregation of particles within hollow carbon matrix kar and srivastava found the same phenomenon since preparing cu cu2o c and cuo cu2o c catalysts supported carbon material 20 the remarkable change in morphological properties between hkust 1 and cu cu2o cuo c can lead to a respective movement in crystalline structure which could also be supported by the xrd diffraction technique fig 2 at a glance the crystalline diffraction profiles of composite and its precursor is absolutely distinctive while most of the typical peaks of hkust 1 clearly distributed at very low degrees 10 30 the figure for cu cu2o cuo c is ranged from 30 to 80 with some peaks at 11 7 220 17 3 551 and 19 0 440 the diffraction profile for hkust 1 herein is perfectly commensurate with one previous publication 6 combining with sem image data mentioned above to confirm the successful carbonization of this cu mof moreover we observed the presence of cu jcpds no 04 0836 cu2o jcpds no 75 1531 and cuo trace jcpds no 45 0937 on cu cu2o cuo c fig 3 the position of these peaks is well correspondent with the reports by karimzadeh et al 21 and zhao et al 22 suggesting that cu cu2o cuo c composite has been synthesized successfully note that oxidation states for cu found here including 0 1 and 2 are very typical peng et al demonstrated the deconstruction of hkust 1 mof structure at 600 c along with the transformation of cu ii o coordination bonds into cu ii o ionic bonds 14 also kar and srivastava indicated that the release of volatile molecules h2o co2 etc from carboxylic acid of mof crystals under such high temperature could leave c skeletons and chains 20 liu et al interpreted that these carbon atoms are very active because they can join in situ reduction of copper i ii oxides summarily we found all of the most common oxidation states of copper after pyrolysis of hkust 1 to gain insight into chemical bonds on the surface of materials fourier transform infrared spectroscopy profiles of hkust 1 and cu cu2o cuo c were recorded and shown in fig 3 most importantly chemical bonds of cu i o and cu ii o have been found on cu cu2o cuo c through two very typical footprints at around 630 cm 1 and 500 cm 1 respectively these outcomes are highly agreeable with recent studies by huang et al which detected the same cu ii o position on fe3o4 cuo 23 and by ho et al which revealed cu i o on faceted cu2o particles 24 zhang et al reported the same results of cuo cu2o porous composites derived from cu btc btc 1 3 5 benzenetricarboxylicacid 25 finally other chemical bonds are also observed on ft ir profiles of both hkust 1 and cu cu2o cuo c ch stretching oh deformation 1370 cm 1 co aromatic cc stretching 1620 cm 1 oh alcohol adsorbed h2o 3340 cm 1 the raman spectrum of cu cu2o cuo c aids to better understand the graphitic nature of supported carbon in composite structure according to fig 4 two conspicuous peaks at around 1350 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 were depicted for d band and g band of the carbon material respectively in theory the crystal structure of supported carbon matrix can be reflected by the ratio between d band and g band intensities i d i g 26 as shown in fig 4 we found the following ratio in cu cu2o cuo c composite i d i g 1 1 which was slightly higher than that of cu cu2o c and cuo cu2o c by kar and srivastava revealing that amorphous carbon herein is more dominant than graphitic carbon domain at higher temperature 700 c 20 in addition we employed the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm measurement of cu cu2o cuo c the result implies that this carbonized material exhibited an outstanding porous structure with specific surface area of 80 m2 g but it was significantly lower than that of hkust 1 precursor 1050 m2 g the decrease of pyrolysis product in surface area is in line with the work by peng et al 14 hkust 1 achieves such large bet surface area pore volume thanks to its a very high porous organic network while the pyrolysis process collapsed this framework decreasing the porosity of cu cu2o cuo c however with an enough good surface area it is expected to reach enhanced diffusion of adsorbate during adsorption process in this study finally we explored the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy profile of cu cu2o cuo c composite to shed light on the oxidation state of copper as well as other chemical bonds on the surface of the material fig 5 a shows a general survey of atoms incorporated in cu cu2o cuo c composite with the existence of typical signals at three various binding energies c 1s 284 291 ev o 1s 528 538 ev and cu 2p 936 967 ev a general comparison in peak intensity among c o and cu signals evidently reveals a higher density for carbon elements than others offering a larger degree of graphitic carbon 27 this phenomenon may affect the dispersion of cu species supported in hollow carbon matrix hence expect to improve adsorption performance of cu cu2o cuo c composite in detail the spectrum data of c 1s can be divided into four well fitted curves confirming the presence of c containing chemical bonds co bonds of alcoholic groups 286 1 ev oco bonds of carboxyl groups 287 4 ev co bonds of carbonyl carboxyl groups 288 0 ev and π π bonds 290 0 ev 22 28 more important the calculated quantity of carbonyl and carboxyl groups accounts for 80 indicating that a large amount of these groups on the surface of cu cu2o cuo c can contribute to the adsorption efficiency towards antibiotics at the same trend we found some important chemical bonds on o 1s xps profile which helps to consolidate the evidence of o containing functional groups accordingly raw data in fig 5 c can be analyzed into four curves corresponding to carbonyl co 531 0 ev alcoholic co 532 2 ev phenolic coh 533 4 ev and carboxyl oco 535 0 ev 27 again the carbonyl and carboxyl groups were found to be more dominant and hence commensurate with c 1s xps profile mentioned above xps analysis of cu 2p in fig 5 d illustrates two typical oxidation states of cu species including cu2 in cupric oxide and cu in cuprous oxide 29 firstly two sub levels of cu ii are cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 ascribed by binding energies 941 1 ev 947 3 ev and 957 4 ev 964 0 ev respectively similarly cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 of cu i may be attributable to the appearance of signals at binding energies 940 4 949 3 and 956 4 ev herein the existence of zero valent cu was not detected on xps profile but observed on xrd diffraction spectrum of cu cu2o cuo c partly because hollow carbon matrix may decorate cu cu2o cuo particles and cu i ii layers may encapsulate zero valent cu hampering the xps signals to metal atoms 30 in another interpretation zhao et al claimed that binding energies between cu i and cu 0 may be overlapped making cu signals difficult to distinguish cu2o signals 22 after all our xps results are well consistent with other reports 29 31 3 2 adsorption study of cu cu2o cuo c composite 3 2 1 effect of solution ph and ionic strength solution ph plays a fundamental role in the adsorption of cip and ttc antibiotics onto cu cu2o cuo c adsorbent this factor can be adjusted by adding appropriate hcl and naoh solutions into antibiotic solutions using online ph meter herein the range of solution ph was alterable from 3 to 11 as shown in fig 6 a it is noticeable that adsorption capacities of cu cu2o cuo c enhanced significanly with raising ph from 3 to nearly neutral ph 6 7 then reduced abruptly at solutions having stronger basicity ph 8 the optimum ph points were determined at ph 6 for ttc and ph 7 for cip strange ions in the solution can affect the competitiveness between adsorbate species and them in general na is one of the most prevalent cations existing in pratical samples in this study we investigated the effect of ionic strength by emplying the adsorption of cip and ttc in the presence of na cations the concentration of na cations was ranged from 25 mm to 400 mm as observed in fig 6 b the adsorption capacities of both cip and ttc antibiotics on cu cu2o cuo c gradually decreased 39 2 and 18 0 respectively with the increase of na concentrations this phenonmenon may be due to the fact that na cations enhanced competition interaction between salt ions and cu cu2o cuo c surface then the adsorption was depleted 32 ma et al explained the higher possibility of compressing the electric double layers covering the surface of adsorbent at stronger ionic strength conditions 33 hence the adsorbent surface becomes more unconducive with less availability of adsorption sites 34 zhang et al also concluded that more cations may weaken the electrostatic attraction between positively charged adsorbate molecules and negatively charged surface of adsorbent 35 3 2 2 adsorption kinetic modelling generally the uptake process of adsorbate molecules over solid adsorbent may experience various mechanisms controlled by the heterogeneity of adsorption sites as well as the physicochemical properties of aqueous media 36 better understanding adsorption mechanism towards cip and ttc antibiotics aids to enhance the removal efficiency along with feasibility within industrial scales therefore to investigate the parameters of kinetic models for cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c composite we determined the adsorption capacity at the regular time 0 360 min the experimental data points and their fitting using nonlinear adsorption kinetics including pseudo ﬁrst order model and pseudo second order were shown in fig 7 at a glance the adsorption process swiftly occurred within first 120 min then reached to be equilibrium after 360 min moreover adsorption capacity of cu cu2o cuo c towards ttc was larger than towards cip antibiotic and the nonlinear adsorption kinetics were well fitted showing the good compatibility between actual and theoretical adsorption capacity table 1 summarized the equations units and values for calculated parameters of pseudo ﬁrst order model and pseudo second order models the suitability level of these models could be clarified by the error functions analysis with higher coefficient of determination adjusted r2 0 9854 9897 and lower function errors the kinetic adsorption of cip and ttc on cu cu2o cuo c adhered to the pseudo second order equation it is therefore suggested that pseudo second order yielded correlations towards kinetic data and could be utilized to predict the overall adsorption rate controlled by chemisorption mechanism which the surface functional groups play a decisive role 37 the herein outcomes asserted the dominance of pseudo second order in adsorption kinetic and seemed strongly suitable with other works 38 39 in our previous publications above results were very expectable for adsorption models for cip and ttc 30 40 3 2 3 adsorption isotherm modelling in the case of existing uptake equilibrium it is important to study the relationship between adsorbent and adsorbate in liquid phase and grasp the adsorption mechanism and optimize the utilization of adsorbent dosage 41 therefore we introduced the nonlinear isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and temkin to calculate the sorption parameters and predict the experimental modes a constant amount of cu cu2o cuo c 0 5 g l was used to adsorb cip and ttc at various concentrations 0 100 mg l experimental data were plotted using the fitting curves by origin program and shown in fig 8 initially equilibrium uptake of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c is very dependent on the concentration of the solution increasing initial concentration helps to improve adsorption capacity as same as kinetic studies equilibrium adsorption capacity of ttc was larger than that of cip using cu cu2o cuo c composite again the nonlinear models applied for isothermal adsorption were fitted well with experimental data fig 8 to explore more parameters of isothermal models we listed values and error function analysis in table 2 nonlinear isotherm curves langmuir freundlich and temkin offered an excellent correlation factors for cip and ttc adsorption since all adjusted r2 values were larger than 0 96 speaking of ttc uptake behavior over cu cu2o cuo c langmuir was considered as the best fitted model because of higher r2 0 9838 together with lower mre 7 19 and sse 83 66 values implying the monolayer coverage property of ttc over cu cu2o cuo c furthermore r l values were found from 0 10 to 0 13 revealing that adsorption of antibiotic over cu cu2o cuo c was a favorable process 42 this phenomenon may be due to the role of carbonyl carboxyl groups fig 5 wang et al also explained that high adsorption capacity of cip might benefit from some functional groups containing rich electron atoms e g oxygen 43 on the other hand temkin was fitted better for cip adsorption model because its adjusted r2 reached 0 99 and very small errors mre 3 32 sse 10 46 temkin was also found the best fitted isothermal model for cip adsorption in a recent study on adsorption of cip over biocomposite fibers based graphene oxide calcium alginate 38 for example gulen et al demonstrated that temkin isotherm fitted well with experimental adsorption data r2 0 996 when reporting the adsorption behavior of cip over montmorillonite mmt clay 39 to compare the uptake capacities qm calculated through langmuir equation we listed the previous studies reporting the use of various adsorbents for cip and ttc antibiotics treatment according to table 3 the surveyed results indicated that in this study maximum adsorption capacity values for cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c performed are higher than those over other materials therefore cu cu2o cuo c composite can be a good alternative for cip and ttc remediation 3 2 4 intraparticle diffusion modelling the adsorption of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c can experience many steps the first step is characterized by the migration of cip and ttc molecules from the solution to cu cu2o cuo c surface via bulk diffusion this stage often takes place swiftly owing to random motion of individual molecules 49 the second can occur mass transfer across the boundary of films this process is complicated to predict and its rate relies on many system parameters such as temperature particle size concentration 50 the third proceeds intra particle pore diffusion of cip and ttc antibiotics and can occur the formation of chemical reaction or complex 49 the final equilibrium step is often assumed to be extremely slow because the residual concentration of cip and ttc is very dilute weber morris equation is one of the most common equations to describe the intraparticle diffusion which its functions and parameters are shown in the supporting information file fig 9 illustrates the multi linear plots of the intraparticle diffusion divided into three stages as observed in fig 9 the rate of each intraparticle diffusion step qt versus t0 5 decreased with increasing the contact time which is similar as previous studies 49 51 table 4 listed weber morris parameters along with very high adjusted coefficients of determination for evaluating the good suitability of cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c the first and second steps occurred rapidly because high rate constants kid 1 3 71 4 33 mg g min1 2 and kid 2 3 90 5 12 mg g min1 2 wu et al also observed the same for intraparticle diffusion phenomenon of cip and ttc on montmorillonite 51 meanwhile the final step occurred more slowly with small kid 2 0 61 1 14 mg g min1 2 this process shows slow intraparticle diffusion mostly due to very low content of cip and ttc in aqueous residuals 3 2 5 adsorption thermodynamic modelling the uptake of cip and ttc antibiotics on cu cu2o cuo c can be prognosticated through calculating relevant thermodynamic parameters enthalpy entropy and free energy which the gibbs equation was described in the supporting information to begin with we determined the influence of various temperatures 288 318 k on uptake capacity of cip and ttc using cu cu2o cuo c fig 10 disposes the correlation between 1 t and ln kc indicating that the temperature played a crucial role in adsorption thermodynamic system moreover some parameters slopes y axis intercepts of two variable linear equations can determine the values of enthalpy δh and entropy δs hence δg can be calculated to clarify the spontaneity and favorability of the thermodynamic system 52 table 5 summarizes the thermodynamic parameters along with high coefficient of determination r2 0 98 as increasing the temperature of the system values of free energy decreased which means that cip and ttc uptake over cu cu2o cuo c is an energetic and more favorable process the positive enthalpy values of δh 7 014 8 789 kj mol indicate the endothermic nature of cip and ttc adsorption while the positive values of entropy δs 28 03 40 97 j mol k imply high affinity of cu cu2o cuo c towards these compounds because of the migration between solvent and adsorbate molecules in heterogeneous phases 53 finally the negative values of gibbs free energy confirm the spontaneous nature of cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c 30 3 2 6 plausible adsorption mechanism to gain more insight into adsorption mechanism of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c composite we assumed several hypotheses based on experimental results including characterization and adsorption test studies typically chemical properties of cip and ttc antibiotic molecules represent as amphoteric compounds having both protonability and deprotonability which means that their ionization is strongly dependent on the solution ph speaking of cip antibiotic drug its dissociation constants pka include pka 1 5 9 and pka 2 8 9 40 therefore cip can present at three different ionized states involving cationic species ciph2 ph 5 9 nearly neutral zwitterion ciph 5 9 ph 8 9 and anionic species cip ph 8 9 meanwhile ttc has three dissociation constants pka 1 3 3 pka 3 7 7 and pka 3 9 7 thereby presenting in the solution at cationic species ttch3 ph 3 3 nearly neutral zwitterions ttch2 3 7 ph 7 7 and anionic species ttch 7 7 ph 9 7 and ttc2 ph 9 7 18 according to fig 6 a the optimum solution ph for cip and ttc were found at 7 and 6 respectively with such ph values both cip and ttc species mostly exist neutral zwitterions ciph and ttch2 respectively which can provide many h donors and h acceptors this result can lead to an assumption in the primary role of several interactions i e hydrogen bonding between antibiotic species and cu cu2o cuo c surface via donor acceptor pathway 54 this mechanism can work out because the same functional groups were found on the surface of cu cu2o cuo c according to analytical results of ft ir fig 3 and xps spectra fig 5 the cu cu2o cuo c structure contains many chemical bonds of main functional groups such as oh bonds co bonds of alcoholic groups oco bonds of carboxyl groups co bonds of carbonyl carboxyl groups and cooh of carboxylic groups fig 11 as a result there are hydrogen interactions between functional groups of cip ttc and cu cu2o cuo c which may vitally contribute to adsorption enhancement otherwise cip and ttc adsorption over cu cu2o cuo c could still be observed even at unfavorable ph points i e ph 3 and 11 the second proposal for adsorption mechanism may rely on the important role of other interactions including π π interactions and n π interactions as illustrated in fig 11 firstly both antibiotic molecules have many aromatic rings which can provide many π conjugated systems according to the raman result in fig 4 the cu cu2o cuo c composite can contain graphitic carbon which can be constituted by π electron rich aromatic rings in addition c 1s xps spectra found the π π bonds on cu cu2o cuo c surface as shown in fig 5 b therefore the interaction between π electron systems of the aromatic rings π conjugated systems between cip ttc and cu cu2o cuo c can occur jung et al also evaluated the same role of π π electron donor acceptor interactions between α fe fe3c composite and π electron acceptors from ttc molecules 55 to better consolidate these assumptions we observed the higher adsorption capacity of ttc 112 5 mg g than that of cip 67 5 mg g which may be attributable to higher amount of h donors and h acceptors on ttc 6 h donors and 18 h acceptors than those on cip 2 h donors and 12 h acceptors and more n π π conjugated systems of ttc than those of cip 3 2 7 regeneration study regarding wastewater treatment models cost effective feasibility of cu cu2o cuo c through the regenerated and reusable possibility needs to be fully investigated herein we carried out several steps as described to assert whether cu cu2o cuo c can be reused within some adsorption regeneration cycles in detail cu cu2o cuo c composite 0 5 g l was poured into each cip 100 mg l and ttc 60 mg l solution and employed for the first run then cip and ttc loaded cu cu2o cuo c materials were extracted immersed in methanol 3 10 ml and distilled water 3 50 ml the solid was centrifuged then collected and dried for using in the next reusability study recyclability study for the adsorption of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c composite as illustrated in fig 12 affirmed that this material still maintained a stable level and uptake capacity for both cip and ttc nearly unchanged in the case of fourth cycle therefore the cu cu2o cuo c composite may by a typical representative for new adsorbent generation in antibiotic remediation 4 conclusion both hkust 1 precursor and cu cu2o cuo c composite have been successfully synthesized and characterized by some physical techniques the cu cu2o cuo c was found to possess a porously hollow structure accompanying with many chemical bonds co oco coh etc existing on the surface the existence of cu i ii oxidation states was also demonstrated via xps spectroscopy the maximum adsorption capacities of cip and ttc over cu cu2o cuo c were found at 67 5 and 112 5 mg g higher than those of various adsorbents from previous studies with excellent reusability properties cu cu2o cuo c can be reused up to 4 cycles making it the promising candidate for the removal of
