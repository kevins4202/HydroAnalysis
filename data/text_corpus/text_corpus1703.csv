8515,study region we investigate the impacts of local temperature and precipitation trends on discharge and sediment loading by applying the model to a watershed in the northeastern us where trends in increasing precipitation exceed those of other regions in north america study focus in this study we simulate the response of watershed sediment loading to changing frequencies and magnitudes of extreme precipitation events using a coupled model that explicitly simulates streambank erosion and failure within a distributed watershed model to drive the model we use meteorological inputs from general circulation models gcms as well as from a statistical weather generator wg new hydrological insights for the region changes in the timing and magnitude of snow melt and spring flows as well as associated sediment mobilization resulted from increases in temperature increases in discharge and sediment load resulted from increases in precipitation events exceeding the 95th percentile in runs driven by wg weather data positive trends were evident in peak as well as annual discharge and suspended sediment yields over the years modeled no clear trends were seen in gcm driven runs which do not capture historically observed trends in extreme precipitation this work is consistent with other studies in that it shows important changes in discharge and sediment yields from a watershed resulting from ongoing changes in climate keywords extreme flows suspended sediment peak flows changing precipitation sediment modeling 1 introduction changing weather patterns will have complex and nonlinear impacts on many human and environmental systems including on processes governing the mobilization and transport of sediment within watersheds significant increases in the frequency of extreme precipitation events have been documented in the united states karl and knight 1998 kunkel et al 1999 kunkel 2003 guilbert et al 2015 although relationships between sediment loading and discharge vary among watersheds webb and walling 1982 williams 1989 asselman 1999 hamshaw 2014 extreme precipitation and or resulting flow events result in disproportionately higher suspended sediment loading in transport limited systems gonzalez hidalgo et al 2010 oeurng et al 2010 increased sediment yields resulting from such events can exceed the capacity of existing infrastructure as well as result in the increased transport of sediment bound nutrients to receiving water bodies one of the mechanisms by which sediment is mobilized particularly in response to high precipitation and flow events is through streambank erosion and failure these processes though widely observed have not heretofore been widely included in watershed models efforts to integrate streambank erosion and phosphorus mobilization are important in watershed model development for assessments mittelstet et al 2016 particularly in the context of understanding the impacts of climate change and increasing extremes increased sediment loading due specifically to streambank erosion can not only contribute large amounts of sediment bound phosphorus and other nutrients kronvang et al 2012 1997 but can also negatively impact water quality both in the watershed and further downstream the contributions of bank erosion have been investigated in the northeastern united states by authors including langendoen et al 2012 dewolfe et al 2004 morrissey et al 2011 nagle et al 2007 and others accelerated streambank erosion can contribute to disproportionate sediment supply to specific areas of a watershed stream channel instability land and habitat loss water quality degradation as well as other consequences us epa 2012 in addition erosion and undercutting of banks and the continued incision of streams can affect the flood resiliency of adjacent areas and infrastructure both heavy rainfall and high flows from snowmelt driven by temperature variability can result in adverse impacts therefore ability to model the combination of conditions watershed state and precipitation that give rise to high loadings under changing extremes would advance understanding of stream watershed and receiving water body response to changing precipitation extremes computational techniques have been used to understand the physical processes and mechanisms responsible for observable changes in the environment one of the advantages of developing physics based modeling approaches is the capability of simulating scenarios that are outside the range of those previously observed stryker et al 2017 coupled the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 and the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem simon et al 2000 2003 2011 in order to better represent the mechanistic processes governing streambank erosion and failure within a distributed watershed model dhsvm is a distributed watershed model that simulates water and energy fluxes at sub daily time steps dhsvm has been used extensively to evaluate impacts of environmental change as well as anthropogenic land use change such as from urbanization and deforestation on watershed hydrology leung and wigmosta 1999 bowling et al 2000 whitaker et al 2002 cuo et al 2009 lanini et al 2009 safeeq and fares 2012 this model also incorporates the mobilization of sediment due to overland and road erosion in response to precipitation and the transport of sediment across the land surface and within the stream network doten et al 2006 bstem was chosen for its advanced physics based representation of both hydraulic and geotechnical processes that play a role in erosion and bank failure it consists of two components a toe erosion module to simulate undercutting of banks by streamflow and a bank stability module to assess the likelihood of failure and the most likely failure plane the representation of bank undercutting resulting from fluvial erosion as a function of excess shear stress is critical to accurate simulation of bank stability simon et al 2000 particularly for examining changing flow regimes in addition bstem simulates the physical characteristics of soils including negative pore pressures that can develop in unsaturated soil conditions since warmer temperatures are likely to affect soil moisture balances the ability to simulate the role of these processes on bank stability is also significant this improved modeling approach is therefore suitable for investigating the impact of climate change scenarios and the occurrence of extreme events on the hydrology and sediment mobilization in small 100 101 km2 and meso 101 102 km2 scale watersheds in order to simulate the impacts of climate change however such models require specific meteorological inputs that reflect the anticipated deviations in climate variables particularly temperature and precipitation several studies have shown that precipitation in the united states and in the northeast region specifically is increasing and becoming more variable in magnitude kunkel et al 1999 2013 kunkel 2003 groisman et al 2005 guilbert et al 2015 kunkel et al 2013 also projected that temperatures in this region will continue to increase between approximately 2 and 6 c by 2080 at current emission rates and that heavy precipitation as well as drought risk will continue to increase authors have also found evidence of a signficiant increase in precipitation occurring as extreme precipitation events heaviest 1 of rainfall over the last approximately 50 years e g karl et al 2009 groisman et al 2001 2012 regional or local trends are critical for investigating impacts of climate change on human life and ecosystem response katz and brown 1992 hayhoe et al 2006 2008 furthermore global circulation model gcm data including the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 data do not capture historically observed trends and variability in precipitation in some regions of the northeast guilbert et al 2014 mohammed et al 2015 another challenge to simulating the impacts of climate change at the watershed scale is the temporal resolution of most climate projection data for example xu 1999 xu et al 2005 and prudhomme et al 2002 noted that gcm products are not adequate for driving hydrological models in part because they perform poorly at subdaily and even daily time steps particularly in mountainous watersheds storm events often pass within a day leading to high temporal variability in water and sediment fluxes not captured in models operating on daily time steps a number of approaches exist to address the unsuitable spatial and temporal scale of gcms including regional climate models hypothetical scenarios and both dynamic and statistical downscaling techniques xu 1999 alternative methods to gcms such as statistical weather generators wgs may be better suited for the prediction of future temperature and precipitation data for specific regions although these techniques have been applied to watershed modeling these approaches also have limitations and key challenges still exist in using existing climate data products to simulate impacts of future trends in settings like this our application is set in a region where changes in extreme precipitation are well documented the watershed encompasses high gradient headwater forested streams and agricultural floodplains post glacial alluvial sediments dominate the landscape and its history includes significant anthropogenic changes in land use such as deforestation and to stream channels such as mill dams and channelization making it susceptible to impacts of high precipitation and flow events whalen 1998 barg and blazewicz 2003 dunn et al 2007a b nagle et al 2007 walter and merritts 2008 again subdaily simulation is critical for capturing the dynamic processes in such watersheds and understanding the influences of changes in precipitation and temperature in the context of this paper extreme precipitation events are characterized as those resulting in daily flows that exceed the 95th percentile this work goes beyond using downscaled gcm output to also using temperature and precipitation data created with a statistical wg that captures local trends and variability in precipitation to drive model runs we apply a physically based watershed model to investigate impacts of increases in temperature and extreme precipitation magnitude and frequency on flow and sediment production dynamics in a meso scale high gradient watershed the primary goal of this study is to assess the hydrological and sediment related impacts of climate change in a representative northeastern us watershed particularly with respect to the increased occurrence of extreme events the secondary purpose of this study is to assess the ability of these climate products to reflect the non stationary shifts in climate that are occurring in this region and the resulting alterations in hydrologic and sediment related processes at a watershed scale 2 methods this study examines hydrological and sediment related simulations produced by the coupled dhsvm bstem model stryker et al 2017 and driven by two sets of meteorological inputs the hydrology model dhsvm mechanistically simulates watershed hydrology wigmosta et al 1994 and uses a 4 point finite difference scheme based on wicks and bathurst 1996 to move sediment downslope through a channel network where sediment is binned by size and routed independently doten et al 2006 transported load includes changes in stored sediment as well as suspended sediment and total transport is limited by bagnold s equation bagnold 1966 based on bstem v5 4 toe erosion and undercutting of channels is calculated as a function of excess shear stress and a force equilibrium analysis used to estimate a factor of safety fos simon et al 2011 if the bank fails sediment that enters the stream channel is routed downstream with other local stream flows eroded sediment from roads overland sediment sediment from upstream and suspended sediment the study site was the mad river watershed in central vermont which drains approximately 373 km2 of land and is bordered by the green mountains land use in the watershed was assumed static for the purposes of focusing on the impacts of specific changes in climate where 86 5 was classified as mixed forest 2 1 as roads 5 5 as urban residential and 4 4 as agricultural including crops pasture and hay based on the 2006 national land use cover dataset nlcd stryker et al 2017 demonstrated the ability of the coupled model to represent sediment mobilization from watershed sources particularly in response to larger precipitation and flow events to evaluate model performance in that work simulated sediment loads for the entire watershed were compared to load estimates based on measured suspended solids at the outlet of the watershed model simulated concentrations at the outlet of several subbasins were compared to measured concentrations at those locations the same model calibration presented in that work was used here all spatial input files and parameter values are as described by stryker et al 2017 the mad river watershed drains to lake champlain a freshwater lake situated between vermont new york and canada lake champlain has experienced an increase in frequency of summer harmful cyanobacteria algae blooms watzin et al 2010 which is in agreement with expected impacts of climate change for many freshwater lakes whitehead et al 2009 moss 2012 el khoury et al 2015 regional climate change trends in the northeastern united states and the lake champlain basin including warming temperatures particularly in winter and increased persistence and variability in precipitation events are more pronounced than global trends frumhoff et al 2007 stager and thill 2010 guilbert et al 2015 in vermont specifically betts 2011 has documented several indicators of warming temperatures including a shorter freeze periods and longer growing seasons over the last 50 years in addition to experiencing climate trends representative of the northeastern united states this watershed is also representative of northern new england watersheds that have steep headwaters draining to floodplains with a history of deforestation for agriculture peak flows in this region typically occur in the spring where snow melt has a significant impact on flow magnitude in addition to spring precipitation tropical storm irene which affected vermont in august 2011 following a heavy spring rainfall is an example of an extreme event that caused significant impacts to the lake champlain basin this event caused tributary flooding intense lateral erosion of streambanks long term changes to river channels and valley morphology and significant damage to bridges stormwater infrastructure and private property pealer 2012 lake champlain basin program 2013 this event also resulted in large pulses of potentially nutrient laden sediments to lake champlain 2 1 climate data using the calibrated dhsvm bstem model for the mad river watershed model runs were conducted for the water years 01 oct 30 sept 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 2090 and 2099 each of these water years was preceded by a 10 month spin up period 01 jan 30 sep to set initial state variables two sets of climate temperature and precipitation data were used to drive the model the first set of this data was developed by winter et al 2016 and based on the output of gcm simulations winter et al used simulations from phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 multimodel ensemble downscaled to an intermediate resolution using the bias corrected with constructed analogs bcca method brekke et al 2013 as the basis for further downscaling the bcca ensemble included 20 gcms run as part of cmip5 under two representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 winter et al 2016 further downscaled that data set specifically for a mountainous region in the northeast that included our study area by using empirical relationships between elevation and daily maximum and minimum surface temperature and precipitation from local station data the result was gridded maximum and minimum surface temperatures as well as precipitation available at a daily time step for 1950 2099 for this work we chose four locally downscaled gcm scenarios for rcp 8 5 representing the 90th percentile of the reference emissions range and similarly representative of greenhouse gas and particle emissions resulting in greater than 8 5 w m2 of radiative forcing in 2100 moss et al 2010 we used a warm scenario a cool scenario 2nd coolest of rcp8 5 a wet scenario and a dry scenario these scenarios are meant to bracket future climate trajectories the second set of data were developed by white et al in press using a statistical wg white et al generated meteorological time maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation using a markov chain monte carlo approach with non stationary precipitation and extreme precipitation distributions this method incorporated the trends noted by guilbert et al 2015 to generate a precipitation time series that statistically reflects the changing probability of extreme events and allows for increasing variance and skewness in the precipitation distribution looking into the future these data were available for the years 2011 2050 for this work we randomly chose 100 realizations from the time series produced by white et al in press for the water years 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 to drive the watershed model although simulated runoff and streamflow are most affected by temperature and precipitation dhsvm requires additional meteorological inputs including humidity wind speed incoming longwave radiation and incoming shortwave radiation these variables affect energy and carbon fluxes vegetation processes and other model processes to complete the meteorological inputs wind speed humidity incoming longwave radiation and incoming shortwave radiation required for the coupled hydrology bank stability model we used national centers for environmental protection ncep reanalysis data provided by the noaa oar esrl psd boulder colorado usa http www esrl noaa gov psd the north american regional reanalysis narr data are high resolution combined model and assimilated time series datasets available at a resolution of eight times daily narr data were assessed for a 15 year period spanning 2000 2014 to evaluate interannual variability see supplemental information data for the period 01 january 2012 through 30 september 2013 representative of this 15 year window were used in all model runs to complete the meteorology time series climate inputs included both downscaled deterministic gcm based scenarios 4 scenarios for 9 different years as well as wg derived scenarios which were assessed as an ensemble 100 realizations of temperature and precipitation for each of 4 different years due to the long run times continuous long term periods were not simulated and results of single water years in 10 year increments were evaluated we assessed baseline results as the average of 85 realizations of statistically generated precipitation and temperature for the water year 2012 in order to isolate the impacts of future temperature and precipitation predictions on watershed discharge and sediment the statistics describing precipitation for the 2012 wg realizations were very similar to those for observed 2011 data and therefore considered representative of a baseline scenario the meteorological input files for these baseline realizations were then completed with the same narr 2012 water year variables as future scenario runs 2 2 sub daily model inputs the coupled watershed model operates most reliability at higher temporal resolutions particularly for the purpose of simulating dynamic hydrology and sediment in mountain settings such as our study site therefore it was necessary to generate subdaily inputs based on the daily data from winter et al 2016 and white et al in press chow and levermore 2007 described several methods for creating hourly temperature from daily maximum and minimum temperatures t max and t min respectively as well as an improved method using average daily temperature in this work we used the sin 14r 1 method for linked days as described by chow and levermore where t max was set to occur at 2 p m and t min to occur one hour before sunrise hourly temperature was calculated as t t t e m p n e x t t e m p p r e v 2 t e m p n e x t t e m p p r e v 2 cos π t t p r e v t n e x t t p r e v where temp next is the next known temperature value either t max or t min and temp prev is the next known temperature value either t max or t min t next is the time for the next known temperature value and t prev is the time for the previous known temperature value and t is the time sunrise and sunset times were calculated according to the latitude of the study site based on a standard formula described in scharmer and greif 2000 sub daily precipitation inputs were generated from daily gcm and wg data by matching predicted storms to existing storms and partitioning the rainfall similarly through the duration of the storm quality controlled historical hourly precipitation data from the burlington international airport weather station in burlington vermont were downloaded from noaa s national climatic data center ncdc http www ncdc noaa gov these data span the period 01 may 1948 through 30 november 2011 we analyzed statistics of historical precipitation events from this dataset including the total duration and depth of each storm in days as well as the percentage of the total depth that fell in each day and hour of the event for each future precipitation scenario at daily resolution we found the location in the time series and magnitude of all non zero values to identify individual precipitation events for each precipitation event we calculated daily statistics including duration depth and percentage of rainfall that fell in each day of an event for a one day event we sampled a one day historical precipitation event of the same depth from the burlington data if no equal depth was found we averaged five storms with the closest total depths for a two day event we sampled an existing storm that matched the total depth and the percentage of rain that fell in each day if we found no exact depth match we averaged the 10 storms with the closest depths if we found no equal percentages we averaged the five storms with the most similar distribution of rainfall if the storm persisted for longer than two days we searched the historical record for a matching event if we identified no suitable precipitation event then we used a combination of shorter duration precipitation events to generate a suitable event to accomplish this we sampled the longest existing storm that matched the depth of equal duration during the daily predicted storm first then sampled other existing storms of similar depth to fill in the time remaining in the predicted storm once we matched each precipitation event with a historical event or combination of historical events we added or subtracted tenths of millimeters of precipitation from random locations within the event to match the total storm depth from the future precipitation events 3 results temperature and precipitation scenarios had clear influences on simulated hydrologic processes including snow accumulation and melt discharge and sediment mobilization modeled climate trends show differences deriving from the gcm and wg data we present these followed by resulting differences in flow and sediment we investigate results representative of changes in extreme flow and sediment yield where extreme indicates those results exceeding the 95th percentile 3 1 climate trends clear differences are evident in the climate time series produced by the alternate methods employed here wg derived precipitation shows an increase in annual precipitation as well as a slight trend in the 95th percentile of daily precipitation over the period of 2020 through 2050 these trends are not present in any of the gcm scenarios used here annual precipitation and extreme precipitation totals in wg realizations are also higher overall than predicted by gcms for all years simulated an increasing trend in maximum storm depth is reflected in wg realizations although these realizations do not reflect longer storm durations gcm scenarios have a higher number of wet days although it has been acknowledged that in part due to the coarse spatial resolution gcms tend to over predict the number of days experiencing rainfall with rainfall intensity being lower than stations within the gcm grid cell wehner et al 2010 in particular gcm data do not reflect the likelihood of increasing extreme events and variability in precipitation patterns evident in observed data for this region maurer et al 2002 mohammed et al 2015 in contrast gcm scenarios do represent historical and expected trends in temperature whereas wg realizations in this case were designed to not include these trends maximum minimum and mean temperatures clearly increase over the 2020 through 2099 period in gcm data a comparison of annual precipitation is shown in fig 1 while 95th percentile extreme precipitation annual number of wet days maximum storm depth maximum storm duration as well as maximum and minimum temperatures between wg realizations and gcm scenarios are shown in figs s2 s7 in supplemental information 3 2 stream flow gcm driven runs show a trend of earlier spring melt and lower cumulative snow water equivalent totals fig 2 the spring day in which total simulated snow water equivalent was 0 1 cm occurred 17 days earlier in the 2099 warm gcm simulation than in the corresponding 2020 warm gcm simulation in wg driven runs this date was within 5 days of the baseline average of may 3rd and we saw no trend between 2020 and 2050 wg driven simulations which assume stationary temperature and nonstationary precipitation the cumulative amount of snow water equivalent over the winter season total for the watershed decreased from 2020 to 2099 in all 4 gcm driven scenarios from an average cumulative total of approximately 0 31 m in 2020 to approximately 0 20 m in 2099 snow water equivalent increased in wg driven runs from an average cumulative total of approximately 0 24 m in 2020 to 0 27 m in 2050 where baseline 2012 runs had an average cumulative total of approximately 0 24 m trends or lack thereof were also apparent in simulated discharge the wg driven runs produced a trend in cumulative discharge that reflected the increase in annual precipitation for the modeled watershed fig 3 cumulative discharge in wg driven runs increased between 2020 and 2050 runs while gcm driven runs reflect no clear pattern over time as expected because of the lack of trends in gcm precipitation however warming temperatures have a clear impact on spring melt processes reflected in discharge occurring particularly during the spring where snow melt contributes to high flows for instance the wet gcm 2099 simulation resulted in higher discharge throughout the winter period and a less significant increase in cumulative discharge during the typical melt period around april spring flows were highest in 2030 and were also high in 2020 gcm scenarios this was due to rapid warming and resulting snow melt and consistent with ongoing observed changes in vermont and other regions of new england betts 2011 hodgkins et al 2002 as expected wg realizations produced higher peak flows and more extreme flows than all gcm scenarios average peak flows were higher in wg driven runs and show an increasing trend between 2020 and 2050 fig 4 we saw no clear trend over time in gcm simulations reflecting the lack of trend in gcm precipitation in fig 4 we show average peak flows from across the gcm scenarios wg realizations as well as the average of baseline scenarios peak flows from gcm scenarios were generally similar or less than peak flows seen in baseline simulations in gcm driven simulations peak flow was highest in 2060 peaks seen in the gcm simulations were the result of rapid snow melt in the spring and not a result of extreme precipitation events in addition we also show the maximum and minimum peak flows in each year for the different sets of runs error bars in fig 4 wg driven realizations resulted in more variability in peak flow events than gcm driven scenarios the maximum peak flows are also highest in wg driven runs although no trend was evident in these maximum values wg driven runs showed a clear increase over time in flows exceeding the 95th percentile of baseline daily discharge fig 4 where gcm driven runs again showed no obvious trend and actually decreased between 2050 and 2090 the error bars shown in fig 4 also indicate the maximum and minimum number of these extreme events for each year simulated in the different sets of runs similarly to the case with peak flows these indicate that wg driven runs produce higher maximum flows caused by extreme events in some realizations gcm scenarios lack representation of high flows caused by extreme precipitation events the error bars also indicate higher variability in extreme flows 3 3 sediment transport trends sediment loading in the simulations reflected overall trends in the driving meteorological data as well as modeled discharge wg driven runs produced average cumulative sediment loads that were higher than the average baseline cumulative load for all years and gcm driven runs produced average cumulative loads lower than the baseline average for most years no clear trend was seen in gcm driven runs between 2020 and 2099 as with flow results cumulative sediment yield was highest in 2030 followed by 2020 simulated year 2099 did produce the 3rd highest cumulative load of the years modeled a large increase in cumulative sediment typically occurs in the spring as a result of spring melt and the associated high flows this increase was less pronounced or occurred earlier in later years of gcm driven runs for example 2099 in the wet gcm scenario fig 5 as with discharge wg driven runs showed increasing cumulative loads from 2020 through 2050 the model also produced steeper increases in cumulative loads during the summer and fall periods in 2020 and 2030 of the gcm driven simulations indicating more sediment mobilization following very high flows in the spring peak sediment loads were also higher in wg driven runs than in gcm driven scenarios and baseline realizations fig 6 shows average daily peak sediment flux across the 4 gcm runs as well as the peak sediment flux from across all wg and baseline realizations similar to peak flow the maximum and minimum peak loads are indicated by the error bars for each set of runs and each year fig 6 the average peak flux in the wg realizations shows an upward trend across the years simulated maximum peak fluxes from wg realizations are also significantly higher than those maxima produced by gcm driven runs as is overall variability in peak yields fig 6 alternatively peak sediment yields generated by the gcm scenarios are generally lower than baseline average peak sediment loads these also show no increasing or decreasing trend over time the number of extreme sediment yielding events follows a similar trend as extreme flow events as expected an increasing trend in number of extreme events is evident in wg driven runs but not in gcm driven runs sediment yields generated by wg realizations also reflect significant variability in comparison to yields generated by gcm scenarios wg driven runs also again show the ability to produce conditions leading to years with high numbers of extreme daily sediment loads wg driven runs again also show higher variability in the number of days resulting in extreme sediment loads generally gcm driven runs again produced relatively low numbers of extreme daily sediment yields in comparison to baseline and wg driven runs there was also significantly lower variability in the gcm driven sediment yields the highest number of days with extreme sediment yield occurred in 2030 in gcm driven scenarios as a result of very high spring flow almost no change 1 in the mean of the average annual ratio of streambank sediment relative to other sources of sediment was seen in either the gcm or wg driven runs at the watershed outlet means of the average annual ratios were calculated as the annual average of ratios calculated at a 3 h resolution for each simulation and then averaged across all simulations driven by the same weather scenario table 1 in baseline gcm and wg simulations the mean average annual ratio of streambank road and overland sediment to total sediment at the outlet of the watershed were similar however considerable variability was seen in these ratios both among simulations as well as throughout the year in a single simulation for example streambank sediment contributions ranged from 74 7 to 95 0 road sediment ranged from 2 3 to 18 3 and sediment mobilized by overland flow ranged from 1 8 to 9 9 of total sediment seen at the outlet under baseline conditions in this work model simulated bank collapse did not show the expected non linear response to changes in climate and actually showed a linear response close to zero 4 discussion although the potential impacts of climate change on discharge and sediment mobilization in a watershed are highly variable it is evident that local trends in precipitation and temperature will have important effects this study shows the simulated watershed response to increasing precipitation as well as to increasing temperatures increasing precipitation in the wg driven runs caused increases in discharge and sediment loading this occurred as higher snow totals during the winter higher flows in the spring and an increase in more extreme precipitation and resulting flow events that caused higher erosion throughout the simulation period no overall increase in discharge occurred in the gcm driven runs most likely because gcm scenarios did not reflect an observed regional trend in increasing frequency and magnitude of precipitation extremes however because of increasing temperatures in the gcm driven runs changes in the timing and magnitude of spring melt did occur the model predicted lower cumulative sediment loading in future years when driven by gcm scenarios due both to lower flows in spring and fewer extreme precipitation and flow events throughout the summer months stochastic wgs often generate precipitation realizations based on statistical sampling where other variables may be determined based on their co occurrence probabilities and the occurrence of wet and dry days fowler et al 2007 we expect that using driving data with representation of both increasing temperatures and precipitation would show more variability over time in the relative contribution of sediment sources increasing temperatures and longer storm durations contributing to wetter antecedent conditions might produce more erosion of land surfaces where extreme precipitation events are likely to particularly increase sediment mobilization from erosion of roads and streambanks we simulated these changes using the coupled dhsvm bstem model and although we saw the expected increases in overall sediment yields in response to higher precipitation and increased frequency of events we saw little change in the ratio of sediment from one source to another continued efforts in developing wgs should focus on an approach that can be tailored to specific regions and represent observed trends as well as variability in multiple climate variables additionally approaches targeted at regional dynamic models should be specifically adapted for simulation of smaller scale weather processes this study highlights the need for higher resolution meteorological data that reflects local trends in climate a regionally variable deficiency in gcms for the purpose of impacts evaluation the results presented here clearly show that both temperature and precipitation have a significant influence on discharge and sediment mobilization in a watershed through the behavior of snowpack and soil moisture earlier spring snow melt could also result in earlier erosion and incision of banks making areas more susceptible to spring precipitation events representing the trend of increasing storm duration and the tendency towards longer wet and dry periods would also affect discharge and loading estimates both higher temperatures and longer storm durations would contribute to wetter conditions in the watershed producing antecedent conditions where soils are more saturated and the watershed is more vulnerable to any precipitation event even if not extreme in nature contrasting model results from the wg versus gcm driven model runs show that failure to capture changes in extreme precipitation in future climate scenarios translates to underestimation of the influence of increasing snowpack higher peak discharges and greater sediment yields this result suggests using extreme caution when using gcm data for hydrological climate change impacts evaluation in the northeastern united states variability in micrometeorological variables not included in our downscaled gcm inputs windspeed humidity incoming shortwave and longwave radiation can be expected to influence a set of ecosystem processes such as carbon and energy cycling root uptake by plants soil moisture and others that will impact water and sediment fluxes from watersheds more comprehensive climate change simulations of these complex ecosystem interactions will require new methods to downscale these micrometeorological variables to subdaily timesteps high resolution distributed watershed modeling can help tease apart the specific processes that might be altered as a result of climate change in this work we focused specifically on the effects of temperature and precipitation while the effects of these other meteorological variables were not explored similarly processes other than erosion may also be contributing to simulated sediment output such as soil thawing and the effects of vegetation these processes are not considered here no trends were seen in the ratio of modeled contributions of sediment from streambanks roads and overland erosion over time either using wg or gcm driving data while the lack of trends suggests that streambank collapse and incision do not begin to dominate sediment mobilization under more extreme precipitation contrary to what is expected it may also be that meteorological inputs were insufficient to characterize local climate changes at the resolution needed to see watershed response using this model alternatively it may suggest that other factors could be driving the relative importance of bank failures in the watershed although high precipitation and flow events contribute to streambank erosion and failure there is not a direct proportionality between the magnitude and frequency of the event and the rate or amount of erosion and failure wynn and mostaghimi 2006 used regression analysis to evaluate which factors including soil properties antecedent conditions root density and freeze thaw cycling were most influential in determining erodibility and shear stress of streambanks these authors found that soil bulk density had a crucial role in determining erodibility among a number of other factors it is likely that soil and stream characteristics held constant or determined using the same probability distributions in the runs presented in this work have an important effect on soil erosion and failure processes in this watershed improved parameterization including potentially tighter distributions of soil parameters such as bulk density could alter how erosion mechanisms respond to meteorological inputs it should also be noted that the ratio of sediment sources examined for this work were annual average ratios of sediment transported to the outlet of the watershed the relatively unchanging ratios could also be a result of the particle size bins and the preferential transport of finer sediment sizes looking at the ratio of sediment from these sources on an event or seasonal basis would likely show more variability similarly analysis at the subwatershed scale could also indicate different dynamics in the mechanisms that mobilize sediment 5 conclusions model results demonstrated that trends in regional precipitation and temperature both impact hydrological and sediment transport processes where increasing temperatures resulted in earlier and higher spring melt and associated changes in discharge and sediment yield and simulated changes in precipitation resulted in higher and more frequent extreme discharge events and sediment yields no significant changes in the ratios of sediment from streambank road and overland sources was observed either because the model was not capturing the dynamics of sediment partitioning possibly due to limitations in the driving data or because other factors are driving the relative magnitude of bank erosion and failure in generating suspended sediment in this watershed although simulating temperature and precipitation trends separately in this work allowed for comparison of the distinct impacts of changes in these driving factors it limited assessment of the combined effects of trends in climate change in this region the lack of available data that represent trends or changes in other meteorological variables such as incoming solar radiation and wind is also limiting changes in these other meteorological variables will likely occur with changing temperature and precipitation and will also impact hydrological and sediment responses in many watersheds it was beyond the scope of this work to investigate relative contributions of sediment from streambank road and overland erosion at various time scales but such an analysis might have provided more information on how these mechanisms might be altered as a result of changing flow regimes this work adds to the body of research that shows the influences of climate change on watershed processes that determine discharge and sediment loading both of which are critical watershed management issues local increases in temperature can be expected to alter snow melt processes and flow regimes local increases in precipitation and extreme events can be expected to generate larger yields of suspended sediment there is significant value in high resolution modeling of these processes to help understand potential changes that critically affect water quality of streams and rivers as well as receiving water bodies however such modeling requires high resolution meteorological data that represent expected changes in local climate particularly in both temperature and precipitation this work uses a new approach to simulating distributed bank erosion and failure within a watershed model to explicitly investigate the impacts of climate change on sediment fluxes we conclude that local increases in temperature and precipitation are likely to increase sediment loading in the modeled watershed as a result of changes in snow melt an overall increase in wetter conditions as well as in response to more extreme precipitation and flow events the interaction of these influences is likely to create the most significant instances of bank erosion and sediment loading that would impact ecological systems infrastructure water quality and other aspects of watershed health and sustainability the ability to represent these mechanistic processes in a spatially explicit model environment offers new opportunities for identification of critical source and high risk areas as well as an opportunity for further work to simulate the

8515,study region we investigate the impacts of local temperature and precipitation trends on discharge and sediment loading by applying the model to a watershed in the northeastern us where trends in increasing precipitation exceed those of other regions in north america study focus in this study we simulate the response of watershed sediment loading to changing frequencies and magnitudes of extreme precipitation events using a coupled model that explicitly simulates streambank erosion and failure within a distributed watershed model to drive the model we use meteorological inputs from general circulation models gcms as well as from a statistical weather generator wg new hydrological insights for the region changes in the timing and magnitude of snow melt and spring flows as well as associated sediment mobilization resulted from increases in temperature increases in discharge and sediment load resulted from increases in precipitation events exceeding the 95th percentile in runs driven by wg weather data positive trends were evident in peak as well as annual discharge and suspended sediment yields over the years modeled no clear trends were seen in gcm driven runs which do not capture historically observed trends in extreme precipitation this work is consistent with other studies in that it shows important changes in discharge and sediment yields from a watershed resulting from ongoing changes in climate keywords extreme flows suspended sediment peak flows changing precipitation sediment modeling 1 introduction changing weather patterns will have complex and nonlinear impacts on many human and environmental systems including on processes governing the mobilization and transport of sediment within watersheds significant increases in the frequency of extreme precipitation events have been documented in the united states karl and knight 1998 kunkel et al 1999 kunkel 2003 guilbert et al 2015 although relationships between sediment loading and discharge vary among watersheds webb and walling 1982 williams 1989 asselman 1999 hamshaw 2014 extreme precipitation and or resulting flow events result in disproportionately higher suspended sediment loading in transport limited systems gonzalez hidalgo et al 2010 oeurng et al 2010 increased sediment yields resulting from such events can exceed the capacity of existing infrastructure as well as result in the increased transport of sediment bound nutrients to receiving water bodies one of the mechanisms by which sediment is mobilized particularly in response to high precipitation and flow events is through streambank erosion and failure these processes though widely observed have not heretofore been widely included in watershed models efforts to integrate streambank erosion and phosphorus mobilization are important in watershed model development for assessments mittelstet et al 2016 particularly in the context of understanding the impacts of climate change and increasing extremes increased sediment loading due specifically to streambank erosion can not only contribute large amounts of sediment bound phosphorus and other nutrients kronvang et al 2012 1997 but can also negatively impact water quality both in the watershed and further downstream the contributions of bank erosion have been investigated in the northeastern united states by authors including langendoen et al 2012 dewolfe et al 2004 morrissey et al 2011 nagle et al 2007 and others accelerated streambank erosion can contribute to disproportionate sediment supply to specific areas of a watershed stream channel instability land and habitat loss water quality degradation as well as other consequences us epa 2012 in addition erosion and undercutting of banks and the continued incision of streams can affect the flood resiliency of adjacent areas and infrastructure both heavy rainfall and high flows from snowmelt driven by temperature variability can result in adverse impacts therefore ability to model the combination of conditions watershed state and precipitation that give rise to high loadings under changing extremes would advance understanding of stream watershed and receiving water body response to changing precipitation extremes computational techniques have been used to understand the physical processes and mechanisms responsible for observable changes in the environment one of the advantages of developing physics based modeling approaches is the capability of simulating scenarios that are outside the range of those previously observed stryker et al 2017 coupled the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 and the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem simon et al 2000 2003 2011 in order to better represent the mechanistic processes governing streambank erosion and failure within a distributed watershed model dhsvm is a distributed watershed model that simulates water and energy fluxes at sub daily time steps dhsvm has been used extensively to evaluate impacts of environmental change as well as anthropogenic land use change such as from urbanization and deforestation on watershed hydrology leung and wigmosta 1999 bowling et al 2000 whitaker et al 2002 cuo et al 2009 lanini et al 2009 safeeq and fares 2012 this model also incorporates the mobilization of sediment due to overland and road erosion in response to precipitation and the transport of sediment across the land surface and within the stream network doten et al 2006 bstem was chosen for its advanced physics based representation of both hydraulic and geotechnical processes that play a role in erosion and bank failure it consists of two components a toe erosion module to simulate undercutting of banks by streamflow and a bank stability module to assess the likelihood of failure and the most likely failure plane the representation of bank undercutting resulting from fluvial erosion as a function of excess shear stress is critical to accurate simulation of bank stability simon et al 2000 particularly for examining changing flow regimes in addition bstem simulates the physical characteristics of soils including negative pore pressures that can develop in unsaturated soil conditions since warmer temperatures are likely to affect soil moisture balances the ability to simulate the role of these processes on bank stability is also significant this improved modeling approach is therefore suitable for investigating the impact of climate change scenarios and the occurrence of extreme events on the hydrology and sediment mobilization in small 100 101 km2 and meso 101 102 km2 scale watersheds in order to simulate the impacts of climate change however such models require specific meteorological inputs that reflect the anticipated deviations in climate variables particularly temperature and precipitation several studies have shown that precipitation in the united states and in the northeast region specifically is increasing and becoming more variable in magnitude kunkel et al 1999 2013 kunkel 2003 groisman et al 2005 guilbert et al 2015 kunkel et al 2013 also projected that temperatures in this region will continue to increase between approximately 2 and 6 c by 2080 at current emission rates and that heavy precipitation as well as drought risk will continue to increase authors have also found evidence of a signficiant increase in precipitation occurring as extreme precipitation events heaviest 1 of rainfall over the last approximately 50 years e g karl et al 2009 groisman et al 2001 2012 regional or local trends are critical for investigating impacts of climate change on human life and ecosystem response katz and brown 1992 hayhoe et al 2006 2008 furthermore global circulation model gcm data including the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 data do not capture historically observed trends and variability in precipitation in some regions of the northeast guilbert et al 2014 mohammed et al 2015 another challenge to simulating the impacts of climate change at the watershed scale is the temporal resolution of most climate projection data for example xu 1999 xu et al 2005 and prudhomme et al 2002 noted that gcm products are not adequate for driving hydrological models in part because they perform poorly at subdaily and even daily time steps particularly in mountainous watersheds storm events often pass within a day leading to high temporal variability in water and sediment fluxes not captured in models operating on daily time steps a number of approaches exist to address the unsuitable spatial and temporal scale of gcms including regional climate models hypothetical scenarios and both dynamic and statistical downscaling techniques xu 1999 alternative methods to gcms such as statistical weather generators wgs may be better suited for the prediction of future temperature and precipitation data for specific regions although these techniques have been applied to watershed modeling these approaches also have limitations and key challenges still exist in using existing climate data products to simulate impacts of future trends in settings like this our application is set in a region where changes in extreme precipitation are well documented the watershed encompasses high gradient headwater forested streams and agricultural floodplains post glacial alluvial sediments dominate the landscape and its history includes significant anthropogenic changes in land use such as deforestation and to stream channels such as mill dams and channelization making it susceptible to impacts of high precipitation and flow events whalen 1998 barg and blazewicz 2003 dunn et al 2007a b nagle et al 2007 walter and merritts 2008 again subdaily simulation is critical for capturing the dynamic processes in such watersheds and understanding the influences of changes in precipitation and temperature in the context of this paper extreme precipitation events are characterized as those resulting in daily flows that exceed the 95th percentile this work goes beyond using downscaled gcm output to also using temperature and precipitation data created with a statistical wg that captures local trends and variability in precipitation to drive model runs we apply a physically based watershed model to investigate impacts of increases in temperature and extreme precipitation magnitude and frequency on flow and sediment production dynamics in a meso scale high gradient watershed the primary goal of this study is to assess the hydrological and sediment related impacts of climate change in a representative northeastern us watershed particularly with respect to the increased occurrence of extreme events the secondary purpose of this study is to assess the ability of these climate products to reflect the non stationary shifts in climate that are occurring in this region and the resulting alterations in hydrologic and sediment related processes at a watershed scale 2 methods this study examines hydrological and sediment related simulations produced by the coupled dhsvm bstem model stryker et al 2017 and driven by two sets of meteorological inputs the hydrology model dhsvm mechanistically simulates watershed hydrology wigmosta et al 1994 and uses a 4 point finite difference scheme based on wicks and bathurst 1996 to move sediment downslope through a channel network where sediment is binned by size and routed independently doten et al 2006 transported load includes changes in stored sediment as well as suspended sediment and total transport is limited by bagnold s equation bagnold 1966 based on bstem v5 4 toe erosion and undercutting of channels is calculated as a function of excess shear stress and a force equilibrium analysis used to estimate a factor of safety fos simon et al 2011 if the bank fails sediment that enters the stream channel is routed downstream with other local stream flows eroded sediment from roads overland sediment sediment from upstream and suspended sediment the study site was the mad river watershed in central vermont which drains approximately 373 km2 of land and is bordered by the green mountains land use in the watershed was assumed static for the purposes of focusing on the impacts of specific changes in climate where 86 5 was classified as mixed forest 2 1 as roads 5 5 as urban residential and 4 4 as agricultural including crops pasture and hay based on the 2006 national land use cover dataset nlcd stryker et al 2017 demonstrated the ability of the coupled model to represent sediment mobilization from watershed sources particularly in response to larger precipitation and flow events to evaluate model performance in that work simulated sediment loads for the entire watershed were compared to load estimates based on measured suspended solids at the outlet of the watershed model simulated concentrations at the outlet of several subbasins were compared to measured concentrations at those locations the same model calibration presented in that work was used here all spatial input files and parameter values are as described by stryker et al 2017 the mad river watershed drains to lake champlain a freshwater lake situated between vermont new york and canada lake champlain has experienced an increase in frequency of summer harmful cyanobacteria algae blooms watzin et al 2010 which is in agreement with expected impacts of climate change for many freshwater lakes whitehead et al 2009 moss 2012 el khoury et al 2015 regional climate change trends in the northeastern united states and the lake champlain basin including warming temperatures particularly in winter and increased persistence and variability in precipitation events are more pronounced than global trends frumhoff et al 2007 stager and thill 2010 guilbert et al 2015 in vermont specifically betts 2011 has documented several indicators of warming temperatures including a shorter freeze periods and longer growing seasons over the last 50 years in addition to experiencing climate trends representative of the northeastern united states this watershed is also representative of northern new england watersheds that have steep headwaters draining to floodplains with a history of deforestation for agriculture peak flows in this region typically occur in the spring where snow melt has a significant impact on flow magnitude in addition to spring precipitation tropical storm irene which affected vermont in august 2011 following a heavy spring rainfall is an example of an extreme event that caused significant impacts to the lake champlain basin this event caused tributary flooding intense lateral erosion of streambanks long term changes to river channels and valley morphology and significant damage to bridges stormwater infrastructure and private property pealer 2012 lake champlain basin program 2013 this event also resulted in large pulses of potentially nutrient laden sediments to lake champlain 2 1 climate data using the calibrated dhsvm bstem model for the mad river watershed model runs were conducted for the water years 01 oct 30 sept 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 2090 and 2099 each of these water years was preceded by a 10 month spin up period 01 jan 30 sep to set initial state variables two sets of climate temperature and precipitation data were used to drive the model the first set of this data was developed by winter et al 2016 and based on the output of gcm simulations winter et al used simulations from phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 multimodel ensemble downscaled to an intermediate resolution using the bias corrected with constructed analogs bcca method brekke et al 2013 as the basis for further downscaling the bcca ensemble included 20 gcms run as part of cmip5 under two representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 winter et al 2016 further downscaled that data set specifically for a mountainous region in the northeast that included our study area by using empirical relationships between elevation and daily maximum and minimum surface temperature and precipitation from local station data the result was gridded maximum and minimum surface temperatures as well as precipitation available at a daily time step for 1950 2099 for this work we chose four locally downscaled gcm scenarios for rcp 8 5 representing the 90th percentile of the reference emissions range and similarly representative of greenhouse gas and particle emissions resulting in greater than 8 5 w m2 of radiative forcing in 2100 moss et al 2010 we used a warm scenario a cool scenario 2nd coolest of rcp8 5 a wet scenario and a dry scenario these scenarios are meant to bracket future climate trajectories the second set of data were developed by white et al in press using a statistical wg white et al generated meteorological time maximum and minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation using a markov chain monte carlo approach with non stationary precipitation and extreme precipitation distributions this method incorporated the trends noted by guilbert et al 2015 to generate a precipitation time series that statistically reflects the changing probability of extreme events and allows for increasing variance and skewness in the precipitation distribution looking into the future these data were available for the years 2011 2050 for this work we randomly chose 100 realizations from the time series produced by white et al in press for the water years 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 to drive the watershed model although simulated runoff and streamflow are most affected by temperature and precipitation dhsvm requires additional meteorological inputs including humidity wind speed incoming longwave radiation and incoming shortwave radiation these variables affect energy and carbon fluxes vegetation processes and other model processes to complete the meteorological inputs wind speed humidity incoming longwave radiation and incoming shortwave radiation required for the coupled hydrology bank stability model we used national centers for environmental protection ncep reanalysis data provided by the noaa oar esrl psd boulder colorado usa http www esrl noaa gov psd the north american regional reanalysis narr data are high resolution combined model and assimilated time series datasets available at a resolution of eight times daily narr data were assessed for a 15 year period spanning 2000 2014 to evaluate interannual variability see supplemental information data for the period 01 january 2012 through 30 september 2013 representative of this 15 year window were used in all model runs to complete the meteorology time series climate inputs included both downscaled deterministic gcm based scenarios 4 scenarios for 9 different years as well as wg derived scenarios which were assessed as an ensemble 100 realizations of temperature and precipitation for each of 4 different years due to the long run times continuous long term periods were not simulated and results of single water years in 10 year increments were evaluated we assessed baseline results as the average of 85 realizations of statistically generated precipitation and temperature for the water year 2012 in order to isolate the impacts of future temperature and precipitation predictions on watershed discharge and sediment the statistics describing precipitation for the 2012 wg realizations were very similar to those for observed 2011 data and therefore considered representative of a baseline scenario the meteorological input files for these baseline realizations were then completed with the same narr 2012 water year variables as future scenario runs 2 2 sub daily model inputs the coupled watershed model operates most reliability at higher temporal resolutions particularly for the purpose of simulating dynamic hydrology and sediment in mountain settings such as our study site therefore it was necessary to generate subdaily inputs based on the daily data from winter et al 2016 and white et al in press chow and levermore 2007 described several methods for creating hourly temperature from daily maximum and minimum temperatures t max and t min respectively as well as an improved method using average daily temperature in this work we used the sin 14r 1 method for linked days as described by chow and levermore where t max was set to occur at 2 p m and t min to occur one hour before sunrise hourly temperature was calculated as t t t e m p n e x t t e m p p r e v 2 t e m p n e x t t e m p p r e v 2 cos π t t p r e v t n e x t t p r e v where temp next is the next known temperature value either t max or t min and temp prev is the next known temperature value either t max or t min t next is the time for the next known temperature value and t prev is the time for the previous known temperature value and t is the time sunrise and sunset times were calculated according to the latitude of the study site based on a standard formula described in scharmer and greif 2000 sub daily precipitation inputs were generated from daily gcm and wg data by matching predicted storms to existing storms and partitioning the rainfall similarly through the duration of the storm quality controlled historical hourly precipitation data from the burlington international airport weather station in burlington vermont were downloaded from noaa s national climatic data center ncdc http www ncdc noaa gov these data span the period 01 may 1948 through 30 november 2011 we analyzed statistics of historical precipitation events from this dataset including the total duration and depth of each storm in days as well as the percentage of the total depth that fell in each day and hour of the event for each future precipitation scenario at daily resolution we found the location in the time series and magnitude of all non zero values to identify individual precipitation events for each precipitation event we calculated daily statistics including duration depth and percentage of rainfall that fell in each day of an event for a one day event we sampled a one day historical precipitation event of the same depth from the burlington data if no equal depth was found we averaged five storms with the closest total depths for a two day event we sampled an existing storm that matched the total depth and the percentage of rain that fell in each day if we found no exact depth match we averaged the 10 storms with the closest depths if we found no equal percentages we averaged the five storms with the most similar distribution of rainfall if the storm persisted for longer than two days we searched the historical record for a matching event if we identified no suitable precipitation event then we used a combination of shorter duration precipitation events to generate a suitable event to accomplish this we sampled the longest existing storm that matched the depth of equal duration during the daily predicted storm first then sampled other existing storms of similar depth to fill in the time remaining in the predicted storm once we matched each precipitation event with a historical event or combination of historical events we added or subtracted tenths of millimeters of precipitation from random locations within the event to match the total storm depth from the future precipitation events 3 results temperature and precipitation scenarios had clear influences on simulated hydrologic processes including snow accumulation and melt discharge and sediment mobilization modeled climate trends show differences deriving from the gcm and wg data we present these followed by resulting differences in flow and sediment we investigate results representative of changes in extreme flow and sediment yield where extreme indicates those results exceeding the 95th percentile 3 1 climate trends clear differences are evident in the climate time series produced by the alternate methods employed here wg derived precipitation shows an increase in annual precipitation as well as a slight trend in the 95th percentile of daily precipitation over the period of 2020 through 2050 these trends are not present in any of the gcm scenarios used here annual precipitation and extreme precipitation totals in wg realizations are also higher overall than predicted by gcms for all years simulated an increasing trend in maximum storm depth is reflected in wg realizations although these realizations do not reflect longer storm durations gcm scenarios have a higher number of wet days although it has been acknowledged that in part due to the coarse spatial resolution gcms tend to over predict the number of days experiencing rainfall with rainfall intensity being lower than stations within the gcm grid cell wehner et al 2010 in particular gcm data do not reflect the likelihood of increasing extreme events and variability in precipitation patterns evident in observed data for this region maurer et al 2002 mohammed et al 2015 in contrast gcm scenarios do represent historical and expected trends in temperature whereas wg realizations in this case were designed to not include these trends maximum minimum and mean temperatures clearly increase over the 2020 through 2099 period in gcm data a comparison of annual precipitation is shown in fig 1 while 95th percentile extreme precipitation annual number of wet days maximum storm depth maximum storm duration as well as maximum and minimum temperatures between wg realizations and gcm scenarios are shown in figs s2 s7 in supplemental information 3 2 stream flow gcm driven runs show a trend of earlier spring melt and lower cumulative snow water equivalent totals fig 2 the spring day in which total simulated snow water equivalent was 0 1 cm occurred 17 days earlier in the 2099 warm gcm simulation than in the corresponding 2020 warm gcm simulation in wg driven runs this date was within 5 days of the baseline average of may 3rd and we saw no trend between 2020 and 2050 wg driven simulations which assume stationary temperature and nonstationary precipitation the cumulative amount of snow water equivalent over the winter season total for the watershed decreased from 2020 to 2099 in all 4 gcm driven scenarios from an average cumulative total of approximately 0 31 m in 2020 to approximately 0 20 m in 2099 snow water equivalent increased in wg driven runs from an average cumulative total of approximately 0 24 m in 2020 to 0 27 m in 2050 where baseline 2012 runs had an average cumulative total of approximately 0 24 m trends or lack thereof were also apparent in simulated discharge the wg driven runs produced a trend in cumulative discharge that reflected the increase in annual precipitation for the modeled watershed fig 3 cumulative discharge in wg driven runs increased between 2020 and 2050 runs while gcm driven runs reflect no clear pattern over time as expected because of the lack of trends in gcm precipitation however warming temperatures have a clear impact on spring melt processes reflected in discharge occurring particularly during the spring where snow melt contributes to high flows for instance the wet gcm 2099 simulation resulted in higher discharge throughout the winter period and a less significant increase in cumulative discharge during the typical melt period around april spring flows were highest in 2030 and were also high in 2020 gcm scenarios this was due to rapid warming and resulting snow melt and consistent with ongoing observed changes in vermont and other regions of new england betts 2011 hodgkins et al 2002 as expected wg realizations produced higher peak flows and more extreme flows than all gcm scenarios average peak flows were higher in wg driven runs and show an increasing trend between 2020 and 2050 fig 4 we saw no clear trend over time in gcm simulations reflecting the lack of trend in gcm precipitation in fig 4 we show average peak flows from across the gcm scenarios wg realizations as well as the average of baseline scenarios peak flows from gcm scenarios were generally similar or less than peak flows seen in baseline simulations in gcm driven simulations peak flow was highest in 2060 peaks seen in the gcm simulations were the result of rapid snow melt in the spring and not a result of extreme precipitation events in addition we also show the maximum and minimum peak flows in each year for the different sets of runs error bars in fig 4 wg driven realizations resulted in more variability in peak flow events than gcm driven scenarios the maximum peak flows are also highest in wg driven runs although no trend was evident in these maximum values wg driven runs showed a clear increase over time in flows exceeding the 95th percentile of baseline daily discharge fig 4 where gcm driven runs again showed no obvious trend and actually decreased between 2050 and 2090 the error bars shown in fig 4 also indicate the maximum and minimum number of these extreme events for each year simulated in the different sets of runs similarly to the case with peak flows these indicate that wg driven runs produce higher maximum flows caused by extreme events in some realizations gcm scenarios lack representation of high flows caused by extreme precipitation events the error bars also indicate higher variability in extreme flows 3 3 sediment transport trends sediment loading in the simulations reflected overall trends in the driving meteorological data as well as modeled discharge wg driven runs produced average cumulative sediment loads that were higher than the average baseline cumulative load for all years and gcm driven runs produced average cumulative loads lower than the baseline average for most years no clear trend was seen in gcm driven runs between 2020 and 2099 as with flow results cumulative sediment yield was highest in 2030 followed by 2020 simulated year 2099 did produce the 3rd highest cumulative load of the years modeled a large increase in cumulative sediment typically occurs in the spring as a result of spring melt and the associated high flows this increase was less pronounced or occurred earlier in later years of gcm driven runs for example 2099 in the wet gcm scenario fig 5 as with discharge wg driven runs showed increasing cumulative loads from 2020 through 2050 the model also produced steeper increases in cumulative loads during the summer and fall periods in 2020 and 2030 of the gcm driven simulations indicating more sediment mobilization following very high flows in the spring peak sediment loads were also higher in wg driven runs than in gcm driven scenarios and baseline realizations fig 6 shows average daily peak sediment flux across the 4 gcm runs as well as the peak sediment flux from across all wg and baseline realizations similar to peak flow the maximum and minimum peak loads are indicated by the error bars for each set of runs and each year fig 6 the average peak flux in the wg realizations shows an upward trend across the years simulated maximum peak fluxes from wg realizations are also significantly higher than those maxima produced by gcm driven runs as is overall variability in peak yields fig 6 alternatively peak sediment yields generated by the gcm scenarios are generally lower than baseline average peak sediment loads these also show no increasing or decreasing trend over time the number of extreme sediment yielding events follows a similar trend as extreme flow events as expected an increasing trend in number of extreme events is evident in wg driven runs but not in gcm driven runs sediment yields generated by wg realizations also reflect significant variability in comparison to yields generated by gcm scenarios wg driven runs also again show the ability to produce conditions leading to years with high numbers of extreme daily sediment loads wg driven runs again also show higher variability in the number of days resulting in extreme sediment loads generally gcm driven runs again produced relatively low numbers of extreme daily sediment yields in comparison to baseline and wg driven runs there was also significantly lower variability in the gcm driven sediment yields the highest number of days with extreme sediment yield occurred in 2030 in gcm driven scenarios as a result of very high spring flow almost no change 1 in the mean of the average annual ratio of streambank sediment relative to other sources of sediment was seen in either the gcm or wg driven runs at the watershed outlet means of the average annual ratios were calculated as the annual average of ratios calculated at a 3 h resolution for each simulation and then averaged across all simulations driven by the same weather scenario table 1 in baseline gcm and wg simulations the mean average annual ratio of streambank road and overland sediment to total sediment at the outlet of the watershed were similar however considerable variability was seen in these ratios both among simulations as well as throughout the year in a single simulation for example streambank sediment contributions ranged from 74 7 to 95 0 road sediment ranged from 2 3 to 18 3 and sediment mobilized by overland flow ranged from 1 8 to 9 9 of total sediment seen at the outlet under baseline conditions in this work model simulated bank collapse did not show the expected non linear response to changes in climate and actually showed a linear response close to zero 4 discussion although the potential impacts of climate change on discharge and sediment mobilization in a watershed are highly variable it is evident that local trends in precipitation and temperature will have important effects this study shows the simulated watershed response to increasing precipitation as well as to increasing temperatures increasing precipitation in the wg driven runs caused increases in discharge and sediment loading this occurred as higher snow totals during the winter higher flows in the spring and an increase in more extreme precipitation and resulting flow events that caused higher erosion throughout the simulation period no overall increase in discharge occurred in the gcm driven runs most likely because gcm scenarios did not reflect an observed regional trend in increasing frequency and magnitude of precipitation extremes however because of increasing temperatures in the gcm driven runs changes in the timing and magnitude of spring melt did occur the model predicted lower cumulative sediment loading in future years when driven by gcm scenarios due both to lower flows in spring and fewer extreme precipitation and flow events throughout the summer months stochastic wgs often generate precipitation realizations based on statistical sampling where other variables may be determined based on their co occurrence probabilities and the occurrence of wet and dry days fowler et al 2007 we expect that using driving data with representation of both increasing temperatures and precipitation would show more variability over time in the relative contribution of sediment sources increasing temperatures and longer storm durations contributing to wetter antecedent conditions might produce more erosion of land surfaces where extreme precipitation events are likely to particularly increase sediment mobilization from erosion of roads and streambanks we simulated these changes using the coupled dhsvm bstem model and although we saw the expected increases in overall sediment yields in response to higher precipitation and increased frequency of events we saw little change in the ratio of sediment from one source to another continued efforts in developing wgs should focus on an approach that can be tailored to specific regions and represent observed trends as well as variability in multiple climate variables additionally approaches targeted at regional dynamic models should be specifically adapted for simulation of smaller scale weather processes this study highlights the need for higher resolution meteorological data that reflects local trends in climate a regionally variable deficiency in gcms for the purpose of impacts evaluation the results presented here clearly show that both temperature and precipitation have a significant influence on discharge and sediment mobilization in a watershed through the behavior of snowpack and soil moisture earlier spring snow melt could also result in earlier erosion and incision of banks making areas more susceptible to spring precipitation events representing the trend of increasing storm duration and the tendency towards longer wet and dry periods would also affect discharge and loading estimates both higher temperatures and longer storm durations would contribute to wetter conditions in the watershed producing antecedent conditions where soils are more saturated and the watershed is more vulnerable to any precipitation event even if not extreme in nature contrasting model results from the wg versus gcm driven model runs show that failure to capture changes in extreme precipitation in future climate scenarios translates to underestimation of the influence of increasing snowpack higher peak discharges and greater sediment yields this result suggests using extreme caution when using gcm data for hydrological climate change impacts evaluation in the northeastern united states variability in micrometeorological variables not included in our downscaled gcm inputs windspeed humidity incoming shortwave and longwave radiation can be expected to influence a set of ecosystem processes such as carbon and energy cycling root uptake by plants soil moisture and others that will impact water and sediment fluxes from watersheds more comprehensive climate change simulations of these complex ecosystem interactions will require new methods to downscale these micrometeorological variables to subdaily timesteps high resolution distributed watershed modeling can help tease apart the specific processes that might be altered as a result of climate change in this work we focused specifically on the effects of temperature and precipitation while the effects of these other meteorological variables were not explored similarly processes other than erosion may also be contributing to simulated sediment output such as soil thawing and the effects of vegetation these processes are not considered here no trends were seen in the ratio of modeled contributions of sediment from streambanks roads and overland erosion over time either using wg or gcm driving data while the lack of trends suggests that streambank collapse and incision do not begin to dominate sediment mobilization under more extreme precipitation contrary to what is expected it may also be that meteorological inputs were insufficient to characterize local climate changes at the resolution needed to see watershed response using this model alternatively it may suggest that other factors could be driving the relative importance of bank failures in the watershed although high precipitation and flow events contribute to streambank erosion and failure there is not a direct proportionality between the magnitude and frequency of the event and the rate or amount of erosion and failure wynn and mostaghimi 2006 used regression analysis to evaluate which factors including soil properties antecedent conditions root density and freeze thaw cycling were most influential in determining erodibility and shear stress of streambanks these authors found that soil bulk density had a crucial role in determining erodibility among a number of other factors it is likely that soil and stream characteristics held constant or determined using the same probability distributions in the runs presented in this work have an important effect on soil erosion and failure processes in this watershed improved parameterization including potentially tighter distributions of soil parameters such as bulk density could alter how erosion mechanisms respond to meteorological inputs it should also be noted that the ratio of sediment sources examined for this work were annual average ratios of sediment transported to the outlet of the watershed the relatively unchanging ratios could also be a result of the particle size bins and the preferential transport of finer sediment sizes looking at the ratio of sediment from these sources on an event or seasonal basis would likely show more variability similarly analysis at the subwatershed scale could also indicate different dynamics in the mechanisms that mobilize sediment 5 conclusions model results demonstrated that trends in regional precipitation and temperature both impact hydrological and sediment transport processes where increasing temperatures resulted in earlier and higher spring melt and associated changes in discharge and sediment yield and simulated changes in precipitation resulted in higher and more frequent extreme discharge events and sediment yields no significant changes in the ratios of sediment from streambank road and overland sources was observed either because the model was not capturing the dynamics of sediment partitioning possibly due to limitations in the driving data or because other factors are driving the relative magnitude of bank erosion and failure in generating suspended sediment in this watershed although simulating temperature and precipitation trends separately in this work allowed for comparison of the distinct impacts of changes in these driving factors it limited assessment of the combined effects of trends in climate change in this region the lack of available data that represent trends or changes in other meteorological variables such as incoming solar radiation and wind is also limiting changes in these other meteorological variables will likely occur with changing temperature and precipitation and will also impact hydrological and sediment responses in many watersheds it was beyond the scope of this work to investigate relative contributions of sediment from streambank road and overland erosion at various time scales but such an analysis might have provided more information on how these mechanisms might be altered as a result of changing flow regimes this work adds to the body of research that shows the influences of climate change on watershed processes that determine discharge and sediment loading both of which are critical watershed management issues local increases in temperature can be expected to alter snow melt processes and flow regimes local increases in precipitation and extreme events can be expected to generate larger yields of suspended sediment there is significant value in high resolution modeling of these processes to help understand potential changes that critically affect water quality of streams and rivers as well as receiving water bodies however such modeling requires high resolution meteorological data that represent expected changes in local climate particularly in both temperature and precipitation this work uses a new approach to simulating distributed bank erosion and failure within a watershed model to explicitly investigate the impacts of climate change on sediment fluxes we conclude that local increases in temperature and precipitation are likely to increase sediment loading in the modeled watershed as a result of changes in snow melt an overall increase in wetter conditions as well as in response to more extreme precipitation and flow events the interaction of these influences is likely to create the most significant instances of bank erosion and sediment loading that would impact ecological systems infrastructure water quality and other aspects of watershed health and sustainability the ability to represent these mechanistic processes in a spatially explicit model environment offers new opportunities for identification of critical source and high risk areas as well as an opportunity for further work to simulate the

8516,study region eastern nile river basin ethiopia sudan and egypt study focus this study aims to understand the future water development perspective in the eastern nile region by considering the current water use situation and proposed reservoirs in the upper blue nile abbay river basin in ethiopia using a simulation approach the study was carried out by using a monthly time step and historical ensemble time series data as representative of possible near future scenarios series of existing and proposed cascaded water development projects in the upper blue nile were considered in the study new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated an overall energy gain in the eastern nile region increases by 258 the upstream country ethiopia can generate as much as 38200 gwh year of energy while the energy production in sudan increases by 39 the cascaded developments integrated with existing water resources systems have a performance efficiency of above 92 this study was an indicative analysis of the potential benefit of upstream nile development without significantly affecting existing development in the nile basin further scientific analysis in this direction would help the nile countries to reach a water use agreement keywords eastern nile water resource modeling blue nile cascades renaissance dam 1 introduction there is huge hydro power development potential in the eastern nile basin waterbury 2002 swain 2002 the greatest development potential about 58 of the total in the nile basin is located in ethiopia this is because of the great differences in altitude ethiopia 2000 there are a number of water resource development projects in ethiopia specifically in the abbay river basin the projects are at different stage of development some are in operational stage some are under construction and the other are in the studying and design phases due to the high variability in annual rainfall conservation of water and irrigated agriculture has been considered as a way to mitigate the effects of drought according to the master plan study of abbay river basin bceom 1999 the total potential for hydropower generation in the basin is about 13 000 mw this is many times as much as the existing installed capacity the abbay basin master plan in ethiopia and other regional projects for instance the joint multipurpose projects jmp has identified three hydropower dams upstream of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd an evaluation of the impacts and benefits of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd during the impounding phase on downstream structures especially on high aswan dam had was conducted by considering different flow scenarios mulat and moges 2014 the study concluded that under normal and wet flow scenarios of the 6 years filling period gerd has no significant impact on downstream water uses the agricultural water requirement from had which is a concern in egypt could not be affected under these scenarios the reduction in the storage volume of had never reached its minimum operation level while the regional energy increases by about 63 due to early start of energy production at gerd if the worst scenario of 6 years consecutive drought such as in 1980s 18 of the longer term mean would occur or if the flow is reduced by 10 or more from the long term mean annual flow then the planned 6 years filling of gerd is insufficient to fill the reservoir without affecting downstream water uses the objective of this study was therefore to provide quantitative analysis of water resources management for the eastern nile region by considering the current irrigation water use and proposed reservoirs in the abbay blue nile river basin the simulation starts after the end of the gerd filling stages this analysis was then used for assessing the impacts and benefits of the upper cascades on downstream structures and the basin as a whole during its filling and full operation in addition the study tested the utility of hydropower development on the abbay blue nile river by evaluating different development or dam scenarios 2 the eastern nile there are two major basins within the nile basin these are the eastern nile which is includes abbay blue nile tekeze atbara baro akobo sobat and the nile equatorial lake including mainly lake victoria basin and equatorial lakes the blue nile is the most important tributary of the nile it contributes about 60 of the total annual nile flow sutcliffe and park 1999 more than 70 of the flow of the blue nile is generated by the four months june september wet season rainfall in ethiopia annual average rainfall over the blue nile basin is 400 109 m3 yr where 62 5 falls on the ethiopian plateau mageed 1994 as the blue nile drops into the lowlands and into southern sudan rainfall decreases and evaporation increases resulting in a significant net loss temperatures also increase in variability and reach substantially higher levels than at lake tana the sennar region located in the southeastern part of sudan experiences evaporation rates of 2500 mm yr and receives 500 mm yr of rainfall with mean daily temperature of 30 c sutcliffe and park 1999 the blue nile basin bnb is characterized by highly rugged topography and considerable variation in altitude total area of the basin is 311 437 km2 of which approximately 63 is in ethiopia and 37 is in sudan the elevation of the basin varies greatly from over 4000 m in the headwaters of some tributaries to 700 m at the foot of the plateau the highest point in lake tana is about 1800 m and the river enters sudan at an elevation of 490 m at the border of the two countries i e with a gradient of approximately 1 5 m km this gives the blue nile its unique feature of huge potential energy opportunity to develop hydropower 3 existing and proposed water resources developments the physical characteristics for the high aswan dam and lake nasser lake nubia were extracted from the power toolkit provided by entro the information contains descriptions of the turbine characteristics including explicit relationships between operating head turbine releases and power generation several water resources development projects in the eastern nile basin are categorised as under operation existing under construction and proposed to be developed most of the operational reservoirs are in sudan and egypt the under construction grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd and the other three cascades under design and study phases are located in ethiopia fig 1 and table 1 3 1 existing developments 3 1 1 tana beles project lake tana is a natural reservoir that controls the tana sub basin flows the lake is fed by the gilgel abbay megech ribb and gumara rivers and its surface area ranges from 3000 to 3500 km2 depending on season and the amount of rainfall the lake level has been regulated since the construction of the control chara chara weir where the lake discharges into the blue nile this controls the flow to the blue nile falls tis abbay and hydro power station which now the hydropower production is left in favor of the tana beles plant the tana beles hydropower project was completed in may 2010 and the project diverts water directly from lake tana and is represented as such in the models the relationship between the diverted flow and intake elevation for the diversion is defined in the beles multipurpose level 1 design report from the ethiopian electric power corporation eepco 2006 water diverted through the tana beles project is returned entirely to the headwaters of the beles which flows into the blue nile upstream of the border between sudan and ethiopia 3 1 2 roseires dam roseires dam was completed in 1966 with an initial capacity of 3 024 109 m3 at level 480 m level the main objective to supply irrigation demands as first priority and hydropower generation is the second priority during its lifetime the reservoir suffered from serious sedimentation which reduced its storage capacity to less than 2 0 109 m3 the deep sluices with sill levels of 435 5m a s l are used to pass the main volume of the flood and to flush the sediment due to the large seasonal fluctuation relatively small storage volume and high amount of sediment accumulating in roseires the operational criteria is specified to draw down the reservoir starting in mid january and maintain a minimum elevation until the peak flow has passed in september therefore meeting target elevation criteria is the primary guiding principle of the operation of roseires dam as it was indicated in the entro power tool kit 3 1 3 sennar dam the sennar dam was built in 1925 on the blue nile near the town of sennar sudan the dam is 3025 m long with a maximum height of 40 m it provides water for irrigation in the al jazirah region similar to rosaries dam a primary operational objective of this reservoir is to achieve drawdown and refill elevations on specified dates in addition the gezira managil diversion takes water directly from the reservoir for agriculture purposes the minimum diversion elevation of the gezira managil diversion is 417 0m a s l and therefore demands can be met when the pool elevation is greater than this level all water in the reservoir above this elevation is considered available for diversion entro power tool kit 3 1 4 jebel aluia the jebel aulia dam built 40 km upstream of khartoum in 1937 on white nile river to store water for later use in egypt the rapid silt up of this reservoir and the construction high aswan dam in egypt in 1965 stopped its function shahin 1985 2002 3 1 5 khashm el girba dam khashm el girba dam just downstream of the confluence of the rivers and the tekeze dam on the tekeze river the primary consumptive use is a direct diversion from the khashm el girba dam entro power tool kit 3 1 6 tekeze dam tekeze dam is a double curvature arch dam in the northern ethiopia on the tekeze river a nile tributary that flows through the deepest canyons into the main nile downstream of khartoum at the time of completion the 188 m high dam is said to be africa s largest arch dam the operation of this reservoir is to primarily meet a target power generation of 112 mw with a maximum power capacity of 300 mw a maximum pool elevation of 1140 ma s l and a minimum operation level of 1096 ma s l was used as the range over which power could be generated 3 1 7 merowe dam the merowe dam is recently constructed which is operated to meet the primary objective of hydropower generation the target power generation is 625 mw with a maximum power capacity of 1250 mw to accomplish this operation a rule was used that specifies a turbine release to meet the power generation objective followed by a flood control rule that spills any water in excess of a specified elevation a maximum pool elevation of 300 ma s l and a minimum operation level of 284 90 ma s l was used as the range over which power could be generated entro power tool kit 3 1 8 high aswan dam had aswan high dam reservoir extends for 500 km along the nile river and covers an area of 6000 km2 of which northern two thirds known as lake nasser is in egypt and one third called lake nubia in sudan the dam completed in 1968 at a distance of 7 km south of aswan city is 2325 m long 111 m high over the original river bed and 40 m and 980 m wide respectively at its crest and bottom nile flow is allowed to pass only through the open cut channel at the eastern side of the dam where six tunnel inlets provided with steel gates are constructed for discharge control and water supply to power plants an escape is also provided at the western side of the dam to permit excess water discharge entro power tool kit the total capacity of the reservoir 162 109 m3 consists of the dead storage of 31 6 109 m3 147 ma s l of lake water level the active storage of 90 7 km3 147 174 m a s l and the emergency storage for flood protection of 41 109 m3 175 182 m as l the reservoir is surrounded by rocky desert terrain to the west is the great sahara desert and the eastern desert on the east side extends to the red sea the aswan high dam contributed greatly to the economic development of egypt by supplying irrigation water and about 2000 mw hydroelectricity and protecting the lower reaches of the nile from flood disasters 3 2 proposed developments 3 2 1 karadobi hydropower project the karadobi hydropower project is located on the abbay river blue nile the proposed dam site is located 1 7 km downstream of its confluence with guder river at about 135 km air distance north west of addis ababa the project was studied at reconnaissance level in the abbay river master plan project bceom 1998 the present pre feasibility study of the karadobi multi purpose project indicate a rolled concrete gravity dam of maximum structural height of 260 m and length of about 684 m at the crest with a corresponding installed capacity of 1600 mw the reservoir area full level has an area of 445 km2 with a capacity of 40200 mcm the project is an element in the nile basin initiative regarding development of power trade among the countries in the nile basin norplan

construction within ethiopia the eventual site for the grand ethiopian renaissance dam was identified by the united states bureau of reclamation during a blue nile survey conducted between 1956 and 1964 united states bureau of reclamation usbr 1964 the ethiopian government made the project public on march 31 2011 the first two generators are expected to become operational after 44 months of construction it is slated for completion in july 2017 the dam will be a roller compacted concrete rcc gravity type comprising of two power stations three spillways and a saddle dam the dam will be 150 m in height and 1800 m in length coyne et bellier and tractebel engineering 2011 4 data in the eastern nile 4 1 stream flow data the source of hydrological data for the gauged data is from ministry of water of water irrigation and electricity mowie there are about 164 hydrometric stations in the blue nile river basin in ethiopia according to world meteorological organization wmo recommendations the number of stations are more than satisfactory i e one station should cover 1800 km2 bceom 1999 but most of the stations are not working properly missed data and stopped functioning as indicated in mulat and moges 2014 the monthly input stream flow series is reconstructed from 50 sub basin flows of upper blue nile abbay river other stream flows such as that of tekeze setet atbara tsa and the white nile at melakal was collected from eastern nile technical regional office entro spreadsheet the later data sets are essential to construct the complete eastern nile model up to had in egypt fig 2 4 2 reservoirs data for the standard reservoir the time series information required includes bottom crest spillway top of dead storage level and minimum operation pool elevations minimum and maximum valve releases precipitation seepage loss and evaporation and flood control and operational rules levels for any water users attached to the reservoir simulation starts from their bottom level for upper cascades with sequences of 5 years interval that is intended to offset the impacts of filling the reservoirs on operational reservoirs including gerd and had 4 3 water users data the most common water use in eastern nile river basin is irrigation water demand the water system retained for the purpose of this study will assume water requirements for irrigation purposes in sudan and water requirements associated to high aswan dam had had outflows aim to satisfy egyptian irrigation water demand as priority to energy generation 55 5 109 m3 year are allocated to egyptian irrigation supply downstream of had this water is also used to generate power within the had installed capacity 18 5 109 m3 year is allocated to sudan for irrigation supply at four different points upstream of had in the water system model as long as had water level is equal or greater than the minimum operating level 147 m water volumes for had irrigation are supplied at a monthly time step according to water demand presented in table 2 the irrigation water demand in bcm will be changed to m3 s for model input with 10 return flow 4 4 hydropower data all input data which enables for running the simulation are from ethiopian electric power corporation eepco grand ethiopian renaissance dam project study and entro for all hydropower plant the engine efficiency is considered to be 95 table 1 shows proposed and implemented hydropower plants in the eastern nile installed and target power in megawatt mw and tail water in meter above sea level 4 5 evaporation losses losses gains were placed at all reservoir locations within the basin to account for reservoirs gains due to precipitation and losses due to evaporation these net losses represent the difference between gross precipitation on the reservoir and natural losses due to evaporation the input data for net losses from reservoirs are shown in table 3 5 river basin modelling and setup the natural river system of the eastern nile river basin was schematized and represented with a node branch structure a number of nodes and corresponding reaches were established based on the river network configuration fig 2 branches represent the main river and its main tributaries and nodes represent major river confluences reservoirs and control points for off take off take points were selected on the main river and or tributaries to release water to cover downstream irrigation and hydropower water demands in the simulation only two major water demand sectors were considered irrigation and hydropower there are eighteen irrigation sites within the basin considered here table 2 the major irrigation system in the basin is gravity flow normally from reservoirs the schemes were then allocated to the nearby nodes for their water withdrawals and return flows from established schemes were directed to the immediate downstream nodes 6 development scenarios during this study an investigation has been conducted to assess the future probable changes of hydrological process which may have impacts on the spatial and temporal distribution of water availability in the basin there are three proposed dams karadobi bekoabo high low and mendya in the abbay basin there are two options for bekoabo bekoabo high and bekoabo low it is not possible to combine bekoabo high and karadobi because of the minimum available elevation difference between them the construction and fillings of each cascades is based on five year intervals from the top to downstream i e karadobi bekoabo and mendya will be constructed and fill in order to get the best combination of the reservoirs operating simultaneously the following scenarios have been considered and summarized in table 4 baseline scenario scenario 1 the reference scenario or current condition gerd only scenario 2 the combination of gerd and currently operating reservoirs karadobi and gerd scenario 3 the second scenario with karadobi karadobi gerd and mendya scenario 4 this one is the combination of karadobi gerd and mendya with the currently scenario karadobi gerd and bekoabo low scenario 5 this is scenario 4 but bekoabo low instead of mendya karadobi gerd mendya and bekoabo low scenario 6 here four reservoirs are considered with current condition bekoabo high and gerd scenario 7 this similar with scenario 3 but bekoabo high instead of karadobi bekoabo high gerd and mendya scenario 8 mendya with scenario 7 7 results and discussion 7 1 inflow to reservoirs the flow regime of the downstream dam is governed by the operations of the upstream hydroelectric power schemes and runoff from the catchments the incremental flow between the two dams reservoirs in the upstream have effects on the downstream reservoirs inflow during filling period of new constructed reservoir the amount of water released will be reduced and more regulated for instance there is slight inflow reduction to gerd during the impounding of upper cascades in the abbay blue nile river during full operation phase the reservoirs in the downstream will gain maximum flow in the dry months and the flood will decrease in wet months as a result of regulating effects of upstream cascades fig 3 demonstrates mean monthly inflow to rosaries dam for different dam scenarios releases from karadobi bekoabo and mendya dam constitute the major inflow into gerd dam this means that the more the release from upper reservoir the faster the downstream reservoir fill up and excess will be discharged the operation of gerd and other upstream dams dictate operation pattern in downstream dam excess releases at gerd will force the reservoir manager at rosaries dam to release so as to accommodate releases from gerd and thereby causing flooding at the downstream area because of its storage capacity gerd has significant effect on the inflow of the sudanese reservoirs rosaries and sennar dam receive more regulated flow due to gerd implementation the monthly reservoirs inflow coefficient of variance is maximum in baseline scenario as compared to the other scenarios the mean monthly inflow to downstream reservoirs will also be improved for instance the mean monthly coefficient of variance for rosaries is 1 2 and 0 2 for baseline and other scenarios respectively for sennar it is 1 3 for baseline scenario and 0 16 for the other scenarios the same is true for had inflow the coefficient of variance of inflow to had decreases from 1 for baseline scenario to 0 5 for other scenarios there are changes in other flow statistics the mean maximum and minimum monthly flow to downstream reservoirs will be changed due to the implementation of upper cascades for instance the maximum inflow to had in dry month may is 3 4 109 m3 for base line scenario but for the scenarios 1 8 it is 4 6 109 m3 that is 35 incremental but for the wet month august it is 32 6 109 m3 and 19 109 m3 for baseline and for scenario 1 8 respectively that is 42 reduction the inflow to had in the dry months march april may and june of selected dry year periods from 1982 to 1988 will increase by 133 from 1272 106 m3 to 2967 106 m3 due to the implementation of upper cascades this shows water availability at had could be safe even drought occurs for the selected wettest years from 1996 to 2001 and wet months july august september and october flow to khartoum will decrease by 100 from 10113 106 m3 to 5084 106 m3 that is if flow which cause flood occurs in the highlands of ethiopia it will be controlled by the upstream reservoirs and will be released in regulated manner the impact of the upstream cascades on the mean annual flow to reservoirs in the downstream is insignificant for instance the difference between maximum 65294 106 m3 with current scenario and the minimum 62438 106 m3 for the scenario 4 mean annual inflow to had is 4 4 for merowe the difference between maximum and minimum mean annual inflow is 3 3 7 2 reservoir water level filling period for karadobi is assumed to be 5 years and after that it start operating with full capacity bekoabo low will start filling when karadobi reaches its full level and then mendya filling will start the construction and filling of mendya lags by 5 years of karadobi or bekoabo high filling but for the three reservoirs combination karadobi bekoabo low mendya the filling will be after 10 years of karadobi filling there is no reservoir upstream of karadobi which affects its operation there are slight impacts of upstream cascades filling on the gerd pool level there could be up to 7 m monthly water level reduction of gerd during filling periods of the upper cascades after filling of all upstream reservoirs the maximum gerd mean monthly reservoir water level difference which is between scenario 2 and scenario 4 is 3 m fig 4 show sudanese reservoir rosaries water levels for different scenarios as shown in the figures all sudanese reservoirs water level will increase due to upper cascades implementation their pool level never be below baseline scenario s level in both filling and operation phases the maximum pool level for all sudanese reservoirs is scenario 2 though it is not below baseline scenario level there could be up to 11 m water level reduction of rosaries during the filling of karadobi media and bekoabo scenario 4 as compared to scenario 2 sennar water level will not be affected by reservoirs in abbay blue nile river basin in both filling and operation phases because of its storage capacity there is water level reduction in the dry months for the baseline scenario but this could be mitigated by implementing reservoirs in the upstream there is slight impact of upper cascades filling on merowe reservoir as compared to scenario1 and scenario2 there could be up to 5 m water level reduction of merowe reservoir due to upper cascades filling as compared to scenario 2 but it will never reach below water level of baseline scenario at the end of impounding of all reservoirs had reservoir water level decreases up to 14 m the maximum reservoir water level reduction will be if all proposed reservoirs in abbay river are implemented had reservoir water level will have less fluctuation when there are more reservoirs in upstream reservoir water level range is 36 m in the simulation period of baseline scenario but for the other scenarios it is around 31meters 7 3 energy production this section discusses the production of energy in the eastern nile region by considering scenarios shown in table 1 regional and each eastern nile country s hydropower production are discussed in the following sub sections 7 4 energy production in abbay blue nile river ethiopia the energy production impact of upstream cascade development in the abbay blue nile river basin is similar with their impacts on the reservoir water level the simulation results of energy production for the different scenarios are provided in tables 5 and 6 as shown in fig 4 and in table 5 the energy generation at gerd will be slightly affected due to the implementation of upper cascades because of their maximum capacity karadobi and bekoabo high have significant impacts on the energy production of gerd during their filling phase during karadobi filling period the energy production of gerd will reach minimum level 9163 gwh yr which is 68 of scenario 2 fig 5 bekoabo high filling will reduce the gerd energy to 10883 gwh yr which is 2546 gwh yr less than that of scenario 2 there is slight fluctuation of energy production when only gerd is in operation scenario 2 for instance the coefficient of variance of the energy within the simulation period for gerd is 0 4 for scenario 2 while it is 0 35 for the other scenarios at full development level maximum gerd energy 16256 gwh yr could be generated when there is no cascade upstream of gerd when there are more reservoirs in operation above gerd there could be slight energy reduction of gerd table 5 the different between the maximum and the minimum is 463 gwh that is 3 reduction from scenario 2 the energy production at karadobi will not be changed because there are no reservoirs above it the mean annual energy at karadobi is 8864 gwh yr during its full operation phase there are three scenarios for mendya that is mendya with bekoabo high mendya with karadobi and mendya with karadobi and bekoabo low fig 6 shows energy production of mendya during filling and operation phases for the combination of mendya with karadobi karadobi bekoabo low and bekoabo high the impounding period is assumed to 5 years and maximum energy production will be after the filling of the reservoir to its full reservoir level 808 m a s l fig 7 shows energy production of bekoabo low and bekoabo high during filling and full operation phases respectively there are two options for bekoabo that is bekoabo high and bekoabo low with karadobi as the name indicates there is difference between bekoabo high and bekoabo low in storage capacity and normal water level therefore there is big mean annual energy production difference between bekoabo high and bekoabo table 5 the construction and filling of bekoabo low is after the implementation of karadobi fig 8 demonstrates the cumulative total energy production in abbay blue nile river ethiopia after all reservoirs are completed as shown in figures and tables 5 and 6 the overall energy production in ethiopia will increase significantly due to the construction of the upper cascades the maximum mean annual energy production 38200 gw yr is scenario 6 which combines four reservoirs gerd karadobi bekoabo low and mendya in abbay blue nile river basin the next maximum mean annual energy production 36525 gwyr is scenario 8 which combines gerd bekoabo high and mendya 7 5 energy production in sudan energy production in sudan is from rosaries sennar and merowe dams sudan would also benefit from the upstream infrastructures reduced spillage makes more water available for hydropower generation fig 9 present the monthly average energy generated by the major hydropower plants rosaries for all development scenarios there is slight reduction of energy at roseires during the filling periods of cascades in abbay blue nile river as compared to scenario 2 but energy generation of rosaries is always more than that of scenario 1 even though there is a slight effect of upstream cascades filling on merowe energy production as compared to the scenario 2 there is significant incremental of energy as compared to scenario 1 for instance there is around 900 gwh more energy production during bekoabo high filling as compared to scenario 1 generally there are positive impacts of upper cascade development for energy production in sudan due to their less storage capacity the energy production in the dry months is less but the upper cascade development can mitigate this problem fig 10 shows the cumulative energy production of reservoirs located in sudan during filling and full operation phases due to the upper cascades there will be flow regulation and reservoirs in sudan will get uniform flows and the energy production will increase due to the upper cascades the minimum energy production in sudanese reservoirs is in the current situation when there are no cascades in operation in the upper blue nile but if there is a reservoir in upper blue nile cumulative energy production in sudan will increase by at least 37 table 6 7 6 energy generation at had energy production at had will decrease due to the upper cascades the production of hydroelectricity from had in egypt would be reduced on average by 8 43 as compared to baseline scenario fig 11 depicts the energy production of had during filling and operation phases of upper cascades karadobi or bekoabo high filling will reduce the had mean annual energy to 5039 gwh yr which is 33 less than the baseline scenario the overall impacts of the upper cascades filling are insignificant table 6 maximum energy reduction at had will be 14 of the baseline scenario during full operation phases the maximum energy 7462 gwh yr is the baseline situation table 6 maximum energy reduction as compared to the baseline scenario is 9 table 6 during the full operation phases 7 7 energy production in eastern nile at the basin scale the annual production of hydroelectricity is boosted by at least 34644 gwh yr amongst which 3130 gwh yr is from sudanese reservoir due to the regulation capacity of ethiopian reservoirs as shown in fig 12 tables 5 and 6 the energy production in the whole eastern nile system will increase significantly when all reservoirs are at their full operation level during their filling phase there is slight reduction of energy generation as compared to scenario 2 fig 11 the column diff in tables 5 and 6 indicates the difference in energy production of eastern nile between the current situation without gerd and other scenarios during the full operation phase eastern nile energy will increase at least by 120 and it will reach up to 258 incremental if each reservoir is considered as shown in table 5 energy productions in sudan will increase due to the upper cascades but in had energy production will slightly decrease because of head reduction the maximum energy in the eastern nile could be 56396 gwh yr for scenario 6 which combines gerd mendya bekoabo low and karadobi with the baseline scenario 7 8 water loss from reservoirs water loss is due to evaporation from the water surfaces of the reservoirs as the water level increases there will be more free water surface area and the evaporation loss will be increased the column diff in table 7 indicates the difference in water loss from the reservoirs of eastern nile between the current situation scenario 1 and other scenarios evaporation loss mm day in the upstream part of the basin is less as compared to downstream meanwhile as a dam is constructed upstream there will be additional free water surface area and more evaporation loss the loss in ethiopia will increase from nil up to 2024 106 m3 because of the reservoirs there is more regulated and constant flow of water to the sudanese reservoirs and the reservoir level is maintained at higher level regularly in an increase of water surface area due to that the loss in sudanese reservoirs increases by at least 35 during full development stages of all upper reservoirs water loss at had slight decrease as the water level also slightly decreases with addition of reservoirs in the upper basin the maximum had loss is 11673 106 m3 is in baseline scenario and the minimum loss is 10190 106 m3 is in scenario 2 7 9 irrigation water demand deficit irrigated agriculture in sudan will benefit from upstream storage in ethiopia since the sudanese annual withdrawals are lower in all scenarios those allocation decisions illustrate that once water has passed through the ethiopian hydropower plants irrigated agriculture starts competing with hydropower generation and irrigation withdrawals become more economically sound table 8 illustrates the benefits and impacts of storage in ethiopia on the irrigated agriculture sector the regulation capacity of the reservoirs located in ethiopia would increase irrigation water availability in sudan no significant impacts are observed for egypt the filling impacts on water demand is insignificant because there are only two events of irrigation water demand deficit at had due to the filling of the reservoirs the irrigation water demand deficit has been considered in the downstream projects especially in had in all scenarios during full operation phase the difference between scenarios is the extent of demand deficit within the simulation period the performance analysis is made by using equation shown below as shown in table 8 the water demand deficit is not significant that is the performance is nearly 100 in irrigation projects in sudan and more than 92 for had irrigation water demand e v e n t b a s e d r e l i a b i l i t y t o t a l n u m b e r o f n o n f a i l u r e m o n t h s t o t a l n u m b e r o f m o n t h s 8 conclusion and recommendations the aim of this study is to understand the future water development perspective in the eastern nile region by considering the current irrigation water use and proposed reservoirs in the upper blue nile abbay river basin in ethiopia using a river basin simulation approach simulations was carried out on a monthly time step and using historical ensemble time series data as representative for possible near future scenarios during the implementation of all planned reservoirs in the upper blue nile the scenarios were evaluated on economic benefits for the whole eastern nile basin wide and at the project site the economic benefits considered are energy production and irrigation water demand satisfaction from all the scenarios ethiopia could have maximum energy 38200 gwh yr could be achieved when karadobi bekoabo low mendia and gerd are in operation simultaneously the next maximum energy 36525 gwh yr could be when bekoabo high mendia and gerd are combined the maximum eastern nile energy 56396 and 54742 gwh yr could be achieved in these scenarios energy in the eastern nile will increase at least by 126 for gerd only case and could increase by 258 for karadobi bekoabo low mendia and gerd combination the energy production in sudan will increase by 39 due to the construction of a single reservoir in the abbay river there could be small energy reduction up to 9 at had due to reduced reservoir water level there are also slight water loss changes in the whole eastern nile due to the implementation of reservoirs the minimum loss is in the current situation development of abbay river will increase the free water surface area and the evaporation in the basin the construction of new reservoirs in the blue nile results in two competing effects with respect to evaporation the first effect is increased evaporation resulting from the proposed reservoirs while the other is reduced evaporation from had as a result of decreased inflows to the reservoir and reduction of the free water area the maximum incremental water loss in the eastern nile could be 10 as compared to the baseline scenario the amount of water flowing to the reservoirs will be more regulated and more constant due to the upstream cascades reservoirs in sudan are small in storage capacity as compared to the other reservoirs in ethiopia and egypt due to that they cannot store water up to their full level in the dry seasons and there are fluctuations in energy production and reservoir water level but the upper cascades in abbay river would enable them to get regulated and more water flow in the dry months and to maintain their water level and energy production constant and at higher level there will be reduction of the risk due to hydrological variability with sequences of dry and wet years indeed at the present time excessive water may be spilled during wet period at downstream reservoirs because existing reservoirs are already filled and as a result water demand failure can occur during a dry period with gerd the total storage capacity along the nile river will significantly increase in the long term basin water management will be easier to optimize with higher storage capacity and upstream regulation capacities the water demand deficit is insignificant in all scenarios that is the performance is more than 92 in all cases in gizira irrigation projects there are no months with water demand deficit due to the upper cascades while there are 2 months in the current scenario as recommendation cascades in abbay river basin are not studied at their final stage and their construction period is not specified so further evaluations may be necessary after their design and construction time is specified further detailed study could also be necessary by considering all proposed and implemented small and medium irrigation and water abstraction projects in abbay river basin research work for the way to improve water use efficiency is crucial managing water resources in a way that brings benefits to all and establishing a regional operation plan that integrates a hydrological forecast model and dynamic operation rules are necessary it is better to recommend managing water resources as a single system by establishing more effective institutional arrangements than those currently existing it is to be hoped that such arrangements will be devised through the protracted negotiations currently under way conflict of interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at https doi org 10 1016 j

8516,study region eastern nile river basin ethiopia sudan and egypt study focus this study aims to understand the future water development perspective in the eastern nile region by considering the current water use situation and proposed reservoirs in the upper blue nile abbay river basin in ethiopia using a simulation approach the study was carried out by using a monthly time step and historical ensemble time series data as representative of possible near future scenarios series of existing and proposed cascaded water development projects in the upper blue nile were considered in the study new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated an overall energy gain in the eastern nile region increases by 258 the upstream country ethiopia can generate as much as 38200 gwh year of energy while the energy production in sudan increases by 39 the cascaded developments integrated with existing water resources systems have a performance efficiency of above 92 this study was an indicative analysis of the potential benefit of upstream nile development without significantly affecting existing development in the nile basin further scientific analysis in this direction would help the nile countries to reach a water use agreement keywords eastern nile water resource modeling blue nile cascades renaissance dam 1 introduction there is huge hydro power development potential in the eastern nile basin waterbury 2002 swain 2002 the greatest development potential about 58 of the total in the nile basin is located in ethiopia this is because of the great differences in altitude ethiopia 2000 there are a number of water resource development projects in ethiopia specifically in the abbay river basin the projects are at different stage of development some are in operational stage some are under construction and the other are in the studying and design phases due to the high variability in annual rainfall conservation of water and irrigated agriculture has been considered as a way to mitigate the effects of drought according to the master plan study of abbay river basin bceom 1999 the total potential for hydropower generation in the basin is about 13 000 mw this is many times as much as the existing installed capacity the abbay basin master plan in ethiopia and other regional projects for instance the joint multipurpose projects jmp has identified three hydropower dams upstream of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd an evaluation of the impacts and benefits of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd during the impounding phase on downstream structures especially on high aswan dam had was conducted by considering different flow scenarios mulat and moges 2014 the study concluded that under normal and wet flow scenarios of the 6 years filling period gerd has no significant impact on downstream water uses the agricultural water requirement from had which is a concern in egypt could not be affected under these scenarios the reduction in the storage volume of had never reached its minimum operation level while the regional energy increases by about 63 due to early start of energy production at gerd if the worst scenario of 6 years consecutive drought such as in 1980s 18 of the longer term mean would occur or if the flow is reduced by 10 or more from the long term mean annual flow then the planned 6 years filling of gerd is insufficient to fill the reservoir without affecting downstream water uses the objective of this study was therefore to provide quantitative analysis of water resources management for the eastern nile region by considering the current irrigation water use and proposed reservoirs in the abbay blue nile river basin the simulation starts after the end of the gerd filling stages this analysis was then used for assessing the impacts and benefits of the upper cascades on downstream structures and the basin as a whole during its filling and full operation in addition the study tested the utility of hydropower development on the abbay blue nile river by evaluating different development or dam scenarios 2 the eastern nile there are two major basins within the nile basin these are the eastern nile which is includes abbay blue nile tekeze atbara baro akobo sobat and the nile equatorial lake including mainly lake victoria basin and equatorial lakes the blue nile is the most important tributary of the nile it contributes about 60 of the total annual nile flow sutcliffe and park 1999 more than 70 of the flow of the blue nile is generated by the four months june september wet season rainfall in ethiopia annual average rainfall over the blue nile basin is 400 109 m3 yr where 62 5 falls on the ethiopian plateau mageed 1994 as the blue nile drops into the lowlands and into southern sudan rainfall decreases and evaporation increases resulting in a significant net loss temperatures also increase in variability and reach substantially higher levels than at lake tana the sennar region located in the southeastern part of sudan experiences evaporation rates of 2500 mm yr and receives 500 mm yr of rainfall with mean daily temperature of 30 c sutcliffe and park 1999 the blue nile basin bnb is characterized by highly rugged topography and considerable variation in altitude total area of the basin is 311 437 km2 of which approximately 63 is in ethiopia and 37 is in sudan the elevation of the basin varies greatly from over 4000 m in the headwaters of some tributaries to 700 m at the foot of the plateau the highest point in lake tana is about 1800 m and the river enters sudan at an elevation of 490 m at the border of the two countries i e with a gradient of approximately 1 5 m km this gives the blue nile its unique feature of huge potential energy opportunity to develop hydropower 3 existing and proposed water resources developments the physical characteristics for the high aswan dam and lake nasser lake nubia were extracted from the power toolkit provided by entro the information contains descriptions of the turbine characteristics including explicit relationships between operating head turbine releases and power generation several water resources development projects in the eastern nile basin are categorised as under operation existing under construction and proposed to be developed most of the operational reservoirs are in sudan and egypt the under construction grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd and the other three cascades under design and study phases are located in ethiopia fig 1 and table 1 3 1 existing developments 3 1 1 tana beles project lake tana is a natural reservoir that controls the tana sub basin flows the lake is fed by the gilgel abbay megech ribb and gumara rivers and its surface area ranges from 3000 to 3500 km2 depending on season and the amount of rainfall the lake level has been regulated since the construction of the control chara chara weir where the lake discharges into the blue nile this controls the flow to the blue nile falls tis abbay and hydro power station which now the hydropower production is left in favor of the tana beles plant the tana beles hydropower project was completed in may 2010 and the project diverts water directly from lake tana and is represented as such in the models the relationship between the diverted flow and intake elevation for the diversion is defined in the beles multipurpose level 1 design report from the ethiopian electric power corporation eepco 2006 water diverted through the tana beles project is returned entirely to the headwaters of the beles which flows into the blue nile upstream of the border between sudan and ethiopia 3 1 2 roseires dam roseires dam was completed in 1966 with an initial capacity of 3 024 109 m3 at level 480 m level the main objective to supply irrigation demands as first priority and hydropower generation is the second priority during its lifetime the reservoir suffered from serious sedimentation which reduced its storage capacity to less than 2 0 109 m3 the deep sluices with sill levels of 435 5m a s l are used to pass the main volume of the flood and to flush the sediment due to the large seasonal fluctuation relatively small storage volume and high amount of sediment accumulating in roseires the operational criteria is specified to draw down the reservoir starting in mid january and maintain a minimum elevation until the peak flow has passed in september therefore meeting target elevation criteria is the primary guiding principle of the operation of roseires dam as it was indicated in the entro power tool kit 3 1 3 sennar dam the sennar dam was built in 1925 on the blue nile near the town of sennar sudan the dam is 3025 m long with a maximum height of 40 m it provides water for irrigation in the al jazirah region similar to rosaries dam a primary operational objective of this reservoir is to achieve drawdown and refill elevations on specified dates in addition the gezira managil diversion takes water directly from the reservoir for agriculture purposes the minimum diversion elevation of the gezira managil diversion is 417 0m a s l and therefore demands can be met when the pool elevation is greater than this level all water in the reservoir above this elevation is considered available for diversion entro power tool kit 3 1 4 jebel aluia the jebel aulia dam built 40 km upstream of khartoum in 1937 on white nile river to store water for later use in egypt the rapid silt up of this reservoir and the construction high aswan dam in egypt in 1965 stopped its function shahin 1985 2002 3 1 5 khashm el girba dam khashm el girba dam just downstream of the confluence of the rivers and the tekeze dam on the tekeze river the primary consumptive use is a direct diversion from the khashm el girba dam entro power tool kit 3 1 6 tekeze dam tekeze dam is a double curvature arch dam in the northern ethiopia on the tekeze river a nile tributary that flows through the deepest canyons into the main nile downstream of khartoum at the time of completion the 188 m high dam is said to be africa s largest arch dam the operation of this reservoir is to primarily meet a target power generation of 112 mw with a maximum power capacity of 300 mw a maximum pool elevation of 1140 ma s l and a minimum operation level of 1096 ma s l was used as the range over which power could be generated 3 1 7 merowe dam the merowe dam is recently constructed which is operated to meet the primary objective of hydropower generation the target power generation is 625 mw with a maximum power capacity of 1250 mw to accomplish this operation a rule was used that specifies a turbine release to meet the power generation objective followed by a flood control rule that spills any water in excess of a specified elevation a maximum pool elevation of 300 ma s l and a minimum operation level of 284 90 ma s l was used as the range over which power could be generated entro power tool kit 3 1 8 high aswan dam had aswan high dam reservoir extends for 500 km along the nile river and covers an area of 6000 km2 of which northern two thirds known as lake nasser is in egypt and one third called lake nubia in sudan the dam completed in 1968 at a distance of 7 km south of aswan city is 2325 m long 111 m high over the original river bed and 40 m and 980 m wide respectively at its crest and bottom nile flow is allowed to pass only through the open cut channel at the eastern side of the dam where six tunnel inlets provided with steel gates are constructed for discharge control and water supply to power plants an escape is also provided at the western side of the dam to permit excess water discharge entro power tool kit the total capacity of the reservoir 162 109 m3 consists of the dead storage of 31 6 109 m3 147 ma s l of lake water level the active storage of 90 7 km3 147 174 m a s l and the emergency storage for flood protection of 41 109 m3 175 182 m as l the reservoir is surrounded by rocky desert terrain to the west is the great sahara desert and the eastern desert on the east side extends to the red sea the aswan high dam contributed greatly to the economic development of egypt by supplying irrigation water and about 2000 mw hydroelectricity and protecting the lower reaches of the nile from flood disasters 3 2 proposed developments 3 2 1 karadobi hydropower project the karadobi hydropower project is located on the abbay river blue nile the proposed dam site is located 1 7 km downstream of its confluence with guder river at about 135 km air distance north west of addis ababa the project was studied at reconnaissance level in the abbay river master plan project bceom 1998 the present pre feasibility study of the karadobi multi purpose project indicate a rolled concrete gravity dam of maximum structural height of 260 m and length of about 684 m at the crest with a corresponding installed capacity of 1600 mw the reservoir area full level has an area of 445 km2 with a capacity of 40200 mcm the project is an element in the nile basin initiative regarding development of power trade among the countries in the nile basin norplan

construction within ethiopia the eventual site for the grand ethiopian renaissance dam was identified by the united states bureau of reclamation during a blue nile survey conducted between 1956 and 1964 united states bureau of reclamation usbr 1964 the ethiopian government made the project public on march 31 2011 the first two generators are expected to become operational after 44 months of construction it is slated for completion in july 2017 the dam will be a roller compacted concrete rcc gravity type comprising of two power stations three spillways and a saddle dam the dam will be 150 m in height and 1800 m in length coyne et bellier and tractebel engineering 2011 4 data in the eastern nile 4 1 stream flow data the source of hydrological data for the gauged data is from ministry of water of water irrigation and electricity mowie there are about 164 hydrometric stations in the blue nile river basin in ethiopia according to world meteorological organization wmo recommendations the number of stations are more than satisfactory i e one station should cover 1800 km2 bceom 1999 but most of the stations are not working properly missed data and stopped functioning as indicated in mulat and moges 2014 the monthly input stream flow series is reconstructed from 50 sub basin flows of upper blue nile abbay river other stream flows such as that of tekeze setet atbara tsa and the white nile at melakal was collected from eastern nile technical regional office entro spreadsheet the later data sets are essential to construct the complete eastern nile model up to had in egypt fig 2 4 2 reservoirs data for the standard reservoir the time series information required includes bottom crest spillway top of dead storage level and minimum operation pool elevations minimum and maximum valve releases precipitation seepage loss and evaporation and flood control and operational rules levels for any water users attached to the reservoir simulation starts from their bottom level for upper cascades with sequences of 5 years interval that is intended to offset the impacts of filling the reservoirs on operational reservoirs including gerd and had 4 3 water users data the most common water use in eastern nile river basin is irrigation water demand the water system retained for the purpose of this study will assume water requirements for irrigation purposes in sudan and water requirements associated to high aswan dam had had outflows aim to satisfy egyptian irrigation water demand as priority to energy generation 55 5 109 m3 year are allocated to egyptian irrigation supply downstream of had this water is also used to generate power within the had installed capacity 18 5 109 m3 year is allocated to sudan for irrigation supply at four different points upstream of had in the water system model as long as had water level is equal or greater than the minimum operating level 147 m water volumes for had irrigation are supplied at a monthly time step according to water demand presented in table 2 the irrigation water demand in bcm will be changed to m3 s for model input with 10 return flow 4 4 hydropower data all input data which enables for running the simulation are from ethiopian electric power corporation eepco grand ethiopian renaissance dam project study and entro for all hydropower plant the engine efficiency is considered to be 95 table 1 shows proposed and implemented hydropower plants in the eastern nile installed and target power in megawatt mw and tail water in meter above sea level 4 5 evaporation losses losses gains were placed at all reservoir locations within the basin to account for reservoirs gains due to precipitation and losses due to evaporation these net losses represent the difference between gross precipitation on the reservoir and natural losses due to evaporation the input data for net losses from reservoirs are shown in table 3 5 river basin modelling and setup the natural river system of the eastern nile river basin was schematized and represented with a node branch structure a number of nodes and corresponding reaches were established based on the river network configuration fig 2 branches represent the main river and its main tributaries and nodes represent major river confluences reservoirs and control points for off take off take points were selected on the main river and or tributaries to release water to cover downstream irrigation and hydropower water demands in the simulation only two major water demand sectors were considered irrigation and hydropower there are eighteen irrigation sites within the basin considered here table 2 the major irrigation system in the basin is gravity flow normally from reservoirs the schemes were then allocated to the nearby nodes for their water withdrawals and return flows from established schemes were directed to the immediate downstream nodes 6 development scenarios during this study an investigation has been conducted to assess the future probable changes of hydrological process which may have impacts on the spatial and temporal distribution of water availability in the basin there are three proposed dams karadobi bekoabo high low and mendya in the abbay basin there are two options for bekoabo bekoabo high and bekoabo low it is not possible to combine bekoabo high and karadobi because of the minimum available elevation difference between them the construction and fillings of each cascades is based on five year intervals from the top to downstream i e karadobi bekoabo and mendya will be constructed and fill in order to get the best combination of the reservoirs operating simultaneously the following scenarios have been considered and summarized in table 4 baseline scenario scenario 1 the reference scenario or current condition gerd only scenario 2 the combination of gerd and currently operating reservoirs karadobi and gerd scenario 3 the second scenario with karadobi karadobi gerd and mendya scenario 4 this one is the combination of karadobi gerd and mendya with the currently scenario karadobi gerd and bekoabo low scenario 5 this is scenario 4 but bekoabo low instead of mendya karadobi gerd mendya and bekoabo low scenario 6 here four reservoirs are considered with current condition bekoabo high and gerd scenario 7 this similar with scenario 3 but bekoabo high instead of karadobi bekoabo high gerd and mendya scenario 8 mendya with scenario 7 7 results and discussion 7 1 inflow to reservoirs the flow regime of the downstream dam is governed by the operations of the upstream hydroelectric power schemes and runoff from the catchments the incremental flow between the two dams reservoirs in the upstream have effects on the downstream reservoirs inflow during filling period of new constructed reservoir the amount of water released will be reduced and more regulated for instance there is slight inflow reduction to gerd during the impounding of upper cascades in the abbay blue nile river during full operation phase the reservoirs in the downstream will gain maximum flow in the dry months and the flood will decrease in wet months as a result of regulating effects of upstream cascades fig 3 demonstrates mean monthly inflow to rosaries dam for different dam scenarios releases from karadobi bekoabo and mendya dam constitute the major inflow into gerd dam this means that the more the release from upper reservoir the faster the downstream reservoir fill up and excess will be discharged the operation of gerd and other upstream dams dictate operation pattern in downstream dam excess releases at gerd will force the reservoir manager at rosaries dam to release so as to accommodate releases from gerd and thereby causing flooding at the downstream area because of its storage capacity gerd has significant effect on the inflow of the sudanese reservoirs rosaries and sennar dam receive more regulated flow due to gerd implementation the monthly reservoirs inflow coefficient of variance is maximum in baseline scenario as compared to the other scenarios the mean monthly inflow to downstream reservoirs will also be improved for instance the mean monthly coefficient of variance for rosaries is 1 2 and 0 2 for baseline and other scenarios respectively for sennar it is 1 3 for baseline scenario and 0 16 for the other scenarios the same is true for had inflow the coefficient of variance of inflow to had decreases from 1 for baseline scenario to 0 5 for other scenarios there are changes in other flow statistics the mean maximum and minimum monthly flow to downstream reservoirs will be changed due to the implementation of upper cascades for instance the maximum inflow to had in dry month may is 3 4 109 m3 for base line scenario but for the scenarios 1 8 it is 4 6 109 m3 that is 35 incremental but for the wet month august it is 32 6 109 m3 and 19 109 m3 for baseline and for scenario 1 8 respectively that is 42 reduction the inflow to had in the dry months march april may and june of selected dry year periods from 1982 to 1988 will increase by 133 from 1272 106 m3 to 2967 106 m3 due to the implementation of upper cascades this shows water availability at had could be safe even drought occurs for the selected wettest years from 1996 to 2001 and wet months july august september and october flow to khartoum will decrease by 100 from 10113 106 m3 to 5084 106 m3 that is if flow which cause flood occurs in the highlands of ethiopia it will be controlled by the upstream reservoirs and will be released in regulated manner the impact of the upstream cascades on the mean annual flow to reservoirs in the downstream is insignificant for instance the difference between maximum 65294 106 m3 with current scenario and the minimum 62438 106 m3 for the scenario 4 mean annual inflow to had is 4 4 for merowe the difference between maximum and minimum mean annual inflow is 3 3 7 2 reservoir water level filling period for karadobi is assumed to be 5 years and after that it start operating with full capacity bekoabo low will start filling when karadobi reaches its full level and then mendya filling will start the construction and filling of mendya lags by 5 years of karadobi or bekoabo high filling but for the three reservoirs combination karadobi bekoabo low mendya the filling will be after 10 years of karadobi filling there is no reservoir upstream of karadobi which affects its operation there are slight impacts of upstream cascades filling on the gerd pool level there could be up to 7 m monthly water level reduction of gerd during filling periods of the upper cascades after filling of all upstream reservoirs the maximum gerd mean monthly reservoir water level difference which is between scenario 2 and scenario 4 is 3 m fig 4 show sudanese reservoir rosaries water levels for different scenarios as shown in the figures all sudanese reservoirs water level will increase due to upper cascades implementation their pool level never be below baseline scenario s level in both filling and operation phases the maximum pool level for all sudanese reservoirs is scenario 2 though it is not below baseline scenario level there could be up to 11 m water level reduction of rosaries during the filling of karadobi media and bekoabo scenario 4 as compared to scenario 2 sennar water level will not be affected by reservoirs in abbay blue nile river basin in both filling and operation phases because of its storage capacity there is water level reduction in the dry months for the baseline scenario but this could be mitigated by implementing reservoirs in the upstream there is slight impact of upper cascades filling on merowe reservoir as compared to scenario1 and scenario2 there could be up to 5 m water level reduction of merowe reservoir due to upper cascades filling as compared to scenario 2 but it will never reach below water level of baseline scenario at the end of impounding of all reservoirs had reservoir water level decreases up to 14 m the maximum reservoir water level reduction will be if all proposed reservoirs in abbay river are implemented had reservoir water level will have less fluctuation when there are more reservoirs in upstream reservoir water level range is 36 m in the simulation period of baseline scenario but for the other scenarios it is around 31meters 7 3 energy production this section discusses the production of energy in the eastern nile region by considering scenarios shown in table 1 regional and each eastern nile country s hydropower production are discussed in the following sub sections 7 4 energy production in abbay blue nile river ethiopia the energy production impact of upstream cascade development in the abbay blue nile river basin is similar with their impacts on the reservoir water level the simulation results of energy production for the different scenarios are provided in tables 5 and 6 as shown in fig 4 and in table 5 the energy generation at gerd will be slightly affected due to the implementation of upper cascades because of their maximum capacity karadobi and bekoabo high have significant impacts on the energy production of gerd during their filling phase during karadobi filling period the energy production of gerd will reach minimum level 9163 gwh yr which is 68 of scenario 2 fig 5 bekoabo high filling will reduce the gerd energy to 10883 gwh yr which is 2546 gwh yr less than that of scenario 2 there is slight fluctuation of energy production when only gerd is in operation scenario 2 for instance the coefficient of variance of the energy within the simulation period for gerd is 0 4 for scenario 2 while it is 0 35 for the other scenarios at full development level maximum gerd energy 16256 gwh yr could be generated when there is no cascade upstream of gerd when there are more reservoirs in operation above gerd there could be slight energy reduction of gerd table 5 the different between the maximum and the minimum is 463 gwh that is 3 reduction from scenario 2 the energy production at karadobi will not be changed because there are no reservoirs above it the mean annual energy at karadobi is 8864 gwh yr during its full operation phase there are three scenarios for mendya that is mendya with bekoabo high mendya with karadobi and mendya with karadobi and bekoabo low fig 6 shows energy production of mendya during filling and operation phases for the combination of mendya with karadobi karadobi bekoabo low and bekoabo high the impounding period is assumed to 5 years and maximum energy production will be after the filling of the reservoir to its full reservoir level 808 m a s l fig 7 shows energy production of bekoabo low and bekoabo high during filling and full operation phases respectively there are two options for bekoabo that is bekoabo high and bekoabo low with karadobi as the name indicates there is difference between bekoabo high and bekoabo low in storage capacity and normal water level therefore there is big mean annual energy production difference between bekoabo high and bekoabo table 5 the construction and filling of bekoabo low is after the implementation of karadobi fig 8 demonstrates the cumulative total energy production in abbay blue nile river ethiopia after all reservoirs are completed as shown in figures and tables 5 and 6 the overall energy production in ethiopia will increase significantly due to the construction of the upper cascades the maximum mean annual energy production 38200 gw yr is scenario 6 which combines four reservoirs gerd karadobi bekoabo low and mendya in abbay blue nile river basin the next maximum mean annual energy production 36525 gwyr is scenario 8 which combines gerd bekoabo high and mendya 7 5 energy production in sudan energy production in sudan is from rosaries sennar and merowe dams sudan would also benefit from the upstream infrastructures reduced spillage makes more water available for hydropower generation fig 9 present the monthly average energy generated by the major hydropower plants rosaries for all development scenarios there is slight reduction of energy at roseires during the filling periods of cascades in abbay blue nile river as compared to scenario 2 but energy generation of rosaries is always more than that of scenario 1 even though there is a slight effect of upstream cascades filling on merowe energy production as compared to the scenario 2 there is significant incremental of energy as compared to scenario 1 for instance there is around 900 gwh more energy production during bekoabo high filling as compared to scenario 1 generally there are positive impacts of upper cascade development for energy production in sudan due to their less storage capacity the energy production in the dry months is less but the upper cascade development can mitigate this problem fig 10 shows the cumulative energy production of reservoirs located in sudan during filling and full operation phases due to the upper cascades there will be flow regulation and reservoirs in sudan will get uniform flows and the energy production will increase due to the upper cascades the minimum energy production in sudanese reservoirs is in the current situation when there are no cascades in operation in the upper blue nile but if there is a reservoir in upper blue nile cumulative energy production in sudan will increase by at least 37 table 6 7 6 energy generation at had energy production at had will decrease due to the upper cascades the production of hydroelectricity from had in egypt would be reduced on average by 8 43 as compared to baseline scenario fig 11 depicts the energy production of had during filling and operation phases of upper cascades karadobi or bekoabo high filling will reduce the had mean annual energy to 5039 gwh yr which is 33 less than the baseline scenario the overall impacts of the upper cascades filling are insignificant table 6 maximum energy reduction at had will be 14 of the baseline scenario during full operation phases the maximum energy 7462 gwh yr is the baseline situation table 6 maximum energy reduction as compared to the baseline scenario is 9 table 6 during the full operation phases 7 7 energy production in eastern nile at the basin scale the annual production of hydroelectricity is boosted by at least 34644 gwh yr amongst which 3130 gwh yr is from sudanese reservoir due to the regulation capacity of ethiopian reservoirs as shown in fig 12 tables 5 and 6 the energy production in the whole eastern nile system will increase significantly when all reservoirs are at their full operation level during their filling phase there is slight reduction of energy generation as compared to scenario 2 fig 11 the column diff in tables 5 and 6 indicates the difference in energy production of eastern nile between the current situation without gerd and other scenarios during the full operation phase eastern nile energy will increase at least by 120 and it will reach up to 258 incremental if each reservoir is considered as shown in table 5 energy productions in sudan will increase due to the upper cascades but in had energy production will slightly decrease because of head reduction the maximum energy in the eastern nile could be 56396 gwh yr for scenario 6 which combines gerd mendya bekoabo low and karadobi with the baseline scenario 7 8 water loss from reservoirs water loss is due to evaporation from the water surfaces of the reservoirs as the water level increases there will be more free water surface area and the evaporation loss will be increased the column diff in table 7 indicates the difference in water loss from the reservoirs of eastern nile between the current situation scenario 1 and other scenarios evaporation loss mm day in the upstream part of the basin is less as compared to downstream meanwhile as a dam is constructed upstream there will be additional free water surface area and more evaporation loss the loss in ethiopia will increase from nil up to 2024 106 m3 because of the reservoirs there is more regulated and constant flow of water to the sudanese reservoirs and the reservoir level is maintained at higher level regularly in an increase of water surface area due to that the loss in sudanese reservoirs increases by at least 35 during full development stages of all upper reservoirs water loss at had slight decrease as the water level also slightly decreases with addition of reservoirs in the upper basin the maximum had loss is 11673 106 m3 is in baseline scenario and the minimum loss is 10190 106 m3 is in scenario 2 7 9 irrigation water demand deficit irrigated agriculture in sudan will benefit from upstream storage in ethiopia since the sudanese annual withdrawals are lower in all scenarios those allocation decisions illustrate that once water has passed through the ethiopian hydropower plants irrigated agriculture starts competing with hydropower generation and irrigation withdrawals become more economically sound table 8 illustrates the benefits and impacts of storage in ethiopia on the irrigated agriculture sector the regulation capacity of the reservoirs located in ethiopia would increase irrigation water availability in sudan no significant impacts are observed for egypt the filling impacts on water demand is insignificant because there are only two events of irrigation water demand deficit at had due to the filling of the reservoirs the irrigation water demand deficit has been considered in the downstream projects especially in had in all scenarios during full operation phase the difference between scenarios is the extent of demand deficit within the simulation period the performance analysis is made by using equation shown below as shown in table 8 the water demand deficit is not significant that is the performance is nearly 100 in irrigation projects in sudan and more than 92 for had irrigation water demand e v e n t b a s e d r e l i a b i l i t y t o t a l n u m b e r o f n o n f a i l u r e m o n t h s t o t a l n u m b e r o f m o n t h s 8 conclusion and recommendations the aim of this study is to understand the future water development perspective in the eastern nile region by considering the current irrigation water use and proposed reservoirs in the upper blue nile abbay river basin in ethiopia using a river basin simulation approach simulations was carried out on a monthly time step and using historical ensemble time series data as representative for possible near future scenarios during the implementation of all planned reservoirs in the upper blue nile the scenarios were evaluated on economic benefits for the whole eastern nile basin wide and at the project site the economic benefits considered are energy production and irrigation water demand satisfaction from all the scenarios ethiopia could have maximum energy 38200 gwh yr could be achieved when karadobi bekoabo low mendia and gerd are in operation simultaneously the next maximum energy 36525 gwh yr could be when bekoabo high mendia and gerd are combined the maximum eastern nile energy 56396 and 54742 gwh yr could be achieved in these scenarios energy in the eastern nile will increase at least by 126 for gerd only case and could increase by 258 for karadobi bekoabo low mendia and gerd combination the energy production in sudan will increase by 39 due to the construction of a single reservoir in the abbay river there could be small energy reduction up to 9 at had due to reduced reservoir water level there are also slight water loss changes in the whole eastern nile due to the implementation of reservoirs the minimum loss is in the current situation development of abbay river will increase the free water surface area and the evaporation in the basin the construction of new reservoirs in the blue nile results in two competing effects with respect to evaporation the first effect is increased evaporation resulting from the proposed reservoirs while the other is reduced evaporation from had as a result of decreased inflows to the reservoir and reduction of the free water area the maximum incremental water loss in the eastern nile could be 10 as compared to the baseline scenario the amount of water flowing to the reservoirs will be more regulated and more constant due to the upstream cascades reservoirs in sudan are small in storage capacity as compared to the other reservoirs in ethiopia and egypt due to that they cannot store water up to their full level in the dry seasons and there are fluctuations in energy production and reservoir water level but the upper cascades in abbay river would enable them to get regulated and more water flow in the dry months and to maintain their water level and energy production constant and at higher level there will be reduction of the risk due to hydrological variability with sequences of dry and wet years indeed at the present time excessive water may be spilled during wet period at downstream reservoirs because existing reservoirs are already filled and as a result water demand failure can occur during a dry period with gerd the total storage capacity along the nile river will significantly increase in the long term basin water management will be easier to optimize with higher storage capacity and upstream regulation capacities the water demand deficit is insignificant in all scenarios that is the performance is more than 92 in all cases in gizira irrigation projects there are no months with water demand deficit due to the upper cascades while there are 2 months in the current scenario as recommendation cascades in abbay river basin are not studied at their final stage and their construction period is not specified so further evaluations may be necessary after their design and construction time is specified further detailed study could also be necessary by considering all proposed and implemented small and medium irrigation and water abstraction projects in abbay river basin research work for the way to improve water use efficiency is crucial managing water resources in a way that brings benefits to all and establishing a regional operation plan that integrates a hydrological forecast model and dynamic operation rules are necessary it is better to recommend managing water resources as a single system by establishing more effective institutional arrangements than those currently existing it is to be hoped that such arrangements will be devised through the protracted negotiations currently under way conflict of interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at https doi org 10 1016 j

8517,study region north algeria study focus the semi arid to arid chéliff zahrez basin faced several droughts with severe impacts on agriculture due to the high temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall we explored the potential of the standardized precipitation index spi markov chain models the drought index and time series modelling to characterize meteorological drought time series of annual precipitation 1960 2010 from 65 meteorological stations across the basin were used the basin was subdivided into five subbasins to account for spatial variability new hydrological insights for the regions the analysis of the standardized precipitation index showed few droughts in the period 1960 1970 whereas in the 1990s a multi year drought occurred with spis as low as 2 extremely dry in many subbasins the markov chain analysis learnt that the probability of having two consecutive drought years appears to be higher in the southern subbasins the drought index derived from transition probabilities indicates that the southern and the southwestern parts of the chéliff zahrez basin are most drought prone time series modelling was applied to compute the spi for different return periods 6 17 years eleven models were tested and it appeared that the asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity aparch approach was best performing based on several information criteria for a return period of 17 years the spi is lower than 1 5 severely dry in many subbasins keywords meteorological drought spi markov chain time series modelling drought maps chéliff zahrez basin 1 introduction algeria is known for its multi year droughts long lasting below normal rainfall in a semi arid climate has devastating impacts on algerian agriculture particularly the western part of the country has experienced several major droughts during the 1940s and since the 1970s meddi and hubert 2003 meddi and meddi 2009 seltzer 1946 already presented a detailed analysis of rainfall across algeria he noted that variability in annual rainfall 1911 1938 in the high plains and the saharan atlas is less sensitive than in the northern regions of algeria demmak 1982 compared rainfall departure from the average deficit in the period 1974 1992 with the deficit from the period 1913 1963 in northern algeria and found drier conditions in the last period although some years in the first period also were dry e g 1913 and 1940 they observed an increased deficit from east to west farmer and wigley 1985 and kadi 1995 reported on widespread drought during some years i e 1937 1961 and 1970 matari and douguedroit 1995 who divided west algeria in several regions noted that the 1940s drought is mainly due to a lower spring rain and those of 1980s to a decreased winter rain the rainfall deficits in northern algeria are triggered by climate drivers such as enso el mahi et al 2012 the reported rainfall deficits caused serious socio economic problems and it anticipated future deficits will impose increasing pressure on the scarce algerian water resources among others for supply of drinking water and irrigation khaldi 2005 adequate water resources management that is based on sound data should cope with these pressures which particularly are felt during drought episodes these data include both the state of an ongoing drought monitoring characterization and drought states that can be expected on the basis of past events prediction drought is a relative phenomenon meaning that it is a deviation from normal hydrometeorological conditions it deviates from aridity which is a permanent feature of a dry climate in this study low average rainfall and is not water scarcity long term unsustainable use of water resources e g wilhite and glantz 1985 wilhite 2000 tallaksen and van lanen 2004 mishra and singh 2010 sheffield and wood 2011 indices are used to characterize the state of a drought many indices have been proposed depending on the aspect of the natural hazard that is addressed impacted sector and on the scientific approach e g reyes gómez et al 2006 niemeijer 2008 wanders et al 2010 munger 1916 was one of the first who proposed a drought index the blumenstock index blumenstock 1942 and the antecedent precipitation index mcquigg 1954 are other early phase examples palmer 1965 proposed the palmer drought severity index pdsi which depends on the soil water budget and it uses precipitation and temperatures data the pdsi is widely used e g dalezios et al 2000 kim et al 2003 dai 2012 but it has despite using multiple sources of observations precipitation and temperature several limitations among others the soil water balance used including the approach to calculate the potential evapotranspiration the temporal scale the physical interpretation inability to compute recurrence probabilities e g alley 1984 guttman 1991 1998 guttman et al 1992 sheffield et al 2012 another even more widely used drought index is the standardized precipitation index spi which was first developed by mckee et al 1993 there are many drought studies using the spi in different ways e g morid et al 2006 edossa et al 2010 pandey et al 2010 vasiliades et al 2010 vangelis et al 2010 orlowsky and seneviratne 2013 joetzjer et al 2013 abdoulaye et al 2014 the spi also has been recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 2006 2012 as a drought indicator in this study the spi has been selected as the drought index spi time series can be used to characterize the at site severity of historic and ongoing drought events additionally it can also be applied to predict sequences of drought and non drought phases by using markov chains markov chains have been widely used to analyse hydrometeorological conditions see paulo and pereira 2007 more specifically for drought markov chains were used for transition probabilities of i spi edossa et al 2010 ii hydrological drought characteristics dilek eren et al 2011 and iii water deficits arasteh and mianehrow 2004 in central iran markov chains also have been applied to investigate drought in algeria for instance meddi and meddi 2009 meddi et al 2013a b found on the basis of precipitation data from the period 1930 2003 that in the western plains a dry year tend to be followed by another dry year i e persistence on the contrary in the centre of the country the probability of a non dry year after a dry year is higher than in the west lazri et al 2015 used markov chains to show that probability on a severe drought will considerably increase around 2041 relative to 2005 the at site spi analysis also has the potential for regionalisation in several studies regionalization of hydrometeorological variables has been investigated for example in algeria souag gamane et al 2007 simulated daily rainfall fields in a semi arid zone by principal component analysis and mehaiguene et al 2012 regionalized flows and base flow in north west the spi time series also offer the opportunity to estimate probabilities of spi values e g return periods of particular drought severity by exploring theoretical models that describe the observed values wang et al 2009 compared performance of several time series models to predict monthly discharge time series mishra and desai 2005 applied arma and arima models to forecast droughts using spi series for the river kangsabati india the purpose of this study is to provide quantitative information on meteorological drought standardized precipitation index spi for north african semi arid climatic conditions using stochastic models i e i at site and spatially distributed probabilities on temporal transitions using markov chains ii recurrence probabilities using the best suited time series model it demonstrates for a north algerian river basin how a set of stochastic models can be developed to obtain probabilistic information on meteorological drought which is essential for short and long term decisions on land and water management in particular the development of land use including rainfed and irrigated agriculture the paper starts with a general description of the chéliff zahrez basin in north algeria including the precipitation data used which we apply to show the potential of stochastic models to quantify meteorological drought for semi arid conditions next we give a brief description of the spi the stochastic models that we apply in this study with reference to the literature i e markov chains including the regionalization approach and the set of times series models including the comparison criteria we used to select the best performing model the results include i probabilities on transition two states dry and wet for each rain station at site for the 1st order markov chain ii maps on the probabilities on transition for the chéliff zahrez basin for the 1st order markov chain and iii at site spi for different return periods obtained with the best suited time series model eventually the detailed results for the chéliff zahrez basin are compared with the outcome of more generic studies on meteorological drought in the region and conclusions are given 2 study area the chéliff zahrez basin is located in the north of algeria fig 1 it occupies an area of 56 227 km2 0 18 3 30 east and 33 53 36 34 n the basin is subdivided in five subregions i e the chéliff upstream boughzoul and zahrez the upper and middle chéliff the lower chéliff and the mina plain and the coastal area it is bounded to the north by the mediterranean sea the west by oran basin to the south by chott chergui and the high plains of the desert and east by the region of algiers and chott hodna algerian basin the chéliff zahrez basin includes two main mountain chains the tellian atlas in the north and the saharian atlas in the south fig 2 the basin is characterized by a semi arid climate with relatively cold rainy winters and hot dry summers in this study we have selected 68 rain stations appendix a which are relatively well distributed fig 2 clearly there are more stations in the wetter north than in the drier south the selected stations have time series of annual rainfall which were long enough to carry out this work the time series cover the years 1960 2010 the majority of the selected meteorological stations has a complete record without gaps we filled the gaps of five stations using the technique developed by laborde 1998 to obtain an acceptable spatial distribution the spatial distribution of the average annual rainfall using the selected rain stations is shown in fig 2 lower right in addition a map with the coefficient of variation of the annual rainfall is given in fig 2 lower right fig 2 shows that average annual rainfall deceases from north to south and from east to west in the far northwest the average rainfall is 580 mm year e g benaria fodda bge and ghrib amont whereas in the extreme south rainfall does not reach more than 170 mm year brida the annual rainfall is also marked with a strong temporal variability the coefficient of variation is progressively growing from north to south i e 0 17 0 75 while being larger in the east than in the west in the upper and middle chéliff basin fig 2 and the dahra mountains the average annual rainfall is more than 500 mm i e south of the mountains medea secteur arib ebda and taougrit in the plains of the upper and middle chéliff the rainfall is lower on average it varies between 300 and 500 mm year the coefficient of variation is also lower 0 30 south of the mountains the average rainfall in the lower chéliff basin and the mina varied between 400 and 350 mm year e g relizane anrh and el hemadna village spatial variability of the coefficient of variation is rather high and fluctuates between 0 29 and 0 51 the southern plain boughzoul zahrez region is extremely dry with an average annual rainfall between 260 and 170 mm e g chahbounia and ksar chellala the coefficient of variation there is between 0 40 and 0 74 six stations distributed over the entire basin were selected to illustrate changes in rainfall patterns including the trend during 1960 2010 fig 3 strong fluctuations in rainfall from year to year occur and differ from place to place annual rainfall at dar chioukh and ain moulah varies between 100 and 450 mm the rainfall in ponteba bge and benaria stations which are located in the north varies between 200 and 700 mm yr 3 methods 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and wmo 2006 2012 suggested the use of the standardized precipitation index spi that is if spi 1 then a drought occurs the spi is defined as spi xij xim s where xij is the 12 months precipitation at the ith rainfall station and jth observation xim is the 12 months long term mean and s is its standard deviation since precipitation data are mostly skewed precipitation data are fitted using a gamma function and then normalized in order to compute spi spi is based on the precipitation data for any desired time scale which means that the precipitation of previous months years can be aggregated it is a measure to characterize meteorological drought which only considers precipitation an index of zero spi 0 indicates the median precipitation amount for the selected time scale e g 1 month 12 months whereas the index is negative for drought and positive for wet conditions table 1 show that as conditions become drier the index becomes more negative the spi in this study was computed using annual rainfall data which implies that we used a specific case of the spi 12 the standardized nature of the spi allows it to be comparable across different locations in the world and it can be interpreted in terms of recurrence probabilities return periods 3 2 drought transition probabilities using markov chain models markov chains provide information on transitions from one state to another e g from drought to non drought e g ochola and kerkides 2003 steinemann 2003 meddi and meddi 2009 meddi et al 2013a b for a comprehensive description of markov chain models readers are referred to banik et al 2000 in this case the spi series are non stationary so we will use non stationary markov chains e g nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 and paulo and pereira 2007 in this study two states have been distinguished i e a dry state d and a non drought wet state w which take the value 0 and 1 respectively we have applied the 1st order markov chain which means that we predict the transition probability for sequences of certain states for 2 successive years we use p 00 to denote the transition probability that a dry year is followed by another dry year 1st order markov chain please note that p 00 p 01 1 and the same applies to p 10 and p 11 p 01 is the probability of a dry year following a wet year and vice versa let x0 x1 x2 xn be random variables distributed identically and taking only two values namely 0 and 1 with probability one i e x n 0 i f t h e n t h y e a r i s d r y 1 i f t h e n t h y e a r i s w e t we apply the following hypothesis the model is a nonstationary order lag one markov chain i e p xn 0 is not constant over time moreover it is assumed that the probabilities of transitions are homogeneous over time in other words it is assumed that the probability of wetness of any year depends only on whether the previous year was wet or dry given the event in the previous year the probability of wetness is assumed to be independent of further preceding years so the stochastic process xn n 0 1 2 is a markov chain medhi 1994 so the probabilities of transitions depend only on the current state and the future state considering the transition matrix as 1 p i j p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 where p i j p x 1 j x 0 i i j 0 1 to compute the higher order transition probabilities we used the chapman kolmogorov equation 2 p k 1 p k p where k 1 2 n the limit law which is stationary exists and is unique because the markov chain is irreducible aperiodic to finite state space as it is invariant to determine the limit law 1 p p t p 1 p p t let p p x0 1 here p is the absolute probability of a year being wet clearly p x0 0 1 p for a stationary distribution 3 1 p p p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 1 p p which gives 4 p p 01 1 p 11 p 01 p is the probability of stay in state 1 and 1 p is the average time of return to state 1 the law of probabilities of the residence time in the state 1 wet noted by w which follows the geometrical law of a parameter p 11 i e 5 p w k 1 p 11 p 11 k 1 hence the probabilities of transition is and probability of wet sequences with length greater than k is 6 p w k t k 1 p w t p 11 k similarly probability of a dry spell of length m is 7 p d m 1 p 00 p 00 m 1 and the probability of dry sequences with length greater than m is 8 p d m p 00 m based upon 1st order markov chain transition probabilities jahangir alam et al 2013 have introduced a meteorological drought index di to provide useful information for agriculture 9 di p 11 x p 01 high di values represent conditions that the probability is high that the second year is wet implicitly this means that p 11 and p 01 are low which implies a low drought where p 11 is the probability of wet following wet in this case a large value of p 01 implies a large number of short wet spells which can prevent occurrence of drought this index of drought proneness is bounded by zero and one the lower the di value the higher will be the degree of drought proneness table 2 3 3 time series models to evaluate the probability of occurrence of drought to improve drought management we considered it useful to estimate the return periods of drought using time series models time series models were applied to compute at site recurrence probabilities of spi the models that were considered are given in appendix b the potential of the following time series models were explored simple gmb geometric brownian motion gbmaj geometric brownian motion time series model with asymmetric jumps aparch an asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ar1 an autoregressive time series of order 1 ar2 an autoregressive time series of order 2 arch an

an autoregressive moving average time series of order 2 comparison criteria have been used in this study to seek a compromise between how well the model fits against the observations and the minimal number of parameters this is in line with the principle of parsimony the three criteria used are appendix b i sic schwarz information criterion ii aic akaike information criterion and iii hqic hannan quinn information criterion 3 4 spatial interpolation in this study the kriging method was selected for spatial interpolation of variables given the scattered locations of a random variable one can calculate an estimate of the variable at any point of this field using the variogram 10 γ d 1 2 e z x z x d 2 where γ d is the semi variogram z is a random variable and e is the expectation of the spatial or temporal shift the kriging equation used has been proposed by deutsch and journel 1992 based on the empirical variogram a function has been fitted to adjust the empirical model the adjusted model was applied in the interpolation there are many functions available to fit but four models were tested in this study i e spherical model exponential model gaussian model power model and linear model the surfer kriging arcgis software was used for the spatial mapping using the kriging procedure 4 results first time series of computed spi for selected rain stations at site are given next transition probabilities states dry and wet for the 1st order markov chain are described the probabilities are presented for each rain station and as maps for the whole chéliff zahrez basin then the drought index for the selected rain stations is described eventually spis for different return periods for selected rain stations are given as obtained with the best performing time series model 4 1 spi in the chéliff zahrez basin time series of 1 year spi section 3 1 were computed for all rain stations in the chéliff zahrez basin for the period 1960 2010 fig 4 gives the time series for some selected stations across the river basin the selected stations are identical to those of fig 3 the time line of spi values shows very few series of dry years before 1970 in most selected stations fig 4 as illustrated by ain mouilah and dar chioukh the latter station is located in an area also known as zahraz it has alternating wet and dry sequences with more dominant long periods of wet years e g 1984 1992 the pontiba bge station high and medium chéliff has experienced wet periods up to 1980 which were followed by dry years the period 2006 2010 was again wetter than normal benaria station coast had a similar pattern although since 2004 it has been slightly wetter than in pontiba bge almost all years in layoune and boughzoul until 1980 were wetter than normal which were followed by predominantly dry years 4 2 transition probabilities of meteorological drought 4 2 1 at site transition probabilities the transition probability of dry and wet states section 3 2 is given for each of the 65 rain stations in fig 5 using annual rainfall data from the period 1960 2010 the probabilities are presented for the 1st order markov chain and are clustered according to the subregions fig 1 for example the probability that the rain station el hamadna village region 3 will face two consecutive drought years is 54 d d and 60 that a wet year is followed by a drought year w d fig 4 top the order 1 markov transition probability shows that the probability of two successive dry years is higher at stations in the regions 3 4 and 5 for instance the probability of a dry year after a dry year d d in brida and charef is 61 and 66 while for the same stations the probability of two successive wet years w w is 39 and 34 respectively in contrast stations in the regions 1 and 2 are marked by a lower probability of d d 60 and a higher probability of w w 50 4 2 2 mapping transition probabilities the at site probabilities were interpolated to obtain maps of transition probabilities for the whole chéliff zahrez basin for the wet dry sequences that were obtained from the markov chain models this is done for the 1st order markov chain kriging was applied to interpolate the at site transition probabilities section 3 4 fig 6 shows the semi variograms for the selected wet dry sequences that were obtained for the transition probabilities appendix c provides the properties of the semi variograms the analysis showed that wet dry sequences starting with a dry year are best described by an exponential model whereas sequences beginning with a wet year are better explained by a linear model the range of the different exponential semi variograms appeared to be substantially different the range of the exponential semi variogram for the transition probability is between 127 and 179 km 1st order markov chain with correlation coefficients around 0 38 appendix c probability maps for the chéliff zahrez basin were generated using a 1st order markov chain which were derived from 1960 to 2010 data contour maps with equal transition probabilities for selected 2 year dry wet sequences were made fig 7 a high transition probability for d d also reflects a high drought proneness the transition probability of a dry year followed by another dry year d d fig 7 left shows a gradient of increasing values from northeast to southwest which implies drought is more persistent in the southwest the transition probability gradient is smaller in the tellian area middle than in gate to the sahara in the south the highest transition probabilities for d w fig 7 middle are located in the

taougrite and tarik ibn ziad according to the di map showing the di associated with the transition probabilities for the 1st markov chain have been generated using the at site di and kriging in an arc

periods was calculated based upon average annual rainfall data from 1960 to 2010 using the eleven selected time series models appendix b it appeared that the asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity aparch model outperformed the other models based upon schwarz information criterion sic akaike information criterion aic and hannah quinn information criterion hqic fig 10 shows the spi for each of the 65 rain stations for a range of return periods 6 17 years the spi obtained with the aparch model substantially varies for a certain return period for example for a return period of 6 years the highest spi exceeds 2 wet condition whereas some rain stations have a spi that is about 1 5 moderately dry for a return period of 17 years the maximum spi is still about 2 whereas the lowest values are 2 extremely dry extremely dry conditions low spi for a return period of 17 years were recorded in the agricultural region region 2 e g bordj el khaled amir sidi medjahed and el abadia as well as for ksar chellala region 4 with spi around 2 while normal values are found for regions 1 3 and 4 5 discussion during the study period 1960 2010 the annual rainfall trend was negative decreasing in several rain stations in the chéliff zahrez basin the temporal evolution of the standardized precipitation index spi reveals the existence of dry episodes between 1970 and 1980 wet interruptions happened in all rainfall stations in north algeria laborde 1993 meddi and meddi 2007 meddi and rahmouni 2014 moreover the basin is characterized by a high spatial variability of rainfall as reflected in the spi fig 10 the relief and the remoteness of the sea play a key role in this variability rainfall decreases from north to south and from east to south meddi and toumi 2013 the likelihood of recurrence of dry years is high compared to the appearance of sequences of wet years fig 5 which means that the chéliff zahrez basin faces repeated drought periods these results are consistent with the work done on the neighbourhood plains of northern algeria meddi and meddi 2009 meddi and toumi 2013 the probability of occurrence of severe droughts is projected to significantly increase 0 27 in 2005 0 58 in 2041 according to lazri et al 2015 which will worsen the already existing drought proneness as reported in our study similar results were found for spain and tunisia benzarti and habaieb 2001 martin vide 1999 dry spells have become more dominant in the region this fact is supported by the reduction in agricultural production especially cereals in algeria this production is marked by strong irregularities which is conditioned by differences in rain over the last 40 years differences up to a factor 5 have been observed in the calamitous year 1994 a record low production of 9 7 million quintals 1 million tons was recorded whereas in 2009 a production of 52 5 million quintals was achieved faostat 2013 the repeated drought and the associated pressure on the lands also had a negative impact on the temporal evolution of the vegetation cover e g forest the forest area reduced between 1910 and 2010 by 22 the number of forest fires also increased by about 1 per year meddour sahar et al 2013 the application of the markov chain hypothesis of order 1 is used to show the persistence of the two dry years in our case the probability of successive years of the same type dry or wet is high 60 this could be explained by the fact that algeria experiences a semi arid climate this widespread drought has important consequences for crops as agriculture in the study area is based on rainfed cropping systems the aparch time series model was selected based upon schwarz information criterion sic akaike information criterion aic and hannan quinn information criterion aic to predict drought return periods using the spi as a drought index the results show that the selected aparch model is suitable for the spi prediction chen et al 2012 khaldoun et al 2013 mossad and alazba 2015 showed that the arima model also performs well for drought prediction however in our study the aparch outperformed the arima model the coefficients of determination between the spi 12 derived from observed data and the predictions using the aparch model are statistically significant and range from 0 80 to 0 95 fig 11 the aparch models show rather high prediction skill in for the boughzoul station r2 0 90 whereas the skill is somewhat lower for the brida station r2 0 81 the stations in zahrez basin ain mouileh and charef are also marked with a slightly lower determination coefficient than 90 the impact of the climate on rain and river flow led to excessive use of groundwater in the upper and middle chéliff the chéliff upstream boughzoul the lower chéliff and the mina plain which water table drop of 5 40 m meddi and hubert 2003 meddi and boucefiane 2009 the impact of the climate on the drought was found in large parts of the mediterranean basin e g aguilera and murillo 2009 essefi et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 mimikou and baltas 2013 in the chéliff zahrez basin 14 dams can be found and numerous hill reservoirs for irrigation have been installed these dams and reservoirs play an important role in the socio economic development of the region moreover part of the waters of this basin is transferred to the west of the country which shows the dependence of other regions on the resources of the chéliff zahrez basin in this context understanding and prediction of drought become are necessary for the rational and sustainable management of water resources the modelling approaches markov chains and the aparch models allow prediction of drought probabilities that can be used by managers in water resources planning in our case the aparch model shows that droughts will be recurrent in the future model prediction results indicate that the risk of drought spi 2 increases from south to north in the basin moreover meddi et al 2009 ghenim and megnounif 2013 found that the flow to dams in the region have decreased drastically in recent decades the improved water management has to guarantee the supply of drinking water to the population and to ensure irrigation of agricultural land to increase agricultural production drought impact on agricultural production boubacar 2010 al kaisi et al 2013 leng et al 2015 zipper et al 2016 requires stable availability of irrigation water to cope with food demands of the ever growing population work on predicting drought probabilities are also essential for decision makers to develop a water strategy for different time horizons to meet future needs that will become increasingly important studies by zeroual et al 2017 taibi et al 2015 showed pessimistic precipitation projections all scenarios predict a decrease in rainfall taibi et al 2015 the inputs to dams depend directly on precipitation as the irrigation depends on the stored volumes in dams prediction becomes a prerequisite for developing strategies of water resource management to ensure sustainable development including growth of agricultural production our results are anticipated to help decisions makers and should be supplemented with the work on the future projection of the climate impact on drought orlowsky and seneviratne 2013 prudhomme et al 2014 van huijgevoort et al 2014 wanders et al 2015 wanders and van lanen 2015 stagge et al 2015 watson et al 2015 to have a sustainable development strategy for the region 6 conclusions this study has predicted the likelihood of meteorological drought by statistical methods in the semi arid chéliff zahrez basin where multiple year droughts are common time series of annual rainfall were collated from 68 meteorological stations for a 51 year period 1960 2010 it appeared that the frequency of drought events substantially varies from one station to another the analysis of the annual rainfall and the derived meteorological drought standardized precipitation index spi has shown that since 1970 the basin has been confronted with below average rainfall particularly the centre and north markov chains were used to identify consecutive drought years of 2 years multiple year droughts are more common than series of wet years in a row the transition probabilities of the worst case i e two successive drought years which reflect the highest drought proneness are 0 5 or more the highest probabilities are found in the west and southwest the drought index that combines transition probabilities of series of dry and wet years has been used as additional approach to identify drought prone regions within the basin the variation in the drought index increased among rain stations when more consecutive years were considered stochastic modelling was applied to determine the spi for a range of return periods for each rainfall station the aparch approach appeared to be the best way of predicting the return periods of meteorological droughts similar to the other analyses the spi for a certain return period substantially varied among the stations for the longest return period we analysed i e 17 years part of the upper and middle chéliff subregion again had the lowest spis spi 2 this study contributes to knowledge on meteorological drought in the generally data sparse north african semi arid regions it shows through various approaches that probability of multiple year droughts is rather high however it also illustrates that spatiotemporal variability is high within a large scale basis such as the chéliff zahrez basin the outcome of the study will support irrigation and agriculture authorities in the chéliff zahrez basin to improve drought management and planning which should also include development of long term drought adaptation strategies based upon recurrence and transition probabilities of current meteorological drought and projected drought in a generic sense drought management in north african semi arid regions can learn from this study the different approaches that were applied in this study are scale independent and transferable to other semi arid conditions if actual numbers are required the study is also meant to be a relevant building block in a better understanding of drought climatology across the globe which considers a wide range of environmental conditions conflict of interest none acknowledgements the

8517,study region north algeria study focus the semi arid to arid chéliff zahrez basin faced several droughts with severe impacts on agriculture due to the high temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall we explored the potential of the standardized precipitation index spi markov chain models the drought index and time series modelling to characterize meteorological drought time series of annual precipitation 1960 2010 from 65 meteorological stations across the basin were used the basin was subdivided into five subbasins to account for spatial variability new hydrological insights for the regions the analysis of the standardized precipitation index showed few droughts in the period 1960 1970 whereas in the 1990s a multi year drought occurred with spis as low as 2 extremely dry in many subbasins the markov chain analysis learnt that the probability of having two consecutive drought years appears to be higher in the southern subbasins the drought index derived from transition probabilities indicates that the southern and the southwestern parts of the chéliff zahrez basin are most drought prone time series modelling was applied to compute the spi for different return periods 6 17 years eleven models were tested and it appeared that the asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity aparch approach was best performing based on several information criteria for a return period of 17 years the spi is lower than 1 5 severely dry in many subbasins keywords meteorological drought spi markov chain time series modelling drought maps chéliff zahrez basin 1 introduction algeria is known for its multi year droughts long lasting below normal rainfall in a semi arid climate has devastating impacts on algerian agriculture particularly the western part of the country has experienced several major droughts during the 1940s and since the 1970s meddi and hubert 2003 meddi and meddi 2009 seltzer 1946 already presented a detailed analysis of rainfall across algeria he noted that variability in annual rainfall 1911 1938 in the high plains and the saharan atlas is less sensitive than in the northern regions of algeria demmak 1982 compared rainfall departure from the average deficit in the period 1974 1992 with the deficit from the period 1913 1963 in northern algeria and found drier conditions in the last period although some years in the first period also were dry e g 1913 and 1940 they observed an increased deficit from east to west farmer and wigley 1985 and kadi 1995 reported on widespread drought during some years i e 1937 1961 and 1970 matari and douguedroit 1995 who divided west algeria in several regions noted that the 1940s drought is mainly due to a lower spring rain and those of 1980s to a decreased winter rain the rainfall deficits in northern algeria are triggered by climate drivers such as enso el mahi et al 2012 the reported rainfall deficits caused serious socio economic problems and it anticipated future deficits will impose increasing pressure on the scarce algerian water resources among others for supply of drinking water and irrigation khaldi 2005 adequate water resources management that is based on sound data should cope with these pressures which particularly are felt during drought episodes these data include both the state of an ongoing drought monitoring characterization and drought states that can be expected on the basis of past events prediction drought is a relative phenomenon meaning that it is a deviation from normal hydrometeorological conditions it deviates from aridity which is a permanent feature of a dry climate in this study low average rainfall and is not water scarcity long term unsustainable use of water resources e g wilhite and glantz 1985 wilhite 2000 tallaksen and van lanen 2004 mishra and singh 2010 sheffield and wood 2011 indices are used to characterize the state of a drought many indices have been proposed depending on the aspect of the natural hazard that is addressed impacted sector and on the scientific approach e g reyes gómez et al 2006 niemeijer 2008 wanders et al 2010 munger 1916 was one of the first who proposed a drought index the blumenstock index blumenstock 1942 and the antecedent precipitation index mcquigg 1954 are other early phase examples palmer 1965 proposed the palmer drought severity index pdsi which depends on the soil water budget and it uses precipitation and temperatures data the pdsi is widely used e g dalezios et al 2000 kim et al 2003 dai 2012 but it has despite using multiple sources of observations precipitation and temperature several limitations among others the soil water balance used including the approach to calculate the potential evapotranspiration the temporal scale the physical interpretation inability to compute recurrence probabilities e g alley 1984 guttman 1991 1998 guttman et al 1992 sheffield et al 2012 another even more widely used drought index is the standardized precipitation index spi which was first developed by mckee et al 1993 there are many drought studies using the spi in different ways e g morid et al 2006 edossa et al 2010 pandey et al 2010 vasiliades et al 2010 vangelis et al 2010 orlowsky and seneviratne 2013 joetzjer et al 2013 abdoulaye et al 2014 the spi also has been recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 2006 2012 as a drought indicator in this study the spi has been selected as the drought index spi time series can be used to characterize the at site severity of historic and ongoing drought events additionally it can also be applied to predict sequences of drought and non drought phases by using markov chains markov chains have been widely used to analyse hydrometeorological conditions see

iii water deficits arasteh and mianehrow 2004 in central iran markov chains also have been applied to investigate drought in algeria for instance meddi and meddi 2009 meddi et al 2013a b found on the basis of precipitation data from the period 1930 2003 that in the western plains a dry year tend to be followed by another dry year i e persistence on the contrary in the centre of the country the probability of a non dry year after a dry year is higher than in the west lazri et al 2015 used markov chains to show that probability on a severe drought will considerably increase around 2041 relative to 2005 the at site spi analysis also has the potential for regionalisation in several studies regionalization of hydrometeorological variables has been investigated for example in algeria souag gamane et al 2007 simulated daily rainfall fields in a semi arid zone by principal component analysis and mehaiguene et al 2012 regionalized flows and base flow in north west the spi time series

compared performance of several time series models to predict monthly discharge time series mishra and desai 2005 applied arma and arima models to forecast droughts using spi series for the river kangsabati india the purpose of this study is to provide quantitative information on meteorological drought standardized precipitation index spi for north african semi arid climatic conditions using stochastic models i e i at site and spatially distributed probabilities on temporal transitions using markov chains ii recurrence probabilities using the best suited time series model it demonstrates for a north algerian river basin how a set of stochastic models can be developed to obtain probabilistic information on meteorological drought which is essential for short and long term decisions on land and water management in particular the development of land use including rainfed and irrigated agriculture the paper starts with a general description of the chéliff zahrez basin in north algeria including the precipitation data used which we apply to show the potential of stochastic models to quantify meteorological drought for semi arid conditions next we give a brief description of the spi the stochastic models that we apply in this study with reference to the literature i e markov chains including the regionalization approach and the set of times series models including the comparison criteria we used to select the best performing model the results include i probabilities on transition two states dry and wet for each rain station at site for the 1st order markov chain ii maps on the probabilities on transition for the chéliff zahrez basin for the 1st order markov chain and iii at site spi for different return periods obtained with the best suited time series model eventually the detailed results for the chéliff zahrez basin are compared with the outcome of more generic studies on meteorological drought in the region and conclusions are given 2 study area the chéliff zahrez basin is located in the north of algeria fig 1 it occupies an area of 56 227 km2 0 18 3 30 east and 33 53 36 34 n the basin is subdivided in five subregions i e the chéliff upstream boughzoul and zahrez the upper and middle chéliff the lower chéliff and the mina plain and the coastal area it is bounded to the north by the mediterranean sea the west by oran basin to the south by chott chergui and the high plains of the desert and east by the region of algiers and chott hodna algerian basin the chéliff zahrez basin includes two main mountain chains the tellian atlas in the north and the saharian atlas in the south fig 2 the basin is characterized by a semi arid climate with relatively cold rainy winters and hot dry summers in this study we have selected 68 rain stations appendix a which are relatively well distributed fig 2 clearly there are more stations in the wetter north than in the drier south the selected stations have time series of annual rainfall which were long enough to carry out this work the time series cover the years 1960 2010 the majority of the selected meteorological stations has a complete record without gaps we filled the gaps of five stations using the technique developed by laborde 1998 to obtain an acceptable spatial distribution the spatial distribution of the average annual rainfall using the selected rain stations is shown in fig 2 lower right in addition a map with the coefficient of variation of the annual rainfall is given in fig 2 lower right fig 2 shows that average annual rainfall deceases from north to south and from east to west in the far northwest the average rainfall is 580 mm year e g benaria fodda bge and ghrib amont whereas in the extreme south rainfall does not reach more than 170 mm year brida the annual rainfall is also marked with a strong temporal variability the coefficient of variation is progressively growing from north to south i e 0 17 0 75 while being larger in the east than in the west in the upper and middle chéliff basin fig 2 and the dahra mountains the average annual rainfall is more than 500 mm i e south of the mountains medea secteur arib ebda and taougrit in the plains of the upper and middle chéliff the rainfall is lower on average it varies between 300 and 500 mm year the coefficient of variation is also lower 0 30 south of the mountains the average rainfall in the lower chéliff basin and the mina varied between 400 and 350 mm year e g relizane anrh and el hemadna village spatial variability of the coefficient of variation is rather high and fluctuates between 0 29 and 0 51 the southern plain boughzoul zahrez region is extremely dry with an average annual rainfall between 260 and 170 mm e g chahbounia and ksar chellala the coefficient of variation there is between 0 40 and 0 74 six stations distributed over the entire basin were selected to illustrate changes in rainfall patterns including the trend during 1960 2010 fig 3 strong fluctuations in rainfall from year to year occur and differ from place to place annual rainfall at dar chioukh and ain moulah varies between 100 and 450 mm the rainfall in ponteba bge and benaria stations which are located in the north varies between 200 and 700 mm yr 3 methods 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and wmo 2006 2012 suggested the use of the standardized precipitation index spi that is if spi 1 then a drought occurs the spi is defined as spi xij xim s where xij is the 12 months precipitation at the ith rainfall station and jth observation xim is the 12 months long term mean and s is its standard deviation since precipitation data are mostly skewed precipitation data are fitted using a gamma function and then normalized in order to compute spi spi is based on the precipitation data for any desired time scale which means that the precipitation of previous months years can be aggregated it is a measure to characterize meteorological drought which only considers precipitation an index of zero spi 0 indicates the median precipitation amount for the selected time scale e g 1 month 12 months whereas the index is negative for drought and positive for wet conditions table 1 show that as conditions become drier the index becomes more negative the spi in this study was computed using annual rainfall data which implies that we used a specific case of the spi 12 the standardized nature of the spi allows it to be comparable across different locations in the world and it can be interpreted in terms of recurrence probabilities return periods 3 2 drought transition probabilities using markov chain models markov chains provide information on transitions from one state to another e g from drought to non drought e g ochola and kerkides 2003 steinemann 2003 meddi and meddi 2009 meddi et al 2013a b for a comprehensive description of markov chain models readers are referred to banik et al 2000 in this case the spi series are non stationary so we will use non stationary markov chains e g nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 and paulo and pereira 2007 in this study two states have been distinguished i e a dry state d and a non drought wet state w which take the value 0 and 1 respectively we have applied the 1st order markov chain which means that we predict the transition probability for sequences of certain states for 2 successive years we use p 00 to denote the transition probability that a dry year is followed by another dry year 1st order markov chain please note that p 00 p 01 1 and the same applies to p 10 and p 11 p 01 is the probability of a dry year following a wet year and vice versa let x0 x1 x2 xn be random variables distributed identically and taking only two values namely 0 and 1 with probability one i e x n 0 i f t h e n t h y e a r i s d r y 1 i f t h e n t h y e a r i s w e t we apply the following hypothesis the model is a nonstationary order lag one markov chain i e p xn 0 is not constant over time moreover it is assumed that the probabilities of transitions are homogeneous over time in other words it is assumed that the probability of wetness of any year depends only on whether the previous year was wet or dry given the event in the previous year the probability of wetness is assumed to be independent of further preceding years so the stochastic process xn n 0 1 2 is a markov chain medhi 1994 so the probabilities of transitions depend only on the current state and the future state considering the transition matrix as 1 p i j p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 where p i j p x 1 j x 0 i i j 0 1 to compute the higher order transition probabilities we used the chapman kolmogorov equation 2 p k 1 p k p where k 1 2 n the limit law which is stationary exists and is unique because the markov chain is irreducible aperiodic to finite state space as it is invariant to determine the limit law 1 p p t p 1 p p t let p p x0 1 here p is the absolute probability of a year being wet clearly p x0 0 1 p for a stationary distribution 3 1 p p p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 1 p p which gives 4 p p 01 1 p 11 p 01 p is the probability of stay in state 1 and 1 p is the average time of return to state 1 the law of probabilities of the residence time in the state 1 wet noted by w which follows the geometrical law of a parameter p 11 i e 5 p w k 1 p 11 p 11 k 1 hence the probabilities of transition is and probability of wet sequences with length greater than k is 6 p w k t k 1 p w t p 11 k similarly probability of a dry spell of length m is 7 p d m 1 p 00 p 00 m 1 and the probability of dry sequences with length greater than m is 8 p d m p 00 m based upon 1st order markov chain transition probabilities jahangir alam et al 2013 have introduced a meteorological drought index di to provide useful information for agriculture 9 di p 11 x p 01 high di values represent conditions that the probability is high that the second year is wet implicitly this means that p 11 and p 01 are low which implies a low drought where p 11 is the probability of wet following wet in this case a large value of p 01 implies a large number of short wet spells which can prevent occurrence of drought this index of drought proneness is bounded by zero and one the lower the di value the higher will be the degree of drought proneness table 2 3 3 time series models to evaluate the probability of occurrence of drought to improve drought management we considered it useful to estimate the return periods of drought using time series models time series models were applied to compute at site recurrence probabilities of spi the models that were considered are given in appendix b the potential of the following time series models were explored simple gmb geometric brownian motion gbmaj geometric brownian motion time series model with

an autoregressive moving average time series of order 2 comparison criteria have been used in this study to seek a compromise between how well the model fits against the observations and the minimal number of parameters this is in line with the principle of parsimony the three criteria used are appendix b i sic schwarz information criterion ii aic akaike information criterion and iii hqic hannan quinn information criterion 3 4 spatial interpolation in this study the kriging method was selected for spatial interpolation of variables given the scattered locations of a random variable one can calculate an estimate of the variable at any point of this field using the variogram 10 γ d 1 2 e z x z x d 2 where γ d is the semi variogram z is a random variable and e is the expectation of the spatial or temporal shift the kriging equation used has been proposed by deutsch and journel 1992 based on the empirical variogram a function has been fitted to adjust the empirical model the adjusted model was applied in the interpolation there are many functions available to fit but four models were tested in this study i e spherical model exponential model gaussian model power model and linear model the surfer kriging arcgis software was used for the spatial mapping using the kriging procedure 4 results first time series of computed spi for selected rain stations at site are given next transition probabilities states dry and wet for the 1st order markov chain are described the probabilities are presented for each rain station and as maps for the whole chéliff zahrez basin then the drought index for the selected rain stations is described eventually spis for different return periods for selected rain stations are given as obtained with the best performing time series model 4 1 spi in the chéliff zahrez basin time series of 1 year spi section 3 1 were computed for all rain stations in the chéliff zahrez basin for the period 1960 2010 fig 4 gives the time series for some selected stations across the river basin the selected stations are identical to those of fig 3 the time line of spi values shows very few series of dry years before 1970 in most selected stations fig 4 as illustrated by ain mouilah and dar chioukh the latter station is located in an area also known as zahraz it has alternating wet and dry sequences with more dominant long periods of wet years e g 1984 1992 the pontiba bge station high and medium chéliff has experienced wet periods up to 1980 which were followed by dry years the period 2006 2010 was again wetter than normal benaria station coast had a similar pattern although since 2004 it has been slightly wetter than in pontiba bge almost all years in layoune and boughzoul until 1980 were wetter than normal which were followed by predominantly dry years 4 2 transition probabilities of meteorological drought 4 2 1 at site transition probabilities the transition probability of dry and wet states section 3 2 is given for each of the 65 rain stations in fig 5 using annual rainfall data from the period 1960 2010 the probabilities are presented for the 1st order markov chain and are clustered according to the subregions fig 1 for example the probability that the rain station el hamadna village region 3 will face two consecutive drought years is 54 d d and 60 that a wet year is followed by a drought year w d fig 4 top the order 1 markov transition probability shows that the probability of two successive dry years is higher at stations in the regions 3 4 and 5 for instance the probability of a dry year after a dry year d d in brida and charef is 61 and 66 while for the same stations the probability of two successive wet years w w is 39 and 34 respectively in contrast stations in the regions 1 and 2 are marked by a lower probability of d d 60 and a higher probability of w w 50 4 2 2 mapping transition probabilities the at site probabilities were interpolated to obtain maps of transition probabilities for the whole chéliff zahrez basin for the wet dry sequences that were obtained from the markov chain models this is done for the 1st order markov chain kriging was applied to interpolate the at site transition probabilities section 3 4 fig 6 shows the semi variograms for the selected wet dry sequences that were obtained for the transition probabilities appendix c provides the properties of the semi variograms the analysis showed that wet dry sequences starting with a dry year are best described by an exponential model whereas sequences beginning with a wet year are better explained by a linear model the range of the different exponential semi variograms appeared to be substantially different the range of the exponential semi variogram for the transition probability is between 127 and 179 km 1st order markov chain with correlation coefficients around 0 38 appendix c probability maps for the chéliff zahrez basin were generated using a 1st order markov chain which were derived from 1960 to 2010 data contour maps with equal transition probabilities for selected 2 year dry wet sequences were made fig 7 a high transition probability for d d also reflects a high drought proneness the transition probability of a dry year followed by another dry year d d fig 7 left shows a gradient of increasing values from northeast to southwest which implies drought is more persistent in the southwest the transition probability gradient is smaller in the tellian area middle than in gate to the sahara in the south the highest transition probabilities for d w fig 7 middle are located in the northeast about 0 45 and the lowest in the central west 0 34 0 36 the transition probabilities for w d 0 32 0 41 fig 7 right are similar to the 2 year sequence d w 4 3 drought index the at site drought index di for the 65 rain stations is shown in fig 8 which is derived from transition probabilities for the 1st order markov chain section 3 2 most dis are between 0 2 and 0 3 fig 10 upper panel which means a mild to moderate drought proneness table 2 two stations ouled ben aekand ain baadj are below 0 185 indicating severe drought proneness while some are not drought prone e g taougrite and tarik ibn ziad according to the di map showing the di associated with the transition probabilities for the 1st markov chain have been generated using the at site di and kriging in an arc gis and arc view environment fig 9 the di map illustrates that the northern and eastern part of the chéliff zahrez basin is less drought prone large areas 0 310 when 2 year sequences are considered moderate drought proneness occurs in the southwest 0 21 0 23 4 4 modelling the return period of the standardized precipitation index the standardized precipitation index spi for different return periods was calculated based upon average annual rainfall data from 1960 to 2010 using the eleven selected time series models appendix b it appeared that the asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity aparch model outperformed the other models based upon schwarz information criterion sic akaike information criterion aic and hannah quinn information criterion hqic fig 10 shows the spi for each of the 65 rain stations for a range of return periods 6 17 years the spi obtained with the aparch model substantially varies for a certain return period for example for a return period of 6 years the highest spi exceeds 2 wet condition whereas some rain stations have a spi that is about 1 5 moderately dry for a return period of 17 years the maximum spi is still about 2 whereas the lowest values are 2 extremely dry extremely dry conditions low spi for a return period of 17 years were recorded in the agricultural region region 2 e g bordj el khaled amir sidi medjahed and el abadia as well as for ksar chellala region 4 with spi around 2 while normal values are found for regions 1 3 and 4 5 discussion during the study period 1960 2010 the annual rainfall trend was negative decreasing in several rain stations in the chéliff zahrez basin the temporal evolution of the standardized precipitation index spi reveals the existence of dry episodes between 1970 and 1980 wet interruptions happened in all rainfall stations in north algeria laborde 1993 meddi and meddi 2007 meddi and rahmouni 2014 moreover the basin is characterized by a high spatial variability of rainfall as reflected in the spi fig 10 the relief and the remoteness of the sea play a key role in this variability rainfall decreases from north to south and from east to south meddi and toumi 2013 the likelihood of recurrence of dry years is high compared to the appearance of sequences of wet years fig 5 which means that the chéliff zahrez basin faces repeated drought periods these results are consistent with the work done on the neighbourhood plains of northern algeria meddi and meddi 2009 meddi and toumi 2013 the probability of occurrence of severe droughts is projected to significantly increase 0 27 in 2005 0 58 in 2041 according to lazri et al 2015 which will worsen the already existing drought proneness as reported in our study similar results were found for spain and tunisia benzarti and habaieb 2001 martin vide 1999 dry spells have become more dominant in the region this fact is supported by the reduction in agricultural production especially cereals in algeria this production is marked by strong irregularities which is conditioned by differences in rain over the last 40 years differences up to a factor 5 have been observed in the calamitous year 1994 a record low production of 9 7 million quintals 1 million tons was recorded whereas in 2009 a production of 52 5 million quintals was achieved faostat 2013 the repeated drought and the associated pressure on the lands also had a negative impact on the temporal evolution of the vegetation cover e g forest the forest area reduced between 1910 and 2010 by 22 the number of forest fires also increased by about 1 per year meddour sahar et al 2013 the application of the markov chain hypothesis of order 1 is used to show the persistence of the two dry years in our case the probability of successive years of the same type dry or wet is high 60 this could be explained by the fact that algeria experiences a semi arid climate this widespread drought has important consequences for crops as agriculture in the study area is based on rainfed cropping systems the aparch time series model was selected based upon schwarz information criterion sic akaike information criterion aic and hannan quinn information criterion aic to predict drought return periods using the spi as a drought index the results show that the selected aparch model is suitable for the spi prediction chen et al 2012 khaldoun et al 2013 mossad and alazba 2015 showed that the arima model also performs well for drought prediction however in our study the aparch outperformed the arima model the coefficients of determination between the spi 12 derived from observed data and the predictions using the aparch model are statistically significant and range from 0 80 to 0 95 fig 11 the aparch models show rather high prediction skill in for the boughzoul station r2 0 90 whereas the skill is somewhat lower for the brida station r2 0 81 the stations in zahrez basin ain mouileh and charef are also marked with a slightly lower determination coefficient than 90 the impact of the climate on rain and river flow led to excessive use of groundwater in the upper and middle chéliff the chéliff upstream boughzoul the lower chéliff and the mina plain which water table drop of 5 40 m meddi and hubert 2003 meddi and boucefiane 2009 the impact of the climate on the drought was found in large parts of the mediterranean basin e g aguilera and murillo 2009 essefi et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 mimikou and baltas 2013 in the chéliff zahrez basin 14 dams can be found and numerous hill reservoirs for irrigation have been installed these dams and reservoirs play an important role in the socio economic development of the region moreover part of the waters of this basin is transferred to the west of the country which shows the dependence of other regions on the resources of the chéliff zahrez basin in this context understanding and prediction of drought become are necessary for the rational and sustainable management of water resources the modelling approaches markov chains and the aparch models allow prediction of drought probabilities that can be used by managers in water resources planning in our case the aparch model shows that droughts will be recurrent in the future model prediction results indicate that the risk of drought spi 2 increases from south to north in the basin moreover meddi et al 2009 ghenim and megnounif 2013 found that the flow to dams in the region have decreased drastically in recent decades the improved water management has to guarantee the supply of drinking water to the population and to ensure irrigation of agricultural land to increase agricultural production drought impact on agricultural production boubacar 2010 al kaisi et al 2013 leng et al 2015 zipper et al 2016 requires stable availability of irrigation water to cope with food demands of the ever growing population work on predicting drought probabilities are also essential for decision makers to develop a water strategy for different time horizons to meet future needs that will become increasingly important studies by zeroual et al 2017 taibi et al 2015 showed pessimistic precipitation projections all scenarios predict a decrease in rainfall taibi et al 2015 the inputs to dams depend directly on precipitation as the irrigation depends on the stored volumes in dams prediction becomes a prerequisite for developing strategies of water resource management to ensure sustainable development including growth of agricultural production our results are anticipated to help decisions makers and should be supplemented with the work on the future projection of the climate impact on drought orlowsky and seneviratne 2013 prudhomme et al 2014 van huijgevoort et al 2014 wanders et al 2015 wanders and van lanen 2015 stagge et al 2015 watson et al 2015 to have a sustainable development strategy for the region 6 conclusions this study has predicted the likelihood of meteorological drought by statistical methods in the semi arid chéliff zahrez basin where multiple year droughts are common time series of annual rainfall were collated from 68 meteorological stations for a 51 year period 1960 2010 it appeared that the frequency of drought events substantially varies from one station to another the analysis of the annual rainfall and the derived meteorological drought standardized precipitation index spi has shown that since 1970 the basin has been confronted with below average rainfall particularly the centre and north markov chains were used to identify consecutive drought years of 2 years multiple year droughts are more common than series of wet years in a row the transition probabilities of the worst case i e two successive drought years which reflect the highest drought proneness are 0 5 or more the highest probabilities are found in the west and southwest the drought index that combines transition probabilities of series of dry and wet years has been used as additional approach to identify drought prone regions within the basin the variation in the drought index increased among rain stations when more consecutive years were considered stochastic modelling was applied to determine the spi for a range of return periods for each rainfall station the aparch approach appeared to be the best way of predicting the return periods of meteorological droughts similar to the other analyses the spi for a certain return period substantially varied among the stations for the longest return period we analysed i e 17 years part of the upper and middle chéliff subregion again had the lowest spis spi 2 this study contributes to knowledge on meteorological drought in the generally data sparse north african semi arid regions it shows through various approaches that probability of multiple year droughts is rather high however it also illustrates that spatiotemporal variability is high within a large scale basis such as the chéliff zahrez basin the outcome of the study will support irrigation and agriculture authorities in the chéliff zahrez basin to improve drought management and planning which should also include development of long term drought adaptation strategies based upon recurrence and transition probabilities of current meteorological drought and projected drought in a generic sense drought management in north african semi arid regions can learn from this study the different approaches that were applied in this study are scale independent and transferable to other semi arid conditions if actual numbers are required the study is also meant to be a relevant building block in a better understanding of drought climatology across the globe which considers a wide range of environmental conditions conflict of interest none acknowledgements the

8518,study region ganga river basin study focus the availability of freshwater has been recognized as a global issue and the reliable evaluation and quantification of it within the basin is necessary to bolster the sustainable management of water for this purpose a basin scale swat model of the ganga river basin has been developed new hydrologic insights for the region model validation showed that simulated results were consistent with the observed data in reproducing the seasonal dynamics of surface water and suggest that the model is capable of reproducing the hydrological features of the basin including the snow melt however there are large variations in both temporal and spatial distribution of the hydrological components statistical methods have been used for detecting trends and critical changes in streamflow it has been found that although the streamflow from the snow fed areas has increased the stream flow in the lower reaches and the non perennial tributaries have declined significantly this decline can be attributed to both anthropogenic and exogenous changes the study also establishes that there has been a substantial reduction in overall water resources availability with respect to virgin this information sets the yardstick to the restoration of the hydrological and environmental health of the basin and can lead to better management of water resources under scarcity keywords surface water modeling swat ganga river basin hydrologic modeling trend test 1 introduction the ganga river basin grb is one of the most populous river systems in the world the river is of high importance with an estimated 440 million people directly or indirectly depending on the water that the ganga and its tributaries provide for agriculture drinking hydropower generation and navigation and for ecosystem services the perpetual population increase and consequent water resources development has affected the river s flow regime which in turn has impacted the water availability quality of water and thus riverine ecosystems the availability of water has become an intriguing issue for irrigation systems food security and ecosystem health the consistent water supply from the grb is of paramount importance for the sustainability of highly dependent agricultural population of india sadoff et al 2013 seidel et al 2000 sustainable water management in an irrigation dominated catchment endeavors to warrant a long term adaptable and stable water supply to accomplish crop water demands in addition to raising industrial and municipal water demands while alleviating deleterious environmental consequences integral to any effective water resource management is the quantification of the natural availability of water within a catchment area to achieve sustainable management of available water resources for a catchment it is essential to understand hydrology of the river catchment understanding watershed hydrology and the hydrologic processes involved is critical as it is vital for reliable assessments of water quantity and quality as a result of rapid urbanization and other land use changes happening within the developed watershed the assessment of water yield and overall water balance in a watershed is a primary requirement and has been extensively adopted for the unequivocal management of catchment abbaspour et al 2015 adeogun et al 2014 malagò et al 2016 accurate and timely forecasts of river runoff have the prowess of providing critical information for agriculture optimization water resource management and disaster mitigation johnston and smakhtin 2014 nishat and rahman 2009 rees et al 2004 hence it is important to consider the various land surface processes of the targeted basin to understand the issues of water resources management meticulously anthropogenic activities such as river regulations have substantially changed the water balance of the natural catchment for this purpose the researchers are inclined to conduct the studies by employing a modeling approach to better understand complex watershed processes and their interactions with topography land use management soils and climate to get key water balance components such as surface runoff groundwater and evapotranspiration et kumar et al 2016 magilligan and nislow 2005 miller et al 2014 as in the rest of the world the complexity of water related problems in india is escalating due to the increase demand of water and the objectives to be fulfilled continue to expand gain and giupponi 2015 nune et al 2014 smakhtin and anputhas 2006 therefore the complexity of the management solutions required is also aggravating to achieve this delicate balance watershed models are desirable which can use indicators of sustainability to guide the decision making process therefore modeling the hydrology of the basin is critical as these models can offer a dynamic framework for watershed analyses of water movement and provide reliable information on the behavior of the system for estimation planning and management of current and future water resources abbaspour et al 2015 adeogun et al 2014 shawul et al 2013 the simulation of credible flows for grb is essential not only to manage the available water resources of the basin but also to have a better knowledge of impact of possible future changes on availability of water water yields and overall water balance of a watershed can be simulated through watershed models hydrological models are necessary for studying hydrologic processes and their responses to both endogenous and human factors but due to complexity in the exemplification of complex natural conditions and processes models must be calibrated prior to its application to attain a realistic match fukunaga et al 2015 futter et al 2015 sahoo et al 2006 the models play an important role in decision making as they are often used for the purpose of choosing an optimal option of action johnston and smakhtin 2014 thompson et al 2004 in recent years large scale hydrological models paved the way for modeler s community to tradeoff the disparity between natural and anthropogenic activities that influence river basin braud et al 2013 fletcher et al 2013 these numerical models have been effectively modified and employed in different circumstances to give a powerful and useful device for the administration of river basin hydrological models coupled with geographical information system gis have enhanced the application of hydrological models in numerous fields overton 2005 paiva et al 2011 however physically distributed hydrologic models incorporate parameters which are directly related to the physical characteristics of catchment topography land use types and soil types and spatial variations in the catchment among numerous physical based hydrological models soil and water assessment tool swat developed by the u s department of agriculture usda has been highly recognized and utilized as one of the most promising and computationally efficient model to simulate involved hydrology within a watershed arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2002 in recent years the swat has been widely used in many countries meaurio et al 2015 rahman et al 2013 wang et al 2014 and has been extensively tested for hydrologic simulation at different spatial scales to investigate management strategies on watershed hydrologic and water quality response debele et al 2010 fontaine et al 2002 santhi et al 2001 shawul et al 2013 however fewer efforts have been made to the use of swat or any other hydrological model in the highly complex grb gosain et al 2006 employed swat model to compute the spatial temporal availability of water in the river system and assessed basin water balance by using the hadley centre regional climate model hadrm2 daily weather data as an input however the effects of infrastructure development and water abstractions and uses were not incorporated in the study in addition the model was not validated due to non availability of utilization data thus making the model less reliable similarly de condappa et al 2009 developed the water evaluation and planning weap model to assess surface water resources in grb with a particular emphasis on the contribution of snow on surface runoff yohe and strzepek 2007 applied watbal monthly time step model to grb while o keeffe et al 2012 applied swat to upper grb to simulate water balances and generate the flows that were likely to have existed prior to any infrastructure projects in the upper ganga basin mishra and lilhare 2016 calibrated and evaluated the ganga river basin using the swat model against the observed streamflow only at the farakka gauge stations without considering the influence of irrigation and the presence of water storage structures high altitude catchment where the snowfall and snowmelt is a dominant factor in the water cycle coupled with relatively flat area makes this region different from that in other parts of the world the simulation of surface runoff in mountainous catchment is challenging as it involves irregular terrain and highly complex hydrological processes as snow and glacier melt runoff is the major contributor to annual surface runoff abudu et al 2012 cao et al 2006 fontaine et al 2002 the higher degree of complexity and spatial variability coupled with variation of precipitation and temperature with elevation makes estimation of model parameters even more challenging whitehead et al 2015 investigated the impact of climate change on the quantity and quality of the ganga river system however in the study model was calibrated and assessed only for the upper reaches of the ganga and not for the entire basin besides effective application of physically based models there are numerous issues that question the output of the model such as uncertainty in input parameters nonlinear relationships between hydrologic response and hydrologic input features and the approaches considered for calibration of numerous model parameters boyle et al 2000 refsgaard 1997 the determination of the appropriate values of model parameters is done by trial and error process where important parameters are altered to accomplish the desired result cao et al 2006 santhi et al 2001 schuol and abbaspour 2006 manual approach of calibration is tedious time taking and requires experience muleta and nicklow 2005 furthermore manual calibration approach does involve comprehensive efforts to become acquainted with the response of model with change in parameters and to recognize the nature of parameters interaction within the considered area on the other hand auto calibration is more time saving and has a more objective approach shawul et al 2013 while the auto calibration approach involves only quantitative comparison the manual approach involves both quantitative as well as qualitative comparisons liew et al 2005 shrestha et al 2011 suggested that manual calibration approach makes the use of modeler s knowledge and experience and should be adopted however the manual calibration approach despite involving comprehensive efforts offers a safe alternative to compare and reduce the difference between the observed and simulated values as it involves systematic approach to control mass balance and examination of surface runoff using hydrographs liew et al 2005 therefore even though swat has an auto calibration option a manual approach has been employed to calibrate the model as it allows to do a site specific calibration and allows the swat model with a chance to replicate as much as possible the hydrological processes occurring within the study area and to develop a reliable framework for further research endeavors in this area the most evident indication of hydrologic change within a catchment is from the trend of surface runoff which characterizes an integrated response to heterogeneity of the catchment and spatial variability of different hydrological components such as rainfall evapotranspiration and base flows and can prove to be an important indicator which can provide with an insight into long term changes caused by both exogenous climate changes as well as endogenous anthropogenic effects lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 panda et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 different studies have attempted to describe observed trends in streamflow as for changes in climate and anthropogenic exercises nune et al 2014 schreider et al 2002 abeysingha et al 2016 investigated trends in observed surface runoff and their linkage with precipitation and anthropogenic factors furthermore spatial and or direction of trends will be useful for water resources planners managers and stakeholders for devising better management options and adaptive plans to deal with adverse scenarios hamed 2008 kahya and kalaycı 2004 nune et al 2014 thus it is evident from the extensive review of the literatures that the studies on assessment of hydrological models for watershed simulations are very much limited in the grb thus reasonable assessment of surface runoff is essential for developing better management plans for the grb against this background the primary aim of this study is to understand the complex interrelationships between topography soil layer land use distribution and climate with respect to the hydrologic response of the watershed by employing a physically based distributed rainfall runoff swat model for simulation of surface runoff in grb in india first swat model has been manually calibrated and validated at multiple sites in the grb second different hydrologic components mainly water yield for the grb and its tributaries have been assessed in addition a diagnostic approach is followed by adopting different statistical tests to investigate whether the water balance has changed over the study region in this research the variation in the surface runoff and different hydrological components is illustrated for two different scenarios viz present and virgin condition to showcase that change in water balance from its pristine state consequently the aim of this study is the development of a methodology using the swat model for the evaluation of spatially and temporally explicit water balance in order to assess the sustainability of the actual water use in grb thereby acknowledging the knowledge gap and thus providing additional support to accomplish watershed management objectives 2 study area the swat model was applied to the 1 08 mkm2 ganga river basin upto farraka that flows into bay of bengal the ganga river basin is situated in the northern part of the country encompassed within the latitudes of 22 30 and 31 30 north and the longitude of 73 30 and 89 00 east fig 1 the basin is a trans boundary basin and lies in india nepal china and bangladesh the area of the river basin in india is 0 86 mkm2 which is nearly 26 percent of total geographic area of the country the ganga river originates as bhagirathi at an elevation of about 7000 m and travels a distance of nearly 2520 km before falling into the bay of bengal throughout its traverse a number of tributaries join the river on both sides of the banks the principal tributaries joining the river are the yamuna the ramganga the ghaghra the gandak the kosi the mahananda and the sone chambal and betwa are the two important sub tributaries of the yamuna river the principal source of water in river is on account of direct surface runoff generated by precipitation return flow base flow and snowmelt water emerging from himalayas the grb understandably does not receive uniform rainfall throughout its region the amount of rainfall received by the basin not only changes throughout the region it is also limited to only few months of the year mainly during monsoon months of june through october thus causing low flow conditions in the ganga as well as its tributaries during the dry periods of november through may the average annual rainfall in the grb varies from 350 mm at the western end to 2000 mm near the delta at the eastern part the drainage area fig 1 of this basin is constituted of many sub basins namely 1 the yamuna river passing through the states of uttarakhand himachal pradesh haryana and uttar pradesh and delhi its main tributaries are tons and chambal followed by sindh the betwa and ken which drain parts of rajasthan and madhya pradesh states 2 the gomti river passing through the uttar pradesh 3 the ghaghara river which originates from tibetan plateau and crosses nepal before passing through uttar pradesh and bihar it is the largest tributary of the ganga by volume of water contributed 4 the gandak river passing through nepal and uttar pradesh and bihar 5 the kosi river passing through nepal and bihar 6 the son river passing through madhya pradesh uttar pradesh jharkhand and bihar 7 the punpun river passing through jharkhand and bihar 8 the damodar river passing through west bengal and jharkhand 3 methodology 3 1 the hydrologic simulator swat swat was developed by the united states department of agriculture usda to predict the impact of land management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large un gauged basins arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2002 the swat model is a continuous time model that operates on a daily time step with option of monthly or annual output the model operates by dividing a catchment into sub catchments and each sub catchment is further divided into hydrological response units hrus the hru is a unique combination of soil and vegetation types within the sub catchment and serves as the basic computational unit for flow accumulation the simulation of hydrological cycle by swat is based on the water balance equation as in eq 1 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r i q i e t i g i b i where sw t mm is the final soil water content sw 0 mm is the initial soil water content on day i t days is time r i mm is the precipitation amount on day i q i mm is the amount of surface runoff on day i et i mm is the evapotranspiration et amount on day i g i mm is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i and b i mm is the amount of return flow on day i swat has inbuilt snow module to capture and simulate snowmelt hydrology permitting the delimitation of up to ten elevation bands with associated precipitation and temperature lapse rates fontaine et al 2002 grusson et al 2015 neitsch et al 2011 qi et al 2016 rahman et al 2013 to determine the water budget swat characterizes liquid and solid rainfall based on temperature of air near surface furthermore in swat snowpack snowfall and snowmelt events are always estimated by the model as soon as the temperature drops below the threshold of stipulated snowfall temperature swat also enables these processes to be spatially distinguished as a function of elevation that allows users to add lapse rate for both precipitation plaps in mm h2o km yr and temperature tlaps in c km which is very essential in the study region considered in this study sub basin has been divided into ten elevation bands 3 2 input data collection and processing model inputs required to run swat include the digital elevation model dem land use soil and weather data the arc gis interface of the swat model was used to discretize the catchment area and extract the input files to be used in swat the 90 m resolution topography data used for this study was extracted from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm the dem fig 2 a was used to delineate the basin and to provide topographical parameters such as overland slope stream network and slope length for each catchment of the basin drainage network generated using dem derived from srtm data might contain few errors to overcome this burning of stream network option available in swat model has been employed in which a stream network can be superimposed onto the dem that forces the alignment of stream the burning option allows forcing of streams to follow a certain path in the present study the drainage network from hydroshed http hydrosheds cr usgs gov was used for this purpose land use land cover is another important segment of data that is essential for hydrological simulation of the basin the merged landuse and irrigation source maps from nrsc and iwmi as shown in fig 2 b has been used for the present study iwmi derived the ganges river basin irrigated area product using modis 500 m and avhrr 10 km satellite sensor data merged with nrsc landuse landcover map of 2007 2008 to derive a new land cover map with agriculture landuse as well as corresponding sources of irrigation information on the soil profile is also required for simulating the hydrological character of the basin digitized soil map from nbsslup merged with the fao global soil map has been used for the modeling the soil map is shown in fig 2 c the daily reanalysis and re gridded weather data from imd rainfall temperature has been used daily rainfall data are at a resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 latitude by longitude grid points whereas temperature data are at 0 5 x 0 5 resolution in the absence of other daily weather data on relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation that are important parameters long term statistics have been used to generate data for these weather parameters for the basin the entire catchment area of ganga river basin was delineated and discretized into 1045 catchments fig 2 d which in turn have a total of 20627 hydrological response units hru division of catchments into areas having unique land use soil and slope combinations makes it possible to account for differences in evapotranspiration and other hydrological conditions for different land covers soils and slopes arnold et al 1998 setegn et al 2008 3 3 model assumptions and options selection for application precipitation data is an important component for the hydrological model that drives surface runoff and mass balance of the hydrologic systems the spatial variability of precipitation and the accuracy of the precipitation input are critical to the use of hydrological models cao et al 2006 in a mountainous basin such as ganga river basin rainfall and temperature varies with change in elevation rahman et al 2013 tahir et al 2011 with an increase in elevation the temperature reduces and is also highly affected by the aspect and topographic shading while precipitation generally increase with an increase in elevation and so does the portion of precipitation that precipitates as snow or rainfall abbaspour et al 2007 lu et al 2010 thanapakpawin et al 2007 in the absence of precipitation data availability for higher elevation areas elevation corrections were applied for rainfall and temperature stations available at lower elevations to simulate snow hydrology the swat model is capable of using elevation bands to adjust the rainfall and temperature as the altitude changes gassman et al 2007 narula and gosain 2013 the basin area with the elevations ranging from 2000 m to 8000 m is divided into ten elevation bands to account for the variation in precipitation and temperature effectively a value of 3 to 6 5 c km increase was used as temperature lapse rate and 100 250 mm km based on rigorous calibration was used as precipitation lapse rate for those sub basins where the elevation bands were incorporated secondary information on canal command areas irrigation sources and district crop production were used to represent and incorporate current crop management practices for crop simulation in the swat model in the present study out of the several options available in swat run off curve number method was employed to estimate surface runoff the penman monteith method for estimating potential evapotranspiration and the variable storage method to simulate channel water routing out of the total period of 28 years 1985 2013 of historical available data 5 years period 1985 89 was used as model warm up period 1990 2004 as calibration period and 2004 2013 as validation period swat model results were compared with the data from different gauge stations provided by central water commission using statistical parameters commonly used in hydrological modeling studies namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 fig 3 shows the locations where calibration and validation has been performed 3 4 statistical analysis regulated catchment such as ganga river basin has undergone major alterations in streamflow moreover there is a growing conflict due to transfer of water between different states and sharing of water between agriculture and industries in the catchment the study of temporal changes to streamflow within a catchment is crucial for water managers and policy makers for the development of successful water policies since surface runoff is of utmost importance for all human activities birsan et al 2014 goyal 2014 zhang et al 2015 gosain et al 2006 in their study has already predicted a reduction in surface runoff for the non gangeatic rivers however streamflow trends and their relationship with the anthropogenic effects as well as climatic variables have not been scientifically examined for ganga river basin therefore a trend test is performed on the hydrological streamflow as well as meteorological precipitation data to assess the ongoing trends and variability in streamflow and precipitation for ganga river basin change in hydrological variables can be considered as an important indicator to take note of and analyze impact of anthropogenic and climate change in this study six statistical tests have been adopted to have more confidence on the existence of trend and change in hydrological data streamflow simulated by swat model are used in this study trend of surface runoff in this study was tested using widely used trend detection methodologies namely mann kendall mk test student s t test and spearman s rho test cumulative deviation test worsley likelihood ratio test and cusum test abeysingha et al 2016 goyal 2014 kahya and kalaycı 2004 yeh et al 2015 zhang et al 2001 brief descriptions of the above mentioned tests are concisely explained in the supplementary material 4 results and discussion the following section describes the performance of swat model to mimic the hydrology of the catchment followed by the system wise assessment analysis of available trend in runoff and difference in surface runoff from its original condition derived from virgin scenario 4 1 model calibration the initial setup of swat model using default parameters was not able to simulate the surface runoff at all the gauge stations correctly as the peak discharge and base flow were underestimated in snow dominant area while in the non perennial region high flows were overestimated and base flows were underestimated therefore the calibration of parameters was needed to exactly simulate the surface runoff swat model developed for ganga river basin is calibrated manually by following a systematic approach neitsch et al 2002 at first upstream gauge is calibrated and the parameters corresponding to that gauge site are kept constant while the parameters of the sub basins between upstream gauge and the next downstream gauge site is calibrated the same approach was repeated for the next downstream stations till we reach the outlet of the catchment farakka various swat parameters that were employed for calibration purpose namely snow parameters smfmx smtmp smfmn sftmp elevation band parameters plaps tlaps and hydrological parameters cn2 sol awc esco gw delay and gw revap arnold et al 2013 neitsch et al 2002 4 2 evaluation of the runoff simulation the comparison of observed and simulated surface runoff on monthly basis for a calibration period from 1990 2004 displayed very good results at all the gauge stations the model once calibrated was then simulated from 2005 to 2010 for validation for perennial rivers like ganga yamuna ghaghara gandak and kosi simulated runoff was generally higher than the corresponding observed values for the same period the base flow primarily attributed to the return flow and snowmelt has been captured quite well by the model for all the river systems the analysis of the most commonly used hydrological statistical parameters performance measures i e nse rsr r2 and pbias for calibration period at various locations for each sub basin has been done the statistical parameters to depict model performance fall in very good category with nse 0 75 and r2 0 85 at all the stream flow stations the analysis of statistical parameters reveals that the swat model was able to capture the intrinsic nature of catchment in terms of surface runoff very precisely the high values of nse and r2 explain that the model has been able to capture high flows while the low values of pbias shows that the low flows pertaining mostly to the snowmelt has also been simulated quiet well by the model a synoptic representation of the performance of nse rsr and pbias at each of the gauge stations considered for the calibration and validation of the basin is shown in fig 4 for the non perennial rivers like chambal sindh tons and son the model was able to capture the high flows quite well with large extent of areas under irrigation it is expected that a large amount of water would come back to the river as return flow swat performed reasonably well in capturing these low base flows in the basin the high values of nse 0 70 and r2 0 8 clearly indicate that the model performed quiet well in the parts of chambal sindh tons and son of the catchment too fig 5 further comparison of distribution of average monthly surface runoff at the basin outlet farakka discharge site has been made fig 6 and fig s1 in supplementary material the results at farakka site show an appreciable match between average annual monthly observed discharge and swat simulated discharge so it may be concluded that the swat model has simulated the basin adequately it can be noted that the snowmelt is major contributor for the surface runoff during non monsoon season and the rainfall does not have the solitary effect on the total runoff during the melt period however the contribution of rain varies because of spatial and temporal variation the comparison of mean monthly simulated discharge at the joshimath gauge station which is predominantly snow fed in nature showed that the monthly flow during the months of february march and april is comparable with the observed discharge during these months fig 6 b and fig s2 in supplementary material swat model has the ability to simulate different components of water yield it was therefore possible to compute the contribution of precipitation and snow and glacier melt in the total water yield at the gauging site explained in the supplementary material the analysis of the simulation suggests that the most of the runoff is generated by precipitation the long term monthly contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to total surface runoff at joshimath gauge station is shown in fig 7 a while fig 7 b shows the average percentage contribution to the total water yield during different months for various parts of basin from the snowmelt the contribution to the surface runoff from snowmelt increases from february to may and from june onwards the contribution from snowmelt decreases fig 7 a b bookhagen and burbank 2010 also obtained similar results indicating that large amount of water is stored as snow in the high elevation and western region and their release does not happen until several months later in the pre and early monsoon season furthermore the maximum contribution to the water yield from rainfall is observed in august with very little contribution from snowmelt fig 7 a b the long term averages of annual surface runoff for the period between 1979 and 2013 has been developed for the catchment at the farakka discharge site which is the outlet of the ganga river basin the analysis of annual stream flow reveals that the years having annual stream flow greater than the average 18 and smaller than the average 17 is approximately same a wet or dry year can act as an indication of several different phenomenon such as precipitation surface runoff etc pinkayan 1966 fig 8 shows wet years along with dry years water balance is an important component in swat model as it involves all the processes and their corresponding impact on the growth of plants within the watershed area fletcher et al 2013 shawul et al 2013 therefore to tackle the water management issues it is essential to analyze and quantify the different hydrologic components occurring inside the basin the assessment of variation in these hydrologic components at both spatial and temporal level is instrumental in formulation of strategies by water planners and stakeholders involved adeogun et al 2014 stated that the rainfall surface runoff base flow lateral flow and evapotranspiration are the important elements of water balance in a catchment except rainfall all the aforementioned elements need proper assessment with the help of modeling tool as the quantification of these components are not easy therefore swat model has an important role in quantifying these hydrologic components within the study area analysis of results for an entire ganga river basin fig 9 show that water yield has the maximum share of water balance with approximately 51 percent 601 6 mm annually of total precipitation 1167 5 mm with evapotranspiration having the next highest share 496 5 mm followed by groundwater recharge 274 8 mm the comparison of hydrologic components for monsoon june july august and september and non monsoon season october november and december has also been done the results show that most of the precipitation 975 mm occurs in monsoon season while non monsoon season experience a comparatively meager rainfall of 65 9 mm fig 9 furthermore the water yield 87 2 mm obtained during non monsoon season is higher than the rainfall 65 9 mm during the corresponding period which is owed to the high amount of return flow 60 8 mm happening inside the catchment because of large amount of areas under irrigation fig 9 fig 10 show the temporal seasonal as well as spatial variation of different hydrologic components within the basin the precipitation varies both spatially and temporally fig 10 the average annual rainfall for the entire basin is about 1168 mm the general spatial trend is that rainfall increases from west to east of the ganga river basin the major part of the rainfall occurs during monsoon months of june july august and september and ranges from 225 mm to 3045 mm in these 4 months fig 10 winter rain october november and december ranges from 7 mm to 415 mm fig 10 swat model has the ability to compute the water yield for each sub basin which is defined as the total amount of water that leaves each of the hrus of the sub basin and enter the main river channel during the time step considered arnold et al 2013 water yield is an important parameter which need to be assessed for the proper management and planning of the watershed the contributions of each of the sub basin areas to water yield for both monsoon as well as non monsoon season have been presented in fig 10 the assessment of water yield contribution for different sub basins during monsoon and non monsoon season reveal that on an average 70 percent of the water yield is contributed during monsoon season as can be seen in fig 10 contribution of sub catchment to water yield has been diverse with maximum contribution of 4505 mm from a sub basin dominated by glacier and snow with almost 65 percent of this contribution 2900 mm being made during monsoon season however the minimum contribution of a sub basin to the water yield is less than 50 mm showing the huge variation within the study area as we noted water yield also varies substantially between the monsoon and non monsoon season with approximately 75 of water yield coming during the monsoon season with range from 50 mm to more than 3000 mm and much smaller portion coming during non monsoon period with range from 5 mm to 600 mm fig 10 in addition precipitation water yield and evapotranspiration were found to be higher in the forested and mountainous and comparably unexploited upper areas fig 10 however as we move downstream or towards non perennial system dominated by agriculture and highly irrigated areas value of evapotranspiration increases a total of 653 billion cubic meter bcm average annual of water was estimated by the swat model as the potential water yield of the ganga river basin between the simulation periods of 1990 2013 further examination of results reveal that the ghaghra river system and gandak river system have made the largest contribution to the water yield in the catchment while chambal and sindh river systems have the lowest contribution in the total water yield the long term monthly averages of surface runoff for the basin has also been developed and analyzed the monthly mean precipitation of 308 3 mm and 307 9 mm is associated to july and august respectively and a minimum of 8 1 mm to november fig 11 furthermore mean monthly water yield has the maximum of 159 8 mm during the month of august fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that during monsoon months of june through september the rainfall is higher than the evapotranspiration requirement and able to meet most of the crop water requirements however during non monsoon months the evapotranspiration is higher than rainfall fig 11 suggesting that required additional water has been either diverted through storage or shallow deep aquifer withdrawal or provided by the soil moisture to meet the crop production demand the assessment of water balance for each of the systems shows similar characteristics with water yield having the maximum share followed by the evapotranspiration 4 3 trend analysis the rank based non parametric test namely mann kendall statistical test the spearman s rho sr test and student s t test are used to analyze trends in surface runoff simulated by calibrated and validated swat model the catchment exhibits dominant trends in most of the regions fig 12 with 65 stations out of 67 stations showing significant trend in annual surface runoff the yamuna river basin represents the northwestern part of the ganga river basin the yamuna river basin has an annual total precipitation of 900 mm a total of 5 gauge stations out of 7 gauge stations in this sub basin had significant downward trend in annual stream flow suggesting a reduction in the annual mean surface runoff fig 12 two gauge stations in the upstream of the sub basin namely yashwant nagar and tuini showed no trend and were exception to the dominant downward annual trend along with mann kendall spearman s rho test student s t test and rank sum test was also used to evaluate whether the trend of surface runoff changed during the period the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff during the periods prior to 1980 and post 1980 periods in order to determine the year of change cusum cumulative deviation and worsley likelihood test were employed the result of change point detection using the above mentioned tests have been shown in table s1 the change points were consistent with each other in all the three tests the overall mean z static value for the rainfall is 0 7 showing that the rainfall doesn t show any significant trend rai et al 2012 also obtained that annual rainfall and monsoon rainfall values show an overall declining trend the trend between observed rainfall and simulated surface runoff might not be opposite in this basin but huge difference between the overall mean z static value for the observed rainfall 0 7 and stream flow 3 066 suggest that the anthropogenic changes within the catchment overall dominate over the exogenous changes anthropogenic activities such as water diversion through canals mostly at tajewala barrage water consumption land use and land cover changes new dam construction and city expansion new delhi result in significant alteration in the surface runoff hence all of the above mentioned factors might have resulted in subsequent increased water withdrawal thus causing a significant decreasing trend of streamflow especially in downstream areas of the basin the upper ganga sub basin is mostly snow fed and glacier dominated a total of 11 stream gauge stations were analyzed of which 4 stations namely uttarkashi rudraprayag joshimath and rishikesh had significant increasing trend while decreasing trend of streamflow at other 7 stream gauge stations in the downstream areas of the river sub basin is observed fig 12 in order to determine year of change cusum cumulative deviation and worsley likelihood tests were employed the result of change point detection using the above mentioned tests have been shown in table s1 the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff during the periods prior to 1970 and post 1970 periods increase in the surface as well as groundwater use to meet the industrial and domestic demands for many cities developed alongside the river such as kanpur along with increase in the irrigated area in the sub basin coupled with raising crops such as sugarcane which demand large amount of water throughout the year has substantially increased water withdrawal thus causing a significant decreasing trend of stream flow in the downstream part of the sub basin the watershed region adjacent to upper ganga basin is gomti river sub basin significant downward trend in annual streamflow dominant in this region has also been observed at streamgages namely lukhnow sultanpur jaunpur maighat and raibareily with a single exception neemsar in the upstream part of the basin had significant increasing trend in annual streamflow fig 12 the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff during the periods prior to 1980 and post 1980 periods table s1 abeysingha et al 2016 also obtained significant decreasing trends for the surface runoff of the gomti river basin may be partly caused by the variations in the rainfall and partly by anthropogenic activities stream gauges in the ghaghra gandak and kosi sub basins were also examined for statistically significant trends in annual streamflow significant increasing trends are prevalent in all these sub basins a total of fifteen stream gauge stations in these sub basins have been examined fig 12 the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff during the periods prior to 1990 and post 1990 periods table s1 the trend analysis of streamflow in chambal sindh betwa ken tons and son sub basins show a significant downward trend with a single exception of maner station in the downstream part of son sub basin that has significant increasing trend in the annual streamflow a total of 24 stations have shown significant decreasing trend in annual streamflow fig 12 the decreasing trend in the rainfall coupled with increasing anthropogenic activities have resulted in decreasing trend of streamflow in these sub basins cusum cumulative deviation and worsley likelihood test are used to determine the year of change at the same time the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff between the two time periods table s1 based on the trend analysis this study provides a strong indication that both climate change and anthropogenic influences have altered the water balance in the ganga river basin it is well known that climate change can alter the hydrologic systems especially glacier and snow melt thus the increase in snow and glacier melt process cause an increase in the annual surface runoff as a result an increasing trend in surface runoff is observed fig 12 whereas rapid increase of settlement area increased irrigation etc in downstream areas and non perennial regions have shown decreasing trend fig 12 4 4 virgin scenario the ganga river basin today proposes substantial water resources development through new projects therefore it is pertinent to evaluate the hydrological health of the basin before imposing any additional stress on the already stressed system thus it is important to understand the situation of the ganga river basin in its pristine state such simulation of ganga river basin during its pristine state is also essential to determine the reference hydrology against which alterations in the surface runoff and other hydrological components in the basin can be measured the analysis of the ganga river basin in its pristine state would help in understanding the extent to which the basin has been already exploited and also give an insight to viable options that can be formulated to restore the basin close to its initial state the developed swat model provides the opportunity to generate scenario that can help in understanding the water resources availability under the virgin or pre development condition therefore in order to develop virgin scenario it was assumed that there has been no irrigation happening within the catchment and all the projects such as reservoirs and canal diversions were removed from the calibrated swat model this scenario assumes that all the farming areas are rain fed the comparison of water balance between the virgin scenario and present scenario business as usual is shown in fig 13 for upper ganga basin yamuna basin chambal basin and sindh basin respectively the analysis of the virgin scenario and present scenario showed that on an average the present annual water yield is 25 30 35 and 35 lower than in the virgin condition for ganga basin upstream of allahabad yamuna basin up to agra chambal basin and sindh basin respectively fig 13 the degree of change in the water yield can be attributed to various land use effects primarily to irrigation requirements that needs to be met as agriculture is the primary activity in ganga basin and development of water resource structures to meet irrigation demands hydropower generation and flood controls it can be observed from fig 13 that there has been over exploitation of water happening in these basins the calculation has been done for the area in the downstream of the rishikesh which is a predominantly agricultural area and requires large amount of water to meet irrigation demand the deviations from the virgin water yield in the present scenario 200 mm is primarily on the account of the huge amount of irrigation happening in the area the comparison of evapotranspiration for the present and virgin condition shows that the present et is much higher than in the virgin scenario which can be attributed to the fact there has been huge amount of irrigation happening in the current scenario which we have assumed to be absent in the virgin scenario fig 13 however there has been an increase in the baseflow in the virgin condition than in the present condition and simultaneously there has been a decrease in the net groundwater recharge fig 13 which seems correct considering the fact that almost all the water infiltrating inside the soil layer would come to the river as baseflow since there is no abstraction happening from the groundwater flow duration curve fdc has been rigorously used in various hydrological studies namely water supply irrigation planning and hydropower river and reservoir studies and augmentation of low flows singh et al 2005 vogel and fennessey 1994 flow duration curve demonstrates variation in stream flow through a graphical representation of distribution of the flow regime brown et al 2005 remondi et al 2016 fdc s can be obtained by plotting surface runoff from the swat model or observed runoff at various gauge stations against various levels of dependability the flow is expected to be equaled or exceeded the analysis of fdc at rudraprayag and joshimath shows that the flow corresponding to 50 75 and 90 dependability is 656 3 448 6 and 370 5 m3 s and 206 135 5 and 109 5 m3 s respectively fig 14 fdc serves as an important tool for the assessment of water resource wealth that was actually available and changes that happened during the course of time and development fig 14 show fdcs for the present and virgin scenario at joshimath and rudraprayag gauge stations respectively the comparison of fdcs for the two scenarios are in line with the two stations showing no considerable change in surface runoff as there has been no considerable exploitation in terms of anthropogenic activities that have happened in these areas however as we move downstream and to the different tributaries of ganga river basin there is a remarkable reduction in flows during the present scenario as compared to the virgin scenario mainly due to the withdrawal of water for fulfilling both industrial and agricultural demand fig 15 show the difference in the flow rates between the present and virgin scenario for kanpur and farakka respectively in addition the comparison between fdc of present and virgin scenario show that the present maximum flow is 33 and 37 lower than in the virgin conditions at kanpur and farakka respectively as can be seen the difference in flow rates between the virgin and present scenario for 50 75 and 90 dependability is found to be 1393 5 748 8 and 718 8 m3 s respectively for the kanpur fig 15 and 11920 9184 and 5639 m3 s respectively for farakka fig 15 the difference in flow affects many future water resources development plans as most of the water resources related infrastructures and plans are reliant on the dependable flows similar trends in difference in surface runoff in present and virgin scenario are recorded for kalanaur mohana chatara and mirzapur fig s3 fig s4 fig s5 and fig s6 in supplementary material 5 conclusion this study illustrates a systematic procedure for the calibration and validation of a physically semi distributed hydrological model swat for a mountainous as well as flat perennial as well as non perennial tributaries of ganga river basin the spatial and temporal variation of rainfall coupled with various landuse and soil types introduced heterogeneity in estimation of parameters for stream flow simulation the analysis of simulation obtained by the swat model indicates that the developed surface water model for the ganga river basin is able to simulate the actual surface water prevailing in the basin reasonably well furthermore most of the himalayan rivers receive flow both from snow and glacial melt as well as rain analysis of model simulations with quantification of snowmelt for the snow dominant himalayan basins suggest that the model is able to capture the snowmelt dynamics prevailing in the basin thus the developed swat model is able to mimic the physical characteristics of the system and can be used for watershed management and planning by developing different scenarios representing various policies for the surface water management for the basin manual calibration approach considering multiple parameters and multiple sites was used to develop swat model for the ganga river basin refsgaard 1997 stated that the calibration of a distributed model is a never ending story hence there is always a room for improvement of the simulated results manual calibration helps in better understanding of the model as well as in recognizing the important processes within the watershed and identifying parameters that are restricted only to a particular condition in a basin it would therefore be reasonable to suggest that the multi site manual approach of calibration and validation as used in the study result in determining more realistic parameter values across the hydrologic processes as well as geographic areas ganga river along with its tributaries irrigate large tracts of land growing wheat rice and sugarcane and support a large number of industries and human population the trend detection on the streamflow of ganga river basin along with its tributaries has showed that there is drying tendency of surface runoff in most of the tributaries especially in highly populated and irrigated areas however the overall trend for ganga river basin at the outlet farakka is increasing the study indicated that both endogenous activities as well as exogenous changes are responsible for the decreasing trends in the streamflow the ever increasing population large amount of irrigation and industrial demands are among the anthropogenic factors that are responsible for increasing withdrawals of water from the basin the study also attempts to analyze the impacts of water resource development projects and anthropogenic activities on the various hydrologic components especially surface runoff in the entire ganga river basin by comparing stream flow changes under virgin and present scenarios the analysis shows that in the upstream portions which are unexploited annual flows remain same for both the virgin and present scenario but as we move towards downstream portion of the basin there is a marked gap between the stream flows under virgin and present scenario therefore construction of various dams and reservoirs coupled with various domestic and industrial demands have resulted in the reduction of stream flows also the study developed fdcs for the two scenarios and the results suggest that there has been reduction in dependable flows at most of the gauge stations this study should be regarded as a first step towards developing a model necessary for basin development and planning although much work still needs to be done on model verification moreover this study involves the assessment of water that is really accessible for all uses and development and should be considered as a starting point in sustainable basin management the present study did not incorporate climate change factors and water quality aspect of the ganga river basin but shall be taken up as part of the future scope the capabilities of swat model that facilitate extensive use of swat model also characterizes limitations there are also problems in portraying some processes perfectly due to the absence of ample observation data inadequate data desired to depict input parameters or lacking of technical understanding furthermore another key weakness of the model is the non spatial aspect of the hrus at the same time significant requirement of data has been deemed as one of the major shortcomings of swat modeling absence of precipitation data for higher elevation and inadequate glacier and snow information is the major limitations of the manuscript another limitation of it is that it assumes constant land use throughout the simulations despite these limitations of swat model

8518,study region ganga river basin study focus the availability of freshwater has been recognized as a global issue and the reliable evaluation and quantification of it within the basin is necessary to bolster the sustainable management of water for this purpose a basin scale swat model of the ganga river basin has been developed new hydrologic insights for the region model validation showed that simulated results were consistent with the observed data in reproducing the seasonal dynamics of surface water and suggest that the model is capable of reproducing the hydrological features of the basin including the snow melt however there are large variations in both temporal and spatial distribution of the hydrological components statistical methods have been used for detecting trends and critical changes in streamflow it has been found that although the streamflow from the snow fed areas has increased the stream flow in the lower reaches and the non perennial tributaries have declined significantly this decline can be attributed to both anthropogenic and exogenous changes the study also establishes that there has been a substantial reduction in overall water resources availability with respect to virgin this information sets the yardstick to the restoration of the hydrological and environmental health of the basin and can lead to better management of water resources under scarcity keywords surface water modeling swat ganga river basin hydrologic modeling trend test 1 introduction the ganga river basin grb is one of the most populous river systems in the world the river is of high importance with an estimated 440 million people directly or indirectly depending on the water that the ganga and its tributaries provide for agriculture drinking hydropower generation and navigation and for ecosystem services the perpetual population increase and consequent water resources development has affected the river s flow regime which in turn has impacted the water availability quality of water and thus riverine ecosystems the availability of water has become an intriguing issue for irrigation systems food security and ecosystem health the consistent water supply from the grb is of paramount importance for the sustainability of highly dependent agricultural population of india sadoff et al 2013 seidel et al 2000 sustainable water management in an irrigation dominated catchment endeavors to warrant a long term adaptable and stable water supply to accomplish crop water demands in addition to raising industrial and municipal water demands while alleviating deleterious environmental consequences integral to any effective water resource management is the quantification of the natural availability of water within a catchment area to achieve sustainable management of available water resources for a catchment it is essential to understand hydrology of the river catchment understanding watershed hydrology and the hydrologic processes involved is critical as it is vital for reliable assessments of water quantity and quality as a result of rapid urbanization and other land use changes happening within the developed watershed the assessment of water yield and overall water balance in a watershed is a primary requirement and has been extensively adopted for the unequivocal management of catchment abbaspour et al 2015 adeogun et al 2014 malagò et al 2016 accurate and timely forecasts of river runoff have the prowess of providing critical information for agriculture optimization water resource management and disaster mitigation johnston and smakhtin 2014 nishat and rahman 2009 rees et al 2004 hence it is important to consider the various land surface processes of the targeted basin to understand the issues of water resources management meticulously anthropogenic activities such as river regulations have substantially changed the water balance of the natural catchment for this purpose the researchers are inclined to conduct the studies by employing a modeling approach to better understand complex watershed processes and their interactions with topography land use management soils and climate to get key water balance components such as surface runoff groundwater and evapotranspiration et kumar et al 2016 magilligan and nislow 2005 miller et al 2014 as in the rest of the world the complexity of water related problems in india is escalating due to the increase demand of water and the objectives to be fulfilled continue to expand gain and giupponi 2015 nune et al 2014 smakhtin and anputhas 2006 therefore the complexity of the management solutions required is also aggravating to achieve this delicate balance watershed models are desirable which can use indicators of sustainability to guide the decision making process therefore modeling the hydrology of the basin is critical as these models can offer a dynamic framework for watershed analyses of water movement and provide reliable information on the behavior of the system for estimation planning and management of current and future water resources abbaspour et al 2015 adeogun et al 2014 shawul et al 2013 the simulation of credible flows for grb is essential not only to manage the available water resources of the basin but also to have a better knowledge of impact of possible future changes on availability of water water yields and overall water balance of a watershed can be simulated through watershed models hydrological models are necessary for studying hydrologic processes and their responses to both endogenous and human factors but due to complexity in the exemplification of complex natural conditions and processes models must be calibrated prior to its application to attain a realistic match fukunaga et al 2015 futter et al 2015 sahoo et al 2006 the models play an important role in decision making as they are often used for the purpose of choosing an optimal option of action johnston and smakhtin 2014 thompson et al 2004 in recent years large scale hydrological models paved the way for modeler s community to tradeoff the disparity between natural and anthropogenic activities that influence river basin braud et al 2013 fletcher et al 2013 these numerical models have been effectively modified and employed in different circumstances to give a powerful and useful device for the administration of river basin hydrological models coupled with geographical information system gis have enhanced the application of hydrological models in numerous fields overton 2005 paiva et al 2011 however physically distributed hydrologic models incorporate parameters which are directly related to the physical characteristics of catchment topography land use types and soil types and spatial variations in the catchment among numerous physical based hydrological models soil and water assessment tool swat developed by the u s department of agriculture usda has been highly recognized and utilized as one of the most promising and computationally efficient model to simulate involved hydrology within a watershed arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2002 in recent years the swat has been widely used in many countries meaurio et al 2015 rahman et al 2013 wang et al 2014 and has been extensively tested for hydrologic simulation at different spatial scales to investigate management strategies on watershed hydrologic and water quality response debele et al 2010 fontaine et al 2002 santhi et al 2001 shawul et al 2013 however fewer efforts have been made to the use of swat or any other hydrological model in the highly complex grb gosain et al 2006 employed swat model to compute the spatial temporal availability of water in the river system and assessed basin water balance by using the hadley centre regional climate model hadrm2 daily weather data as an input however the effects of infrastructure development and water abstractions and uses were not incorporated in the study in addition the model was not validated due to non availability of utilization data thus making the model less reliable similarly de condappa et al 2009 developed the water evaluation and planning weap model to assess surface water resources in grb with a particular emphasis on the contribution of snow on surface runoff yohe and strzepek 2007 applied watbal monthly time step model to grb while o keeffe et al 2012 applied swat to upper grb to simulate water balances and generate the flows that were likely to have existed prior to any infrastructure projects in the upper ganga basin mishra and lilhare 2016 calibrated and evaluated the ganga river basin using the swat model against the observed streamflow only at the farakka gauge stations without considering the influence of irrigation and the presence of water storage structures high altitude catchment where the snowfall and snowmelt is a dominant factor in the water cycle coupled with relatively flat area makes this region different from that in other parts of the world the simulation of surface runoff in mountainous catchment is challenging as it involves irregular terrain and highly complex hydrological processes as snow and glacier melt runoff is the major contributor to annual surface runoff abudu et al 2012 cao et al 2006 fontaine et al 2002 the higher degree of complexity and spatial variability coupled with variation of precipitation and temperature with elevation makes estimation of model parameters even more challenging whitehead et al 2015 investigated the impact of climate change on the quantity and quality of the ganga river system however in the study model was calibrated and assessed only for the upper reaches of the ganga and not for the entire basin besides effective application of physically based models there are numerous issues that question the output of the model such as uncertainty in input parameters nonlinear relationships between hydrologic response and hydrologic input features and the approaches considered for calibration of numerous model parameters boyle et al 2000 refsgaard 1997 the determination of the appropriate values of model parameters is done by trial and error process where important parameters are altered to accomplish the desired result cao et al 2006 santhi et al 2001 schuol and abbaspour 2006 manual approach of calibration is tedious time taking and requires experience muleta and nicklow 2005 furthermore manual calibration approach does involve comprehensive efforts to become acquainted with the response of model with change in parameters and to recognize the nature of parameters interaction within the considered area on the other hand auto calibration is more time saving and has a more objective approach shawul et al 2013 while the auto calibration approach involves only quantitative comparison the manual approach involves both quantitative as well as qualitative comparisons liew et al 2005 shrestha et al 2011 suggested that manual calibration approach makes the use of modeler s knowledge and experience and should be adopted however the manual calibration approach despite involving comprehensive efforts offers a safe alternative to compare and reduce the difference between the observed and simulated values as it involves systematic approach to control mass balance and examination of surface runoff using hydrographs liew et al 2005 therefore even though swat has an auto calibration option a manual approach has been employed to calibrate the model as it allows to do a site specific calibration and allows the swat model with a chance to replicate as much as possible the hydrological processes occurring within the study area and to develop a reliable framework for further research endeavors in this area the most evident indication of hydrologic change within a catchment is from the trend of surface runoff which characterizes an integrated response to heterogeneity of the catchment and spatial variability of different hydrological components such as rainfall evapotranspiration and base flows and can prove to be an important indicator which can provide with an insight into long term changes caused by both exogenous climate changes as well as endogenous anthropogenic effects lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 panda et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 different studies have attempted to describe observed trends in streamflow as for changes in climate and anthropogenic exercises nune et al 2014 schreider et al 2002 abeysingha et al 2016 investigated trends in observed surface runoff and their linkage with precipitation and anthropogenic factors furthermore spatial and or direction of trends will be useful for water resources planners managers and stakeholders for devising better management options and adaptive plans to deal with adverse scenarios hamed 2008 kahya and kalaycı 2004 nune et al 2014 thus it is evident from the extensive review of the literatures that the studies on assessment of hydrological models for watershed simulations are very much limited in the grb thus reasonable assessment of surface runoff is essential for developing better management plans for the grb against this background the primary aim of this study is to understand the complex interrelationships between topography soil layer land use distribution and climate with respect to the hydrologic response of the watershed by employing a physically based distributed rainfall runoff swat model for simulation of surface runoff in grb in india first swat model has been manually calibrated and validated at multiple sites in the grb second different hydrologic components mainly water yield for the grb and its tributaries have been assessed in addition a diagnostic approach is followed by adopting different statistical tests to investigate whether the water balance has changed over the study region in this research the variation in the surface runoff and different hydrological components is illustrated for two different scenarios viz present and virgin condition to showcase that change in water balance from its pristine state consequently the aim of this study is the development of a methodology using the swat model for the evaluation of spatially and temporally explicit water balance in order to assess the sustainability of the actual water use in grb thereby acknowledging the knowledge gap and thus providing additional support to accomplish watershed management objectives 2 study area the swat model was applied to the 1 08 mkm2 ganga river basin upto farraka that flows into bay of bengal the ganga river basin is situated in the northern part of the country encompassed within the latitudes of 22 30 and 31 30 north and the longitude of 73 30 and 89 00 east fig 1 the basin is a trans boundary basin and lies in india nepal china and bangladesh the area of the river basin in india is 0 86 mkm2 which is nearly 26 percent of total geographic area of the country the ganga river originates as bhagirathi at an elevation of about 7000 m and travels a distance of nearly 2520 km before falling into the bay of bengal throughout its traverse a number of tributaries join the river on both sides of the banks the principal tributaries joining the river are the yamuna the ramganga the ghaghra the gandak the kosi the mahananda and the sone chambal and betwa are the two important sub tributaries of the yamuna river the principal source of water in river is on account of direct surface runoff generated by precipitation return flow base flow and snowmelt water emerging from himalayas the grb understandably does not receive uniform rainfall throughout its region the amount of rainfall received by the basin not only changes throughout the region it is also limited to only few months of the year mainly during monsoon months of june through october thus causing low flow conditions in the ganga as well as its tributaries during the dry periods of november through may the average annual rainfall in the grb varies from 350 mm at the western end to 2000 mm near the delta at the eastern part the drainage area fig 1 of this basin is constituted of many sub basins namely 1 the yamuna river passing through the states of uttarakhand himachal pradesh haryana and uttar pradesh and delhi its main tributaries are tons and chambal followed by sindh the betwa and ken which drain parts of rajasthan and madhya pradesh states 2 the gomti river passing through the uttar pradesh 3 the ghaghara river which originates from tibetan plateau and crosses nepal before passing through uttar pradesh and bihar it is the largest tributary of the ganga by volume of water contributed 4 the gandak river passing through nepal and uttar pradesh and bihar 5 the kosi river passing through nepal and bihar 6 the son river passing through madhya pradesh uttar pradesh jharkhand and bihar 7 the punpun river passing through jharkhand and bihar 8 the damodar river passing through west bengal and jharkhand 3 methodology 3 1 the hydrologic simulator swat swat was developed by the united states department of agriculture usda to predict the impact of land management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large un gauged basins arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2002 the swat model is a continuous time model that operates on a daily time step with option of monthly or annual output the model operates by dividing a catchment into sub catchments and each sub catchment is further divided into hydrological response units hrus the hru is a unique combination of soil and vegetation types within the sub catchment and serves as the basic computational unit for flow accumulation the simulation of hydrological cycle by swat is based on the water balance equation as in eq 1 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r i q i e t i g i b i where sw t mm is the final soil water content sw 0 mm is the initial soil water content on day i t days is time r i mm is the precipitation amount on day i q i mm is the amount of surface runoff on day i et i mm is the evapotranspiration et amount on day i g i mm is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i and b i mm is the amount of return flow on day i swat has inbuilt snow module to capture and simulate snowmelt hydrology permitting the delimitation of up to ten elevation bands with associated precipitation and temperature lapse rates fontaine et al 2002 grusson et al 2015 neitsch et al 2011 qi et al 2016 rahman et al 2013 to determine the water budget swat characterizes liquid and solid rainfall based on temperature of air near surface furthermore in swat snowpack snowfall and snowmelt events are always estimated by the model as soon as the temperature drops below the threshold of stipulated snowfall temperature swat also enables these processes to be spatially distinguished as a function of elevation that allows users to add lapse rate for both precipitation plaps in mm h2o km yr and temperature tlaps in c km which is very essential in the study region considered in this study sub basin has been divided into ten elevation bands 3 2 input data collection and processing model inputs required to run swat include the digital elevation model dem land use soil and weather data the arc gis interface of the swat model was used to discretize the catchment area and extract the input files to be used in swat the 90 m resolution topography data used for this study was extracted from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm the dem fig 2 a was used to delineate the basin and to provide topographical parameters such as overland slope stream network and slope length for each catchment of the basin drainage network generated using dem derived from srtm data might contain few errors to overcome this burning of stream network option available in swat model has been employed in which a stream network can be superimposed onto the dem that forces the alignment of stream the burning option allows forcing of streams to follow a certain path in the present study the drainage network from hydroshed http hydrosheds cr usgs gov was used for this purpose land use land cover is another important segment of data that is essential for hydrological simulation of the basin the merged landuse and irrigation source maps from nrsc and iwmi as shown in fig 2 b has been used for the present study iwmi derived the ganges river basin irrigated area product using modis 500 m and avhrr 10 km satellite sensor data merged with nrsc landuse landcover map of 2007 2008 to derive a new land cover map with agriculture landuse as well as corresponding sources of irrigation information on the soil profile is also required for simulating the hydrological character of the basin digitized soil map from nbsslup merged with the fao global soil map has been used for the modeling the soil map is shown in fig 2 c the daily reanalysis and re gridded weather data from imd rainfall temperature has been used daily rainfall data are at a resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 latitude by longitude grid points whereas temperature data are at 0 5 x 0 5 resolution in the absence of other daily weather data on relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation that are important parameters long term statistics have been used to generate data for these weather parameters for the basin the entire catchment area of ganga river basin was delineated and discretized into 1045 catchments fig 2 d which in turn have a total of 20627 hydrological response units hru division of catchments into areas having unique land use soil and slope combinations makes it possible to account for differences in evapotranspiration and other hydrological conditions for different land covers soils and slopes arnold et al 1998 setegn et al 2008 3 3 model assumptions and options selection for application precipitation data is an important component for the hydrological model that drives surface runoff and mass balance of the hydrologic systems the spatial variability of precipitation and the accuracy of the precipitation input are critical to the use of hydrological models cao et al 2006 in a mountainous basin such as ganga river basin rainfall and temperature varies with change in elevation rahman et al 2013 tahir et al 2011 with an increase in elevation the temperature reduces and is also highly affected by the aspect and topographic shading while precipitation generally increase with an increase in elevation and so does the portion of precipitation that precipitates as snow or rainfall abbaspour et al 2007 lu et al 2010 thanapakpawin et al 2007 in the absence of precipitation data availability for higher elevation areas elevation corrections were applied for rainfall and temperature stations available at lower elevations to simulate snow hydrology the swat model is capable of using elevation bands to adjust the rainfall and temperature as the altitude changes gassman et al 2007 narula and gosain 2013 the basin area with the elevations ranging from 2000 m to 8000 m is divided into ten elevation bands to account for the variation in precipitation and temperature effectively a value of 3 to 6 5 c km increase was used as temperature lapse rate and 100 250 mm km based on rigorous calibration was used as precipitation lapse rate for those sub basins where the elevation bands were incorporated secondary information on canal command areas irrigation sources and district crop production were used to represent and incorporate current crop management practices for crop simulation in the swat model in the present study out of the several options available in swat run off curve number method was employed to estimate surface runoff the penman monteith method for estimating potential evapotranspiration and the variable storage method to simulate channel water routing out of the total period of 28 years 1985 2013 of historical available data 5 years period 1985 89 was used as model warm up period 1990 2004 as calibration period and 2004 2013 as validation period swat model results were compared with the data from different gauge stations provided by central water commission using statistical parameters commonly used in hydrological modeling studies namely nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 fig 3 shows the locations where calibration and validation has been performed 3 4 statistical analysis regulated catchment such as ganga river basin has undergone major alterations in streamflow moreover there is a growing conflict due to transfer of water between different states and sharing of water between agriculture and industries in the catchment the study of temporal changes to streamflow within a catchment is crucial for water managers and policy makers for the development of successful water policies since surface runoff is of utmost importance for all human activities birsan et al 2014 goyal 2014 zhang et al 2015 gosain et al 2006 in their study has already predicted a reduction in surface runoff for the non gangeatic rivers however streamflow trends and their relationship with the anthropogenic effects as well as climatic variables have not been scientifically examined for ganga river basin therefore a trend test is performed on the hydrological streamflow as well as meteorological precipitation data to assess the ongoing trends and variability in streamflow and precipitation for ganga river basin change in hydrological variables can be considered as an important indicator to take note of and analyze impact of anthropogenic and climate change in this study six statistical tests have been adopted to have more confidence on the existence of trend and change in hydrological data streamflow simulated by swat model are used in this study trend of surface runoff in this study was tested using widely used trend detection methodologies namely mann kendall mk test student s t test and spearman s rho test cumulative deviation test worsley likelihood ratio test and cusum test abeysingha et al 2016 goyal 2014 kahya and kalaycı 2004 yeh et al 2015 zhang et al 2001 brief descriptions of the above mentioned tests are concisely explained in the supplementary material 4 results and discussion the following section describes the performance of swat model to mimic the hydrology of the catchment followed by the system wise assessment analysis of available trend in runoff and difference in surface runoff from its original condition derived from virgin scenario 4 1 model calibration the initial setup of swat model using default parameters was not able to simulate the surface runoff at all the gauge stations correctly as the peak discharge and base flow were underestimated in snow dominant area while in the non perennial region high flows were overestimated and base flows were underestimated therefore the calibration of parameters was needed to exactly simulate the surface runoff swat model developed for ganga river basin is calibrated manually by following a systematic approach neitsch et al 2002 at first upstream gauge is calibrated and the parameters corresponding to that gauge site are kept constant while the parameters of the sub basins between upstream gauge and the next downstream gauge site is calibrated the same approach was repeated for the next downstream stations till we reach the outlet of the catchment farakka various swat parameters that were employed for calibration purpose namely snow parameters smfmx smtmp smfmn sftmp elevation band parameters plaps tlaps and hydrological parameters cn2 sol awc esco gw delay and gw revap arnold et al 2013 neitsch et al 2002 4 2 evaluation of the runoff simulation the comparison of observed and simulated surface runoff on monthly basis for a calibration period from 1990 2004 displayed very good results at all the gauge stations the model once calibrated was then simulated from 2005 to 2010 for validation for perennial rivers like ganga yamuna ghaghara gandak and kosi simulated runoff was generally higher than the corresponding observed values for the same period the base flow primarily attributed to the return flow and snowmelt has been captured quite well by the model for all the river systems the analysis of the most commonly used hydrological statistical parameters performance measures i e nse rsr r2 and pbias for calibration period at various locations for each sub basin has been done the statistical parameters to depict model performance fall in very good category with nse 0 75 and r2 0 85 at all the stream flow stations the analysis of statistical parameters reveals that the swat model was able to capture the intrinsic nature of catchment in terms of surface runoff very precisely the high values of nse and r2 explain that the model has been able to capture high flows while the low values of pbias shows that the low flows pertaining mostly to the snowmelt has also been simulated quiet well by the model a synoptic representation of the performance of nse rsr and pbias at each of the gauge stations considered for the calibration and validation of the basin is shown in fig 4 for the non perennial rivers like chambal sindh tons and son the model was able to capture the high flows quite well with large extent of areas under irrigation it is expected that a large amount of water would come back to the river as return flow swat performed reasonably well in capturing these low base flows in the basin the high values of nse 0 70 and r2 0 8 clearly indicate that the model performed quiet well in the parts of chambal sindh tons and son of the catchment too fig 5 further comparison of distribution of average monthly surface runoff at the basin outlet farakka discharge site has been made fig 6 and fig s1 in supplementary material the results at farakka site show an appreciable match between average annual monthly observed discharge and swat simulated discharge so it may be concluded that the swat model has simulated the basin adequately it can be noted that the snowmelt is major contributor for the surface runoff during non monsoon season and the rainfall does not have the solitary effect on the total runoff during the melt period however the contribution of rain varies because of spatial and temporal variation the comparison of mean monthly simulated discharge at the joshimath gauge station which is predominantly snow fed in nature showed that the monthly flow during the months of february march and april is comparable with the observed discharge during these months fig 6 b and fig s2 in supplementary material swat model has the ability to simulate different components of water yield it was therefore possible to compute the contribution of precipitation and snow and glacier melt in the total water yield at the gauging site explained in the supplementary material the analysis of the simulation suggests that the most of the runoff is generated by precipitation the long term monthly contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to total surface runoff at joshimath gauge station is shown in fig 7 a while fig 7 b shows the average percentage contribution to the total water yield during different months for various parts of basin from the snowmelt the contribution to the surface runoff from snowmelt increases from february to may and from june onwards the contribution from snowmelt decreases fig 7 a b bookhagen and burbank 2010 also obtained similar results indicating that large amount of water is stored as snow in the high elevation and western region and their release does not happen until several months later in the pre and early monsoon season furthermore the maximum contribution to the water yield from rainfall is observed in august with very little contribution from snowmelt fig 7 a b the long term averages of annual surface runoff for the period between 1979 and 2013 has been developed for the catchment at the farakka discharge site which is the outlet of the ganga river basin the analysis of annual stream flow reveals that the years having annual stream flow greater than the average 18 and smaller than the average 17 is approximately same a wet or dry year can act as an indication of several different phenomenon such as precipitation surface runoff etc pinkayan 1966 fig 8 shows wet years along with dry years water balance is an important component in swat model as it involves all the processes and their corresponding impact on the growth of plants within the watershed area fletcher et al 2013 shawul et al 2013 therefore to tackle the water management issues it is essential to analyze and quantify the different hydrologic components occurring inside the basin the assessment of variation in these hydrologic components at both spatial and temporal level is instrumental in formulation of strategies by water planners and stakeholders involved adeogun et al 2014 stated that the rainfall surface runoff base flow lateral flow and evapotranspiration are the important elements of water balance in a catchment except rainfall all the aforementioned elements need proper assessment with the help of modeling tool as the quantification of these components are not easy therefore swat model has an important role in quantifying these hydrologic components within the study area analysis of results for an entire ganga river basin fig 9 show that water yield has the maximum share of water balance with approximately 51 percent 601 6 mm annually of total precipitation 1167 5 mm with evapotranspiration having the next highest share 496 5 mm followed by groundwater recharge 274 8 mm the comparison of hydrologic components for monsoon june july august and september and non monsoon season october november and december has also been done the results show that most of the precipitation 975 mm occurs in monsoon season while non monsoon season experience a comparatively meager rainfall of 65 9 mm fig 9 furthermore the water yield 87 2 mm obtained during non monsoon season is higher than the rainfall 65 9 mm during the corresponding period which is owed to the high amount of return flow 60 8 mm happening inside the catchment because of large amount of areas under irrigation fig 9 fig 10 show the temporal seasonal as well as spatial variation of different hydrologic components within the basin the precipitation varies both spatially and temporally fig 10 the average annual rainfall for the entire basin is about 1168 mm the general spatial trend is that rainfall increases from west to east of the ganga river basin the major part of the rainfall occurs during monsoon months of june july august and september and ranges from 225 mm to 3045 mm in these 4 months fig 10 winter rain october november and december ranges from 7 mm to 415 mm fig 10 swat model has the ability to compute the water yield for each sub basin which is defined as the total amount of water that leaves each of the hrus of the sub basin and enter the main river channel during the time step considered arnold et al 2013 water yield is an important parameter which need to be assessed for the proper management and planning of the watershed the contributions of each of the sub basin areas to water yield for both monsoon as well as non monsoon season have been presented in fig 10 the assessment of water yield contribution for different sub basins during monsoon and non monsoon season reveal that on an average 70 percent of the water yield is contributed during monsoon season as can be seen in fig 10 contribution of sub catchment to water yield has been diverse with maximum contribution of 4505 mm from a sub basin dominated by glacier and snow with almost 65 percent of this contribution 2900 mm being made during monsoon season however the minimum contribution of a sub basin to the water yield is less than 50 mm showing the huge variation within the study area as we noted water yield also varies substantially between the monsoon and non monsoon season with approximately 75 of water yield coming during the monsoon season with range from 50 mm to more than 3000 mm and much smaller portion coming during non monsoon period with range from 5 mm to 600 mm fig 10 in addition precipitation water yield and evapotranspiration were found to be higher in the forested and mountainous and comparably unexploited upper areas fig 10 however as we move downstream or towards non perennial system dominated by agriculture and highly irrigated areas value of evapotranspiration increases a total of 653 billion cubic meter bcm average annual of water was estimated by the swat model as the potential water yield of the ganga river basin between the simulation periods of 1990 2013 further examination of results reveal that the ghaghra river system and gandak river system have made the largest contribution to the water yield in the catchment while chambal and sindh river systems have the lowest contribution in the total water yield the long term monthly averages of surface runoff for the basin has also been developed and analyzed the monthly mean precipitation of 308 3 mm and 307 9 mm is associated to july and august respectively and a minimum of 8 1 mm to november fig 11 furthermore mean monthly water yield has the maximum of 159 8 mm during the month of august fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that during monsoon months of june through september the rainfall is higher than the evapotranspiration requirement and able to meet most of the crop water requirements however during non monsoon months the evapotranspiration is higher than rainfall fig 11 suggesting that required additional water has been either diverted through storage or shallow deep aquifer withdrawal or provided by the soil moisture to meet the crop production demand the assessment of water balance for each of the systems shows similar characteristics with water yield having the maximum share followed by the evapotranspiration 4 3 trend analysis the rank based non parametric test namely mann kendall statistical test the spearman s rho sr test and student s t test are used to analyze trends in surface runoff simulated by calibrated and validated swat model the catchment exhibits dominant trends in most of the regions fig 12 with 65 stations out of 67 stations showing significant trend in annual surface runoff the yamuna river basin represents the northwestern part of the ganga river basin the yamuna river basin has an annual total precipitation of 900 mm a total of 5 gauge stations out of 7 gauge stations in this sub basin had significant downward trend in annual stream flow suggesting a reduction in the annual mean surface runoff fig 12 two gauge stations in the upstream of the sub basin namely yashwant nagar and tuini showed no trend and were exception to the dominant downward annual trend along with mann kendall spearman s rho test student s t test and rank sum test was also used to evaluate whether the trend of surface runoff changed during the period the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff during the periods prior to 1980 and post 1980 periods in order to determine the year of change cusum cumulative deviation and worsley likelihood test were employed the result of change point detection using the above mentioned tests have been shown in table s1 the change points were consistent with each other in all the three tests the overall mean z static value for the rainfall is 0 7 showing that the rainfall doesn t show any significant trend rai et al 2012 also obtained that annual rainfall and monsoon rainfall values show an overall declining trend the trend between observed rainfall and simulated surface runoff might not be opposite in this basin but huge difference between the overall mean z static value for the observed rainfall 0 7 and stream flow 3 066 suggest that the anthropogenic changes within the catchment overall dominate over the exogenous changes anthropogenic activities such as water diversion through canals mostly at tajewala barrage water consumption land use and land cover changes new dam construction and city expansion new delhi result in significant alteration in the surface runoff hence all of the above mentioned factors might have resulted in subsequent increased water withdrawal thus causing a significant decreasing trend of streamflow especially in downstream areas of the basin the upper ganga sub basin is mostly snow fed and glacier dominated a total of 11 stream gauge stations were analyzed of which 4 stations namely uttarkashi rudraprayag joshimath and rishikesh had significant increasing trend while decreasing trend of streamflow at other 7 stream gauge stations in the downstream areas of the river sub basin is observed fig 12 in order to determine year of change cusum cumulative deviation and worsley likelihood tests were employed the result of change point detection using the above mentioned tests have been shown in table s1 the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff during the periods prior to 1970 and post 1970 periods increase in the surface as well as groundwater use to meet the industrial and domestic demands for many cities developed alongside the river such as kanpur along with increase in the irrigated area in the sub basin coupled with raising crops such as sugarcane which demand large amount of water throughout the year has substantially increased water withdrawal thus causing a significant decreasing trend of stream flow in the downstream part of the sub basin the watershed region adjacent to upper ganga basin is gomti river sub basin significant downward trend in annual streamflow dominant in this region has also been observed at streamgages namely lukhnow sultanpur jaunpur maighat and raibareily with a single exception neemsar in the upstream part of the basin had significant increasing trend in annual streamflow fig 12 the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff during the periods prior to 1980 and post 1980 periods table s1 abeysingha et al 2016 also obtained significant decreasing trends for the surface runoff of the gomti river basin may be partly caused by the variations in the rainfall and partly by anthropogenic activities stream gauges in the ghaghra gandak and kosi sub basins were also examined for statistically significant trends in annual streamflow significant increasing trends are prevalent in all these sub basins a total of fifteen stream gauge stations in these sub basins have been examined fig 12 the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff during the periods prior to 1990 and post 1990 periods table s1 the trend analysis of streamflow in chambal sindh betwa ken tons and son sub basins show a significant downward trend with a single exception of maner station in the downstream part of son sub basin that has significant increasing trend in the annual streamflow a total of 24 stations have shown significant decreasing trend in annual streamflow fig 12 the decreasing trend in the rainfall coupled with increasing anthropogenic activities have resulted in decreasing trend of streamflow in these sub basins cusum cumulative deviation and worsley likelihood test are used to determine the year of change at the same time the student s t test revealed significant differences in mean surface runoff between the two time periods table s1 based on the trend analysis this study provides a strong indication that both climate change and anthropogenic influences have altered the water balance in the ganga river basin it is well known that climate change can alter the hydrologic systems especially glacier and snow melt thus the increase in snow and glacier melt process cause an increase in the annual surface runoff as a result an increasing trend in surface runoff is observed fig 12 whereas rapid increase of settlement area increased irrigation etc in downstream areas and non perennial regions have shown decreasing trend fig 12 4 4 virgin scenario the ganga river basin today proposes substantial water resources development through new projects therefore it is pertinent to evaluate the hydrological health of the basin before imposing any additional stress on the already stressed system thus it is important to understand the situation of the ganga river basin in its pristine state such simulation of ganga river basin during its pristine state is also essential to determine the reference hydrology against which alterations in the surface runoff and other hydrological components in the basin can be measured the analysis of the ganga river basin in its pristine state would help in understanding the extent to which the basin has been already exploited and also give an insight to viable options that can be formulated to restore the basin close to its initial state the developed swat model provides the opportunity to generate scenario that can help in understanding the water resources availability under the virgin or pre development condition therefore in order to develop virgin scenario it was assumed that there has been no irrigation happening within the catchment and all the projects such as reservoirs and canal diversions were removed from the calibrated swat model this scenario assumes that all the farming areas are rain fed the comparison of water balance between the virgin scenario and present scenario business as usual is shown in fig 13 for upper ganga basin yamuna basin chambal basin and sindh basin respectively the analysis of the virgin scenario and present scenario showed that on an average the present annual water yield is 25 30 35 and 35 lower than in the virgin condition for ganga basin upstream of allahabad yamuna basin up to agra chambal basin and sindh basin respectively fig 13 the degree of change in the water yield can be attributed to various land use effects primarily to irrigation requirements that needs to be met as agriculture is the primary activity in ganga basin and development of water resource structures to meet irrigation demands hydropower generation and flood controls it can be observed from fig 13 that there has been over exploitation of water happening in these basins the calculation has been done for the area in the downstream of the rishikesh which is a predominantly agricultural area and requires large amount of water to meet irrigation demand the deviations from the virgin water yield in the present scenario 200 mm is primarily on the account of the huge amount of irrigation happening in the area the comparison of evapotranspiration for the present and virgin condition shows that the present et is much higher than in the virgin scenario which can be attributed to the fact there has been huge amount of irrigation happening in the current scenario which we have assumed to be absent in the virgin scenario fig 13 however there has been an increase in the baseflow in the virgin condition than in the present condition and simultaneously there has been a decrease in the net groundwater recharge fig 13 which seems correct considering the fact that almost all the water infiltrating inside the soil layer would come to the river as baseflow since there is no abstraction happening from the groundwater flow duration curve fdc has been rigorously used in various hydrological studies namely water supply irrigation planning and hydropower river and reservoir studies and augmentation of low flows singh et al 2005 vogel and fennessey 1994 flow duration curve demonstrates variation in stream flow through a graphical representation of distribution of the flow regime brown et al 2005 remondi et al 2016 fdc s can be obtained by plotting surface runoff from the swat model or observed runoff at various gauge stations against various levels of dependability the flow is expected to be equaled or exceeded the analysis of fdc at rudraprayag and joshimath shows that the flow corresponding to 50 75 and 90 dependability is 656 3 448 6 and 370 5 m3 s and 206 135 5 and 109 5 m3 s respectively fig 14 fdc serves as an important tool for the assessment of water resource wealth that was actually available and changes that happened during the course of time and development fig 14 show fdcs for the present and virgin scenario at joshimath and rudraprayag gauge stations respectively the comparison of fdcs for the two scenarios are in line with the two stations showing no considerable change in surface runoff as there has been no considerable exploitation in terms of anthropogenic activities that have happened in these areas however as we move downstream and to the different tributaries of ganga river basin there is a remarkable reduction in flows during the present scenario as compared to the virgin scenario mainly due to the withdrawal of water for fulfilling both industrial and agricultural demand fig 15 show the difference in the flow rates between the present and virgin scenario for kanpur and farakka respectively in addition the comparison between fdc of present and virgin scenario show that the present maximum flow is 33 and 37 lower than in the virgin conditions at kanpur and farakka respectively as can be seen the difference in flow rates between the virgin and present scenario for 50 75 and 90 dependability is found to be 1393 5 748 8 and 718 8 m3 s respectively for the kanpur fig 15 and 11920 9184 and 5639 m3 s respectively for farakka fig 15 the difference in flow affects many future water resources development plans as most of the water resources related infrastructures and plans are reliant on the dependable flows similar trends in difference in surface runoff in present and virgin scenario are recorded for kalanaur mohana chatara and mirzapur fig s3 fig s4 fig s5 and fig s6 in supplementary material 5 conclusion this study illustrates a systematic procedure for the calibration and validation of a physically semi distributed hydrological model swat for a mountainous as well as flat perennial as well as non perennial tributaries of ganga river basin the spatial and temporal variation of rainfall coupled with various landuse and soil types introduced heterogeneity in estimation of parameters for stream flow simulation the analysis of simulation obtained by the swat model indicates that the developed surface water model for the ganga river basin is able to simulate the actual surface water prevailing in the basin reasonably well furthermore most of the himalayan rivers receive flow both from snow and glacial melt as well as rain analysis of model simulations with quantification of snowmelt for the snow dominant himalayan basins suggest that the model is able to capture the snowmelt dynamics prevailing in the basin thus the developed swat model is able to mimic the physical characteristics of the system and can be used for watershed management and planning by developing different scenarios representing various policies for the surface water management for the basin manual calibration approach considering multiple parameters and multiple sites was used to develop swat model for the ganga river basin refsgaard 1997 stated that the calibration of a distributed model is a never ending story hence there is always a room for improvement of the simulated results manual calibration helps in better understanding of the model as well as in recognizing the important processes within the watershed and identifying parameters that are restricted only to a particular condition in a basin it would therefore be reasonable to suggest that the multi site manual approach of calibration and validation as used in the study result in determining more realistic parameter values across the hydrologic processes as well as geographic areas ganga river along with its tributaries irrigate large tracts of land growing wheat rice and sugarcane and support a large number of industries and human population the trend detection on the streamflow of ganga river basin along with its tributaries has showed that there is drying tendency of surface runoff in most of the tributaries especially in highly populated and irrigated areas however the overall trend for ganga river basin at the outlet farakka is increasing the study indicated that both endogenous activities as well as exogenous changes are responsible for the decreasing trends in the streamflow the ever increasing population large amount of irrigation and industrial demands are among the anthropogenic factors that are responsible for increasing withdrawals of water from the basin the study also attempts to analyze the impacts of water resource development projects and anthropogenic activities on the various hydrologic components especially surface runoff in the entire ganga river basin by comparing stream flow changes under virgin and present scenarios the analysis shows that in the upstream portions which are unexploited annual flows remain same for both the virgin and present scenario but as we move towards downstream portion of the basin there is a marked gap between the stream flows under virgin and present scenario therefore construction of various dams and reservoirs coupled with various domestic and industrial demands have resulted in the reduction of stream flows also the study developed fdcs for the two scenarios and the results suggest that there has been reduction in dependable flows at most of the gauge stations this study should be regarded as a first step towards developing a model necessary for basin development and planning although much work still needs to be done on model verification moreover this study involves the assessment of water that is really accessible for all uses and development and should be considered as a starting point in sustainable basin management the present study did not incorporate climate change factors and water quality aspect of the ganga river basin but shall be taken up as part of the future scope the capabilities of swat model that facilitate extensive use of swat model also characterizes limitations there are also problems in portraying some processes perfectly due to the absence of ample observation data inadequate data desired to depict input parameters or lacking of technical understanding furthermore another key weakness of the model is the non spatial aspect of the hrus at the same time significant requirement of data has been deemed as one of the major shortcomings of swat modeling absence of precipitation data for higher elevation and inadequate glacier and snow information is the major limitations of the manuscript another limitation of it is that it assumes constant land use throughout the simulations despite these limitations of swat model

8519,study region the dhofar mountains are located on the arabian peninsula in southern oman unlike other regions of oman the dhofar mountains have an annual monsoon season that results in a semi arid cloud forest the region highly depends on groundwater resources and the dhofar mountain range is the major recharge area for the salalah coastal plain study focus forests in cloud impacted areas can harvest cloud water droplets in addition to receiving rainfall the forest interception and recharge relevant net precipitation are investigated by ecohydrological studies these studies are however limited to the point or experimental plot scale and to particular tree species groundwater studies in contrast are often linked to catchment or groundwater aquifer boundaries and are therefore calculated at meso to regional scale to be able to utilize findings from ecohydrological site studies for regional groundwater studies we regionalize field site studies through cloud forest distribution and rainfall interpolation in a semi arid data scarce region heavily dependent on groundwater resources new hydrological insights for the region our results are a cloud forest precipitation scenario that quantifies the additional rainfall gained through cloud water harvesting by the cloud forest in comparison to interpolated rainfall the precipitation available for recharge within the dhofar mountains increases by 20 considering a recharge precipitation ratio calculation the recharge ratios in the region are up to 24 for highly forested areas keywords rainfall monsoon cloud forest semi arid ecohydrology groundwater recharge 1 introduction the availability of sustainable water resources is an essential concern in arid and semi arid regions on the arabian peninsula water withdrawal is estimated to be more than five times higher than renewable water frenken 2009 however the estimation of such numbers is based on extremely sparse data and subject to large uncertainties using global atmospheric reanalysis models lorenz and kunstmann 2012 demonstrated the effect of sparse rain gauge distributions on the uncertainty of daily rainfall estimated by the reanalyses as rainfall determines current groundwater recharge the recharge zones and their functioning is of paramount importance in quantifying renewable water resources the dhofar mountain range of oman is one of these recharge areas and supplies both the nejd desert region to the north as well as the salalah coastal plain oman s second largest city to the south with groundwater recharge the dhofar mountains feature a semi arid seasonal cloud forest fed by the annual khareef monsoon season hildebrandt and eltahir 2006 besides the annual monsoon the region is subject to strong cyclonic events up to 400 mm within a few days that occur irregularly every 2 6 years strauch et al 2014 analyzed the isotopic signatures of rainfall spring discharge and groundwater results show that groundwater recharge from the dhofar mountains to the salalah coastal plain is mainly linked to monsoon rainfall this is also supported by the observations of i higher soil moisture during the monsoon than during and after cyclone rainfall events hildebrandt et al 2007 and ii greater surface runoff during cyclonic rainfall due to infiltration excess flow vs little to no surface runoff during the monsoon forests intercept and redistribute precipitation into different components throughfall and stemflow levia et al 2011 the sum of throughfall and stemflow determines net precipitation the amount of water available below the canopy water that is intercepted by the canopy is being evaporated and therefore mostly results in a loss of water carlyle moses and gash 2011 net precipitation is classically measured by budgeting measurements of throughfall stemflow and open rainfall friesen et al 2015 during the khareef season in southern oman precipitation is available as i rainfall and as ii fog also called horizontal precipitation horizontal precipitation is mainly a turbulent process where cloud droplets are mixed inside the canopy and are intercepted by the vegetation hildebrandt et al 2007 shuttleworth 1977 whereas rainfall is recorded via rain gauges the amount of fog is usually not measured in particular trees have the ability to harvest cloud water more efficiently than lower vegetation yielding higher amounts of horizontal precipitation in addition to rainfall hildebrandt and eltahir 2008 when fog moves through the canopy water accumulates at the leaves and branches and then either evaporates drips off as throughfall or flows down the stem as stemflow cloud forest hydrology has been extensively studied bruijnzeel et al 2011 holwerda et al 2010 especially in tropical montane cloud forests the importance of cloud or fog interception to groundwater recharge has also been shown by clark et al 1987 for the dhofar region by ingraham and matthews 1988 for kenia and by sawaske and freyberg 2014 for california the annual monsoon season in dhofar through its interaction with the vegetation bawain 2012 hildebrandt et al 2007 hildebrandt and eltahir 2007 facilitates survival of the dhofar cloud forest also through forest canopy redistribution net precipitation is spatially heterogeneously distributed in throughfall and stemflow whereas the latter is especially important for infiltration and recharge germer 2013 kacimov et al 2010 liang et al 2011 schwärzel et al 2012 this is further emphasized by the fact that stemflow in the dhofar cloud forest can reach up to 40 of net precipitation bawain 2012 which even on a global scale is amongst the highest recorded stemflow contributions cf levia and frost 2003 forest interception studies which are required to assess interception and quantify the recharge relevant net precipitation are however often only possible at point or experimental plot scale and are limited to the studied tree species groundwater recharge and consequently also the input data to recharge models in contrast are required at relatively large scales e g linked to hydrological catchments or groundwater aquifer boundaries and thus is located at the other end of the spatial scale scanlon et al 2002 only few studies provide interception estimates on a large global scale miralles et al 2010 murray 2014 however those ignore processes like horizontal precipitation and are therefore not suitable to translate the local eco hydrological processes into recharge relevant processes studies regarding the precipitation in oman exist on a national scale and are often limited to two or three rainfall stations in the study region al ajmi et al 2013 kwarteng et al 2009 in this study we use data from 24 rainfall stations for the dhofar region that allowed us to capture the variability across the mountain range and the coastal region and enabled us to produce daily interpolated rainfall from 1992 to 2014 satellite data for vegetation and elevation were used to derive could forest cover and extent assumptions that were used to incorporate the cloud forest in a precipitation scenario were taken from previous studies the main objectives of this study are to separate the monsoon rainfall relevant for the coastal plain recharge to interpolate the monsoon rainfall to generate an interpolated rainfall dataset including cloud forest impact and to provide a basic groundwater balance based on the two rainfall datasets and groundwater recharge precipitation ratio estimates 2 data and methods 2 1 site description the dhofar mountains are located in southern oman and act as a boundary between the desert region nejd to the north and the salalah coastal plain including oman s second largest city to the south fig 1 extending for almost 300 km into yemen to the southwest the dhofar mountains are a crescent shaped coastal mountain range that encompasses the coastal plain around the city of salalah the coastal plain is about 15 km wide at its broadest point and 60 km long from the flat coastal plain the elevation rises abruptly in the mountains to about 900 1300 m a m s l in the study region jebel samhan outside the study region has an elevation of about 1700 m a m s l groundwater recharge from the mountains feeds the coastal aquifer that is intensively used for agriculture and municipal water use precipitation can be subdivided into monsoon precipitation and cyclone events the monsoon season occurs from mid june to mid september and is characterized by low intensity rainfall and drizzle 10 mm day 1 and dense fog along the mountain range visibility down to 5 m personal observation during the monsoon season an inversion layer develops above the mountain crest that holds the clouds on the southern side of the mountains abdul wahab 2003 hildebrandt et al 2007 cyclonic rainfall events occur irregularly between 2 6 years cf 3 results for a couple of days and yield high rainfall amounts of up to 400 mm kwarteng et al 2009 the mountainous land cover ranges from cloud forests tree heights 10m cropland and grassland to bare rock soils are shallow with a depth of 0 5 1 m friesen et al 2011 next to its natural botanical and hydrological value bawain 2012 el sheikh 2013 the cloud forest also has a high economic value as the monsoon season in dhofar is a touristic hotspot throughout the arabian peninsula the predominant tree species in the dhofar mountains is anogeissus dhofarica kürschner et al 2004 miller et al 1988 with tree heights between 2 and 10 m observed stand densities from experimental sites are between 1800 and 3800 trees per hectare hildebrandt et al 2007 bawain 2012 however it has to be taken into account that the tree heights are relatively low favoring a high density and that the forest in whole mountain range is highly fragmented cf fig 1 the cloud forest ranges from the mountain crest up to 1000 m a m s l in the north to the foothills in the south and is a deciduous and water limited cloud forest that depends on cloud prevalence for survival hildebrandt and eltahir 2006 forest cover is endangered both through livestock roaming freely in the mountain range cf brinkmann et al 2009 as well as through the extensive development of tourist and transport infrastructure personal communication ministry of environment and climate affairs 2 1 1 geology and hydrogeology the main geologic formations in the dhofar mountains and in the coastal plain are limestone of tertiary origin in the mountains the layers of the hadramout group are present from bottom to top these are the umm er radhuma uer the rus rus and the dammam dam formations the water level in the mountains is between 500 and 600 m and a groundwater divide separates flow to the north najd and flow to the south coastal plain the uer with its karstic limestone is the main aquifer in the mountains the main aquifer in the coastal plain is the adawnib formation of the fars group overlain by the nar formation and quaternary deposits the saturated thickness of the coastal aquifer which also shows karst characteristics is about 70 m both the dhofar mountains as well as the coastal plain show karstic characteristics water infiltrates in the outcrops of the uer in the dhofar mountains and recharges the coastal plain aquifer which is indicated by increasing spring discharge and groundwater levels in the plain annually during and after the monsoon season fig 2 depicts the water level of an exemplary well the isotopic signatures observed in groundwater and spring discharge as well as in rainfall data from both cyclone events and monsoon rainfall fig 3 show that the groundwater that recharges the salalah coastal plain aquifers originates from monsoon rainfall both cyclone rainfall as well as groundwater found in the northern desert region nejd show different isotopic signatures from the coastal plain groundwater and spring discharge cf clark et al 1987 strauch et al 2014 2 2 data sources and pre processing 2 2 1 rainfall data and interpolation daily rainfall data were provided by the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources of oman mrmwr as well as through the global summary of the day gsod data set from the national climate data center https data noaa gov dataset global surface summary of the day gsod in total 23 stations were used 9 located in the salalah coastal plain and 14 located in the dhofar mountains to our knowledge this is the largest rainfall dataset available for the southern dhofar region data availability goes back to 1973 however our analysis focuses on the period from 1992 to 2014 as only few stations were available prior to 1992 additionally to the local observations the analyses are based on interpolated rainfall maps cf section 2 2 2 the station data were processed into monsoon and non monsoon rainfall mostly cyclones fig 4 shows the data availability during monsoon for all stations used in the analysis as some of the cyclonic events occur closely before or after the monsoon season their distinction is in some cases difficult or even impossible the separation of annual rainfall into monsoon only rainfall was based on reported monsoon times kwarteng et al 2009 and rainfall amounts based on station data to retrieve rainfall time series for monsoon rainfall only monsoon season cyclone events were filtered automatically according to the data processing scheme shown in fig 5 for station averaging the data were filtered depending on the amount of missing data and the recorded rainfall the rainfall time series is intermittent and includes missing values see fig 4 all years with more than 20 missing values during the monsoon season are removed the precipitation dataset includes stations which report no precipitation 0 mm where they in fact should report station failure missing value to filter for those situations entire years not exceeding 10 mm year 1 are excluded 2 2 2 spatial interpolation of precipitation the interpolation of the station data is based on kriging with external drift edk ahmed and de marsily 1987 this geostatistical method estimates the precipitation at a location based on the information of the neighboring stations the relation and weight of the neighboring stations are determined based on a variogram as additional information the terrain elevation digital elevation model is used as external drift elevation data were taken from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm reuter et al 2007 for the external drift the srtm data were upscaled to 1 km 1 km pixels the number of 23 stations is small for the area of interest which is about 1400 km2 area of the mountain regions in the central and eastern part cf fig 7 edk depends as any statistically method on the amount of available data and thus is probably uncertain for the application within this domain as edk is a well established method buytaert et al 2006 to estimate spatial distributed fields of geo scientific data we herein applied the edk approach alternative approaches such as inverse distance thiessen polygons copulas bárdossy and pegram 2009 prism daly et al 1994 and shepard s angular distance weighting algorithm shepard 1968 can also be applied for interpolation the interpolation of precipitation data is performed using all available monsoon data including station years with more than 20 missing values but neglecting station years with precipitation less than 10 mm a 1 the precipitation variability between the rain gauges is assessed by a semi variogram the parameters of the variogram nugget range and sill are consecutively applied for edk as they determine the weighting between neighboring stations for the precipitation estimation in a given location the variogram as well as the external drift kriging itself depend on several parameters like the maximum station search distance type of the variogram experimental spherical gaussian and fitting parameters for the variogram several options were tested whereas a search distance of 100 km and an exponential variogram led to the best results in terms of cross location evaluation the quality of the precipitation interpolation is assessed by a jackknife method leave one out strategy therefore the precipitation is interpolated at the location of a rain gauge by neglecting the observed time series this method is repeated for each rain gauge comparing the interpolated time series with the observation assesses the quality of the interpolation 2 2 3 dhofar cloud forest precipitation budget cloud forests have the ability to harvest fog water which can result in net precipitation that is higher than the rainfall measured in the open thereby not necessarily being subject to interception loss but in some cases to interception gain in the dhofar cloud forest the precipitation budget and the interception gain has been extensively studied bawain et al 2010 bawain 2012 friesen et al 2011 hildebrandt and eltahir 2006 2007 2008 hildebrandt et al 2007 for several years at two sites in the dhofar mountains gogub and tawi attair hildebrandt 2005 page 91 estimated net precipitation for the years 2003 and 2004 to be 2 3 times the amount of rainfall the high uncertainty was owed to sensor failures however data from 2008 and 2009 unpublished results by hildebrandt bawain show net precipitation to rainfall ratios of 2 56 and 2 58 respectively estimates from hildebrandt 2005 as well as unpublished results by hildebrandt and bawain are all based on observations from an anogeissus dhofarica forest patch and were derived using the water budget method for the water budget method rainfall is measured in the open field or above the canopy stemflow and throughfall gauges distributed within the forested area provide net precipitation the sum of stemflow and throughfall cf hildebrandt 2005 for a detailed methodology regarding monitoring and water budgeting based on the provided estimates for the predominant tree species anogeissus dhofarica a net precipitation to rainfall ratio of 2 5 was chosen fig 6 shows the schematic principle of cloud forest hydrology for the predominant tree species anogeissus dhofarica and the contribution of cloud water to net precipitation 2 2 4 cloud forest distribution cloud forest distribution is based on post monsoon landsat 8 data from 2014 mid sept to dec with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m gps geolocated photographs unpublished data were taken as ground truth for the classification the image collection and classification algorithm was conducted using the google earth engine google earth engine team 2015 the cloud forest extends from the mountain crest to the foothills during the monsoon season an inversion layer just above the mountain range results in a dense fog that is sustained throughout the three month monsoon period this fog extends into the coastal plain abdul wahab 2003 forest in the region only occurs due to the additional horizontal precipitation without fog only shrubs would survive due to the limited water availability as irrigated areas show similarly ndvi values a filter had to be applied that distinguished between cloud forest and irrigation plots in the coastal plain this was accomplished by applying a 150 m a m s l elevation threshold elevation data were taken from the shuttle radar topography mission reuter et al 2007 the area classified as cloud forest see fig 7 is subject to change cf 2 1 site description and may have been larger in former times as shown in fig 7 most forested areas are located on the steep slopes of the wadi valleys and the forest cover generally decreases from west to east using the satellite based cloud forest distribution the percentile cloud forest cover was calculated for the 1 km 1 km pixels of the edk interpolation for the cloud forest rainfall scenario the proportionate cloud water interception was added to each time step of the edk interpolated dataset eq 1 1 p c f p a n c f p a c f α where p is the interpolated rainfall in m ancf the non forested pixel area in m2 acf the forested pixel area in m2 and α the factor determining the additional cloud water harvest set to 2 5 cf fig 6 pcf the interpolated rainfall including the cloud forest impact is later converted back from m3 to mm 2 2 5 groundwater recharge groundwater aquifers in the salalah coastal plain are mainly fed by precipitation in the mountains the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources mrmwr divides the mountains and coastal plain into the central freshwater zone and the eastern brackish zone see fig 6 to compare the interpolated precipitation to groundwater groundwater recharge was calculated for the two groundwater zones groundwater recharge is the annual increase of water stored in an aquifer and is calculated based on spring discharge water level data of wells and the specific yield of the respective aquifer for this study we used data for the salalah coastal plain provided by the mrmwr that reported averaged annual water level increases of 4m year for the central zone and of 2 m year for the eastern zone grc 2005 and a specific yield of 0 03 mwr 1992 using the water level increase per year and the specific yield of the upper groundwater aquifer an annual recharge was calculated eq 2 based on the water table fluctuation wtf method scanlon et al 2002 2 r s y δ h δ t where sy is the specific yield set to 0 03 h is the water level and t time δh δt is the water level increase set to 4 m year 1 in central zone and to 2 m year 1 in the eastern zone annual recharge was used to derive the recharge precipitation ratio cf scanlon et al 2006 3 results the results are based on i station data analysis and on ii edk interpolated precipitation and groundwater recharge data station data were used to separate rainfall into monsoon and non monsoon rainfall to derive monsoon season characteristics and to calculate wet and dry years the monsoon rainfall was used as input data to the edk interpolation and to calculate a cloud forest precipitation scenario as well as available precipitation for the different groundwater recharge zones based on the rainfall processing described in section 2 2 1 the individual station data series were separated into monsoon and non monsoon rainfall the resulting precipitation is depicted in fig 8 that shows the annual monsoon rainfall for all stations and the corresponding non monsoon rainfall using data from the joint typhoon warning center jtwc we show that years with high non monsoon rainfall corresponds to years during which cyclone tracks were in close vicinity of the study region based on both monsoon as well as on non monsoon interannual variability no clear periodicity could be detected based on station data statistical metrics of monsoon rainfall and total rainfall incl cyclones were calculated for monsoon wet years are above 190 mm year 1 and dry years below 105 mm year 1 based on the upper and lower 20th percentiles cf table 1 following the separation into monsoon rainfall only monsoon specific metrics such as the duration of the monsoon period the onset and the end of the monsoon period were derived see fig 9 the boxplots in fig 9 are per station and show the interannual variability although some variability between the different stations is evident no clear pattern e g with elevation or longitude was detected on average the monsoon duration is 72 days with an onset on june 23rd and an end on september 13th the available rainfall stations for the dhofar mountains and the salalah coastal plain were interpolated using an edk approach fig 10 a the interpolated precipitation has been derived for monsoon rainfall only cf fig 8 the extent of the interpolated area is limited by the available stations and therefore does not cover the entire mountain range cf fig 7 fig 10b shows the correlation coefficient after a jackknife test the correlation coefficients at the location of each of the rain gauges are interpolated for visualization purposes fig 10b the mean correlation coefficient is over all stations is 0 63 the interpolation performance is governed by the elevation in regions of distinct topographical differences the errors are largest combined with the cloud forest distribution and the interception gain through cloud water harvesting a cloud forest scenario was calculated that includes cloud water interception fig 11 shows the modified spatial distribution and the general increase in precipitation when including the increased precipitation under forested regions for better comparison the same color scale has been used for figs 10a and 11 mean annual precipitation 1992 2014 for the interpolated rainfall is about 129 mm year 1 min 75 max 180 and for the cloud forest precipitation scenario is about 157 mm year 1 min 75 max 354 based on the two interpolated rainfall datasets figs 10a and 11 the rainfall was separately extracted for the central and eastern zone fig 12 shows an overview of the two rainfall datasets and the respective groundwater recharge precipitation ratios the boxplots in the top panels depict the interannual rainfall variability from 1992 to 2014 clear differences between interpolated rainfall and the cloud forest scenario can be seen in the bottom panels the relative quantities for forest and non forested land cover and for rainfall based on the cloud forest scenario are displayed the differences between the central high forest cover and the eastern low forest cover are obvious as the increased cloud forest precipitation is much lower for the eastern zone the importance of the cloud forest cover is evident in the different rainfall datasets fig 12 top panels differences in groundwater recharge ratios fig 12 bottom panels can clearly be seen however this cannot be attributed to rainfall differences alone in addition to differences in rainfall differences in the geology and the aquifer properties probably play a role 4 discussion monsoon precipitation has a strong effect on the semi arid cloud forest in the dhofar mountains hildebrandt and eltahir 2006 in addition studies on the isotopic signatures of groundwater resources show that groundwater recharge in the salalah coastal plain that is fed by groundwater recharge in the dhofar mountains is highly dependent on monsoon precipitation clark et al 1987 strauch et al 2014 based on this strong dependency on monsoon precipitation figs 2 and 3 we have chosen to separate the monsoon rainfall from the available rainfall data the filtered rainfall dataset further showed the variability in monsoon rainfall amounts and monsoon season duration previous studies focusing on longer time series yet much fewer stations have shown periodicities in cyclone occurrence and monsoon strength al ajmi et al 2013 kwarteng et al 2009 within this study no periodicities could be detected this can be explained by the high intra station variability where annual monsoon rainfall amounts from station to station vary in the range of 100 200 mm year 1 cf fig 8 top panel as well as by the relatively short time series the monsoon rainfall separation mostly focused on the exclusion of cyclone rainfall that occurs frequently about every 3 7 years in the dhofar region of oman fig 8 and kwarteng et al 2009 for such a separation no comparable studies have been identified the low data availability necessitated the rainfall separation to be purely based on daily rainfall amounts and on reported monsoon periods the exclusion of cyclone events from the rainfall time series was then compared to historical cyclone tracks provided by the joint typhoon warning center there is no record of cyclone rainfall amounts with reference to cyclone tracks however we could show that cyclone tracks in close vicinity to the study region corresponded well with years that indicate high amounts of non monsoon rainfall fig 8 bottom panel for the cloud forest precipitation scenario the additional cloud water harvesting estimates of the dominant tree species anogeissus dhofarica was taken the precipitation arriving below the dominant tree species amounts to 250 of rainfall collected in the open in comparison to other studies this is an extreme value bruijnzeel et al 2011 compared tropical montane cloud forest systems with high values of 170 and 179 however the study focused on locations with much higher precipitation the minimum was 500 mm year 1 in hawaii cloud water interception to rainfall ratios above 400 have been reported cf review by giambelluca and gerold 2011 the dhofar cloud forest is a seasonal semi arid cloud forest and the three month monsoon season is characterized by heavy fog friesen et al 2017 one further explanation for the high net precipitation to rainfall ratio could be the high stemflow ratio of over 30 of net precipitation stemflow is still mostly neglected in many cloud forest studies as it often ranges below 10 bruijnzeel et al 2011 levia and germer 2015 specifically discuss stemflow and fog where dhofar is also named as the highest reported location but also mention studies in hawaii that are in a similar range for desert shrubs values of even 30 45 have been reported hildebrandt 2005 in view of the abovementioned studies 250 is still high however considering the semi arid setting the dense fog as well as the windward facing slopes of the dhofar mountains abdul wahab 2003 the high net precipitation to rainfall ratio can be considered reasonable data on further tree species endemic to the dhofar mountains could be used to better estimate the regional cloud water harvesting estimates however such data are not available the additional water gained through cloud water harvesting has then been upscaled to the whole mountain range using forest cover derived from satellite data the cloud forest precipitation scenario on average is about 20 higher than interpolated rainfall forest cover is variable throughout the mountain range which may be due to the amount of infrastructure development e g roads or touristic sites as well as due to livestock numbers although region wide data on tourist numbers and to a certain degree on livestock numbers can be found those data are not spatially distributed therefore does not allow for a detailed analysis on why forest cover differs along the mountain range with regard to elevation it can be seen that forest cover peaks at around 500 m data not shown based on the cloud forest precipitation scenario and on recharge estimates provided by the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources the ratio between recharge and precipitation could be calculated the 24 recharge precipitation ratio calculated for the central zone cf fig 12 is high compared to recharge ratios found in semi arid regions worldwide cf fig 12 in scanlon et al 2006 according to scanlon et al 2006 recharge ratios above 20 occur in semi arid regions above 800 mm year 1 annual rainfall as we present not only interpolated rainfall but also estimate forest cover cloud water harvesting and groundwater recharge there are multiple sources of error the most quantifiable source of error is with respect to the rainfall interpolation fig 10b shows the pearson s correlation of station data against the edk interpolation additional sources of error are associated with cloud water harvesting that could only be assessed when including data on more tree species with regard to the groundwater recharge estimates further studies on both tree species net precipitation and detailed groundwater modeling is therefore required to provide a clear error estimate 5 conclusions this study provides a filtered rainfall dataset for the monsoon season in the dhofar mountains that was used to provide interpolated rainfall datasets from 1992 to 2014 of i monsoon rainfall and of ii monsoon rainfall including the cloud forest impact on average the cloud forest impact amounts to a 20 increase in precipitation in the dhofar mountains cf figs 10a and 11 as shown by previous work groundwater recharge to the salalah coastal plain is mainly influenced by monsoon rainfall the spatially explicit rainfall dataset in combination with the impact of cloud forest ecohydrology now allows to better estimate the effect of land cover changes on water availability in the semi arid dhofar mountains and salalah coastal region with regard to groundwater recharge the cloud forest rainfall scenario has been used to derive recharge precipitation ratios for two regions the central and eastern coastal region results show marked differences between the two regions with a 24 recharge ratio for the central and a 7 recharge ratio for the eastern region that are both relatively high for semi arid regions the effect of cloud forest cover on recharge rates however has to be further investigated as differences in geology as well as different land cover and use and their transpiration rates may also play a role future research should therefore focus on identifying smaller recharge regions with markedly different cloud forest cover in combination with detailed hydrogeologic modeling acknowledgements jan friesen and thomas mueller have been supported by the project submarine groundwater discharge

8519,study region the dhofar mountains are located on the arabian peninsula in southern oman unlike other regions of oman the dhofar mountains have an annual monsoon season that results in a semi arid cloud forest the region highly depends on groundwater resources and the dhofar mountain range is the major recharge area for the salalah coastal plain study focus forests in cloud impacted areas can harvest cloud water droplets in addition to receiving rainfall the forest interception and recharge relevant net precipitation are investigated by ecohydrological studies these studies are however limited to the point or experimental plot scale and to particular tree species groundwater studies in contrast are often linked to catchment or groundwater aquifer boundaries and are therefore calculated at meso to regional scale to be able to utilize findings from ecohydrological site studies for regional groundwater studies we regionalize field site studies through cloud forest distribution and rainfall interpolation in a semi arid data scarce region heavily dependent on groundwater resources new hydrological insights for the region our results are a cloud forest precipitation scenario that quantifies the additional rainfall gained through cloud water harvesting by the cloud forest in comparison to interpolated rainfall the precipitation available for recharge within the dhofar mountains increases by 20 considering a recharge precipitation ratio calculation the recharge ratios in the region are up to 24 for highly forested areas keywords rainfall monsoon cloud forest semi arid ecohydrology groundwater recharge 1 introduction the availability of sustainable water resources is an essential concern in arid and semi arid regions on the arabian peninsula water withdrawal is estimated to be more than five times higher than renewable water frenken 2009 however the estimation of such numbers is based on extremely sparse data and subject to large uncertainties using global atmospheric reanalysis models lorenz and kunstmann 2012 demonstrated the effect of sparse rain gauge distributions on the uncertainty of daily rainfall estimated by the reanalyses as rainfall determines current groundwater recharge the recharge zones and their functioning is of paramount importance in quantifying renewable water resources the dhofar mountain range of oman is one of these recharge areas and supplies both the nejd desert region to the north as well as the salalah coastal plain oman s second largest city to the south with groundwater recharge the dhofar mountains feature a semi arid seasonal cloud forest fed by the annual khareef monsoon season hildebrandt and eltahir 2006 besides the annual monsoon the region is subject to strong cyclonic events up to 400 mm within a few days that occur irregularly every 2 6 years strauch et al 2014 analyzed the isotopic signatures of rainfall spring discharge and groundwater results show that groundwater recharge from the dhofar mountains to the salalah coastal plain is mainly linked to monsoon rainfall this is also supported by the observations of i higher soil moisture during the monsoon than during and after cyclone rainfall events hildebrandt et al 2007 and ii greater surface runoff during cyclonic rainfall due to infiltration excess flow vs little to no surface runoff during the monsoon forests intercept and redistribute precipitation into different components throughfall and stemflow levia et al 2011 the sum of throughfall and stemflow determines net precipitation the amount of water available below the canopy water that is intercepted by the canopy is being evaporated and therefore mostly results in a loss of water carlyle moses and gash 2011 net precipitation is classically measured by budgeting measurements of throughfall stemflow and open rainfall friesen et al 2015 during the khareef season in southern oman precipitation is available as i rainfall and as ii fog also called horizontal precipitation horizontal precipitation is mainly a turbulent process where cloud droplets are mixed inside the canopy and are intercepted by the vegetation hildebrandt et al 2007 shuttleworth 1977 whereas rainfall is recorded via rain gauges the amount of fog is usually not measured in particular trees have the ability to harvest cloud water more efficiently than lower vegetation yielding higher amounts of horizontal precipitation in addition to rainfall hildebrandt and eltahir 2008 when fog moves through the canopy water accumulates at the leaves and branches and then either evaporates drips off as throughfall or flows down the stem as stemflow cloud forest hydrology has been extensively studied bruijnzeel et al 2011 holwerda et al 2010 especially in tropical montane cloud forests the importance of cloud or fog interception to groundwater recharge has also been shown by clark et al 1987 for the dhofar region by ingraham and matthews 1988 for kenia and by sawaske and freyberg 2014 for california the annual monsoon season in dhofar through its interaction with the vegetation bawain 2012 hildebrandt et al 2007 hildebrandt and eltahir 2007 facilitates survival of the dhofar cloud forest also through forest canopy redistribution net precipitation is spatially heterogeneously distributed in throughfall and stemflow whereas the latter is especially important for infiltration and recharge germer 2013 kacimov et al 2010 liang et al 2011 schwärzel et al 2012 this is further emphasized by the fact that stemflow in the dhofar cloud forest can reach up to 40 of net precipitation bawain 2012 which even on a global scale is amongst the highest recorded stemflow contributions cf levia and frost 2003 forest interception studies which are required to assess interception and quantify the recharge relevant net precipitation are however often only possible at point or experimental plot scale and are limited to the studied tree species groundwater recharge and consequently also the input data to recharge models in contrast are required at relatively large scales e g linked to hydrological catchments or groundwater aquifer boundaries and thus is located at the other end of the spatial scale scanlon et al 2002 only few studies provide interception estimates on a large global scale miralles et al 2010 murray 2014 however those ignore processes like horizontal precipitation and are therefore not suitable to translate the local eco hydrological processes into recharge relevant processes studies regarding the precipitation in oman exist on a national scale and are often limited to two or three rainfall stations in the study region al ajmi et al 2013 kwarteng et al 2009 in this study we use data from 24 rainfall stations for the dhofar region that allowed us to capture the variability across the mountain range and the coastal region and enabled us to produce daily interpolated rainfall from 1992 to 2014 satellite data for vegetation and elevation were used to derive could forest cover and extent assumptions that were used to incorporate the cloud forest in a precipitation scenario were taken from previous studies the main objectives of this study are to separate the monsoon rainfall relevant for the coastal plain recharge to interpolate the monsoon rainfall to generate an interpolated rainfall dataset including cloud forest impact and to provide a basic groundwater balance based on the two rainfall datasets and groundwater recharge precipitation ratio estimates 2 data and methods 2 1 site description the dhofar mountains are located in southern oman and act as a boundary between the desert region nejd to the north and the salalah coastal plain including oman s second largest city to the south fig 1 extending for almost 300 km into yemen to the southwest the dhofar mountains are a crescent shaped coastal mountain range that encompasses the coastal plain around the city of salalah the coastal plain is about 15 km wide at its broadest point and 60 km long from the flat coastal plain the elevation rises abruptly in the mountains to about 900 1300 m a m s l in the study region jebel samhan outside the study region has an elevation of about 1700 m a m s l groundwater recharge from the mountains feeds the coastal aquifer that is intensively used for agriculture and municipal water use precipitation can be subdivided into monsoon precipitation and cyclone events the monsoon season occurs from mid june to mid september and is characterized by low intensity rainfall and drizzle 10 mm day 1 and dense fog along the mountain range visibility down to 5 m personal observation during the monsoon season an inversion layer develops above the mountain crest that holds the clouds on the southern side of the mountains abdul wahab 2003 hildebrandt et al 2007 cyclonic rainfall events occur irregularly between 2 6 years cf 3 results for a couple of days and yield high rainfall amounts of up to 400 mm kwarteng et al 2009 the mountainous land cover ranges from cloud forests tree heights 10m cropland and grassland to bare rock soils are shallow with a depth of 0 5 1 m friesen et al 2011 next to its natural botanical and hydrological value bawain 2012 el sheikh 2013 the cloud forest also has a high economic value as the monsoon season in dhofar is a touristic hotspot throughout the arabian peninsula the predominant tree species in the dhofar mountains is anogeissus dhofarica kürschner et al 2004 miller et al 1988 with tree heights between 2 and 10 m observed stand densities from experimental sites are between 1800 and 3800 trees per hectare hildebrandt et al 2007 bawain 2012 however it has to be taken into account that the tree heights are relatively low favoring a high density and that the forest in whole mountain range is highly fragmented cf fig 1 the cloud forest ranges from the mountain crest up to 1000 m a m s l in the north to the foothills in the south and is a deciduous and water limited cloud forest that depends on cloud prevalence for survival hildebrandt and eltahir 2006 forest cover is endangered both through livestock roaming freely in the mountain range cf brinkmann et al 2009 as well as through the extensive development of tourist and transport infrastructure personal communication ministry of environment and climate affairs 2 1 1 geology and hydrogeology the main geologic formations in the dhofar mountains and in the coastal plain are limestone of tertiary origin in the mountains the layers of the hadramout group are present from bottom to top these are the umm er radhuma uer the rus rus and the dammam dam formations the water level in the mountains is between 500 and 600 m and a groundwater divide separates flow to the north najd and flow to the south coastal plain the uer with its karstic limestone is the main aquifer in the mountains the main aquifer in the coastal plain is the adawnib formation of the fars group overlain by the nar formation and quaternary deposits the saturated thickness of the coastal aquifer which also shows karst characteristics is about 70 m both the dhofar mountains as well as the coastal plain show karstic characteristics water infiltrates in the outcrops of the uer in the dhofar mountains and recharges the coastal plain aquifer which is indicated by increasing spring discharge and groundwater levels in the plain annually during and after the monsoon season fig 2 depicts the water level of an exemplary well the isotopic signatures observed in groundwater and spring discharge as well as in rainfall data from both cyclone events and monsoon rainfall fig 3 show that the groundwater that recharges the salalah coastal plain aquifers originates from monsoon rainfall both cyclone rainfall as well as groundwater found in the northern desert region nejd show different isotopic signatures from the coastal plain groundwater and spring discharge cf clark et al 1987 strauch et al 2014 2 2 data sources and pre processing 2 2 1 rainfall data and interpolation daily rainfall data were provided by the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources of oman mrmwr as well as through the global summary of the day gsod data set from the national climate data center https data noaa gov dataset global surface summary of the day gsod in total 23 stations were used 9 located in the salalah coastal plain and 14 located in the dhofar mountains to our knowledge this is the largest rainfall dataset available for the southern dhofar region data availability goes back to 1973 however our analysis focuses on the period from 1992 to 2014 as only few stations were available prior to 1992 additionally to the local observations the analyses are based on interpolated rainfall maps cf section 2 2 2 the station data were processed into monsoon and non monsoon rainfall mostly cyclones fig 4 shows the data availability during monsoon for all stations used in the analysis as some of the cyclonic events occur closely before or after the monsoon season their distinction is in some cases difficult or even impossible the separation of annual rainfall into monsoon only rainfall was based on reported monsoon times kwarteng et al 2009 and rainfall amounts based on station data to retrieve rainfall time series for monsoon rainfall only monsoon season cyclone events were filtered automatically according to the data processing scheme shown in fig 5 for station averaging the data were filtered depending on the amount of missing data and the recorded rainfall the rainfall time series is intermittent and includes missing values see fig 4 all years with more than 20 missing values during the monsoon season are removed the precipitation dataset includes stations which report no precipitation 0 mm where they in fact should report station failure missing value to filter for those situations entire years not exceeding 10 mm year 1 are excluded 2 2 2 spatial interpolation of precipitation the interpolation of the station data is based on kriging with external drift edk ahmed and de marsily 1987 this geostatistical method estimates the precipitation at a location based on the information of the neighboring stations the relation and weight of the neighboring stations are determined based on a variogram as additional information the terrain elevation digital elevation model is used as external drift elevation data were taken from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm reuter et al 2007 for the external drift the srtm data were upscaled to 1 km 1 km pixels the number of 23 stations is small for the area of interest which is about 1400 km2 area of the mountain regions in the central and eastern part cf fig 7 edk depends as any statistically method on the amount of available data and thus is probably uncertain for the application within this domain as edk is a well established method buytaert et al 2006 to estimate spatial distributed fields of geo scientific data we herein applied the edk approach alternative approaches such as inverse distance thiessen polygons copulas bárdossy and pegram 2009 prism daly et al 1994 and shepard s angular distance weighting algorithm shepard 1968 can also be applied for interpolation the interpolation of precipitation data is performed using all available monsoon data including station years with more than 20 missing values but neglecting station years with precipitation less than 10 mm a 1 the precipitation variability between the rain gauges is assessed by a semi variogram the parameters of the variogram nugget range and sill are consecutively applied for edk as they determine the weighting between neighboring stations for the precipitation estimation in a given location the variogram as well as the external drift kriging itself depend on several parameters like the maximum station search distance type of the variogram experimental spherical gaussian and fitting parameters for the variogram several options were tested whereas a search distance of 100 km and an exponential variogram led to the best results in terms of cross location evaluation the quality of the precipitation interpolation is assessed by a jackknife method leave one out strategy therefore the precipitation is interpolated at the location of a rain gauge by neglecting the observed time series this method is repeated for each rain gauge comparing the interpolated time series with the observation assesses the quality of the interpolation 2 2 3 dhofar cloud forest precipitation budget cloud forests have the ability to harvest fog water which can result in net precipitation that is higher than the rainfall measured in the open thereby not necessarily being subject to interception loss but in some cases to interception gain in the dhofar cloud forest the precipitation budget and the interception gain has been extensively studied bawain et al 2010 bawain 2012 friesen et al 2011 hildebrandt and eltahir 2006 2007 2008 hildebrandt et al 2007 for several years at two sites in the dhofar mountains gogub and tawi attair hildebrandt 2005 page 91 estimated net precipitation for the years 2003 and 2004 to be 2 3 times the amount of rainfall the high uncertainty was owed to sensor failures however data from 2008 and 2009 unpublished results by hildebrandt bawain show net precipitation to rainfall ratios of 2 56 and 2 58 respectively estimates from hildebrandt 2005 as well as unpublished results by hildebrandt and bawain are all based on observations from an anogeissus dhofarica forest patch and were derived using the water budget method for the water budget method rainfall is measured in the open field or above the canopy stemflow and throughfall gauges distributed within the forested area provide net precipitation the sum of stemflow and throughfall cf hildebrandt 2005 for a detailed methodology regarding monitoring and water budgeting based on the provided estimates for the predominant tree species anogeissus dhofarica a net precipitation to rainfall ratio of 2 5 was chosen fig 6 shows the schematic principle of cloud forest hydrology for the predominant tree species anogeissus dhofarica and the contribution of cloud water to net precipitation 2 2 4 cloud forest distribution cloud forest distribution is based on post monsoon landsat 8 data from 2014 mid sept to dec with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m gps geolocated photographs unpublished data were taken as ground truth for the classification the image collection and classification algorithm was conducted using the google earth engine google earth engine team 2015 the cloud forest extends from the mountain crest to the foothills during the monsoon season an inversion layer just above the mountain range results in a dense fog that is sustained throughout the three month monsoon period this fog extends into the coastal plain abdul wahab 2003 forest in the region only occurs due to the additional horizontal precipitation without fog only shrubs would survive due to the limited water availability as irrigated areas show similarly ndvi values a filter had to be applied that distinguished between cloud forest and irrigation plots in the coastal plain this was accomplished by applying a 150 m a m s l elevation threshold elevation data were taken from the shuttle radar topography mission reuter et al 2007 the area classified as cloud forest see fig 7 is subject to change cf 2 1 site description and may have been larger in former times as shown in fig 7 most forested areas are located on the steep slopes of the wadi valleys and the forest cover generally decreases from west to east using the satellite based cloud forest distribution the percentile cloud forest cover was calculated for the 1 km 1 km pixels of the edk interpolation for the cloud forest rainfall scenario the proportionate cloud water interception was added to each time step of the edk interpolated dataset eq 1 1 p c f p a n c f p a c f α where p is the interpolated rainfall in m ancf the non forested pixel area in m2 acf the forested pixel area in m2 and α the factor determining the additional cloud water harvest set to 2 5 cf fig 6 pcf the interpolated rainfall including the cloud forest impact is later converted back from m3 to mm 2 2 5 groundwater recharge groundwater aquifers in the salalah coastal plain are mainly fed by precipitation in the mountains the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources mrmwr divides the mountains and coastal plain into the central freshwater zone and the eastern brackish zone see fig 6 to compare the interpolated precipitation to groundwater groundwater recharge was calculated for the two groundwater zones groundwater recharge is the annual increase of water stored in an aquifer and is calculated based on spring discharge water level data of wells and the specific yield of the respective aquifer for this study we used data for the salalah coastal plain provided by the mrmwr that reported averaged annual water level increases of 4m year for the central zone and of 2 m year for the eastern zone grc 2005 and a specific yield of 0 03 mwr 1992 using the water level increase per year and the specific yield of the upper groundwater aquifer an annual recharge was calculated eq 2 based on the water table fluctuation wtf method scanlon et al 2002 2 r s y δ h δ t where sy is the specific yield set to 0 03 h is the water level and t time δh δt is the water level increase set to 4 m year 1 in central zone and to 2 m year 1 in the eastern zone annual recharge was used to derive the recharge precipitation ratio cf scanlon et al 2006 3 results the results are based on i station data analysis and on ii edk interpolated precipitation and groundwater recharge data station data were used to separate rainfall into monsoon and non monsoon rainfall to derive monsoon season characteristics and to calculate wet and dry years the monsoon rainfall was used as input data to the edk interpolation and to calculate a cloud forest precipitation scenario as well as available precipitation for the different groundwater recharge zones based on the rainfall processing described in section 2 2 1 the individual station data series were separated into monsoon and non monsoon rainfall the resulting precipitation is depicted in fig 8 that shows the annual monsoon rainfall for all stations and the corresponding non monsoon rainfall using data from the joint typhoon warning center jtwc we show that years with high non monsoon rainfall corresponds to years during which cyclone tracks were in close vicinity of the study region based on both monsoon as well as on non monsoon interannual variability no clear periodicity could be detected based on station data statistical metrics of monsoon rainfall and total rainfall incl cyclones were calculated for monsoon wet years are above 190 mm year 1 and dry years below 105 mm year 1 based on the upper and lower 20th percentiles cf table 1 following the separation into monsoon rainfall only monsoon specific metrics such as the duration of the monsoon period the onset and the end of the monsoon period were derived see fig 9 the boxplots in fig 9 are per station and show the interannual variability although some variability between the different stations is evident no clear pattern e g with elevation or longitude was detected on average the monsoon duration is 72 days with an onset on june 23rd and an end on september 13th the available rainfall stations for the dhofar mountains and the salalah coastal plain were interpolated using an edk approach fig 10 a the interpolated precipitation has been derived for monsoon rainfall only cf fig 8 the extent of the interpolated area is limited by the available stations and therefore does not cover the entire mountain range cf fig 7 fig 10b shows the correlation coefficient after a jackknife test the correlation coefficients at the location of each of the rain gauges are interpolated for visualization purposes fig 10b the mean correlation coefficient is over all stations is 0 63 the interpolation performance is governed by the elevation in regions of distinct topographical differences the errors are largest combined with the cloud forest distribution and the interception gain through cloud water harvesting a cloud forest scenario was calculated that includes cloud water interception fig 11 shows the modified spatial distribution and the general increase in precipitation when including the increased precipitation under forested regions for better comparison the same color scale has been used for figs 10a and 11 mean annual precipitation 1992 2014 for the interpolated rainfall is about 129 mm year 1 min 75 max 180 and for the cloud forest precipitation scenario is about 157 mm year 1 min 75 max 354 based on the two interpolated rainfall datasets figs 10a and 11 the rainfall was separately extracted for the central and eastern zone fig 12 shows an overview of the two rainfall datasets and the respective groundwater recharge precipitation ratios the boxplots in the top panels depict the interannual rainfall variability from 1992 to 2014 clear differences between interpolated rainfall and the cloud forest scenario can be seen in the bottom panels the relative quantities for forest and non forested land cover and for rainfall based on the cloud forest scenario are displayed the differences between the central high forest cover and the eastern low forest cover are obvious as the increased cloud forest precipitation is much lower for the eastern zone the importance of the cloud forest cover is evident in the different rainfall datasets fig 12 top panels differences in groundwater recharge ratios fig 12 bottom panels can clearly be seen however this cannot be attributed to rainfall differences alone in addition to differences in rainfall differences in the geology and the aquifer properties probably play a role 4 discussion monsoon precipitation has a strong effect on the semi arid cloud forest in the dhofar mountains hildebrandt and eltahir 2006 in addition studies on the isotopic signatures of groundwater resources show that groundwater recharge in the salalah coastal plain that is fed by groundwater recharge in the dhofar mountains is highly dependent on monsoon precipitation clark et al 1987 strauch et al 2014 based on this strong dependency on monsoon precipitation figs 2 and 3 we have chosen to separate the monsoon rainfall from the available rainfall data the filtered rainfall dataset further showed the variability in monsoon rainfall amounts and monsoon season duration previous studies focusing on longer time series yet much fewer stations have shown periodicities in cyclone occurrence and monsoon strength al ajmi et al 2013 kwarteng et al 2009 within this study no periodicities could be detected this can be explained by the high intra station variability where annual monsoon rainfall amounts from station to station vary in the range of 100 200 mm year 1 cf fig 8 top panel as well as by the relatively short time series the monsoon rainfall separation mostly focused on the exclusion of cyclone rainfall that occurs frequently about every 3 7 years in the dhofar region of oman fig 8 and kwarteng et al 2009 for such a separation no comparable studies have been identified the low data availability necessitated the rainfall separation to be purely based on daily rainfall amounts and on reported monsoon periods the exclusion of cyclone events from the rainfall time series was then compared to historical cyclone tracks provided by the joint typhoon warning center there is no record of cyclone rainfall amounts with reference to cyclone tracks however we could show that cyclone tracks in close vicinity to the study region corresponded well with years that indicate high amounts of non monsoon rainfall fig 8 bottom panel for the cloud forest precipitation scenario the additional cloud water harvesting estimates of the dominant tree species anogeissus dhofarica was taken the precipitation arriving below the dominant tree species amounts to 250 of rainfall collected in the open in comparison to other studies this is an extreme value bruijnzeel et al 2011 compared tropical montane cloud forest systems with high values of 170 and 179 however the study focused on locations with much higher precipitation the minimum was 500 mm year 1 in hawaii cloud water interception to rainfall ratios above 400 have been reported cf review by giambelluca and gerold 2011 the dhofar cloud forest is a seasonal semi arid cloud forest and the three month monsoon season is characterized by heavy fog friesen et al 2017 one further explanation for the high net precipitation to rainfall ratio could be the high stemflow ratio of over 30 of net precipitation stemflow is still mostly neglected in many cloud forest studies as it often ranges below 10 bruijnzeel et al 2011 levia and germer 2015 specifically discuss stemflow and fog where dhofar is also named as the highest reported location but also mention studies in hawaii that are in a similar range for desert shrubs values of even 30 45 have been reported hildebrandt 2005 in view of the abovementioned studies 250 is still high however considering the semi arid setting the dense fog as well as the windward facing slopes of the dhofar mountains abdul wahab 2003 the high net precipitation to rainfall ratio can be considered reasonable data on further tree species endemic to the dhofar mountains could be used to better estimate the regional cloud water harvesting estimates however such data are not available the additional water gained through cloud water harvesting has then been upscaled to the whole mountain range using forest cover derived from satellite data the cloud forest precipitation scenario on average is about 20 higher than interpolated rainfall forest cover is variable throughout the mountain range which may be due to the amount of infrastructure development e g roads or touristic sites as well as due to livestock numbers although region wide data on tourist numbers and to a certain degree on livestock numbers can be found those data are not spatially distributed therefore does not allow for a detailed analysis on why forest cover differs along the mountain range with regard to elevation it can be seen that forest cover peaks at around 500 m data not shown based on the cloud forest precipitation scenario and on recharge estimates provided by the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources the ratio between recharge and precipitation could be calculated the 24 recharge precipitation ratio calculated for the central zone cf fig 12 is high compared to recharge ratios found in semi arid regions worldwide cf fig 12 in scanlon et al 2006 according to scanlon et al 2006 recharge ratios above 20 occur in semi arid regions above 800 mm year 1 annual rainfall as we present not only interpolated rainfall but also estimate forest cover cloud water harvesting and groundwater recharge there are multiple sources of error the most quantifiable source of error is with respect to the rainfall interpolation fig 10b shows the pearson s correlation of station data against the edk interpolation additional sources of error are associated with cloud water harvesting that could only be assessed when including data on more tree species with regard to the groundwater recharge estimates further studies on both tree species net precipitation and detailed groundwater modeling is therefore required to provide a clear error estimate 5 conclusions this study provides a filtered rainfall dataset for the monsoon season in the dhofar mountains that was used to provide interpolated rainfall datasets from 1992 to 2014 of i monsoon rainfall and of ii monsoon rainfall including the cloud forest impact on average the cloud forest impact amounts to a 20 increase in precipitation in the dhofar mountains cf figs 10a and 11 as shown by previous work groundwater recharge to the salalah coastal plain is mainly influenced by monsoon rainfall the spatially explicit rainfall dataset in combination with the impact of cloud forest ecohydrology now allows to better estimate the effect of land cover changes on water availability in the semi arid dhofar mountains and salalah coastal region with regard to groundwater recharge the cloud forest rainfall scenario has been used to derive recharge precipitation ratios for two regions the central and eastern coastal region results show marked differences between the two regions with a 24 recharge ratio for the central and a 7 recharge ratio for the eastern region that are both relatively high for semi arid regions the effect of cloud forest cover on recharge rates however has to be further investigated as differences in geology as well as different land cover and use and their transpiration rates may also play a role future research should therefore focus on identifying smaller recharge regions with markedly different cloud forest cover in combination with detailed hydrogeologic modeling acknowledgements jan friesen and thomas mueller have been supported by the project submarine groundwater discharge
