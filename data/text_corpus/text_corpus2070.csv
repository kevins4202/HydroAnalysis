10350,as different hydrological phenomena caused by different climates have a far reaching impact on agricultural sustainable development analysis of the impact of soil erosion on agricultural sustainable planting under different climates was conducted the swat model was used to quantitatively analyze the regional soil and water loss affected by different climate changes in addition the evaluation and prediction model of agricultural sustainable planting was constructed with epic software in order to achieve the agricultural sustainable planting by selecting appropriate crops based on the analysis of yulin city in shaanxi province the results showed that with fixed precipitation the increase and decrease of 5 c temperature would lead to a change rate of soil loss of 27 78 and 9 52 respectively with fixed temperature the increase and decrease of 20 precipitation would lead to a change rate of soil loss of 21 43 and 38 10 respectively the situation of soil erosion under the slope environment was more serious and the yield of grain and farming income decreased it is necessary to choose reasonable planting methods and environmental control policies to reduce the impact of soil erosion on agricultural sustainable planting currently conservation tillage is adopted as the control measure in yulin the results of this paper indicated that slope change and crop rotation should be adopted simultaneously to realize the coordination of soil and water conservation and agricultural benefits under the climate change background keywords different climates soil erosion agriculture sustainable planting modeling analysis 1 introduction the sustainable development of agriculture has always been the goal of agricultural economic development and construction and it is a new concept stemmed from the sustainable development of the environment in recent years leal filho et al 2018 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 li et al 2017 the sustainable development of agriculture is consistent with the institutional and technical transformation of natural resources ensuring that the current agricultural resources meet the needs of contemporary human use while future generations can have inexhaustible agricultural resources thompson 2017 the concept of agricultural sustainability was first proposed by western countries and has been widely applied in european and american countries however in the process of studying agricultural sustainability the challenges brought by the development of soil geography are inevitable keesstra et al 2018 although soil geography is explicitly recognized as a subdiscipline of physical geography and soil science it has gradually been accepted as a complementary and descriptive subdiscipline of botany agronomy and geology at various times in the last century rodrigo comino et al 2018a until contemporary in addition to being a decisive factor in agricultural development soil geographers represented by rodrigo comino have found that they can also play an important role in sustainable processes by studying issues related to human beings and the natural environment rodrigo comino et al 2018a keesstra et al 2016 moreover rodrigo comino et al 2018b believed that soil geography could be defined as a discipline that studies the causes of soil distribution and its relationship with human beings in recent years with the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs soil geographers have become more concerned about how to contribute the research team led by professor keesstra systematically summarized how to contribute to the realization of sustainable development goals more effectively the framework of soil and land stakeholders proposed by the them is instructive for our study keesstra et al 2018 visser et al 2019 in their opinion soil geographers should regard society and ecology as an interconnected system soil degradation and restoration will have a joint impact on global food health water and climate and attention should be paid to the attitude of stakeholders and changes in economic conditions in the realization of sustainability keesstra et al 2016 2018 visser et al 2019 different from previous studies on europe and america the present study focuses on china located in asia the form of agriculture in china is slightly different from that in european and american countries the premise of sustainable development of agriculture featuring chinese characteristics is based on science and technology to ensure the sustainable development of the environment the continuous availability of the soil and the stability of production fan et al 2018 among the factors highlighted by chinese government stable production is undoubtedly the most important for such a country with large population therefore sustainably achieving stable agricultural production is the core of almost all planning as mentioned above the impact of climate change on the sustainability of agriculture in ecosystems can be huge in recent years carbon emissions have continued to increase and the trend of global warming has not stopped posing great challenges on the sustainable development of agriculture qin and lin 2019 at present the impact of global climate change is mainly on the distribution time and intensity of rain and snow and it is more likely to cause extreme meteorological disasters under the general environment of global climate change temperature and precipitation conditions have changed significantly the precipitation caused frequent soil erosion lin et al 2019 sharifi et al 2018 the problem of soil erosion has always been a critical issue that must be solved in human survival and development so far there are various degrees of soil erosion in multiple countries globally which severely restricts the development of the agricultural economy in many countries according to survey data the global cultivated land area was about 1 5 108hmÂ² including antarctica however about 10 of the soil is covered by ice and snow and some of the soil cannot be agriculturally produced because it does not meet the growth conditions of most crops cramer and solomon 1993 lin et al 2019 only the remaining 22 of the soil can be agriculturally planted once serious soil erosion problems occur nearly one third of the cultivated land worldwide will be affected therefore climate change soil erosion and sustainable agricultural production are inextricably connected due to the remaining historical problems economic development level of china has been lagging behind that of the european and american countries before the reform and opening up in the process of moving towards the 21 st century the economy of china is developing by leaps and bounds continually narrowing the economic gap with european and american countries nevertheless most of economic development in china is at the expense of resources and the environment resulting in severe soil erosion and environmental problems in the context of massive economic construction and continuous population growth large scale economic activities have led to the constant reduction of cultivated land area in china which has caused great harm to the production of food crops and has also caused enormous pressure on the sustainable development of the national economy song et al 2019 gong et al 2019 additionally domestic soil and water theory practice of china started later than developed countries it is urgent to study a feasible soil erosion control plan to promote the stable and healthy development of agricultural economy in china controlling soil erosion has always been one of the important tasks of the government s water conservancy construction achieving sustainable agricultural planting through soil and water conservation is the main way to promote the long term development of soil erosion areas yan et al 2018 while the existing research mainly considered the treatment of soil erosion and improvement of agricultural planting soil conditions there are few related studies on the impact of climate change on soil and water loss therefore this study focuses on the impact of soil erosion on sustainable agricultural planting under different climate changes this study establishes a model to simulate the impact of soil erosion on sustainable agricultural planting under the climate change background and aims to provide an important reference for the sustainable development of the chinese agricultural economy 2 literature background so far european and american countries have made breakthrough progress in the study of soil erosion control the most representative of which is the soil erosion model the research on soil erosion control in europe and the united states started early as early as the middle of the last century american researcher smith et al designed the soil erosion equation by analyzing the data of soil erosion data over several decades borrelli et al 2017 researchers in the industry have widely recognized this equation and gradually applied it in practice a group of european soil erosion researchers led by morgan and quinton proposed a european soil erosion model based on the analysis of european soil erosion characteristics morgan et al 1998 with the further development of related research the work of soil and water loss control is no longer limited to the model and calculation of soil erosion but to discover the main causes of soil and water loss through experiments or simulations propose corresponding protection measures and gradually consider the important role of human in the control for example through rainfall simulation experiments rodrigo comino et al 2018a 2018b found that grape planting in bare soil would lead to soil erosion rate as high as 4 1 mg ha 1 h 1 besides a high water loss value of more than 30 was detected soil erosion rate is higher in different slope position and different environmental characteristics the results showed that bare soil was the most important driving factors for the increased soil erosion rate similarly citrus plantations as a representative of the mediterranean citrus orchard were also studied by keesstra et al 2018 it turned out that in many mediterranean regions citrus groves have high rates of soil loss due to the expansion of drip irrigation on slopes and the widespread use of glyphosate in order to reduce these unsustainable soil losses keesstra et al 2018 conducted 40 rainfall simulation tests and found that straw mulching was an effective tool to reduce soil loss in citrus plantations especially on sloping lands straw mulching can be an effective solution by slowing down runoff initiation and reducing runoff generation it is noteworthy that the human factors of governance have also been discussed in detail in citrus plantations as well cerda et al 2018 found that crop or weed growth in citrus plantations was associated with lower soil erosion this was because vegetation coverage was high enough to enhance infiltration and avoid surface erosion making surface erosion out of contact however cerda et al 2018 found that such positive effects did not persuade local farmers to take their advice because they preferred clean bare soil with no plants other than citrus crops to change such behaviors cerda 2018 found that subsidies are the best choice to persuade farmers to change their management mode and at the same time they should make up for their lack of awareness of environmental protection it can be seen that the research on soil and water conservation and planting in europe has been relatively developed and the corresponding results have provided a reference basis for decision makers to a large extent similar to europe the american soil and water loss controlling schemes are also comprehensive and are committed to maintaining the balance between the soil and water loss control and landowners interests crosson 2016 therefore in western countries a unified controlling scheme of biology farming and engineering is used comprehensively in terms of asian countries japan for example is considered as the most advanced country in asia in terms of soil and water conservation because its agricultural land area and soil topography do not occupy the natural advantage therefore japan attaches great importance to environmental protection research on soil erosion control methods has been carried out relatively early and advanced results have been achieved so far such as engineering methods and farming methods kawahigashi 2019 pheng et al 2019 however due to the unique characteristics of soil erosion in japan most of its controlling schemes are various engineering measures and seldom take other factors such as farmer into consideration china is similar to japan after the emergence of the soil erosion equation many chinese scholars have conducted in depth studies exploring the establishment of soil erosion prediction models suitable in china in recent years china s domestic research on soil erosion control measures has been making progress smoothly fu et al 2011 haiyan and liying 2017 due to topography and landforms complexity in china relevant scholars have proposed targeted soil erosion s controlling schemes based on the characteristics of different topography and landforms these schemes can be summarized as three categories of engineering measures forest and grass measures or plant measures and farming measures these measures are considered to be applicable to the prevention and control of soil erosion in different areas however nearly all of the measures paid much attention to engineering methods or does not take into account soil and land stakeholder framework proposed by keesstra et al 2018 in order to narrow these gaps this paper focused on soil erosion and agricultural planting under the climate change of the loess plateau as the research objects research on climate change has attracted much attention in china in recent years the research on the impact of climate change on soil erosion on the loess plateau has made some progress and achieved some results however due to the complexity of soil erosion process the complexity of climate change the impact of climate change on soil erosion still needs to be strengthened in various aspects the possible impact of climate change on soil erosion in the loess plateau region has been recognized since the first ipcc assessment report whereas due to the complexity of the problem researchers only began to carry out relevant studies until the early 2000s compared with the research on climate change the research on the impact of climate change on soil erosion started relatively late and the findings emerging from previous researches are limited and sometimes even inconsistent jing and jiao 2011 in addition with the continuous increase of population in china the development of agricultural industry has gradually increased the pressure on the agricultural environment and the development of agricultural industry has caused soil and water loss non point source pollution air pollution and other environmental problems the most serious environmental problem in the loess hilly region is soil and water loss in loess hilly areas due to deforestation overgrazing wasteland destruction and unreasonable tillage serious soil erosion has been caused jing and jiao 2011 have shown that the impact of human activities on ecosystems leads to soil erosion which far exceeds natural erosion therefore how to coordinate agricultural production and soil erosion is another important issue in addition to climate change to solve these problems this study focuses on yulin city in the loess plateau region and draws conclusions through the simulation of different climate scenarios and different planting methods as a supplement and validation of previous studies in addition the value of this study is also reflected in the fact that it can provide reference and comparison for the associations between climate and soil erosion in different regional environments in the future by conducting a micro study on specific regions 3 research methods 3 1 research objective 3 1 1 an overview of the studied area yulin city is located in the northern part of shaanxi province at the junction of shaanxi gansu ningxia shanxi and neimenggu the eastern part of yulin faces the yellow river and shanxi province and the western part connects gansu and ningxia the south of yulin is known as the yan an area and the north is connected with inner mongolia it is located between 36 95 39 57 n and 107 47 111 25 e with a total of 12 counties in terms of the terrain of this area the northwest is high in altitude and the southeast part has a lower altitude the basic landform types include sandy areas hills and gullies and beam shaped hills covering a total land area of 43 113 km2 accounting for 21 16 of the total land area of shaanxi province unfortunately yulin is not only one of the areas with the most serious soil erosion in china but also a typical area with fragile ecological environment yulin is located in the loess plateau in northwest china it has a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate and is a typical area with a mixture of agriculture and animal husbandry the area is also one of china s important energy development zones including the development of coal petroleum and other energy sources and related heavy industries even though the development of these energy resources and industries is the foundation of the social and economic development of yulin area it also brings tremendous pressure to the fragile ecological environment further increasing the land resource carrying pressure in yulin area 3 1 2 topographic characteristics in terms of the topographic characteristics the altitude of yulin declines from the northwest part to the southeast part see fig 1 hao mountain in the south of dingbian county in the west of yulin is 1 901 m above sea level which is the highest point in the entire region the lowest point in the southeast is at the mouth of the wuding river running into the yellow river with an altitude of 610 m most of the east part ranges from 1 000 1200 meters above sea level and the west part is mostly between 1200 1500 meters the landforms of yulin area mainly included three types namely sandy areas hilly gully areas and beam shaped hills the sandy area is mainly located in the north that is in the south of the maowusu desert with an area of about 15 813 km2 accounting for 36 71 of the total land area in yulin this area is not undulating whereas the wind erosion is strong and the sand movement is dramatic the hilly gully areas in yulin are mainly located in baiyushan area of dingbian county covering an area of about 5200 km2 accounting for 11 72 of the total area the landform is characterized by high terrain and wide loess plateaus where flowing water erosion is relatively strong with a deep layer of soils the gravity sliding is common in the hilly gully area in mountainous regions which suffers from serious soil erosion as the area of plateaus continue to decrease the streams are also threatened the hilly gully landform covers the largest area in yulin with about 22 300 km2 accounting for 51 6 of the total area this area is full of both vertical and horizontal erosions with strong denudation of flowing water the ground here is therefore fragmented and the problem of soil erosion is extremely serious 3 1 3 climate characteristic yulin is located in the northwestern inner land zone of china and has an arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate the climate of yulin is greatly affected by the monsoon it also falls in the westerly zone with plenty of sunshine and four distinct seasons it is windy and sandy in spring and rainy in summer in winter it is drought and cold with less rain the annual average precipitation in yulin is between 350 and 450 mm the precipitation also increases from northwest part to southeast part of yulin precipitation is mostly concentrated in summer with heavy rain as 71 of the annual precipitation is concentrated from june to september in spring the drought is serious the average temperature in yulin area is 7 12 c the average temperature in winter is 10 c to 3 c and the average temperature in summer is 22 24 c and the temperature in spring is higher than that in autumn in general the average temperature increases from northwest to southeast part in terms of sunshine the annual hours with sunshine are between 2618 and 2914 h and the average sunshine percentage is between 55 and 66 the period from may to august witnesses the most sunshine and the period from december to february sees the least hours of sunshine 3 1 4 hydrological characteristics yulin is one of the areas with least amount of water resources in china the per capita water resources here are even lower than one sixth of the national level although several rivers flow through this area they are all seasonal rivers with less precipitation and strong evaporation most of these rivers are mainly recharged by groundwater this area has the least amount of runoff in shaanxi province yulin is the only area in shaanxi province that has outflow rivers and inland rivers the outflow rivers belong to the yellow river basin accounting for 98 of the total area of the district there are a total of 101 rivers with a drainage area greater than 100 km2 which belong to the three water systems of wuding river tuwei river and kuye river the rivers in this area are generally short and rich in sediment so the basin area is generally small as well for example only the wuding river has a basin area of more than 2000 km2 the kuye river has a drainage area of more than 5000 km2 whereas other rivers including tuwei river huangfu river gushan river jialu river and yuxi river are all covering an even smaller drainage area due to the uneven distribution of precipitation in the yulin area the rivers often surge and fall and there is a large difference in flow between the dry season and the flood season the rivers also carry a large amount of sediment in general there are more rivers in the south of the great wall in yulin with a dense river network the area in the north of the great wall however is seriously affected by the maowusu desert as there are large areas without any river 3 1 5 soil characteristics the soil in the yulin area has transitional characteristics see figs 2 and 3 the north is the southern part of the chestnut calcareous soil in neimenggu and the south is the northern part of the black loess soil in northern shaanxi the northwestern area of dingbian county has been invaded by desert plants therefore multiple soil parent materials come into being the soil types in this area include sandy soil chestnut calcareous soil followed by chernozem soil loess soil and a small amount of red soil marsh soil and salt collapsed soil sandy soil is the soil developed from the sandy soil parent material in the windy grassland area it is mainly distributed in the northern part of yulin it includes mobile sandy soil semi fixed sandy soil fixed sandy soil and cultivated sandy soil the process of forming these types of soils is consistent with the growth and succession of sandy vegetation chestnut calcareous soil is the soil developed by the dry grassland vegetation in the west of yulin due to the relatively dry climate the leaching effect of the soil is weak and the calcification process becomes obvious there are often calcium nodules under the surface of the land posting a foaming reaction of hydrochloric acid due to less rainfall grassland plants often die due to high temperature and gas decomposition is high thus the intensity of mineralization of organic matter is far greater than the accumulation of humus the humus layer is therefore thin and the soil structure is poor with a low value of soil utilization the black calcareous soil is widely distributed in the southern part of yulin covering only a small area it is mainly distributed in the broken plateau and the flat land of the ditches there are three sub soil types from the northern area to the southern area known as sticky chernozem heilu soil and light heilu soil 3 1 6 vegetation characteristics yulin is located in the mid latitude zone of the northern hemisphere in the transitional zone between the humid monsoon zone and the inland arid zone in china as the dryness gradually increases from the southeast to the northwest the nature of the vegetation also has obvious local characteristics there is a transitional zone with a mixture of a forest and grassland zone typical steppe zone and desert steppe zone fig 2 the specific vegetation landscape type in the south of the great wall line in yulin area is forest shrub grassland which is also a transitional zone from warm temperate deciduous broad leaved forest belt to grassland belt in hills with relatively good water conditions there are still coniferous forests and deciduous broad leaved forests remaining in the upper part of hilly loess plateau region there are mostly miscanthus grassland and thyme prairie on shady slopes and semi shady slopes there are mostly artemisia vestita grassland and on sunny and semi sunny slopes there are mostly mugwort grassland the area in the north of the great wall is the southern edge of the maowusu desert where flowing semi fixed and fixed dunes and sandy land are distributed low wet beaches of varying sizes are formed between the sand dunes as the sand is loose and flexible vegetation such as grassland cannot develop in this area and therefore it is dominated by sand vegetation due to the diverse natural environmental conditions of the low wet beach between the dunes a variety of vegetation types have been formed 3 1 7 summary this paper takes yulin city shaanxi province as the research object the area belongs to the northernmost point of shaanxi province it is located at the junction of the loess plateau and maowusu sandy land the climate change is evident in the four seasons the time of light is long the temperature gradient is large and the spring temperature is higher than the autumn temperature the summer is hot and the winter is cold and dry a total of 53 rivers in yulin flow into the yellow river making the city suffer from the most serious soil erosion in shaanxi province and even the country the area of soil erosion exceeds 40 000 km2 and the annual average erosion modulus exceeds 10 000 tons per square kilometer the soil erosion problem has been the main content of government work in recent years in order to realize the research in this paper geographical data and statistical data were collected respectively and swat model was established for further analysis geographical data is composed of the following sources yulin city cultivated land quality evaluation data land use classification data the data come from the loess plateau scientific data center national science and technology basic condition platform national earth system scientific data sharing service platform etc statistical data considered the natural social and economic aspects of yulin city the data comes from the 2017 shaanxi provincial statistical yearbook shaanxi provincial disaster prevention yearbook yulin statistical yearbook summaries of ecological construction and soil and water conservation work etc 3 2 research on the impact of different climates on soil erosion to simulate the soil erosion in regions affected by different climates the climate change conditions was used as inputs to the distributed hydrological model swat model a representative year was selected and quantitative analysis was done peng et al 2018 swat soil and water assessment tool was developed by dr jeff arnold of the american agricultural research center in 1994 in recent years with the advancement of information technology this model has been gradually developed and improved and has been widely used in practice the application of the swat model is mainly concentrated in various fields such as land use change soil erosion pollutant load and hydrological cycle analysis of watershed the model can analyze the change range of soil erosion by setting the future climate change and land use change scenario combination and can also increase the dimension of the scenario combination according to the research goal and accurately analyze the soil erosion status in the whole situation the swat model provides an essential reference for soil erosion management and its advantages are more prominent the data that the swat model needs to input was as follows 1 land use type data the data were from the national land use type data with a resolution of 1 5 km 1 5 km provided by the institute of geography chinese academy of sciences 2 dem data the data were from global dem data with a resolution of 95 s intercepting regional boundaries to obtain the required data provided by the american geographical association 3 distribution data of soil type the data had a global resolution of 1 3000000 these data focused on the study area to obtain the required data and were downloaded at the food and agriculture organization of the united nations 4 meteorological data the meteorological station in the study area provides the data from 2010 to 2019 the main factors include sunshine hours wind speed solar radiation relative humidity minimum temperature and maximum temperature wang et al 2018a b hao et al 2017 5 hydrometeorological data the hydrological station in the study area provides the data the data included the sand content annual runoff of the river and precipitation data in the study area from 2010 to 2019 3 3 evaluation model of sustainable agricultural planting the swat model is used to analyze the impact of different climates on soil erosion on this basis the agricultural sustainable planting evaluation and the prediction model is used to select appropriate crops to achieve sustainable agricultural planting and promote agricultural economic development according to the specific situation of the

on soil erosion to analyze the changes in soil erosion in yulin under different climatic conditions four climate change conditions were set as input 2017 was selected as the representative year to study its soil erosion and the method in this paper was used to analyze the change rate and amount of soil erosion quantitatively the results are shown in table 1 the four types of climate change are as follows climate change condition 1 precipitation remains unchanged and the temperature is 5 c climate change condition 2 precipitation remains unchanged and the temperature is 5 climate change condition 3 the temperature remains unchanged and the precipitation changes by 20 climate change condition 4 the temperature remains unchanged and the precipitation changes by 20 it can be seen from table 1 that in the climate change condition 1 as the temperature increased by 5 c and the precipitation remained unchanged the amount of soil erosion decreased by 3 5 104t and the rate of change of soil erosion decreased by 27 78 compared with that before the climate change the reason is that the temperature rises and the precipitation does not change which leads to an increase in evaporation and a decrease in runoff and reduces the amount of soil erosion in the climate change condition 2 the temperature was reduced by 5 and the precipitation was unchanged the amount of soil erosion increased by 1 2 104t the rate of soil erosion increased by 9 52 compared with what was before climate change the situation was contrary to climate change condition 1 the temperature was reduced the amount of evaporation was reduced and there was no change in precipitation and led to a rise in the volume of runoff and soil erosion rate in condition 3 the precipitation increased by 20 and the temperature was unchanged compared with the climate before the change the soil erosion amount raised by 2 7 104t and the soil erosion rate increased by 21 43 climate change condition 3 was among the four climate change conditions the most significant amount of soil erosion which was due to the increase in precipitation and the increase in runoff when the temperature did not change leading to increased soil erosion climate change condition 4 precipitation decreased by 20 the temperature did not change runoff decreased and the rate of change in soil erosion decreased by 38 10 for the reduction of the runoff and the impact on soil erosion becomes smaller climate change had a significant impact on soil erosion which brought tremendous pressure on sustainable agricultural planting therefore to achieve sustainable agricultural planting and soil and water conservation and promote economic benefits it is necessary to study reasonable farming methods 4 2 analysis of sustainable agricultural development different farming methods had different effects on soil and water conservation to achieve soil and water conservation the analysis results are shown in fig 4 this study analyzes the soil erosion situation of different topography and different farming methods the soil erosion modulus were important reference data reflecting the status of soil erosion it can be seen from fig 4 a that the water and soil erosion in the terraced environment was not serious with the maximum water and soil erosion modulus being only 5 5 t km2 which showed that different farming methods had no direct impact on soil erosion from fig 4 b it can be seen that there were several soil erosion cases in the sloping fields when the slope was 7 the soil erosion of maize monoculture was the most serious the soil erosion of wheat monoculture was about half of that of maize monoculture and the soil erosion caused by wheat maize rotation was the least when the slope of the slope was 12 the soil erosion modulus of corn monoculture reached 5500 t km2 the soil erosion modulus of wheat monocropping was about 2000 t km2 and the soil erosion modulus of wheat maize rotation was less than 100 t km2 when the slope of the sloping fields increased to 22 the soil erosion caused by wheat monoculture was the most serious while the soil erosion by maize monoculture and wheat maize rotation farming almost disappeared it can be seen from fig 4 that if cultivation on slopes was needed a suitable cultivation method should be chosen to achieve the effect of soil and water conservation at the same time the slope also had a great impact on soil erosion in order to achieve soil and water conservation sloping fields need to be reformed according to the research results low slope areas can be built as terraces high slope areas can grow crops with good soil and water conservation and implement reasonable farming methods to achieve sustainable development of agricultural planting the cultivation and harvesting of crops are closely related to farmers income to analyze the impact of soil erosion caused by changes in the natural environment on farmers revenue the method used in this study counts the potential revenue of different terrains without considering the impact of the natural environment the results are shown in table 2 the data in table 2 did not consider the impact of the natural environment and estimates the potential profits of crops in different terrains as shown in table 2 the benefits of wheat regardless of the terrain were the most impressive considering the environmental impact of soil erosion the discounted value obtained within one month is shown in table 3 according to table 3 and fig 4 the income from wheat cultivation was higher not matter if it is in the terraces or sloping fields in the terraces maize had the highest soil erosion modulus so the income of corn was the lowest on sloping fields even when the slope was only 7 the maize s income showed a negative state indicating that it was not suitable for planting maize on slopes when the slope was 12 both the wheat monoculture and maize monoculture modules had high soil erosion moduli and showed negative income status with the increase of the slope the soil erosion was getting severe so the income was decreasing comparing tables 2 and 3 the benefits obtained after considering the natural environmental factors had greatly fluctuated indicating that the natural environment affected by soil erosion had a great impact on farmers economic income therefore it is necessary to fully consider factors such as soil and water conservation and sustainable agricultural planting and adjust agricultural cultivation methods to promote sustainable economic development 5 discussion 5 1 conservation tillage a promising approach for management in yulin in this study it can be found that under the situation of precipitation and temperature change soil erosion and agricultural planting in yulin area would be greatly affected how to mitigate climate change through agricultural measures is a question worth discussing in this discussion section this paper will discuss and combine the research of previous scholars and conclude that the transformation from traditional tillage to conservation tillage system can promote a sustainable future in the aspects of climate change soil conservation and agricultural economic benefits in the context of global climate change the loess plateau is showing a trend of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature according to the research of yan 2015 the average precipitation in this region decreased at a rate of 7 51 mm 10a from 1961 to 2014 ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change has also shown that precipitation in northwest china could decrease by up to 5 per decade between 1951 and 2010 ipcc 2013 the study of deng et al 2014 showed that the average annual temperature of the loess plateau increased by 1 1 during 1951 2000 which may lead to an increase in plant transpiration and soil evaporation in terrestrial ecosystems the lack of fertility caused by the loss of soil organic matter and the increasing water stress under the background of climate change are the important factors limiting crop production on the loess plateau which also have a negative impact on the sustainable development of agriculture on the ecological and social level findings emerging from these studies were similar to our findings whereas the scenarios studied here are more extreme and better able to show the long term effects of climate change in this paper four scenarios of precipitation and temperature are simulated and it is found that the increase of temperature and the constant precipitation lead to the increase of evaporation the decrease of runoff and the decrease of soil erosion but this is bound to have a huge impact on farming if temperature decreases evaporation decreases and precipitation remains unchanged runoff and soil erosion rate will increase increasing or decreasing rainfall can also lead to increased soil erosion or pressure on farming therefore the establishment of an agricultural system that adapts to regional climate and natural environment and supports sustainable production with less water is the basis for guaranteeing agricultural production and protecting ecological environment in semi arid regions such as the loess plateau at present conservation tillage is the main strategy for soil and water conservation and agricultural benefit improvement in yulin area conservation tillage is a tillage technique in which mechanization is the main method low tillage or no tillage method is adopted to reduce tillage to as long as seed germination can be ensured crop straw and stubble are used to cover the ground and pesticides are mainly used to control weeds and pests zhang et al 2005 conservation tillage have shown great potential to increase soil water holding capacity and crop yields in crop systems with different climatic conditions and natural environments in recent years cerdÃ  et al 2017 su et al 2007 novara et al 2011 2019 zhang et al 2015 several studies in the mediterranean region argued that no tillage and less tillage can not only increase soil moisture but also improve water use efficiency raheem lahmod et al 2019 cerdÃ  et al 2020 in addition short term conservation tillage can increase soil water storage capacity which in turn would promote the growth of roots and increase yield lampurlanÃ©s and cantero martinez 2003 kirchhoff et al 2017 similarly long term conservation tillage can increase the water composition in soil novara et al 2019 with conservation tillage crop roots can help improving soil porosity increasing soil water infiltration rate and reducing surface runoff mcvay et al 1989 al shammary et al 2020 since 2002 11 counties districts in yulin namely dingbian shenmu yuyang hengshan jingbian suide mizhi jiaxian fugu qingjian and wubao have been listed in the ministry of agriculture for conservation tillage as areas to conduct conservation tillage projects and provincial conservation tillage projects in the past 17 years the implementing units of various projects in yulin city have implemented a total of 1 3 million mu of conservation tillage based on the principles of conducting coordinated operations consolidating results and comprehensive promotion the central and provincial governments have provided a total of 86 359 600 yuan for special funds purchase subsidies local supporting facilities and self raised funds in yulin of which 26 58 million yuan has been invested by the central province and 11 5 million yuan was from local supporting funds and 48 279 600 yuan have been raised by farmers these funds were used to promote 28 797 sets of various conservation tillage machines including 5994 sets of no tillage planters 3503 sets of other conservation tillage machines and 19 300 sets of conventional farming machinery which greatly improved the equipment structure of this area according to related statistics the implementation of conservation tillage fields will increase the yield by 0 10 per mu save 20 60 yuan per mu and achieve a total of 155 million yuan in cost savings and efficiency each area is gradually expanding the scale of implementing the projects and a long term mechanism for rolling development has been initially established the development of conservation tillage has moved from the trial and demonstration stage to the large scale promotion stage therefore this section will discuss the soil erosion and agricultural development in yulin area while taking conservation tillage as a main management method based on the findings this study aims to evaluate the benefits of the conservation tillage in yulin area and thereafter provide suggestions accordingly to achieve a better protection of farmland productivity and prevention of soil erosion in the context of climate change 5 2 promoting crop rotation together with conservation tillage conservation tillage is believed as effective in reducing carbon emissions and maintaining climate stability the simulation conducted in this study showed that climate change whether in temperature or precipitation would had negative effects such as soil erosion and loss of agricultural outcomes therefore the present study suggests that for better governance it is necessary to reduce uncertainties in the climate and mitigate climate change one of the main causes of climate change is the increase of greenhouse gases and the reduction of carbon sinks in this field previous research has shown that conservation tillage is generally considered to be effective in reducing climate change the mechanism lies in the significant changes in soil organic carbon with conservation tillage soil carbon sequestration is the process of transferring co2 from the atmosphere to the soil through plants plant residuals and other organic matters these substances become part of the soil in the form of organic matters the retention time of organic carbon in the soil can vary from short term i e do not go back to the atmosphere immediately to long term i e up to a thousand years lal et al 2007 in the early 20th century various studies on co2 emissions found that agriculture was not only one of the main sources of soil co2 emissions but also an important carbon sink for co2 kimble et al 1998 traditional farming systems can significantly increase the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere and the annual contribution to climate change can be as high as 14 vermeulen et al 2012 in addition several studies found that carbon sink could dramatically increase the soil organic carbon content during and at the end of the study and as a result the level of soil organic carbon content could exceed the initial soil level and the atmospheric co2 level was reduced kirschbaum 2000 olson 2010 page et al 2014 some researchers argued that switching from traditional farming to conservation tillage systems could significantly increase soil organic carbon content novara et al 2019 cerdÃ  et al 2020 studies have also shown that the advantages of conservation tillage in anti erosion are trivial and did not differ from traditional tillage in terms of soil carbon sequestration luo et al 2010 ogle et al 2012 however the growth trend of the effect of conservation tillage was nonlinear over time franzluebbers 2005 and soil organic carbon increased faster with the prolonged action of conservation tillage especially under the conditions of no tillage and crop straw mulching mazzoncini et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2016 raheem lahmod et al 2019 keesstra et al 2019 straw could be directly decomposed to increase soil carbon input and it can also retain more surface nutrients by reducing soil erosion however we found that similar to previous studies conducted among spanish grape growers the use of crop straw is a major factor restricting the development of conservation tillage in yulin area and the loess plateau this is because straw was also used as fuel and animal feed and there was a deeply rooted idea among farmers that all crop straw must be removed from the field before sowing in traditional farming methods cai et al 2006 cerdÃ  et al 2018a 2018b the main reasons for farmers to adopt this approach is that they believed that clearing out the straw can help effectively manage the hazards of weeds and at the same time reduce the difficulty of operation during planting therefore although the yulin area has achieved some outcomes in soil and water conservation through the promotion of conservation tillage policy makers are suggested to pay further attention to farmers viewpoint of straw utilization in the promotion of conservation tillage in addition it is believed that reasonable crop rotation should be promoted first of all according to previous research conservation tillage is not sufficient to improve carbon sequestration capacity reasonable crop rotation can bring more carbon sequestration benefits compared with short term crop rotation three year or longer crop rotation has even higher contribution to the accumulation of soil organic carbon abdalla et al 2017 indicated that compared with the no tillage system the co2 emissions of the tillage system increased by 21 additionally compared with the tillage system the rotation system significantly reduced the co2 emissions by 26 the carbon dioxide emission reduction of sandy loam with low organic matter content is lower than that of clay with high organic matter content in addition conservation tillage based on crop rotation can not only bring the benefits of soil carbon sequestration and slow down climate change it can also help solving the dilemma between grain output and farmers income this is one of the important contributions of the present study grain production and farmers income are issues worthy of attention under conservation tillage china as a country with a large population is facing a large proportion of low income citizens especially in the loess plateau concerns about food production under conservation tillage are supported by some evidences mangalassery et al 2015 reviewed previous literatures and concluded that no tillage in tropical and temperate soils can reduce greenhouse gas emissions whereas the reduction in production coming along may threaten global food security although the expected reduction in grain production would be 1 8 mangalassery et al 2015 emphatically raised a core question namely can any reduction in production be acceptable in order to achieve climate goals for poverty stricken areas the reduction of grain production will obviously aggravate poverty and cause social instability therefore combined with the findings from this study yulin area is encouraged to pay more attention to protecting the interests of farmers the conservation tillage program in yulin area are suggested to include crop stalks in the field to increase soil organic carbon storage improve productivity and increase dry farming while at the same time crop rotation and conservation tillage can be combined effectively to maintain the efficiency of agricultural output 5 3 promote slope conversion to terraces in conservation tillage in the loess plateau where yulin city is located rain fed agriculture had a dominant position in crop production deng et al 2006 liu et al 2016 among rain fed agriculture corn is the main sources of food forage and cash crops with an output accounting for 30 8 of the total yield of grain crops on the plateau however its production is often affected by water scarcity zhang et al 2014 wheat is an important food source for humans and provides high quality feed for the breeding industry as a cold season crop that undergoes the c3 photosynthetic pathway winter wheat is characterized by a high crude protein content and a large demand for soil water nielsen et al 2016 wienhold et al 2018 water scarcity is the main constraints of all crop production in rain fed agricultural systems in semi arid regions rockstrÃ¶m et al 2010 therefore soil and water conservation has become very important for regional crop production in this study the soil erosion conditions and the impact on farmers income of the corn wheat and corn wheat rotation planting methods under different slopes were simulated and analyzed the results suggested that under the rotation system the soil and water conservation benefits and economic benefits of terraced fields were most salient for most steep slopes i e with slopes greater than 7 it is necessary to avoid single planting of wheat which tend to cause soil erosion and had low benefits table 4 shows the main crops planted in 2018 recorded in the 2019 yulin statistical yearbook from the table it can be found that corn is the most important agricultural crop according to a study of ge and zhang 2020 on the status quo of yulin corn is currently the most important agricultural crop in yulin area and is widely planted in various slope areas while the planting area of wheat and rice is relatively small the analysis of the present study showed that under the goal of achieving water and soil conservation and agricultural economic benefits slope conversion to terraces is an important measure that should be taken into account in yulin the benefits of changing slopes to terraces are supported both in the present study and previous literatures the slope conversion project started relatively early in international contexts for example japan and italy are focusing on the development of slopes and paid special attention to the development of slopes as the domestic mountainous and hilly areas there have reached 75 80 of the national area only the rational development and utilization of land can make up for the scarcity of land and give full play to the resources in unused land zhou 2008 with the development in recent years increasing attention has been paid to undeveloped sloping land resources worldwide reusing sloping land resources is an important measure to develop arable land so as to realize the sustainable use of resources and improve the living standards of local farmers liu et al 2013 in addition it is worth noting that transforming slopes to terraces will also bring positive effects on climate change houghton 2007 and resh et al 2002 pointed out that in the initial stage of land development or renovation soil organic carbon would decrease the accumulation of soil organic carbon after slope conversion varies for different utilization types and nitrogen fixing plants showed higher potential for soil organic carbon accumulation in addition deng et al 2016 pointed out that the soil organic carbon increase rate and organic carbon pool capacity tend to be different in different restoration stages after conducting slope conversion the toc effects can vary depending on the number of years and can be roughly divided into three types some scholars believed that as the number of years increases soil organic carbon follow a trend of continuous accumulation and eventually reaching equilibrium an et al 2009 however some studies have shown that soil organic carbon has declined in the early stages of remediation with the increase of vegetation restoration years after remediation the content of soil organic carbon has been continuously increasing with effective accumulation and can even exceed the level before the redevelopment deng et al 2014 qin et al 2014 analyzed the organic carbon density of the 0 20 cm soil layer and found that the soil organic carbon density of robinia pseudoacacia continued to accumulate and grow with the increase in years and the soil organic carbon density increased by 59 54 in terms of the overall performance the 30 years robinia pseudoacacia was higher than cultivated land followed by immature robinia pseudoacacia in recent years the yulin government has also vigorously promoted the slope conversion project while encountering various obstacles in this process by reviewing previous literatures it should be noted that the support of fiscal policy from governments and the improvement of residents awareness should be the focus of the current implementation of the slope conversion project in yulin adopting farmer technology is recognized as a gradual or step by step decision making process barham et al 2004 conley and udry 2010 most farmers will not adopt an agricultural production technology immediately after hearing about it for the first time instead farmers will make decisions about whether or not to adopt a technology after experiencing technological adaptation while fully considering about the uncertainty the cost and economic benefits of technology adoption and observing the effects and evaluations of relatives friends or neighbors who adopted the technology in previous literature about the yulin area jia 2018 found that the waiting time of farmers for different water and soil conservation measures showed large differences the average waiting time of farmers to build terraces was about 16 5 years it took farmers approximately 8 years to adopt using water saving irrigation technology the average waiting time of farmers to utilize plastic film and afforestation was about 2 years farmers spent less than half a year on average to decide on implementing furrow and ridge farming therefore although the benefits of slope to terrace conversion are widely recognized there is still great resistance in the process of promotion and advancement by reviewing previous studies it can be found that in response to this problem collective actions by farmers have the greatest effect on reducing the waiting time for farmers to build terraces therefore in the process of promoting slope conversion the government is suggested to encourage regional scale actions for example by providing financial subsidies visser et al 2019 cerdÃ  et al 2018a 2018b 6 conclusion water and soil resources are natural resources on which human beings depend on for survival and production under the joint influence of natural and human factors soil erosion in china is becoming increasingly serious to reduce the impact of soil erosion on sustainable agricultural farming the swat model was used in this study to quantitatively analyze the regional soil and water loss affected by different climate changes in addition the evaluation and prediction model of agricultural sustainable planting was constructed in order to achieve the agricultural sustainable planting by selecting appropriate crops based on the analysis of yulin city in shaanxi province the results showed that with fixed precipitation the increase and decrease of 5 c temperature would lead to a change rate of soil loss of 27 78 and 9 52 respectively with fixed temperature the increase and decrease of 20 precipitation would lead to a change rate of soil and water loss of 21 43 and 38 10 respectively the situation of soil erosion under the slope environment was more serious and the yield of grain and farming income decreased it is necessary to choose reasonable planting methods and environmental control policies to reduce the impact of soil erosion on agricultural sustainable planting currently conservation tillage is adopted as the control measure in yulin the results of this paper indicated that slope conversion and crop rotation may be adopted simultaneously to realize the coordination of soil and water conservation and agricultural benefits under the background of climate change fiscal policies such as subsidies may also be considered to encourage farmers to adopt measures such as changing slopes declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this research was funded by

10350,as different hydrological phenomena caused by different climates have a far reaching impact on agricultural sustainable development analysis of the impact of soil erosion on agricultural sustainable planting under different climates was conducted the swat model was used to quantitatively analyze the regional soil and water loss affected by different climate changes in addition the evaluation and prediction model of agricultural sustainable planting was constructed with epic software in order to achieve the agricultural sustainable planting by selecting appropriate crops based on the analysis of yulin city in shaanxi province the results showed that with fixed precipitation the increase and decrease of 5 c temperature would lead to a change rate of soil loss of 27 78 and 9 52 respectively with fixed temperature the increase and decrease of 20 precipitation would lead to a change rate of soil loss of 21 43 and 38 10 respectively the situation of soil erosion under the

soil erosion on agricultural sustainable planting currently conservation tillage is adopted as the control measure in yulin the results of this paper indicated that slope change and crop rotation should be adopted simultaneously to realize the coordination of soil and water conservation and agricultural benefits under the climate change background keywords different climates soil erosion agriculture sustainable planting modeling analysis 1 introduction the sustainable development of agriculture has always been the goal of agricultural economic development and construction and it is a new concept stemmed from the sustainable development of the environment in recent years leal filho et al 2018 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 li et al 2017 the sustainable development of agriculture is consistent with the institutional and technical transformation of natural resources ensuring that the current agricultural resources meet the needs of contemporary human use while future generations can have inexhaustible agricultural resources thompson 2017 the concept of agricultural sustainability was first proposed by western countries and has been widely applied in european and american countries however in the process of studying agricultural sustainability the challenges brought by the development of soil geography are inevitable keesstra et al 2018 although soil geography is explicitly recognized as a subdiscipline of physical geography and soil science it has gradually been accepted as a complementary and descriptive subdiscipline of botany agronomy and geology at various times in the last century rodrigo comino et al 2018a until contemporary in addition to being a decisive factor in agricultural development soil geographers represented by rodrigo comino have found that they can also play an important role in sustainable processes by studying issues related to human beings and the natural environment rodrigo comino et al 2018a keesstra et al 2016 moreover rodrigo comino et al 2018b believed that soil geography could be defined as a discipline that studies the causes of soil distribution and its relationship with human beings in recent years with the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs soil geographers have become more concerned about how to contribute the research team led by professor keesstra systematically summarized how to contribute to the realization of sustainable development goals more effectively the framework of soil and land stakeholders proposed by the them is instructive for our study keesstra et al 2018 visser et al 2019 in their opinion soil geographers should regard society and ecology as an interconnected system soil degradation and restoration will have a joint impact on global food health water and climate and attention should be paid to the attitude of stakeholders and changes in economic conditions in the realization of sustainability keesstra et al 2016 2018 visser et al 2019 different from previous studies on europe and america the present study focuses on china located in asia the form of agriculture in china is slightly different from that in european and american countries the premise of sustainable development of agriculture featuring chinese characteristics is based on science and technology to ensure the sustainable development of the environment the continuous availability of the soil and the stability of production fan et al 2018 among the factors highlighted by chinese government stable production is undoubtedly the most important for such a country with large population therefore sustainably achieving stable agricultural production is the core of almost all planning as mentioned above the impact of climate change on the sustainability of agriculture in ecosystems can be huge in recent years carbon emissions have continued to increase and the trend of global warming has not stopped posing great challenges on the sustainable development of agriculture qin and lin 2019 at present the impact of global climate change is mainly on the distribution time and intensity of rain and snow and it is more likely to cause extreme meteorological disasters under the general environment of global climate change temperature and precipitation conditions have changed significantly the precipitation caused frequent soil erosion lin et al 2019 sharifi et al 2018 the problem of soil erosion has always been a critical issue that must be solved in human survival and development so far there are various degrees of soil erosion in multiple countries globally which severely restricts the development of the agricultural economy in many countries according to survey data the global cultivated land area was about 1 5 108hmÂ² including antarctica however about 10 of the soil is covered by ice and snow and some of the soil cannot be agriculturally produced because it does not meet the growth conditions of most crops cramer and solomon 1993 lin et al 2019 only the remaining 22 of the soil can be agriculturally planted once serious soil erosion problems occur nearly one third of the cultivated land worldwide will be affected therefore climate change soil erosion and sustainable agricultural production are inextricably connected due to the remaining historical problems economic development level of china has been lagging behind that of the european and american countries before the reform and opening up in the process of moving towards the 21 st century the economy of china is developing by leaps and bounds continually narrowing the economic gap with european and american countries nevertheless most of economic development in china is at the expense of resources and the environment resulting in severe soil erosion and environmental problems in the context of massive economic construction and continuous population growth large scale economic activities have led to the constant reduction of cultivated land area in china which has caused great harm to the production of food crops and has also caused enormous pressure on the sustainable development of the national economy song et al 2019 gong et al 2019 additionally domestic soil and water theory practice of china started later than developed countries it is urgent to study a feasible soil erosion control plan to promote the stable and healthy development of agricultural economy in china controlling soil erosion has always been one of the important tasks of the government s water conservancy construction achieving sustainable agricultural planting through soil and water conservation is the main way to promote the long term development of soil erosion areas yan et al 2018 while the existing research mainly considered the treatment of soil erosion and improvement of agricultural planting soil conditions there are few related studies on the impact of climate change on soil and water loss therefore this study focuses on the impact of soil erosion on sustainable agricultural planting under different climate changes this study establishes a model to simulate the impact of soil erosion on sustainable agricultural planting under the climate change background and aims to provide an important reference for the sustainable development of the chinese agricultural economy 2 literature background so far european and american countries have made breakthrough progress in the study of soil erosion control the most representative of which is the soil erosion model the research on soil erosion control in europe and the united states started early as early as the middle of the last century american researcher smith et al designed the soil erosion equation by analyzing the data of soil erosion data over several decades borrelli et al 2017 researchers in the industry have widely recognized this equation and gradually applied it in practice a group of european soil erosion researchers led by morgan and quinton proposed a european soil erosion model based on the analysis of european soil erosion characteristics morgan et al 1998 with the further development of related research the work of soil and water loss control is no longer limited to the model and calculation of soil erosion but to discover the main causes of soil and water loss through experiments or simulations propose corresponding protection measures and gradually consider the important role of human in the control for example through rainfall simulation experiments rodrigo comino et al 2018a 2018b found that grape planting in bare soil would lead to soil erosion rate as high as 4 1 mg ha 1 h 1 besides a high water loss value of more than 30 was detected soil erosion rate is higher in different slope position and different environmental characteristics the results showed that bare soil was the most important driving factors for the increased soil erosion rate similarly citrus plantations as a representative of the mediterranean citrus orchard were also studied by keesstra et al 2018 it turned out that in many mediterranean regions citrus groves have high rates of soil loss due to the expansion of drip irrigation on slopes and the widespread use of glyphosate in order to reduce these unsustainable soil losses keesstra et al 2018 conducted 40 rainfall simulation tests and found that straw mulching was an effective tool to reduce soil loss in citrus plantations especially on sloping lands straw mulching can be an effective solution by slowing down runoff initiation and reducing runoff generation it is noteworthy that the human factors of governance have also been discussed in detail in citrus plantations as well cerda et al 2018 found that crop or weed growth in citrus plantations was associated with lower soil erosion this was because vegetation coverage was high enough to enhance infiltration and avoid surface erosion making surface erosion out of contact however cerda et al 2018 found that such positive effects did not persuade local farmers to take their advice because they preferred clean bare soil with no plants other than citrus crops to change such behaviors cerda 2018 found that subsidies are the best choice to persuade farmers to change their management mode and at the same time they should make up for their lack of awareness of environmental protection it can be seen that the research on soil and water conservation and planting in europe has been relatively developed and the corresponding results have provided a reference basis for decision makers to a large extent similar to europe the american soil and water loss controlling schemes are also comprehensive and are committed to maintaining the balance between the soil and water loss control and landowners interests crosson 2016 therefore in western countries a unified controlling scheme of biology farming and engineering is used comprehensively in terms of asian countries japan for example is considered as the most advanced country in asia in terms of soil and water conservation because its agricultural land area and soil topography do not occupy the natural advantage therefore japan attaches great importance to environmental protection research on soil erosion control methods has been carried out relatively early and advanced results have been achieved so far such as engineering methods and farming methods kawahigashi 2019 pheng et al 2019 however due to the unique characteristics of soil erosion in japan most of its controlling schemes are various engineering measures and seldom take other factors such as farmer into consideration china is similar to japan after the emergence of the soil erosion equation many chinese scholars have conducted in depth studies exploring the establishment of soil erosion prediction models suitable in china in recent years china s domestic research on soil erosion control measures has been making progress smoothly fu et al 2011 haiyan and liying 2017 due to topography and landforms complexity in china relevant scholars have proposed targeted soil erosion s controlling schemes based on the characteristics of different topography and landforms these schemes can be summarized as three categories of engineering measures forest and grass measures or plant measures and farming measures these measures are considered to be applicable to the prevention and control of soil erosion in different areas however nearly all of the measures paid much attention to engineering methods or does not take into account soil and land stakeholder framework proposed by keesstra et al 2018 in order to narrow these gaps this paper focused on soil erosion and agricultural planting under the climate change of the loess plateau as the research objects research on climate change has attracted much attention in china in recent years the research on the impact of climate change on soil erosion on the loess plateau has made some progress and achieved some results however due to the complexity of soil erosion process the complexity of climate change the impact of climate change on soil erosion still needs to be strengthened in various aspects the possible impact of climate change on soil erosion in the loess plateau region has been recognized since the first ipcc assessment report whereas due to the complexity of the problem researchers only began to carry out relevant studies until the early 2000s compared with the research on climate change the research on the impact of climate change on soil erosion started relatively late and the findings emerging from previous researches are limited and sometimes even inconsistent jing and jiao 2011 in addition with the continuous increase of population in china the development of agricultural industry has gradually increased the pressure on the agricultural environment and the development of agricultural industry has caused soil and water loss non point source pollution air pollution and other environmental problems the most serious environmental problem in the loess hilly region is soil and water loss in loess hilly areas due to deforestation overgrazing wasteland destruction and unreasonable tillage serious soil erosion has been caused jing and jiao 2011 have shown that the impact of human activities on ecosystems leads to soil erosion which far exceeds natural erosion therefore how to coordinate agricultural production and soil erosion is another important issue in addition to climate change to solve these problems this study focuses on yulin city in the loess plateau region and draws conclusions through the simulation of different climate scenarios and different planting methods as a supplement and validation of previous studies in addition the value of this study is also reflected in the fact that it can provide reference and comparison for the associations between climate and soil erosion in different regional environments in the future by conducting a micro study on specific regions 3 research methods 3 1 research objective 3 1 1 an overview of the studied area yulin city is located in the northern part of shaanxi province at the junction of shaanxi gansu ningxia shanxi and neimenggu the eastern part of yulin faces the yellow river and shanxi province and the western part connects gansu and ningxia the south of yulin is known as the yan an area and the north is connected with inner mongolia it is located between 36 95 39 57 n and 107 47 111 25 e with a total of 12 counties in terms of the terrain of this area the northwest is high in altitude and the southeast part has a lower altitude the basic landform types include sandy areas hills and gullies and beam shaped hills covering a total land area of 43 113 km2 accounting for 21 16 of the total land area of shaanxi province unfortunately yulin is not only one of the areas with the most serious soil erosion in china but also a typical area with fragile ecological environment yulin is located in the loess plateau in northwest china it has a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate and is a typical area with a mixture of agriculture and animal husbandry the area is also one of china s important energy development zones including the development of coal petroleum and other energy sources and related heavy industries even though the development of these energy resources and industries is the foundation of the social and economic development of yulin area it also brings tremendous pressure to the fragile ecological environment further increasing the land resource carrying pressure in yulin area 3 1 2 topographic characteristics in terms of the topographic characteristics the altitude of yulin declines from the northwest part to the southeast part see fig 1 hao mountain in the south of dingbian county in the west of yulin is 1 901 m above sea level which is the highest point in the entire region the lowest point in the southeast is at the mouth of the wuding river running into the yellow river with an altitude of 610 m most of the east part ranges from 1 000 1200 meters above sea level and the west part is mostly between 1200 1500 meters the landforms of yulin area mainly included three types namely sandy areas hilly gully areas and beam shaped hills the sandy area is mainly located in the north that is in the south of the maowusu desert with an area of about 15 813 km2 accounting for 36 71 of the total land area in yulin this area is not undulating whereas the wind erosion is strong and the sand movement is dramatic the hilly gully areas in yulin are mainly located in baiyushan area of dingbian county covering an area of about 5200 km2 accounting for 11 72 of the total area the landform is characterized by high terrain and wide loess plateaus where flowing water erosion is relatively strong with a deep layer of soils the gravity sliding is common in the hilly gully area in mountainous regions which suffers from serious soil erosion as the area of plateaus continue to decrease the streams are also threatened the hilly gully landform covers the largest area in yulin with about 22 300 km2 accounting for 51 6 of the total area this area is full of both vertical and horizontal erosions with strong denudation of flowing water the ground here is therefore fragmented and the problem of soil erosion is extremely serious 3 1 3 climate characteristic yulin is located in the northwestern inner land zone of china and has an arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate the climate of yulin is greatly affected by the monsoon it also falls in the westerly zone with plenty of sunshine and four distinct seasons it is windy and sandy in spring and rainy in summer in winter it is drought and cold with less rain the annual average precipitation in yulin is between 350 and 450 mm the precipitation also increases from northwest part to southeast part of yulin precipitation is mostly concentrated in summer with heavy rain as 71 of the annual precipitation is concentrated from june to september in spring the drought is serious the average temperature in yulin area is 7 12 c the average temperature in winter is 10 c to 3 c and the average temperature in summer is 22 24 c and the temperature in spring is higher than that in autumn in general the average temperature increases from northwest to southeast part in terms of sunshine the annual hours with sunshine are between 2618 and 2914 h and the average sunshine percentage is between 55 and 66 the period from may to august witnesses the most sunshine and the period from december to february sees the least hours of sunshine 3 1 4 hydrological characteristics yulin is one of the areas with least amount of water resources in china the per capita water resources here are even lower than one sixth of the national level although several rivers flow through this area they are all seasonal rivers with less precipitation and strong evaporation most of these rivers are mainly recharged by groundwater this area has the least amount of runoff in shaanxi province yulin is the only area in shaanxi province that has outflow rivers and inland rivers the outflow rivers belong to the yellow river basin accounting for 98 of the total area of the district there are a total of 101 rivers with a drainage area greater than 100 km2 which belong to the three water systems of wuding river tuwei river and kuye river the rivers in this area are generally short and rich in sediment so the basin area is generally small as well for example only the wuding river has a basin area of more than 2000 km2 the kuye river has a drainage area of more than 5000 km2 whereas other rivers including tuwei river huangfu river gushan river jialu river and yuxi river are all covering an even smaller drainage area due to the uneven distribution of precipitation in the yulin area the rivers often surge and fall and there is a large difference in flow between the dry season and the flood season the rivers also carry a large amount of sediment in general there are more rivers in the south of the great wall in yulin with a dense river network the area in the north of the great wall however is seriously affected by the maowusu desert as there are large areas without any river 3 1 5 soil characteristics the soil in the yulin area has transitional characteristics see figs 2 and 3 the north is the southern part of the chestnut calcareous soil in neimenggu and the south is the northern part of the black loess soil in northern shaanxi the northwestern area of dingbian county has been invaded by desert plants therefore multiple soil parent materials come into being the soil types in this area include sandy soil chestnut calcareous soil followed by chernozem soil loess soil and a small amount of red soil marsh soil and salt collapsed soil sandy soil is the soil developed from the sandy soil parent material in the windy grassland area it is mainly distributed in the northern part of yulin it includes mobile sandy soil semi fixed sandy soil fixed sandy soil and cultivated sandy soil the process of forming these types of soils is consistent with the growth and succession of sandy vegetation chestnut calcareous soil is the soil developed by the dry grassland vegetation in the west of yulin due to the relatively dry climate the leaching effect of the soil is weak and the calcification process becomes obvious there are often calcium nodules under the surface of the land posting a foaming reaction of hydrochloric acid due to less rainfall grassland plants often die due to high temperature and gas decomposition is high thus the intensity of mineralization of organic matter is far greater than the accumulation of humus the humus layer is therefore thin and the soil structure is poor with a low value of soil utilization the black calcareous soil is widely distributed in the southern part of yulin covering only a small area it is mainly distributed in the broken plateau and the flat land of the ditches there are three sub soil types from the northern area to the southern area known as sticky chernozem heilu soil and light heilu soil 3 1 6 vegetation characteristics yulin is located in the mid latitude zone of the northern hemisphere in the transitional zone between the humid monsoon zone and the inland arid zone in china as the dryness gradually increases from the southeast to the northwest the nature of the vegetation also has obvious local characteristics there is a transitional zone with a mixture of a forest and grassland zone typical steppe zone and desert steppe zone fig 2 the specific vegetation landscape type in the south of the great wall line in yulin area is forest shrub grassland which is also a transitional zone from warm temperate deciduous broad leaved forest belt to grassland belt in hills with relatively good water conditions there are still coniferous forests and deciduous broad leaved forests remaining in the upper part of hilly loess plateau region there are mostly miscanthus grassland and thyme prairie on shady slopes and semi shady slopes there are mostly artemisia vestita grassland and on sunny and semi sunny slopes there are mostly mugwort grassland the area in the north of the great wall is the southern edge of the maowusu desert where flowing semi fixed and fixed dunes and sandy land are distributed low wet beaches of varying sizes are formed between the sand dunes as the sand is loose and flexible vegetation such as grassland cannot develop in this area and therefore it is dominated by sand vegetation due to the diverse natural environmental conditions of the low wet beach between the dunes a variety of vegetation types have been formed 3 1 7 summary this paper takes yulin city shaanxi province as the research object the area belongs to the northernmost point of shaanxi province it is located at the junction of the loess plateau and maowusu sandy land the climate change is evident in the four seasons the time of light is long the temperature gradient is large and the spring temperature is higher than the autumn temperature the summer is hot and the winter is cold and dry a total of 53 rivers in yulin flow into the yellow river making the city suffer from the most serious soil erosion in shaanxi province and even the country the area of soil erosion exceeds 40 000 km2 and the annual average erosion modulus exceeds 10 000 tons per square kilometer the soil erosion problem has been the main content of government work in recent years in order to realize the research in this paper geographical data and statistical data were collected respectively and swat model was established for

construction and soil and water conservation work etc 3 2 research on the impact of different climates on soil erosion to simulate the soil erosion in regions affected by different climates the climate change conditions was used as inputs to the distributed hydrological model swat model a representative year was selected and quantitative analysis was done peng et al 2018 swat soil and water assessment tool was developed by dr jeff arnold of the american agricultural research center in 1994 in recent years with the advancement of information technology this model has been gradually developed and improved and has been widely used in practice the application of the swat model is mainly concentrated in various fields such as land use change soil erosion pollutant load and hydrological cycle analysis of watershed the model can analyze the change range of soil erosion by setting the future climate change and land use change scenario combination and can also increase the dimension of the scenario combination according to the research goal and accurately analyze the soil erosion status in the whole situation the swat model provides an essential reference for soil erosion management and its advantages are more prominent the data that the swat model needs to input was as follows 1 land use type data the data were from the national land use type data with a

on soil erosion to analyze the changes in soil erosion in yulin under different climatic conditions four climate change conditions were set as input 2017 was selected as the representative year to study its soil erosion and the method in this paper was used to analyze the change rate and amount of soil erosion quantitatively the results are shown in table 1 the four types of climate change are as follows climate change condition 1 precipitation remains unchanged and the temperature is 5 c climate change condition 2 precipitation remains unchanged and the temperature is 5 climate change condition 3 the temperature remains unchanged and the precipitation changes by 20 climate change condition 4 the temperature remains unchanged and the precipitation changes by 20 it can be seen from table 1 that in the climate change condition 1 as the temperature increased by 5 c and the precipitation remained unchanged the amount of soil erosion decreased by 3 5 104t and the rate of change of soil erosion decreased by 27 78 compared with that before the climate change the reason is that the temperature rises and the precipitation does not change which leads to an increase in evaporation and a decrease in runoff and reduces the amount of soil erosion in the climate change condition 2 the temperature was reduced by 5 and the precipitation was unchanged the amount of soil erosion increased by 1 2 104t the rate of soil erosion increased by 9 52 compared with what was before climate change the situation was contrary to climate change condition 1 the temperature was reduced the amount of evaporation was reduced and there was no change in precipitation and led to a rise in the volume of runoff and soil erosion rate in condition 3 the precipitation increased by 20 and the temperature was unchanged compared with the climate before the change the soil erosion amount raised by 2 7 104t and the soil erosion rate increased by 21 43 climate change condition 3 was among the four climate change conditions the most significant amount of soil erosion which was due to the increase in precipitation and the increase in runoff when the temperature did not change leading to increased soil erosion climate change condition 4 precipitation decreased by 20 the temperature did not change runoff decreased and the rate of change in soil erosion decreased by 38 10 for the reduction of the runoff and the impact on soil erosion becomes smaller climate change had a significant impact on soil erosion which brought tremendous pressure on sustainable agricultural planting therefore to achieve sustainable agricultural planting and soil and water conservation and promote economic benefits it is necessary to study reasonable farming methods 4 2 analysis of sustainable agricultural development different farming methods had different effects on soil and water conservation to achieve soil and water conservation the analysis results are shown in fig 4 this study analyzes the soil erosion situation of different topography and different farming methods the soil erosion modulus were important reference data reflecting the status of soil erosion it can be seen from fig 4 a that the water and soil erosion in the terraced environment was not serious with the maximum water and soil erosion modulus being only 5 5 t km2 which showed that different farming methods had no direct impact on soil erosion from fig 4 b it can be seen that there were several soil erosion cases in the sloping fields when the slope was 7 the soil erosion of maize monoculture was the most serious the soil erosion of wheat monoculture was about half of that of maize monoculture and the soil erosion caused by wheat maize rotation was the least when the slope of the slope was 12 the soil erosion modulus of corn monoculture reached 5500 t km2 the soil erosion modulus of wheat monocropping was about 2000 t km2 and the soil erosion modulus of wheat maize rotation was less than 100 t km2 when the slope of the sloping fields increased to 22 the soil erosion caused by wheat monoculture was the most serious while the soil erosion by maize monoculture and wheat maize rotation farming almost disappeared it can be seen from fig 4 that if cultivation on slopes was needed a suitable cultivation method should be chosen to achieve the effect of soil and water conservation at the same time the slope also had a great impact on soil erosion in order to achieve soil and water conservation sloping fields need to be reformed according to the research results low slope areas can be built as terraces high slope areas can grow crops with good soil and water conservation and implement reasonable farming methods to achieve sustainable development of agricultural planting the cultivation and harvesting of crops are closely related to farmers income to analyze the impact of soil erosion caused by changes in the natural environment on farmers revenue the method used in this study counts the potential revenue of different terrains without considering the impact of the natural environment the results are shown in table 2 the data in table 2 did not consider the impact of the natural environment and estimates the potential profits of crops in different terrains as shown in table 2 the benefits of wheat regardless of the terrain were the most impressive considering the environmental impact of soil erosion the discounted value obtained within one month is shown in table 3 according to table 3 and fig 4 the income from wheat cultivation was higher not matter if it is in the terraces or sloping fields in the terraces maize had the highest soil erosion modulus so the income of corn was the lowest on sloping fields even when the slope was only 7 the maize s income showed a negative state indicating that it was not suitable for planting maize on slopes when the slope was 12 both the wheat monoculture and maize monoculture modules had high soil erosion moduli and showed negative income status with the increase of the slope the soil erosion was getting severe so the income was decreasing comparing tables 2 and 3 the benefits obtained after considering the natural environmental factors had greatly fluctuated indicating that the natural environment affected by soil erosion had a great impact on farmers economic income therefore it is necessary to fully consider factors such as soil and water conservation and sustainable agricultural planting and adjust agricultural cultivation methods to promote sustainable economic development 5 discussion 5 1 conservation tillage a promising approach for management in yulin in this study it can be found that under the situation of precipitation and temperature change soil erosion and agricultural planting in yulin area would be greatly affected how to mitigate climate change through agricultural measures is a question worth discussing in this discussion section this paper will discuss and combine the research of previous scholars and conclude that the transformation from traditional tillage to conservation tillage system can promote a sustainable future in the aspects of climate change soil conservation and agricultural economic benefits in the context of global climate change the loess plateau is showing a trend of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature according to the research of yan 2015 the average precipitation in this region decreased at a rate of 7 51 mm 10a from 1961 to 2014 ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change has also shown that precipitation in northwest china could decrease by up to 5 per decade between 1951 and 2010 ipcc 2013 the study of deng et al 2014 showed that the average annual temperature of the loess plateau increased by 1 1 during 1951 2000 which may lead to an increase in plant transpiration and soil evaporation in terrestrial ecosystems the lack of fertility caused by the loss of soil organic matter and the increasing water stress under the background of climate change are the important factors limiting crop production on the loess plateau which also have a negative impact on the sustainable development of agriculture on the ecological and social level findings emerging from these studies were similar to our findings whereas the scenarios studied here are more extreme and better able to show the long term effects of climate change in this paper four scenarios of precipitation and temperature are simulated and it is found that the increase of temperature and the constant precipitation lead to the increase of evaporation the decrease of runoff and the decrease of soil erosion but this is bound to have a huge impact on farming if temperature decreases evaporation decreases and precipitation remains unchanged runoff and soil erosion rate will increase increasing or decreasing rainfall can also lead to increased soil erosion or pressure on farming therefore the establishment of an agricultural system that adapts to regional climate and natural environment and supports sustainable production with less water is the basis for guaranteeing agricultural production and protecting ecological environment in semi arid regions such as the loess plateau at present conservation tillage is the main strategy for soil and water conservation and agricultural benefit improvement in yulin area conservation tillage is a tillage technique in which mechanization is the main method low tillage or no tillage method is adopted to reduce tillage to as long as seed germination can be ensured crop straw and stubble are used to cover the ground and pesticides are mainly used to control weeds and pests zhang et al 2005 conservation tillage have shown great potential to increase soil water holding capacity and crop yields in crop systems with different climatic conditions and natural environments in recent years cerdÃ  et al 2017 su et al 2007 novara et al 2011 2019 zhang et al 2015 several studies in the mediterranean region argued that no tillage and less tillage can not only increase soil moisture but also improve water use efficiency raheem lahmod et al 2019 cerdÃ  et al 2020 in addition short term conservation tillage can increase soil water storage capacity which in turn would promote the growth of roots and increase yield lampurlanÃ©s and cantero martinez 2003 kirchhoff et al 2017 similarly long term conservation tillage can increase the water composition in soil novara et al 2019 with conservation tillage crop roots can help improving soil porosity increasing soil water infiltration rate and reducing surface runoff mcvay et al 1989 al shammary et al 2020 since 2002 11 counties districts in yulin namely dingbian shenmu yuyang hengshan jingbian suide mizhi jiaxian fugu qingjian and wubao have been listed in the ministry of agriculture for conservation tillage as areas to conduct conservation tillage projects and provincial conservation tillage projects in the past 17 years the implementing units of various projects in yulin city have implemented a total of 1 3 million mu of conservation tillage based on the principles of conducting coordinated operations consolidating results and comprehensive promotion the central and provincial governments have provided a total of 86 359 600 yuan for special funds purchase subsidies local supporting facilities and self raised funds in yulin of which 26 58 million yuan has been invested by the central province and 11 5 million yuan was from local supporting funds and 48 279 600 yuan have been raised by farmers these funds were used to promote 28 797 sets of various conservation tillage machines including 5994 sets of no tillage planters 3503 sets of other conservation tillage machines and 19 300 sets of conventional farming machinery which greatly improved the equipment structure of this area according to related statistics the implementation of conservation tillage fields will increase the yield by 0 10 per mu save 20 60 yuan per mu and achieve a total of 155 million yuan in cost savings and efficiency each area is gradually expanding the scale of implementing the projects and a long term mechanism for rolling development has been initially established the development of conservation tillage has moved from the trial and demonstration stage to the large scale promotion stage therefore this section will discuss the soil erosion and agricultural development in yulin area while taking conservation tillage as a main management method based on the findings this study aims to evaluate the benefits of the conservation tillage in yulin area and thereafter provide suggestions accordingly to achieve a better protection of farmland productivity and prevention of soil erosion in the context of climate change 5 2 promoting crop rotation together with conservation tillage conservation tillage is believed as effective in reducing carbon emissions and maintaining climate stability the simulation conducted in this study showed that climate change whether in temperature or precipitation would had negative effects such as soil erosion and loss of agricultural outcomes therefore the present study suggests that for better governance it is necessary to reduce uncertainties in the climate and mitigate climate change one of the main causes of climate change is the increase of greenhouse gases and the reduction of carbon sinks in this field previous research has shown that conservation tillage is generally considered to be effective in reducing climate change the mechanism lies in the significant changes in soil organic carbon with conservation tillage soil carbon sequestration is the process of transferring co2 from the atmosphere to the soil through plants plant residuals and other organic matters these substances become part of the soil in the form of organic matters the retention time of organic carbon in the soil can vary from short term i e do not go back to the atmosphere immediately to long term i e up to a thousand years lal et al 2007 in the early 20th century various studies on co2 emissions found that agriculture was not only one of the main sources of soil co2 emissions but also an important carbon sink for co2 kimble et al 1998 traditional farming systems can significantly increase the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere and the annual contribution to climate change can be as high as 14 vermeulen et al 2012 in addition several studies found that carbon sink could dramatically increase the soil organic carbon content during and at the end of the study and as a result the level of soil organic carbon content could exceed the initial soil level and the atmospheric co2 level was reduced kirschbaum 2000 olson 2010 page et al 2014 some researchers argued that switching from traditional farming to conservation tillage systems could significantly increase soil organic carbon content novara et al 2019 cerdÃ  et al 2020 studies have also shown that the advantages of conservation tillage in anti erosion are trivial and did not differ from traditional tillage in terms of soil carbon sequestration luo et al 2010 ogle et al 2012 however the growth trend of the effect of conservation tillage was nonlinear over time franzluebbers 2005 and soil organic carbon increased faster with the prolonged action of conservation tillage especially under the conditions of no tillage and crop straw mulching mazzoncini et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2016 raheem lahmod et al 2019 keesstra et al 2019 straw could be directly decomposed to increase soil carbon input and it can also retain more surface nutrients by reducing soil erosion however we found that similar to previous studies conducted among spanish grape growers the use of crop straw is a major factor restricting the development of conservation tillage in yulin area and the loess plateau this is because straw was also used as fuel and animal feed and there was a deeply rooted idea among farmers that all crop straw must be removed from the field before sowing in traditional farming methods cai et al 2006 cerdÃ  et al 2018a 2018b the main reasons for farmers to adopt this approach is that they believed that clearing out the straw can help effectively manage the hazards of weeds and at the same time reduce the difficulty of operation during planting therefore although the yulin area has achieved some outcomes in soil and water conservation through the promotion of conservation tillage policy makers are suggested to pay further attention to farmers viewpoint of straw utilization in the promotion of conservation tillage in addition it is believed that reasonable crop rotation should be promoted first of all according to previous research conservation tillage is not sufficient to improve carbon sequestration capacity reasonable crop rotation can bring more carbon sequestration benefits compared with short term crop rotation three year or longer crop rotation has even higher contribution to the accumulation of soil organic carbon abdalla et al 2017 indicated that compared with the no tillage system the co2 emissions of the tillage system increased by 21 additionally compared with the tillage system the rotation system significantly reduced the co2 emissions by 26 the carbon dioxide emission reduction of sandy loam with low organic matter content is lower than that of clay with high organic matter content in addition conservation tillage based on crop rotation can not only bring the benefits of soil carbon sequestration and slow down climate change it can also help solving the dilemma between grain output and farmers income this is one of the important contributions of the present study grain production and farmers income are issues worthy of attention under conservation tillage china as a country with a large population is facing a large proportion of low income citizens especially in the loess plateau concerns about food production under conservation tillage are supported by some evidences mangalassery et al 2015 reviewed previous literatures and concluded that no tillage in tropical and temperate soils can reduce greenhouse gas emissions whereas the reduction in production coming along may threaten global food security although the expected reduction in grain production would be 1 8 mangalassery et al 2015 emphatically raised a core question namely can any reduction in production be acceptable in order to achieve climate goals for poverty stricken areas the reduction of grain production will obviously aggravate poverty and cause social instability therefore combined with the findings from this study yulin area is encouraged to pay more attention to protecting the interests of farmers the conservation tillage program in yulin area are suggested to include crop stalks in the field to increase soil organic carbon storage improve productivity and increase dry farming while at the same time crop rotation and conservation tillage can be combined effectively to maintain the efficiency of agricultural output 5 3 promote slope conversion to terraces in conservation tillage in the loess plateau where yulin city is located rain fed agriculture had a dominant position in crop production deng et al 2006 liu et al 2016 among rain fed agriculture corn is the main sources of food forage and cash crops with an output accounting for 30 8 of the total yield of grain crops on the plateau however its production is often affected by water scarcity zhang et al 2014 wheat is an important food source for humans and provides high quality feed for the breeding industry as a cold season crop that undergoes the c3 photosynthetic pathway winter wheat is characterized by a high crude protein content and a large demand for soil water nielsen et al 2016 wienhold et al 2018 water scarcity is the main constraints of all crop production in rain fed agricultural systems in semi arid regions rockstrÃ¶m et al 2010 therefore soil and water conservation has become very important for regional crop production in this study the soil erosion conditions and the impact on farmers income of the corn wheat and corn wheat rotation planting methods under different slopes were simulated and analyzed the results suggested that under the rotation system the soil and water conservation benefits and economic benefits of terraced fields were most salient for most steep slopes i e with slopes greater than 7 it is necessary to avoid single planting of wheat which tend to cause soil erosion and had low benefits table 4 shows the main crops planted in 2018 recorded in the 2019 yulin statistical yearbook from the table it can be found that corn is the most important agricultural crop according to a study of ge and zhang 2020 on the status quo of yulin corn is currently the most important agricultural crop in yulin area and is widely planted in various slope areas while the planting area of wheat and rice is relatively small the analysis of the present study showed that under the goal of achieving water and soil conservation and agricultural economic benefits slope conversion to terraces is an important measure that should be taken into account in yulin the benefits of changing slopes to terraces are supported both in the present study and previous literatures the slope conversion project started relatively early in international contexts for example japan and italy are focusing on the development of slopes and paid special attention to the development of slopes as the domestic mountainous and hilly areas there have reached 75 80 of the national area only the rational development and utilization of land can make up for the scarcity of land and give full play to the resources in unused land zhou 2008 with the development in recent years increasing attention has been paid to undeveloped sloping land resources worldwide reusing sloping land resources is an important measure to develop arable land so as to realize the sustainable use of resources and improve the living standards of local farmers liu et al 2013 in addition it is worth noting that transforming slopes to terraces will also bring positive effects on climate change houghton 2007 and resh et al 2002 pointed out that in the initial stage of land development or renovation soil organic carbon would decrease the accumulation of soil organic carbon after slope conversion varies for different utilization types and nitrogen fixing plants showed higher potential for soil organic carbon accumulation in addition deng et al 2016 pointed out that the soil organic carbon increase rate and organic carbon pool capacity tend to be different in different restoration stages after conducting slope conversion the toc effects can vary depending on the number of years and can be roughly divided into three types some scholars believed that as the number of years increases soil organic carbon follow a trend of continuous accumulation and eventually reaching equilibrium an et al 2009 however some studies have shown that soil organic carbon has declined in the early stages of remediation with the increase of vegetation restoration years after remediation the content of soil organic carbon has been continuously increasing with effective accumulation and can even exceed the level before the redevelopment deng et al 2014 qin et al 2014 analyzed the organic carbon density of the 0 20 cm soil layer and found that the soil organic carbon density of robinia pseudoacacia continued to accumulate and grow with the increase in years and the soil organic carbon density increased by 59 54 in terms of the overall performance the 30 years robinia pseudoacacia was higher than cultivated land followed by immature robinia pseudoacacia in recent years the yulin government has also vigorously promoted the slope conversion project while encountering various obstacles in this process by reviewing previous literatures it should be noted that the support of fiscal policy from governments and the improvement of residents awareness should be the focus of the current implementation of the slope conversion project in yulin adopting farmer technology is recognized as a gradual or step by step decision making process barham et al 2004 conley and udry 2010 most farmers will not adopt an agricultural production technology immediately after hearing about it for the first time instead farmers will make decisions about whether or not to adopt a technology after experiencing technological adaptation while fully considering about the uncertainty the cost and economic benefits of technology adoption and observing the effects and evaluations of relatives friends or neighbors who adopted the technology in previous literature about the yulin area jia 2018 found that the waiting time of farmers for different water and soil conservation measures showed large differences the average waiting time of farmers to build terraces was about 16 5 years it took farmers approximately 8 years to adopt using water saving irrigation technology the average waiting time of farmers to utilize plastic film and afforestation was about 2 years farmers spent less than half a year on average to decide on implementing furrow and ridge farming therefore although the benefits of slope to terrace conversion are widely recognized there is still great resistance in the process of promotion and advancement by reviewing previous studies it can be found that in response to this problem collective actions by farmers have the greatest effect on reducing the waiting time for farmers to build terraces therefore in the process of promoting slope conversion the government is suggested to encourage regional scale actions for example by providing financial subsidies visser et al 2019 cerdÃ  et al 2018a 2018b 6 conclusion water and soil resources are natural resources on which human beings depend on for survival and production under the joint influence of natural and human factors soil erosion in china is becoming increasingly serious to reduce the impact of soil erosion on sustainable agricultural farming the swat model was used in this study to quantitatively analyze the regional soil and water loss affected by different climate changes in addition the evaluation and prediction model of agricultural sustainable planting was constructed in order to achieve the agricultural sustainable planting by selecting appropriate crops based on the analysis of yulin city in shaanxi province the results showed that with fixed precipitation the increase and decrease of 5 c temperature would lead to a change rate of soil loss of 27 78 and 9 52 respectively with fixed temperature the increase and decrease of 20 precipitation would lead to a change rate of soil and water loss of 21 43 and 38 10 respectively the situation of soil erosion under the slope environment was more serious and the yield of grain and farming income decreased it is necessary to choose reasonable planting methods and environmental control policies to reduce the impact of soil erosion on agricultural sustainable planting currently conservation tillage is adopted as the control measure in yulin the results of this paper indicated that slope conversion and crop rotation may be adopted simultaneously to realize the coordination of soil and water conservation and agricultural benefits under the background of climate change fiscal policies such as subsidies may also be

10351,irrigation with brackish water is a possible solution to alleviate freshwater shortages in arid and semi arid regions however necessary measures need to be taken to leach accumulated salts out of the root zone this can be accomplished by leaching with freshwater applied by surface irrigation lfsi which needs to be optimized to improve the leaching efficiency an experiment in a field drip irrigated with brackish water was carried out during 2017 and 2018 to evaluate the effects of leaching or no leaching t0 during the corn elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages the hydrus 2d 3d model was calibrated and validated using experimental data collected in 2017 and 2018 respectively the results of numerical simulations were in good agreement with measurements which is electrical conductivity ec w with mean relative errors of 11 9 10 1 10 6 and 9 2 for the t1 t2 t3 and t0 treatments respectively during the validation periods lfsi during the corn elongation stage t1 had the shortest duration of high salinity stress which lasted 42 56 57 and 82 days for the t1 t2 t3 and t0 scenarios respectively the highest rate of salt reduction in the root zone i e the desalination rate occurred when lfsi was applied during the corn grain filling stage t3 the desalinization rates were 59 68 and 69 in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively the cumulative salt flux at a depth of 40 cm increased by 2 0 16 3 and 34 7 for t1 t2 and t3 respectively compared to t0 two dimensional simulations of ec e distributions revealed that the high salinity stress area in the soil profile after lfsi was 4 48 and 92 higher for t0 than for t1 t2 and t3 respectively the simulations showed that optimal leaching time was about 41 days after sowing which led to the lowest duration of the high salinity stress period and a relatively high desalination rate of 59 keywords drip irrigation leaching during different growth stages duration of high salt stress hydrus 2d 3d corn 1 introduction shortages of water resources and soil salinization have become critical problems facing arid regions these problems have greatly restricted sustainable agricultural development and directly influenced the food security lambers 2003 liu and diamond 2005 singh 2012 jesus et al 2018 in agriculture water saving and soil salinization prevention technologies that reduce deep percolation nassah et al 2018 wang et al 2019a 2019b decrease soil evaporation hou et al 2016 wang et al 2019a 2019b and control the groundwater table soppe et al 2003 have often been used to relieve water shortage pressures however these strategies can reduce agricultural water shortages only to some extent a more direct and efficient approach is to search for new water sources soil salinization and shallow salty groundwater brackish water with a salt concentration of 2 5 g l 1 mwr 1998 besides severe drought are usually signs of problems for agricultural production singh et al 1989 quantitatively the supply of brackish water worldwide is about 1 39 109 km3 which is as much as the supply of freshwater accounting for 1 of the water on earth rozema and flowers 2008 in china the total volume of brackish water is about 13 billion m3 while the hetao irrigation district has about 8 9 billion m3 of brackish water yang et al 2020 currently brackish water has been recognized as an alternative water source to make up for the shortage of freshwater in regions with limited water resources li 2018 cucci et al 2019 therefore brackish water has been used as an important supplement to agricultural irrigation in many water scarce areas and countries such as israel ghermandi et al 2014 afghanistan ragab and christel 2002 italy cucci et al 2019 and china huang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 however brackish water needs to be used in such a way so that its impact does not significantly affect crop growth ayers et al 1976 li et al 2019a 2019b when leaching after irrigation with brackish water is insufficient salts accumulate in the root zone resulting in a significant decrease in the osmotic potential aragÃ¼Ã©s et al 2015 which produces a physiological drought root vitality decreases under conditions involving salt stress annunziata et al 2017 which reduces crop root water uptake khan et al 2004 additionally soil microorganisms are affected hodge et al 2009 chen et al 2018 the utilization of brackish water for irrigation as an alternative to fresh water is thus quite challenging if used inappropriately the use of brackish water can produce severe threats to agricultural production hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 drip irrigation has been used worldwide due to its advantageous agronomic water conservation and economic aspects lazarovitch et al 2009 wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 jia et al 2020 however since drip irrigation applies water at specific points in space salts and water are pushed towards the fringes of the wetting area chen et al 2009 and crop root growth is limited to inside the wetted volume of the soil dong et al 2010 additionally salts continue to accumulate in the root zone with an increase in irrigation time if brackish water is used for irrigation and leaching does not occur which inevitably affects crop growth thus an efficient and low cost leaching strategy for brackish water irrigation is needed to push salts out of the root zone and to reduce soil salt stresses forkutsa et al 2009 satchithanantham et al 2014 hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 the conjunctive use of brackish and freshwater for irrigation is an important way to decrease soil salinity rhoades 1984 xue and ren 2017 blending and alternate use are two options adopted when waters of different qualities are available rhoades 1984 dudley et al 2008 kulkarni 2011 ghermandi et al 2014 kondash et al 2020 for example the initial and final salt concentrations in the soil profile were not significantly different for alternate irrigation hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 however the final salt concentrations significantly increased for irrigation with conjunctive use of seawater and freshwater machekposhti et al 2017 li et al 2019a 2019b reported that alternate use of fresh and brackish waters for irrigation was more efficient than blending in alleviating adverse effects of saline water on the soil crop system in drip irrigation with brackish water salts quickly accumulate in the crop root zone due to low irrigation volumes and limited leaching hanson et al 2008 nevertheless drip irrigation with brackish water 1 1 4 9 ds m 1 and appropriate management strategies did not affect crop growth wan et al 2007 however soil salts still accumulate in the root zone with increasing irrigation times volumes when brackish water is used for example soil water salinity at a distance of up to 30 cm from the dripper almost doubled after 7 10 irrigations with brackish water electrical conductivity of 0 3 ds m 1 hanson et al 2008 it is therefore a primary practice to apply excess freshwater for leaching to avoid salt accumulation in the root zone of drip irrigated soil raij et al 2016 alternative irrigation using brackish water and freshwater was often used to solve salt accumulation when only brackish water was used with drip irrigation burt and isbell 2005 however high cost complicated operation and incomplete leaching remain unresolved questions letey et al 2011 the salt removal efficiency of drip irrigation is smaller than for surface irrigation due to spatial constraints hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 for the same irrigation duration better results are likely to be obtained for lfsi than drip irrigation because of higher water volumes and complete coverage of the soil profile it is thus necessary to optimize leaching dynamics i e times and volumes to improve the effects of lfsi additionally it is critical to reduce the frequency of leaching events with constant irrigation depths to decrease the required quantity of freshwater and to optimize its timing to alleviate the effects of the soil salt stress on crop growth compared with field experiments mathematical models have the advantage of saving time expense and labor mathematical models have many advantages to evaluate the effects of different leaching strategies on spatial and temporal distributions of soil salts sammis et al 2011 ramos et al 2012 srivastava 2019 li et al 2019a 2019b many models exist that can be used to evaluate the movement of water and soil salt under conditions involving brackish water irrigation or saline shallow water tables these include hydrus Å¡imÅ¯nek et al 2016 swap yuan et al 2019 leachc ali and elliott 2000 saltmed afzal et al 2016 soothar et al 2019 karandish and Å¡imÅ¯nek 2019 and unsatchem rasouli et al 2013 bradford and letey 1992 used the modified van genuchten hanks model to show that the cyclic irrigation strategy produced higher simulated yields of salt sensitive corn than the blending irrigation strategy yuan et al 2019 used the swap model to show that brackish water with the salt concentration of 3 5 mg cm 3 was not suitable for long term irrigation soothar et al 2019 used the saltmed model to reveal that the optimal time of using brackish water for irrigation was during the vegetative stage of winter wheat since hydrus is ï¬exible to accommodate different types of boundary conditions it has been widely used to simulate soil water and salt distributions under brackish water irrigation and to optimize management strategies phogat et al 2012 li 2018 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 used hydrus to simulate irrigation with brackish water and indicated that the amount of freshwater should be increased to reduce the salinity and enhance salt leaching yang et al 2019 showed that the higher the leaching volume the lower the salinity around the wetted body of drip irrigation hydrus simulations showed that about 1 2 kg m 3 salt was leached out from the 100 cm root zone irrigated for 15 years by a blend of brackish and fresh water he et al 2017 the main objectives of this study were i to calibrate and validate the hydrus 2d 3d model for drip irrigation with brackish water ii to evaluate soil salt spatio temporal dynamics iii to compare actual and cumulative soil salt fluxes at depths of 40 and 100 cm and iv to optimize the timing of leaching with freshwater applied by surface irrigation during different growth stages the study aims to provide a basis for the better use of drip irrigation with brackish water and leaching using surface irrigation with freshwater 2 material and methods 2 1

2018 respectively in the experiment brackish water drip irrigation and freshwater surface irrigation were conjunctively used different scenarios with different timing of leaching with freshwater applied by surface irrigation lfsi were evaluated while irrigating the field with brackish water by drippers complete random design comprising of three replicates of four treatments was conducted on 12 field plots the four treatments involved lfsi in the elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages or no leaching t0 each plot had a length of 20 m a width of 7 m and was surrounded by a bare area with a 2 m width to avoid external influences on trial conditions groundwater with an average salinity of 2 54 g l 1 electrical conductivity of about 3 7 ds m 1 was the water source for drip

event 8 events and the leaching quota for surface irrigation only once during the entire growth season was 112 5 mm additionally large irrigation about 225 mm in each year called autumn irrigation was used after the harvest on october 16 and 20 in 2017 and 2018 respectively to leach salts accumulated during the season out of the soil profile lu et al 2019 the corn zea mays l was sown on may 9 1 and harvested on september 10 11 in 2017 2018 one drip line with a 30 cm emitter spacing and one plastic film 80 cm wide were used for two corn rows with a row spacing of 40 cm and an emitter discharge of

carbamide co nh2 2 n 32 were applied in the field as basal fertilizer the carbamide co nh2 2 n 32 solubilized as topdressing was applied during the elongation stage 30 of the total n fertilizer and the grain filling stage 30 of the total n fertilizer each time accompanied with drip irrigation 2 2 measurements and methods 2 2 1 meteorological data an automatic meteorological station onset

and tensiometers zhonghui inc zknt 100 china respectively the distances between tensiometers and the drip emitter were 0 cm under mulching and 55 cm outside of mulching a bare area fig 1 the measuring depths were 5 15 30 50 70 and 90 cm for swc and 90 and 110 cm for soil water potential and measuring time intervals were about every 5 7 days additionally auger boring was used to obtain soil samples since the method is destructive measurements were collected adjacent to the tdr probes only every 10 14 days to calibrate tdr and salinity readings soil samples were divided into two groups one for measuring swc and another one for soil salinity the electrical conductivity ec w of all soil samples was determined using 1 5 extracts of soil and water by weight using a conductivity meter zhongxi inc ddsj 308 f china the electric conductivity of a saturated paste extract ec e was inferred from measured values of soil ec w using the following relationship 4 e c e 5 8216 e c w 1 3403 r 2 0 95

ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 1999 wang et al 2019a 2019b cumulative soil salt leaching was determined by multiplying the soil salt concentration of the leaching

the richards equation richards 1931 and the convection dispersion equation a detailed description can be found in Å¡imÅ¯nek et al 2016 additionally it was assumed in this study that the drip line and crops acted as infinite sources and sinks in the perpendicular direction root water extraction was computed according to the feddes model feddes et al 1978 karandish and Å¡imÅ¯nek 2018 adapted for two

to account for combined water and salinity stresses the root water uptake reduction due to the water stress was simulated using the piece wise linear function of feddes et al 1978 with default hydrus parameters for corn the root water uptake reduction due to the salinity stress was simulated using the salinity threshold ec t and slope function maas 1990 the salinity threshold and slope for corn were set to 1 7 ds m 1 and 12 respectively karandish and Å¡imÅ¯nek 2018 the soil hydraulic properties i e Î¸ h and k h are represented in the hydrus 2d 3d model using the analytical functions of van

maximum observed groundwater table depth was deï¬ned between the emitter and the middle of the no mulched area fig 1 the simulation domain was discretized using the non uniform finite element mesh generated by the hydrus 2d 3d model measured swcs and soil salinities at the beginning of the experiment of each year were used as initial conditions for simulations the top and bottom water contents were 0 19 and 0 23 cm3 cm 3 and ec w were 0 25 and 0 32 ds m 1 the no flow and atmospheric to apply precipitation irrigation and potential evaporation e p boundary conditions bcs were assigned to the 0 35 and 35 55 cm top boundary fig 1 respectively depending on whether the soil surface was covered or not by a plastic film a 2 cm wide time variable flux bc was speciï¬ed at the left corner of the soil surface to represent the emitter the potential transpiration t p ï¬ux was specified to account for plant water uptake time variable head bc was used at the bottom boundary left and right boundaries were assigned a no flow bc additionally a third type bc was used to describe concentration ï¬uxes along the top and bottom boundaries 2 3 3 model parameters soil hydraulic parameters i e Î¸ r Î¸ s Î± n and k s were obtained according to the percentage content of sand silt and clay in the soil particle distribution curve using the rosetta module of hydrus these values of soil hydraulic parameters were further manually calibrated by comparing simulated and observed values of swcs and soil salt contents table 2 the longitudinal dispersivities of two soil layers were 50 and 20 cm the transversal dispersivities were set to one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivities ramos et al 2012 since molecular diffusion can usually be neglected the molecular diffusion coefficient was set to zero radcliffe and Å¡imÅ¯nek 2010 the root distribution parameters were obtained from actual measurements table 3 2 4 model performance criteria the paired t test analysis for the statistical comparison of the observed and hydrus 2d 3d simulated data demonstrated no significant difference between the observed and simulated swcs and salinities during 2017 and 2018 agreement between simulated and observed values was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the mean relative error mre for each treatment 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 1 2 10 m

2d 3d model was calibrated and validated using the swc and ec w experimental data from the years of 2017 and 2018 respectively various statistical tests rmse mae and mre were carried out to investigate the model performance and they showed good agreement between simulated and measured values table 4 the range of rmses for the calibration periods for swcs and ec w was 0 03 0 08 cm3 cm 3 and 0 08 0 12 ds m 1 respectively corresponding ranges for mae were 0 01 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and 0 05 0 06 ds m 1 for mre were 10 2 11 2 and 8 6 13 0 and for r 2 were 0 9 0 95 and 0 85 0 91 respectively additionally the range of rmses for the validation periods for swc and ec w was 0 02 0 09 cm3 cm 3 and 0 10 0 13 ds m 1 respectively corresponding ranges for mae were 0 01 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and 0 05 0 08 ds m 1 for mre were 8 9 11 6 and 9 2 11 9 and for r 2 were 0 89 0 95 and 0 88 0 92 respectively simulation errors for both swc and ec w were slightly higher under the mulch than in the bare area likely because of damaged plastic film 3 2 effects of lfsi timing on electrical conductivity ec e the soil ec e under drip irrigation varied quite dynamically ec e values of different soil layers were analyzed for different timings of lfsi during the elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages and under no leaching conditions t0 in the 2017 and 2018 seasons fig 4 ec e in the 0 40 cm soil layer had an average ec e of 6 2 ds m 1 during the growth period the ec e in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers decreased after irrigation with brackish water fig 4 and then gradually increased ec e in the deep soil layer 40 100 cm was practically unaffected by drip irrigation overall ec e of each soil layer gradually increased during the entire growth stage and it quickly increased above 5 9 ds m 1 when corn yield was expected to be reduced by about 50 from optimal yield fao29 1976 additionally the maximum ec e reached values of 9 0 and 12 1 ds m 1 in the shallow soil layer 0 40 m in 2017 and 2018 respectively and 6 5 and 7 0 ds m 1 in the deep soil layer 40 100 cm when no leaching was applied during the growth stage when ec e is higher than 5 9 ds m 1 high salt stress hss corn yield is expected to decrease by more than 50 fao29 1976 it is thus important to extend the duration of the low salt stress conditions ec e lower than 5 9 ds m 1 lss during the corn growing season significant decreases in ec e in all soil layers were produced after lfsi leaching with freshwater average ec e decreased to 2 4 ds m 1 which represented an average decrease of 74 and 52 in the shallow and deep soil layers for three leaching treatments in both years respectively the effects of the timing of lfsi on ec e were different early lfsi caused the lowest average ec e in the experiment and a longer duration of lss the average ec e in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the t1 t2 t3 and t0 scenarios was 5 3 5 4 5 5 and 6 9 ds m 1 during the entire growing season in both years respectively the average duration of lss was 83 69 68 and 43 days respectively the average ec e in the 0 40 cm soil layer was 6 1 6 2 6 3 and 7 8 ds m 1 respectively and the average duration of lss was 69 56 55 and 41 days respectively however later lfsi led to lower ec e at the end of the growing season das 125 ec e in the shallow soil layer was 10 2 10 2 8 6 and 13 1 ds m 1 in the t1 t2 t3 and t0 scenarios in both years respectively and 6 7 6 2 5 3 and 8 6 ds m 1 in the deep soil layer lfsi in the elongation stage t1 produced a longer duration of lss by 21 19 and 45 compared with lfsi in the t2 t3 and t0 scenarios even though ec e at the end of the growing season was a little higher than in t2 and t3 lfsi applied during any growth stage can significantly decrease ec e in the soil in all soil layers lfsi in the elongation stage can produce the lowest average soil salinity and the longest duration of lss 3 3 actual and cumulative salt fluxes at depths of 40 and 100 cm for different lfsi treatments in the study the maximum depth of the wetted soil after drip irrigation was 40 cm while the maximum measured corn rooting depth during the grain filling stage was 80 3 cm we therefore measured simulated and analyzed actual and cumulative salt fluxes at depths of 40 and 100 cm fig 5 overall soil salts at depths of 40 and 100 cm always moved upward during periods without irrigation or rainfall and downward salt leaching after drip irrigation with brackish water the average peak of the salt leaching flux at 40 cm was 8 9 mg cm 3 day 1 negative sign in fig 5 indicates leaching which was about 80 higher than fluxes at 100 cm salt leaching fluxes significantly increased after lfsi in each treatment the average peak of the salt leaching flux at a depth of 100 cm was higher than the one at a depth of 40 cm i e 30 2 and 36 9 mg cm 3 day 1 at depths of 40 and 100 cm respectively in all treatment due to accumulated salts in the 40 100 cm soil layer during drip irrigation without leaching later lfsis caused higher maxima in the salt leaching flux for example the maximum salt leaching flux at a depth of 40 cm was 19 3 32 2 and 39 1 mg cm 3 day 1 for lfsi during the elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages respectively the salt fluxes increased to 25 1 36 2 and 49 4 mg cm 3 day 1 at a depth of 100 cm due to salt accumulation in the soil before lfsi except for small positive values capillary rise during the early corn growing season das 0 41 the cumulative salt flux csf at the 100 cm soil depth was always negative i e soil salt leaching the timing of lfsi had a noticeable effect on csf and later lfsi caused higher cumulative salt leaching for example the csf values at a depth of 40 cm were 4 9 5 0 5 7 and 6 6 t ha 1 for t0 t1 t2 and t3 at the end of the growing season das 125 respectively and 3 0 3 2 4 5 and 5 4 t ha 1 at a depth of 100 cm the later lfsi was applied the more salts were leached larger differences were recorded at a depth of 100 cm than 40 cm 3 4 the effects of lfsi timing on two dimensional ece and salt stress distribution fig 6 shows the two dimensional distributions of simulated ec e for all four treatments to demonstrate the effects of the different timing of lfsi on the salt stress in the soil profile fig 6 shows the ec e profiles before das 41 66 and 87 and after das 43 68 and 89 either drip irrigation or lfsi during the 2017 season generally ec e gradually increased with time in all treatments due to the input of salts with brackish water and salted groundwater for example the average ec e in the soil profile was 5 67 8 22 and 9 36 ds m 1 on das 41 66 and 87 in the t0 treatment fig 6s u w respectively when the hss areas accounted for 10 62 and 91 of the total area although salt concentrations in the surface soil decreased after drip irrigation with brackish water the overall mass of salts in the soil profile remained similar due to the lack of leaching and the average ec e in all treatments increased for example the average ec e increased 21 15 and 8 on das 43 68 and 89 compared with those on das 41 66 and 87 in the t0 treatment fig 6s t u v w x respectively there was a dramatic decrease in soil salt mass and ec e concentration in the soil profile after lfsi was applied fig 6 the hss area in the soil profile completely disappeared following lfsi additionally when lfsi was applied later in the season after more salts had accumulated in the soil profile a decrease in soil salt concentrations was more obvious for example there was a 4 48 and 92 reduction in average ec e after lfsi was applied on das 43 t1 68 t2 and 89 t3 compared with those of das 41 t1 66 t2 and 87 t3 respectively fig 6a b i j q r 3 5 the effects of the lfsi time on water and salt balance components soil water and salt balance components were greatly influenced by the lfsi events table 5 actual et fluxes for the lfsi treatments t1 t2 and t3 were higher than for t0 and increased on average by 14 2 and 13 9 in 2017 and 2018 respectively lfsi applied later in the season caused lower et and corn yield due to longer hss actual et was on average 71 7 57 8 and 49 4 mm higher in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments than in the t0 treatment respectively compared with t0 corn yields increased on average in two growing seasons by 18 5 7 9 and 0 8 significant differences in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively however except for t1 which showed a small improvement average wue decreased due to higher irrigation and leaching compared t0 additionally the t0 treatment due to the lowest amount of irrigation water utilized more groundwater 12 3 and 25 5 more in 2017 and 2018 respectively compared with the lfsi treatments lfsi applied later caused a slight reduction in groundwater use for example there was a difference of 8 5 mm in the cumulative upward water flux between t1 and t3 during 2017 lfsi treatments produced more salt leaching compared with t0 the later lfsi was applied the higher the salt leaching the average amounts of leached salts in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments were 12 4 13 1 and 15 7 t ha 1 which were 1 2 1 3 and 1 5 times higher than in t0 since t0 utilized more saline groundwater more salts were transported into the soil profile from groundwater in this treatment than in the other treatments on average 13 5 11 6 11 4 and 11 2 t ha 1 in t0 t1 t2 and t3 in both years respectively additionally s e the final soil salt storage in t0 was higher than those in the lfsi treatments and lfsi applied later produced lower s e the average over two years s e was 26 2 22 5 21 6 and 19 3 t ha 1 in t0 t1 t2 and t3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the necessity of leaching fields irrigated with brackish water in areas with shallow groundwater irrigation with brackish water i e with salt concentrations of 2 8 8 2 ds m 1 inevitably leads to salt accumulation in the soil profile the salt distribution depends on the irrigation method for example salts are usually accumulated in the shallow wetted soil layer under drip irrigation selim et al 2012 goldberg et al 1976 in this study although ec e in the surface soil decreased after the application of drip irrigation with brackish water the accumulated salts were not leached out of the root zone 0 100 cm due to a low drip irrigation volume these salts were only transported sideways to bare areas and into the deeper root zone as a result some portions of the corn root system remained under salt stress in contrast salts are mostly distributed below the 80 cm depth under surface irrigation mainly due to the larger irrigation quota of each application fao29 1976 sinha and singh 1976 when the soil salt concentrations are higher than that of brackish water an area with reduced salinity a desalinization zone will be temporarily formed in the wetted soil layer after brackish water irrigation for example in this study the region with reduced salinity occurs in the top 40 cm fig 6 the salts are pushed out of the wetted soil and accumulate around the wetting front zhang et al 2019 however accumulated salts can still move back into the crop root zone due to crop transpiration and soil evaporation groenveld et al 2013 in this study the soil salt concentration in the root zone gradually increased with time when no freshwater irrigation was used for example the average salt concentration on das 41 das 66 das 89 was 4 8 7 4 and 9 6 ds m 1 in the fan shaped region with a radius of about 40 cm respectively fig 6s u w as a result salinity stress inevitably appeared under brackish water drip irrigation it is necessary to leach the salts out of the crop root zone with freshwater in order to keep salinity below the threshold salinity level and not to restrict crop growth zhang et al 2019 usually soil salts are leached out of the crop root zone by percolation in this study 55 mm of water with 19 3 39 1 mg cm 2 of salts were leached below the 40 cm depth by irrigation of 112 5 mm of freshwater with a salinity of 0 76 d s 1 fig 5 in areas with shallow groundwater saline groundwater can move into the soil due to the capillary action and the salts then remain in the root zone the risk of secondary salinization is practically unavoidable when there is no human intervention satchithanantham et al 2014 it was found in this study that when brackish water was the only source for irrigation t0 8 6 t ha 2 of salts migrated from groundwater into the soil during the crop growth period 65 of total soil salts forkutsa et al 2009 found that salinization was inevitable in shallow groundwater areas unless underground drainage conditions were improved shallow groundwater areas with high salinity can thus easily produce physiological drought xu et al 2019 leaching using freshwater irrigation is then needed to move soil salts out of the root zone for example in our study freshwater irrigation leached 12 4 13 1 and 15 7 t ha 2 of salts out of the root zone on das 41 66 and 89 respectively 4 2 effects of the timing of leaching on soil salinity in a field irrigated with brackish water usually leaching using freshwater is carried out only at the end of the growing season or at the beginning of the next growing season peng et al 2016 however in such a case salts can accumulate in the root zone during the growing season so that crop growth may still be under salinity stress in the later growth stages minhas and gupta 1993a 1993b therefore alternative irrigation with salt and freshwater is often applied to control soil salinity during the season chauhan et al 2007 xu et al 2014 although more freshwater is then needed leaching using irrigation with fresh water during critical growth periods can not only decrease soil salinity but may also reduce the amount of required water for irrigation bradford and letey 1992 alternate irrigation has thus become an important technology used in conjunction with brackish water irrigation minhas et al 2007 we define the desalination rate as dr ec e t 1 ec e t 2 ec e t 1 100 where t 1 and t 2 are times before and after leaching respectively since salts accumulate in the soil with time earlier leaching using freshwater irrigation leads to a lower desalination rate and higher corn yield due to low salt accumulation in comparison later leaching is accompanied by more prolonged salt stress on crop growth after the elongation stage naresh et al 1993a 1993b for example in this study the desalination rate for the 0 40 cm soil horizon was 66 76 and 77 fig 7 while the number of days with high salt stress hss was 56 69 and 70 when leaching was applied during the corn elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages respectively fig 4 however the highest corn yield and wue of 11 063 kg ha 1 and 22 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 an average for two years respectively were found for t1 which represented an increase of 9 8 17 5 18 5 and 6 7 12 1 1 4 compared with t2 t3 and t0 respectively hence the optimal leaching time is crucial for improving the desalination rate and corn yield and for reducing the duration of salt stress the statistical tests showed that there was a high consistency between measured and simulated values for various treatments during both calibration and validation periods that meets the requirements of soil water and salinity simulations r 2 0 88 hence numerical simulations were carried out for scenarios with leaching at 6 19 31 36 39 41 43 48 55 66 79 89 98 and 125 days after sowing das while keeping all other conditions the same as above the results showed that the average ec e was not significantly affected by the timing of leaching except when no leaching was applied the average ec e for all leaching treatments in the 0 40 cm soil layer was 6 2 ds m 1 which was significantly lower than in the t0 scenario with the average ec e of 7 8 ds m 1 the corresponding values for the 0 100 cm soil layer were 5 5 ds m 1 leaching treatments and 6 9 ds m 1 t0 fig 7a c based on the t1 t2 and t3 scenarios it was found that earlier leaching resulted in a shorter duration of hss simulations discussed in this section showed that the shortest duration of hss was obtained when leaching was applied on das 41 fig 4 when leaching was applied either before or after 41 das the duration of hss always increased the duration of hss for leaching at das 41 decreased by 32 and 50 in the 0 40 cm and 0 100 cm soil layers respectively compared with no leaching t0 fig 7a c later leaching always resulted in higher desalination rates and higher cumulative salt fluxes at both depths of 40 and 100 cm when leaching was applied after das 41 the desalination rate increased but the growth would be reduced after das 66 fig 7b d the optimal irrigation time for leaching is thus between das 41 66 when considering both the duration of hss and the desalination rate 5 conclusions the soil salt dynamics in experimental plots drip irrigated with brackish water and lfsi in the corn elongation t1 tasseling t2 or grain filling t3 stages or not leached t0 was evaluated both experimentally and numerically with hydrus 2d 3d the model was successfully calibrated and validated using observed soil salt concentrations from 2017 and 2018 respectively the accuracy for the validation period meets standard requirements with rmse mae mre and r 2 of 0 02 0 13 mg cm 3 0 0465 0 0801 mg cm 3 8 7 11 1 and 0 88 0 92 respectively the electrical conductivity of a saturated extract ec e in the soil dramatically decreased after lfsi in both shallow 0 40 cm and deep 40 100 cm soil layers the earlier lfsi was applied the shorter duration of high salt stress ec e higher than 5 9 ds m 1 hss the duration of hss was 42 56 57 and 82 days in the t1 t2 t3 and t0 scenarios respectively however the later lfsi is applied the more salts are leached from the root zone the desalinization rate was 297 410 and 431 for t1 t2 and t3 respectively while significantly more salts could be leached below the 100 cm depth when lfsi was applied later the differences in salt leaching below the 40 cm depth were much smaller cumulative salt fluxes at the 40 cm depth for t1 t2 and t3 increased by 36 7 66 7 and 80 compared to that for t0 the two dimensional ec e distributions showed that the salt stress area in the soil profile after lfsi in the t0 scenario was 4 48 and 92 higher than in the t1 t2 and t3 scenarios respectively in the t0 scenario the soil salts from the shallow soil layer were only transported to deeper soil zone the hss area in the soil profile completely disappeared after lfsi additionally later leaching was preceded by more salts being accumulated in the soil profile before leaching although later leaching improved the desalination rate the duration of the salt stress was longer the optimal time for lfsi determined based on scenario simulations with hydrus 2d 3d was about 41 days after sowing declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10351,irrigation with brackish water is a possible solution to alleviate freshwater shortages in arid and semi arid regions however necessary measures need to be taken to leach accumulated salts out of the root zone this can be accomplished by leaching with freshwater applied by surface irrigation lfsi which needs to be optimized to improve the leaching efficiency an experiment in a field drip irrigated with brackish water was carried out during 2017 and 2018 to evaluate the effects of leaching or no leaching t0 during the corn elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages the hydrus 2d 3d model was calibrated and validated using experimental data collected in 2017 and 2018 respectively the results of numerical simulations were in good agreement with measurements which is electrical conductivity ec w with mean relative errors of 11 9 10 1 10 6 and 9 2 for the t1 t2 t3 and t0 treatments respectively during the validation periods lfsi during the corn elongation stage t1 had the shortest duration of high salinity stress which lasted 42 56 57 and 82 days for the t1 t2 t3 and t0 scenarios respectively the highest rate of salt reduction in the root zone i e the desalination rate occurred when lfsi was applied during the corn grain filling stage t3 the desalinization rates were 59 68 and 69 in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively the cumulative salt flux at a depth of 40 cm increased by 2 0 16 3 and 34 7 for t1 t2 and t3 respectively compared to t0 two dimensional simulations of ec e distributions revealed that the high salinity stress area in the soil profile after lfsi was 4 48 and 92 higher for t0 than for t1 t2 and t3 respectively the simulations showed that optimal leaching time was about 41 days after sowing which led to the lowest duration of the high salinity stress period and a relatively high desalination rate of 59 keywords drip irrigation leaching during different growth stages duration of high salt stress hydrus 2d 3d corn 1 introduction shortages of water resources and soil salinization have become critical problems facing arid regions these problems have greatly restricted sustainable agricultural development and directly influenced the food security lambers 2003 liu and diamond 2005 singh 2012 jesus et al 2018 in agriculture water saving and soil salinization prevention technologies that reduce deep percolation nassah et al 2018 wang et al 2019a 2019b decrease soil evaporation hou et al 2016 wang et al 2019a 2019b and control the groundwater table soppe et al 2003 have often been used to relieve water shortage pressures however these strategies can reduce agricultural water shortages only to some extent a more direct and efficient approach is to search for new water sources soil salinization and shallow salty groundwater brackish water with a salt concentration of 2 5 g l 1 mwr 1998 besides severe drought are usually signs of problems for agricultural production singh et al 1989 quantitatively the supply of brackish water worldwide is about 1 39 109 km3 which is as much as the supply of freshwater accounting for 1 of the water on earth rozema and flowers 2008 in china the total volume of brackish water is about 13 billion m3 while the hetao irrigation district has about 8 9 billion m3 of brackish water yang et al 2020 currently brackish water has been recognized as an alternative water source to make up for the shortage of freshwater in regions with limited water resources li 2018 cucci et al 2019 therefore brackish water has been used as an important supplement to agricultural irrigation in many water scarce areas and countries such as israel ghermandi et al 2014 afghanistan ragab and christel 2002 italy cucci et al 2019 and china huang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 however brackish water needs to be used in such a way so that its impact does not significantly affect crop growth ayers et al 1976 li et al 2019a 2019b when leaching after irrigation with brackish water is insufficient salts accumulate in the root zone resulting in a significant decrease in the osmotic potential aragÃ¼Ã©s et al 2015 which produces a physiological drought root vitality decreases under conditions involving salt stress annunziata et al 2017 which reduces crop root water uptake khan et al 2004 additionally soil microorganisms are affected hodge et al 2009 chen et al 2018 the utilization of brackish water for irrigation as an alternative to fresh water is thus quite challenging if used inappropriately the use of brackish water can produce severe threats to agricultural production hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 drip irrigation has been used worldwide due to its advantageous agronomic water conservation and economic aspects lazarovitch et al 2009 wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 jia et al 2020 however since drip irrigation applies water at specific points in space salts and water are pushed towards the fringes of the wetting area chen et al 2009 and crop root growth is limited to inside the wetted volume of the soil dong et al 2010 additionally salts continue to accumulate in the root zone with an increase in irrigation time if brackish water is used for irrigation and leaching does not occur which inevitably affects crop growth thus an efficient and low cost leaching strategy for brackish water irrigation is needed to push salts out of the root zone and to reduce soil salt stresses forkutsa et al 2009 satchithanantham et al 2014 hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 the conjunctive use of brackish and freshwater for irrigation is an important way to decrease soil salinity rhoades 1984 xue and ren 2017 blending and alternate use are two options adopted when waters of different qualities are available rhoades 1984 dudley et al 2008 kulkarni 2011 ghermandi et al 2014 kondash et al 2020 for example the initial and final salt concentrations in the soil profile were not significantly different for alternate irrigation hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 however the final salt concentrations significantly increased for irrigation with conjunctive use of seawater and freshwater machekposhti et al 2017 li et al 2019a 2019b reported that alternate use of fresh and brackish waters for irrigation was more efficient than blending in alleviating adverse effects of saline water on the soil crop system in drip irrigation with brackish water salts quickly accumulate in the crop root zone due to low irrigation volumes and limited leaching hanson et al 2008 nevertheless drip irrigation with brackish water 1 1 4 9 ds m 1 and appropriate management strategies did not affect crop growth wan et al 2007 however soil salts still accumulate in the root zone with increasing irrigation times volumes when brackish water is used for example soil water salinity at a distance of up to 30 cm from the dripper almost doubled after 7 10 irrigations with brackish water electrical conductivity of 0 3 ds m 1 hanson et al 2008 it is therefore a primary practice to apply excess freshwater for leaching to avoid salt accumulation in the root zone of drip irrigated soil raij et al 2016 alternative irrigation using brackish water and freshwater was often used to solve salt accumulation when only brackish water was used with drip irrigation burt and isbell 2005 however high cost complicated operation and incomplete leaching remain unresolved questions letey et al 2011 the salt removal efficiency of drip irrigation is smaller than for surface irrigation due to spatial constraints hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 for the same irrigation duration better results are likely to be obtained for lfsi than drip irrigation because of higher water volumes and complete coverage of the soil profile it is thus necessary to optimize leaching dynamics i e times and volumes to improve the effects of lfsi additionally it is critical to reduce the frequency of leaching events with constant irrigation depths to decrease the required quantity of freshwater and to optimize its timing to alleviate the effects of the soil salt stress on crop growth compared with field experiments mathematical models have the advantage of saving time expense and labor mathematical models have many advantages to evaluate the effects of different leaching strategies on spatial and temporal distributions of soil salts sammis et al 2011 ramos et al 2012 srivastava 2019 li et al 2019a 2019b many models exist that can be used to evaluate the movement of water and soil salt under conditions involving brackish water irrigation or saline shallow water tables these include hydrus

used the modified van genuchten hanks model to show that the cyclic irrigation strategy produced higher simulated yields of salt sensitive corn than the blending irrigation strategy yuan et al 2019 used the swap model to show that brackish water with the salt concentration of 3 5 mg cm 3 was not suitable for long term irrigation soothar et al 2019 used the saltmed model to reveal that the optimal time of using brackish water for irrigation was during the vegetative stage of winter wheat since hydrus is ï¬exible to accommodate different types of boundary conditions it has been widely used to simulate soil water and salt distributions under brackish water irrigation and to optimize management strategies phogat et al 2012 li 2018 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 used hydrus to simulate irrigation with brackish water and indicated that the amount of freshwater should be increased to reduce the salinity and enhance salt leaching yang et al 2019 showed that the higher the leaching volume the lower the salinity around the wetted body of drip irrigation hydrus simulations showed that about 1 2 kg m 3 salt was leached out from the 100 cm root zone irrigated for 15 years by a blend of brackish and fresh water he et al 2017 the main objectives of this study were i to calibrate and validate the hydrus 2d 3d model for drip irrigation with brackish water ii to evaluate soil salt spatio temporal dynamics iii to compare actual and cumulative soil salt fluxes at depths of 40 and 100 cm and iv to optimize the timing of leaching with freshwater applied by surface irrigation during different growth stages the study aims to provide a basis for the better use of drip irrigation with brackish water and leaching using surface irrigation with freshwater 2 material and methods 2 1

2018 respectively in the experiment brackish water drip irrigation and freshwater surface irrigation were conjunctively used different scenarios with different timing of leaching with freshwater applied by surface irrigation lfsi were evaluated while irrigating the field with brackish water by drippers complete random design comprising of three replicates of four treatments was conducted on 12 field plots the four treatments involved lfsi in the elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages or no leaching t0 each plot had a length of 20 m a width of 7 m and was surrounded by a bare area with a 2 m width to avoid external influences on trial conditions groundwater with an average salinity of 2 54 g l 1 electrical conductivity of about 3 7 ds m 1 was the water source for drip

used after the harvest on october 16 and 20 in 2017 and 2018 respectively to leach salts accumulated during the season out of the soil profile lu et al 2019 the corn zea mays l was sown on may 9 1 and

maximum observed groundwater table depth was deï¬ned between the emitter and the middle of the no mulched area fig 1 the simulation domain was discretized using the non uniform finite element mesh generated by the hydrus 2d 3d model measured swcs and soil salinities at the beginning of the experiment of each year were used as initial conditions for simulations the top and bottom water contents

Î¸ r Î¸ s Î± n and k s were obtained according to the percentage content of sand silt and clay in the soil particle distribution curve using the rosetta module of hydrus these values of soil hydraulic parameters were further manually calibrated by comparing simulated and observed values of swcs and soil salt contents table 2 the longitudinal dispersivities of two soil layers were 50 and 20 cm the transversal dispersivities were set to one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivities ramos et al 2012 since molecular diffusion can usually be neglected the molecular diffusion coefficient was set to zero radcliffe and Å¡imÅ¯nek 2010 the root distribution parameters were obtained from actual measurements table 3 2 4 model performance criteria the paired t test analysis for the statistical comparison of the observed and hydrus 2d 3d simulated data demonstrated no significant difference between the observed and simulated swcs and salinities during 2017 and 2018 agreement between

2d 3d model was calibrated and validated using the swc and ec w experimental data from the years of 2017 and 2018 respectively various statistical tests rmse mae and mre were carried out to investigate the model performance and they showed good agreement between simulated and measured values table 4 the range of rmses for the calibration periods for swcs and ec w was 0 03 0 08 cm3 cm 3 and 0 08 0 12 ds m 1 respectively corresponding ranges for mae were 0 01 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and 0 05 0 06 ds m 1 for mre were 10 2 11 2 and 8 6 13 0 and for r 2 were 0 9 0 95 and 0 85 0 91 respectively additionally the range of rmses for the validation periods for swc and ec w was 0 02 0 09 cm3 cm 3 and 0 10 0 13 ds m 1 respectively corresponding ranges for mae were 0 01 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and 0 05 0 08 ds m 1 for mre were 8 9 11 6 and 9 2 11 9 and for r 2 were 0 89 0 95 and 0 88 0 92 respectively simulation errors for both swc and ec w were slightly higher under the mulch than in the bare area likely because of damaged plastic film 3 2 effects of lfsi timing on electrical conductivity ec e the soil ec e under drip irrigation varied quite dynamically ec e values of different soil layers were analyzed for different timings of lfsi during the elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages and under no leaching conditions t0 in the 2017 and 2018 seasons fig 4 ec e in the 0 40 cm soil layer had an average ec e of 6 2 ds m 1 during the growth period the ec e in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers decreased after irrigation with brackish water fig 4 and then gradually increased ec e in the deep soil layer 40 100 cm was practically unaffected by drip irrigation overall ec e of each soil layer gradually increased during the entire growth stage and it quickly increased above 5 9 ds m 1 when corn yield was expected to be reduced by about 50 from optimal yield fao29 1976 additionally the maximum ec e reached values of 9 0 and 12 1 ds m 1 in the shallow soil layer 0 40 m in 2017 and 2018 respectively and 6 5 and 7 0 ds m 1 in the deep soil layer 40 100 cm when no leaching was applied during the growth stage when ec e is higher than 5 9 ds m 1 high salt stress hss corn yield is expected to decrease by more than 50 fao29 1976 it is thus important to extend the duration of the low salt stress conditions ec e lower than 5 9 ds m 1 lss during the corn growing season significant decreases in ec e in all soil layers were produced after lfsi leaching with freshwater average ec e decreased to 2 4 ds m 1 which represented an average decrease of 74 and 52 in the shallow and deep soil layers for three leaching treatments in both years respectively the effects of the timing of lfsi on ec e were different early lfsi caused the lowest average ec e in the experiment and a longer duration of lss the average ec e in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the t1 t2 t3 and t0 scenarios was 5 3 5 4 5 5 and 6 9 ds m 1 during the entire growing season in both years respectively the average duration of lss was 83 69 68 and 43 days respectively the average ec e in the 0 40 cm soil layer was 6 1 6 2 6 3 and 7 8 ds m 1 respectively and the average duration of lss was 69 56 55 and 41 days respectively however later lfsi led to lower ec e at the end of the growing season das 125 ec e in the shallow soil layer was 10 2 10 2 8 6 and 13 1 ds m 1 in the t1 t2 t3 and t0 scenarios in both years respectively and 6 7 6 2 5 3 and 8 6 ds m 1 in the deep soil layer lfsi in the elongation stage t1 produced a longer duration of lss by 21 19 and 45 compared with lfsi in the t2 t3 and t0 scenarios even though ec e at the end of the growing season was a little higher than in t2 and t3 lfsi applied during any growth stage can significantly decrease ec e in the soil in all soil layers lfsi in the elongation stage can produce the lowest average soil salinity and the longest duration of lss 3 3 actual and cumulative salt fluxes at depths of 40 and 100 cm for different lfsi treatments in the study the maximum depth of the wetted soil after drip irrigation was 40 cm while the maximum measured corn rooting depth during the grain filling stage was 80 3 cm we therefore measured simulated and analyzed actual and cumulative salt fluxes at depths of 40 and 100 cm fig 5 overall soil salts at depths of 40 and 100 cm always moved upward during periods without irrigation or rainfall and downward salt leaching after drip irrigation with brackish water the average peak of the salt leaching flux at 40 cm was 8 9 mg cm 3 day 1 negative sign in fig 5 indicates leaching which was about 80 higher than fluxes at 100 cm salt leaching fluxes significantly increased after lfsi in each treatment the average peak of the salt leaching flux at a depth of 100 cm was higher than the one at a depth of 40 cm i e 30 2 and 36 9 mg cm 3 day 1 at depths of 40 and 100 cm respectively in all treatment due to accumulated salts in the 40 100 cm soil layer during drip irrigation without leaching later lfsis caused higher maxima in the salt leaching flux for example the maximum salt leaching flux at a depth of 40 cm was 19 3 32 2 and 39 1 mg cm 3 day 1 for lfsi during the elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages respectively the salt fluxes increased to 25 1 36 2 and 49 4 mg cm 3 day 1 at a depth of 100 cm due to salt accumulation in the soil before lfsi except for small positive values capillary rise during the early corn growing season das 0 41 the cumulative salt flux csf at the 100 cm soil depth was always negative i e soil salt leaching the timing of lfsi had a noticeable effect on csf and later lfsi caused higher cumulative salt leaching for example the csf values at a depth of 40 cm were 4 9 5 0 5 7 and 6 6 t ha 1 for t0 t1 t2 and t3 at the end of the growing season das 125 respectively and 3 0 3 2 4 5 and 5 4 t ha 1 at a depth of 100 cm the later lfsi was applied the more salts were leached larger differences were recorded at a depth of 100 cm than 40 cm 3 4 the effects of lfsi timing on two dimensional ece and salt stress distribution fig 6 shows the two dimensional distributions of simulated ec e for all four treatments to demonstrate the effects of the different timing of lfsi on the salt stress in the soil profile fig 6 shows the ec e profiles before das 41 66 and 87 and after das 43 68 and 89 either drip irrigation or lfsi during the 2017 season generally ec e gradually increased with time in all treatments due to the input of salts with brackish water and salted groundwater for example the average ec e in the soil profile was 5 67 8 22 and 9 36 ds m 1 on das 41 66 and 87 in the t0 treatment fig 6s u w respectively when the hss areas accounted for 10 62 and 91 of the total area although salt concentrations in the surface soil decreased after drip irrigation with brackish water the overall mass of salts in the soil profile remained similar due to the lack of leaching and the average ec e in all treatments increased for example the average ec e increased 21 15 and 8 on das 43 68 and 89 compared with those on das 41 66 and 87 in the t0 treatment fig 6s t u v w x respectively there was a dramatic decrease in soil salt mass and ec e concentration in the soil profile after lfsi was applied fig 6 the hss area in the soil profile completely disappeared following lfsi additionally when lfsi was applied later in the season after more salts had accumulated in the soil profile a decrease in soil salt concentrations was more obvious for example there was a 4 48 and 92 reduction in average ec e after lfsi was applied on das 43 t1 68 t2 and 89 t3 compared with those of das 41 t1 66 t2 and 87 t3 respectively fig 6a b i j q r 3 5 the effects of the lfsi time on water and salt balance components soil water and salt balance components were greatly influenced by the lfsi events table 5 actual et fluxes for the lfsi treatments t1 t2 and t3 were higher than for t0 and increased on average by 14 2 and 13 9 in 2017 and 2018 respectively lfsi applied later in the season caused lower et and corn yield due to longer hss actual et was on average 71 7 57 8 and 49 4 mm higher in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments than in the t0 treatment respectively compared with t0 corn yields increased on average in two growing seasons by 18 5 7 9 and 0 8 significant differences in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments respectively however except for t1 which showed a small improvement average wue decreased due to higher irrigation and leaching compared t0 additionally the t0 treatment due to the lowest amount of irrigation water utilized more groundwater 12 3 and 25 5 more in 2017 and 2018 respectively compared with the lfsi treatments lfsi applied later caused a slight reduction in groundwater use for example there was a difference of 8 5 mm in the cumulative upward water flux between t1 and t3 during 2017 lfsi treatments produced more salt leaching compared with t0 the later lfsi was applied the higher the salt leaching the average amounts of leached salts in the t1 t2 and t3 treatments were 12 4 13 1 and 15 7 t ha 1 which were 1 2 1 3 and 1 5 times higher than in t0 since t0 utilized more saline groundwater more salts were transported into the soil profile from groundwater in this treatment than in the other treatments on average 13 5 11 6 11 4 and 11 2 t ha 1 in t0 t1 t2 and t3 in both years respectively additionally s e the final soil salt storage in t0 was higher than those in the lfsi treatments and lfsi applied later produced lower s e the average over two years s e was 26 2 22 5 21 6 and 19 3 t ha 1 in t0 t1 t2 and t3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the necessity of leaching fields irrigated with brackish water in areas with shallow groundwater irrigation with brackish water i e with salt concentrations of 2 8 8 2 ds m 1 inevitably leads to salt accumulation in the soil profile the salt distribution depends on the irrigation method for example salts are usually accumulated in the shallow wetted soil layer under drip irrigation selim et al 2012 goldberg et al 1976 in this study although ec e in the surface soil decreased after the application of drip irrigation with brackish water the accumulated salts were not leached out of the root zone 0 100 cm due to a low drip irrigation volume these salts were only transported sideways to bare areas and into the deeper root zone as a result some portions of the corn root system remained under salt stress in contrast salts are mostly distributed below the 80 cm depth under surface irrigation mainly due to the larger irrigation quota of each application fao29 1976 sinha and singh 1976 when the soil salt concentrations are higher than that of brackish water an area with reduced salinity a desalinization zone will be temporarily formed in the wetted soil layer after brackish water irrigation for example in this study the region with reduced salinity occurs in the top 40 cm fig 6 the salts are pushed out of the wetted soil and accumulate around the wetting front zhang et al 2019 however accumulated salts can still move back into the crop root zone due to crop transpiration and soil evaporation groenveld et al 2013 in this study the soil salt concentration in the root zone gradually increased with time when no freshwater irrigation was used for example the average salt concentration on das 41 das 66 das 89 was 4 8 7 4 and 9 6 ds m 1 in the fan shaped region with a radius of about 40 cm respectively fig 6s u w as a result salinity stress inevitably appeared under brackish water drip irrigation it is necessary to leach the salts out of the crop root zone with freshwater in order to keep salinity below the threshold salinity level and not to restrict crop growth zhang et al 2019 usually soil salts are leached out of the crop root zone by percolation in this study 55 mm of water with 19 3 39 1 mg cm 2 of salts were leached below the 40 cm depth by irrigation of 112 5 mm of freshwater with a salinity of 0 76 d s 1 fig 5 in areas with shallow groundwater saline groundwater can move into the soil due to the capillary action and the salts then remain in the root zone the risk of secondary salinization is practically unavoidable when there is no human intervention satchithanantham et al 2014 it was found in this study that when brackish water was the only source for irrigation t0 8 6 t ha 2 of salts migrated from groundwater into the soil during the crop growth period 65 of total soil salts forkutsa et al 2009 found that salinization was inevitable in shallow groundwater areas unless underground drainage conditions were improved shallow groundwater areas with high salinity can thus easily produce physiological drought xu et al 2019 leaching using freshwater irrigation is then needed to move soil salts out of the root zone for example in our study freshwater irrigation leached 12 4 13 1 and 15 7 t ha 2 of salts out of the root zone on das 41 66 and 89 respectively 4 2 effects of the timing of leaching on soil salinity in a field irrigated with brackish water usually leaching using freshwater is carried out only at the end of the growing season or at the beginning of the next growing season peng et al 2016 however in such a case salts can accumulate in the root zone during the growing season so that crop growth may still be under salinity stress in the later growth stages minhas and gupta 1993a 1993b therefore alternative irrigation with salt and freshwater is often applied to control soil salinity during the season chauhan et al 2007 xu et al 2014 although more freshwater is then needed leaching using irrigation with fresh water during critical growth periods can not only decrease soil salinity but may also reduce the amount of required water for irrigation bradford and letey 1992 alternate irrigation has thus become an important technology used in conjunction with brackish water irrigation minhas et al 2007 we define the desalination rate as dr ec e t 1 ec e t 2 ec e t 1 100 where t 1 and t 2 are times before and after leaching respectively since salts accumulate in the soil with time earlier leaching using freshwater irrigation leads to a lower desalination rate and higher corn yield due to low salt accumulation in comparison later leaching is accompanied by more prolonged salt stress on crop growth after the elongation stage naresh et al 1993a 1993b for example in this study the desalination rate for the 0 40 cm soil horizon was 66 76 and 77 fig 7 while the number of days with high salt stress hss was 56 69 and 70 when leaching was applied during the corn elongation t1 tasseling t2 and grain filling t3 stages respectively fig 4 however the highest corn yield and wue of 11 063 kg ha 1 and 22 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 an average for two years respectively were found for t1 which represented an increase of 9 8 17 5 18 5 and 6 7 12 1 1 4 compared with t2 t3 and t0 respectively hence the optimal leaching time is crucial for improving the desalination rate and corn yield and for reducing the duration of salt stress the statistical tests showed that there was a high consistency between measured and simulated values for various treatments during both calibration and validation periods that meets the requirements of soil water and salinity simulations r 2 0 88 hence numerical simulations were carried out for scenarios with leaching at 6 19 31 36 39 41 43 48 55 66 79 89 98 and 125 days after sowing das while keeping all other conditions the same as above the results showed that the average ec e was not significantly affected by the timing of leaching except when no leaching was applied the average ec e for all leaching treatments in the 0 40 cm soil layer was 6 2 ds m 1 which was significantly lower than in the t0 scenario with the average ec e of 7 8 ds m 1 the corresponding values for the 0 100 cm soil layer were 5 5 ds m 1 leaching treatments and 6 9 ds m 1 t0 fig 7a c based on the t1 t2 and t3 scenarios it was found that earlier leaching resulted in a shorter duration of hss simulations discussed in this section showed that the shortest duration of hss was obtained when leaching was applied on das 41 fig 4 when leaching was applied either before or after 41 das the duration of hss always increased the duration of hss for leaching at das 41 decreased by 32 and 50 in the 0 40 cm and 0 100 cm soil layers respectively compared with no leaching t0 fig 7a c later leaching always resulted in higher desalination rates and higher cumulative salt fluxes at both depths of 40 and 100 cm when leaching was applied after das 41 the desalination rate increased but the growth would be reduced after das 66 fig 7b d the optimal irrigation time for leaching is thus between das 41 66 when considering both the duration of hss and the desalination rate 5 conclusions the soil salt dynamics in experimental plots drip irrigated with brackish water and lfsi in the corn elongation t1 tasseling t2 or grain filling t3 stages or not leached t0 was evaluated both experimentally and numerically with hydrus 2d 3d the model was successfully calibrated and validated using observed soil salt concentrations from 2017 and 2018 respectively the accuracy for the validation period meets standard requirements with rmse mae mre and r 2 of 0 02 0 13 mg cm 3 0 0465 0 0801 mg cm 3 8 7 11 1 and 0 88 0 92 respectively the electrical conductivity of a saturated extract ec e in the soil dramatically decreased after lfsi in both shallow 0 40 cm and deep 40 100 cm soil layers the earlier lfsi was applied the shorter duration of high salt stress ec e higher than 5 9 ds m 1 hss the duration of hss was 42 56 57 and 82 days in the t1 t2 t3 and t0 scenarios respectively however the later lfsi is applied the more salts are leached from the root zone the desalinization rate was 297 410 and 431 for t1 t2 and t3 respectively while significantly more salts could be leached below the 100 cm depth when lfsi was applied later the differences in salt leaching below the 40 cm depth were much smaller cumulative salt fluxes at the 40 cm depth for t1 t2 and t3 increased by 36 7 66 7 and 80 compared to that for t0 the two dimensional ec e distributions showed that the salt stress area in the soil profile after lfsi in the t0 scenario was 4 48 and 92 higher than in the t1 t2 and t3 scenarios respectively in the t0 scenario the soil salts from the shallow soil layer were only transported to deeper soil zone the hss area in the soil profile completely disappeared after lfsi additionally later leaching was preceded by more salts being accumulated in the soil profile before leaching although later leaching improved the desalination rate the duration of the salt stress was longer the optimal time for lfsi determined based on scenario simulations with hydrus 2d 3d was about 41 days after sowing declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10352,field scale experiments are seldom replicated due to size constraints and limitations of other resources this presents a difficulty in performing statistical analysis and interpretation of the results collected in this paper we will evaluate water and nutrient effluent data from two fields one managed under controlled subsurface drainage cssd compared with an adjacent field under conventional free subsurface drainage fssd the purpose of this paper is to compare approaches for statistical analysis of unreplicated paired design drainage experiments the methods tested include the paired watershed design a before after control impact paired bacip design time series and analysis using a beta and a gamma distribution the assumptions used in the paired watershed and bacip designs require the data to follow a normal distribution with identically and independently distributed errors while the beta and gamma distributions do not require the assumption of normality analysis of the data set using a normal distribution was found to be inappropriate due to the nature of the data set which violates the assumptions required for analysis of variance whereas the analysis of the data using a beta distribution was found to produce the most appropriate results the time series approach mimicked the physical treatments applied to fssd and cssd fields and led to a significant effect of cssd compared to fssd future work should focus on confirming that the beta distribution or time series are the best approaches for statistical analysis of field scale unreplicated paired design drainage experiments keywords drainage statistics unreplicated experiment paired design time series beta distribution 1 introduction water table management by artificial drainage is a required practice to increase crop productivity in southwest minnesota as well as in several other regions around the globe shallow water tables can limit root development and oxygen supply to roots which in turn limits above ground growth and decreases yield one option to lower the water table is to adopt a practice called free subsurface drainage fssd free drainage consists of plastic corrugated drainage installed at variable depths e g 0 6 1 2 m within a field with an open unrestricted outlet which allows for excess water to freely move out of the field quickly by directing its flow into ditches or streams although this practice has important positive economic aspects it also has potential for negative environmental consequences for example the potential for leaching of nutrients no3 and h2po4 and pesticides can significantly increase in fields that have adopted fssd lalonde et al 1996 the use of controlled subsurface drainage cssd has been suggested to minimize the potential for nutrient and pesticides leaching from agricultural drained fields controlled drainage allows for the opportunity to manage the subsurface drainage system according to seasonal needs strock et al 2010 controlled drainage involves the use of variable height weir boards in a water level control structure to manage the outlet elevation of a drainage system water control structures when installed in a ditch main sub main or lateral drainage line allow the manager to set the drainage outlet at any level between the ground surface undrained condition and the drain depth free drainage the water table must rise above the elevation setting of the weirs in the structure before drainage can occur controlled drainage has been shown to minimize no3 losses from 46 to as much as 95 when compared with fssd lalonde et al 1996 dinnes et al 2002 this method has gained popularity and its adoption is increasing in southwest minnesota because of the potential positive impact that cssd might have on water quality personal communications however approaches for statistical analysis of this type of experiment is lacking in the literature the majority of the research reported in the literature that has compared cssd with fssd has utilized small plots usually 0 2 ha plot 1 which are replicated kalita and kanwar 1993 drury et al 1996 lalonde et al 1996 fisher et al 1999 although the use of plot scale experiments is important for understanding the processes underlying the principle of cssd the extrapolation of plot scale experiments to entire fields or to a watershed scale might not be realistic furthermore taking a plot scale experiment to a whole field or watershed scale experiment has significant limitations for example the amount of funds required for implementation of the system will limit the number of controlled structures that can be implemented in each field or the landscape slope might also limit the numbers of structures to be installed in each field and randomization replication of experimental units and treatment assignment to experimental units is also affected by the combination of the previous two reasons the biggest limitation from a research perspective is that field or watershed experiments conducted to compare nutrient losses between fssd and cssd in the majority of the cases might not be replicated replication should be thought of as the number of experimental units receiving each of the treatments applied and not the number of samples collected from each experimental unit field scale experiments comparing fssd and cssd usually have two experimental units each receiving one of the two treatments hurlbert 1984 has indicated that statistical analysis on data sets coming from unreplicated studies can and will in the majority of the studies lead to pseudoreplication the author has defined pseudoreplication as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated or replicates are not statistically independent however other authors have argued that by assuring that three essential assumptions for statistical analysis are not violated randomization replication and independence of errors statistical analysis of unreplicated experiments can proceed stewart oaten et al 1986 1992 and few methods have been reported in the literature stewart oaten et al 1986 1992 smith et al 1993 smith 2006 clausen et al 1996 the use of before and after control impact pairs bacip some refer to this approach also as baci when the sites are not paired methodology has been used for statistical analysis of data generated by unreplicated experiments stewart oaten et al 1986 1992 smith et al 1993 smith 2006 the bacip method is most commonly utilized to quantify the magnitude of the change or the difference between the site managed as a control no changes and a site in which management has changed treatment in other words monitoring both sites at the same time repeatedly for a predetermined period of time allows the researcher to determine the relationship between the two sites measurements continue to be collected in both sites after the change in management happens and the difference in the relationship before and after the change indicates the magnitude of the effect however this method requires that repeated measurements over time be collected before and after the change in management so it satisfies the replication requirement randomization in certain cases cannot be achieved for example in instances where there are only two experimental units available and one must be the control site and the other must be the treatment site due to site characteristics the problem with the lack of independent errors i e correlated errors can be corrected by properly modeling the correlation structures of error terms prior to data analysis and interpretation in fact modeling of error terms in today s statistical analysis should be a priority and a procedure adopted by any researcher who uses statistical analysis for inference in treatment effects of field studies the studies reported by stewart oaten et al 1986 1992 smith et al 1993 and smith 2006 are mostly focused on the effects of power plants on water ecology clausen et al 1996 has taken an agricultural approach to the bacip design and named it paired watershed in clausen et al 1996 for example water runoff is measured in two watersheds before a change in management takes place this period is termed the calibration period regression analysis is used to establish a relationship between the two experimental units water runoff measurements continue to be collected after the change in management in one watershed takes place while the other watershed remains managed as before and the new relationship between the two watersheds is determined this period is called the treatment period by comparing the slopes of the relationship between the calibration and treatment periods the authors can identify if there was a change in water runoff due to the change in management the same approach can be used to assess the effect of management changes in other parameters of interest for example the amount of a contaminant or nutrient in the water exported from agricultural fields experiments that are performed to compare cssd and fssd present additional difficulties for example consider an experiment initiated to evaluate annual cumulative total n leached between two drainage systems within a given year specifically the problem of non replication arises as the researchers attempt to compare two single annual values one from each experimental unit without a proper error term associated with each value this problem is alleviated as the researcher collects information over the course of several years and can then estimate the variability and therefore a valid error term of each experimental unit and start drawing conclusions about the amount of nutrient losses between the two drainage systems however the number of years required for a meaningful or valid statistical comparison cannot be predicted and might be beyond the timeline that the research would have supporting funds another issue that arises from cssd experiments is that zones under cssd may result in no drainage effluent the end result of which is effectively no no3 loss or zeros for data collected for some portion of a particular season while in the fssd zone data may be continuously collected as water is free to flow on a daily basis the literature reports some work on the theory behind bacip experiments stewart oaten et al 1986 stewart oaten 1992 with a small number of reports that actually used case studies as examples of how the methods work smith et al 1993 clausen et al 1996 perrett and higgins 2006 the intent of this paper is to illustrate and compare some of the statistical techniques that have been used to evaluate experiments that are not replicated or may have unique conditions or situations that make some methods inappropriate or that the data types create a statistical analysis problem i e the zero s one possible approach to assessing a paired watershed experiment is through the techniques of time series statistics data collected from each cssd and fssd field over time is considered a series and within each series a model will be built models for times series encompass autoregressive ar or moving average ma types a combination of both models gives an autoregressive moving average version arma cowpertwait and metcalfe 2009 meek et al 2000 for a non stationary dataset an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model may be called upon to simulate the time series non stationary data refers to a dataset whose statistics such as average standard deviation or and autocorrelation show increasing or decreasing trends cryer and chan 2008 in addition to the models previously discussed time series can be assessed with changepoint detection technique to find a time when the data statistics for example the mean or variance shifts significantly a changepoint is a period date over which the entire series can be split in two and where the change in means is significantly different an equivalent method is also called homogeneity test for time series whitcher et al 2002 ribeiro et al 2016 furthermore other techniques for processing time series such as structural change allows for the identification of more than one changepoints in the data zeilis et al 2002 2010 this flexibility in identifying multiple significant points within the series called breakpoints helps to better approximate the field physical changes during the time when the experiment is being conducted the structural change technique requires for its application a set of data free of auto correlation thus the time series models presented previously becomes a necessary step the selection of the appropriate statistical tool for data analysis of cssd experiments is challenging due to the nature of the data collected the lack of standards for analysis of such data sets creates further complications when trying to publish such studies in peer reviewed journals as different reviewers will have different opinions on how to best analyze the data and in some cases no consensus can be achieved this paper attempts to create a resource where researchers studying controlled drainage or unreplicated watershed studies can go to for options on how to statistically analyze their dataset a real dataset from an experiment conducted for four years at one location is used for the illustration of the statistical methods under consideration the technical mathematical and mechanical aspects of the methods discussed here have been published elsewhere and citations are provided when each method is introduced therefore for reasons of space and simplicity the mathematical discussions will be omitted after reading the manuscript the reader should have adequate information to help deciding whether the procedures described in this manuscript could be used in their current research or not 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study site drainage structures were installed at a farmer s field located in southwest minnesota in 2006 for this paper four years of data were collected starting in 2006 and ending in 2009 the drainage system was designed and installed to accommodate field subdivision into east 14 2 ha and west 22 3 ha management zones randomly the east zone was assigned to the fssd system and the west zone was assigned to the cssd system the first two years 2006 2007 covers the calibration period during which the two fields are managed under the same conditions so that an initial relationship can be established between the two fields both under fssd in 2006 and under cssd in 2007 years 2008 and 2009 encompass the treatment period for which the two fields are treated differently with one remaining in fssd and the other undergoing the treatment cssd data loggers were utilized to collect stage height information and isco samplers were installed to collected water samples in two water level control structures used to manage the drainage system outlet elevation the data loggers were programmed to take water height measurements every 15 min 24 h a day 7 days a week from the start of snow melt variable within each year to the time of the year when the ground was frozen and no measurements could be collected due to freezing conditions automated samplers were set up to collect water samples after 37 8 m3 of water flow had been registered water samples were used for the determination of total suspended solids and total nutrient leaching for phosphorus p and nitrogen n however in this manuscript only the data for total n will be presented 2 2 defining the nature of the dataset for statistical analysis data loggers and sensors in cssd experiments monitor the water volume that flows through the system at predetermined time intervals for example during times of the season when flow is minimal the sampling period can be set to every 15 min on the other hand when large storm events occur and a large amount of water is expected to flow through the system then the sampling period can be as little as every minute or even more frequently therefore the dataset to be used for statistical analysis can take on several forms depending on what the hypothesis for the study is and the nature of statistical methods utilized to analyze the dataset for this manuscript the data loggers were set to collect information every 15 min and the daily sum total n load was calculated as the sum of total n load at each of the 96 15 min intervals 24 h 1440 min 96 intervals of 15 min five selected approaches for statistical analysis of this dataset either use the daily sum total n flow or a new value derived from the daily sum total n load and its derivation is explained within each section for each approach the selected approaches include the paired watershed design bacip time series modeling analysis using a beta distribution and analysis using a gamma distribution each of the five approaches is described below 2 3 approaches for statistical analysis of daily measurements 2 3 1 paired watershed design approach this method consists of determining the linear relationship between the parameters of interest from the two experimental units during a calibration period and also after the treatments have been implemented clausen et al 1996 for example the daily sum total n load in the cssd zone can be expressed as a linear function of the daily sum total n load in the fssd zone in some cases the relationship is not linear however it can become linear after transformation the regression parameter of interest from that relationship is slope the slope estimated for the linear regression between the two zones during the calibration period is then compared with the slope estimated in the treatment period clausen et al 1996 a significant change in the slope indicates that the treatment did have a significant effect on the parameter of interest all statistical analysis for this approach was performed using the open source statistical software r r 2007 2 3 2 before after control impact paired approach bacip in this approach the zone under fssd and the zone under cssd are paired and samples are collected at both locations simultaneously stewart oaten et al 1986 suggested that if the assumptions of additivity and independence are met then the dataset can be evaluated by a parametric t test or a non parametric mann whitney u test however if the assumptions are violated the tests are both invalid the authors also suggested that the meaning of the assumptions should be evaluated more frequently using datasets collected from field experiments to ensure the implications of assumption violation could be determined the dataset collected for the cssd experiment presents an opportunity for testing the consequences of violating the assumptions and also to investigate if this approach is a better approach for statistical analysis of this type of dataset than the other four approaches all statistical analysis for this approach was performed using the open source statistical software r r development core team 2007 the first step is to define the nature of the dataset to be used for the bacip it has been recommended to calculate the average daily difference between daily sum total n load in the two locations before the treatment period and after the treatment period for each year individually x ijkl x i jkl stewart oaten et al 1986 that is the average of the differences between x 1 1 l daily sum total n load for the fssd zone averaged over all j th days during the calibration period during the l th year x 2 1 l daily sum total n load at the cssd zone averaged over all j th days during the before treatment period during the l th year the dataset should be checked against additivity and independence of error this dataset was evaluated for correlation of errors by the durbin watson test and the results showed the assumption of independence was met although the raw data did show weak serial correlations for each year the difference x ijkl x i jkl which is the data used in the statistical analysis did not inherit the correlation from the raw data stewart oaten et al 1986 suggested it is possible that differences between two observations which are correlated in time might not be correlated at all the results of the durbin watson test for this dataset corroborates with stewart oaten et al 1986 all statistical analysis for this approach was performed using the open source statistical software r r development core team 2007 2 3 3 analysis using a beta distribution the beta distribution has been used in several disciplines ranging from strategic planning engineering marketing and weather forecasting moitra 1990 the wide range of its application shows that this distribution is extremely versatile especially when the variable being modeled is a ratio ranging between 0 x ijkl 1 therefore to use a beta distribution for analysis of cssd systems the dataset must be converted into a ratio or fraction for the daily sum total n load dataset the best approach is to calculate the cumulative daily sum ratio for the total n load for each year however one must be cautious as values greater than 1 will be omitted from the analysis thus let x ijkl be the daily sum total n load mean at the i th location fssd or cssd in the j th day of the k th treatment before or after treatment implementation for the l th year then the x ij kl is the cumulative total n load from day j to day j and is estimated as x i j k l j j x i k l the cumulative daily sum ratio is then computed as x 2 j k l x 1 j k l x 2 j k l x 1 j k l x 2 j k l x 1 j k l where 2 represents the cssd zone and 1 represents the fssd zone the cssd zone was chosen as the numerator because it was expected to have the higher daily sum total n load between the two systems as reported in fig 1a and b analysis of variance using the beta distribution was performed in sas 9 2 sas institute 2010 using the following code proc glimmix data beta nobound class year vargrp day model ratio year dist beta link logit ddfm kr random day type cs random residual group vargrp lsmeans year ilink diff lines lsmeans year ilink diff lines adjusted bon lsmeans year ilink diff lines adjusted tukey run briefly year is a vector with the number of years in the study dist beta indicates that a beta distribution should be used instead of a normal distribution day is a vector which contains the day of each measurement at each year and is used to calculate the autocorrelation between measurements with random day type cs indicating that the autocorrelation has a compound symmetry form lastly vargrp is a parameter indicating that different years have different variances represented by random residual group vargrp a compound symmetry variance structure was used because it was the one that resulted in the best fit according to the aic criteria for more details on the code the reader is referred to the sas manuals the cumulative ratios associated standard errors and a summary of the multiple comparison tests among all years are reported in table 2 the multiple comparison tests were performed using the fisher lsd the adjustments proposed by tukey kramer and bonferroni results are presented in the discussion section 2 3 4 analysis using a gamma distribution the gamma distribution has been used for statistical analysis of datasets that contain zeros as well as experiments in population abundance epidemiology and climate simulations dennis and patil 1984 wilks 1990 watterson and dix 2003 in contrast to the beta distribution the gamma distribution can handle any dataset where x ijkl 0 therefore the difference x ijkl x i jkl between the daily sum total n load in the cssd and fssd cannot be used as the data set for statistical analysis using the gamma distribution the best option is to use the cumulative daily sum ratio as was suggested in the beta distribution section the advantage of using a gamma distribution over the beta distribution is that the gamma distribution also accepts values greater than 1 therefore no data is omitted during the analysis analysis of variance using the beta distribution was performed in sas 9 2 using the following code proc glimmix data gamma class year model ratio year dist gamma link logit ddfm kr lsmeans year ilink lines lsmeans year ilink lines adjust bon lsmeans year ilink lines adjust tukey run dist gamma indicates that the gamma distribution be used this code has some differences compared with the previous code as it omits the statements random and random residual this is because calculations for autocorrelation and the use of heterogeneous variances among years did not improve the model and the simplest model was fit the cumulative ratios associated standard errors and a summary of the multiple comparison tests among all years are reported in table 2 the multiple comparison tests were performed using the fisher lsd the adjustments proposed by tukey kramer and bonferroni results are shown in the discussion section 2 3 5 analysis using time series approach the focus of this analysis was two fold 1 find the appropriate time series model for the daily nitrate load data over the 4 year period for each field and 2 find the most appropriate segmentation of the monitoring period that corresponds to the physical manipulation of the drainage boards at the control structure of each field a function called strucchange in r stats stands out among the time series tools to represent statistically the field manipulation of the boards at the drainage outlets specifically this function requires uncorrelated time series data thus the first step is to identify a time series model which removes the correlation good starting models are autoregressive moving average arma or autoregressive integrated moving average arima for each set of data the use of such models produces uncorrelated data by checking the model stability and invertibility five steps are needed for this part of the analysis 1 fit arma arima time series models to original data and obtain uncorrelated time series data 2 apply strucchange function on modeled data 3 by applying strucchange function on each data set two statistics bayesian information criterion bic and residuals sum of squares rss are obtained to decide on which number of breakpoints values correspond to the physical manipulation of control boards in the field breakpoint values are associated with actual dates from each data set the model with the lowest bic is generally the best fit for a dataset 4 extract p values for each breakpoint segments fstats and sctest functions 5 test the means of adjacent data segments from each field separated by breakpoints from step 4 with variance test and student t test from each field there are three data segments 1 before the first breakpoint 2 between the first and second breakpoints and 3 after the second breakpoint the two data segments before the second breakpoint belong to the calibration period drainage boards at each field were changed twice while the remaining data segment covers the treatment period the function strucchange is based on a couple of methods that can capture instabilities in parametric models f statistics andrews 1993 andrews and ploberger 1994 and generalized fluctuations test kuan and hornik 1995 f statistics test against a breakpoint of undetermined timing in that regard the ordinary least square ols residuals from segmented regression are compared to the residuals of unsegmented model the set of techniques for generalized fluctuations test captures departure from constancy in a graphic way departures from constancy appear in either residuals or parameter estimates for the dating of breakpoints the minimum residual sum of square rss for each segment model corresponding to each breakpoint is first calculated the correct breakpoints minimize an objective function formulated with rss over all model partitions 3 results 3 1 paired watershed approach the daily sum total n load dataset shows a strong linear relationship between the cssd and fssd zones while they were being managed similarly in the 2 year calibration period fig 1a and b in 2006 fig 1a both were managed as fssd and in 2007 fig 1b both were managed as cssd this result shows that the method proposed by clausen et al 1996 would be a useful statistical approach to analyze this experiment however the cssd system presents another challenge for statistical analysis that has not been presented and discussed in the literature although the two sites are strongly related during the 2 year calibration period fig 1a and b when the treatment period begins this relationship becomes non existent fig 2a and b this happens because in the experimental unit assigned to the fssd treatment nitrogen load will take place at any time when there is water flowing out of the system however for the experimental unit assigned to the cssd treatment there will be flow taking place only at specific times during the season when the researcher sees a reason to allow drainage to take place drainage in the cssd treatment will also take place when the system is saturated and water is free to move above the elevation of the weir boards in the control structure which is used to manage water flow the relationship between the two experimental units needed for the use of the clausen et al 1996 method is not present when one structure is freely flowing and the other is not due to the water being held in place therefore the method of clausen et al 1996 can no longer be used as described by the authors and other methods are required for proper statistical inference on the effects of cssd on total loads of nutrient sediment pesticides or any other parameter being monitored 3 2 bacip approach table 1 represents the average daily difference at each site for each year and also summarizes the t test and u test of the differences between all years used in the study from 2006 to 2009 both the t test and u test show that the differences in total n load in 2006 and 2007 are not statistically significant table 1 however there are significant differences for all other comparisons in total n load among 2006 2008 and 2009 as well as among 2007 2008 and 2009 furthermore the use of the t test and u test led to the same conclusions in addition table 1 also shows the estimate of the variances s 2 for the differences in each year variance tests were used to compare the s 2 among the years and the t tests were corrected to account for the years when the s 2 were statistically different table 1 the results using either the corrected t test welch t test or the standard t test shows very similar results table 1 which would not change the significance of the test being performed and either would lead to the same conclusion for this dataset however very different results could be observed between the welch t test and the standard t test if a different dataset was used assuming that the effects of location and time on the mean are additive when in fact they are non additive can also invalidate the t and u tests the intent of this paper is not to discuss how non additivity could be introduced into a dataset neither how to fix it but rather what the effects of non additivity is on the statistical tests fig 3 shows a plot of the differences as a function of the average daily total n load if the regression equation has a slope 0 then the effects can be assumed to be additive however when the slope is 0 then the effects are non additive there is clear evidence that the effects of location and time are non additive as the regression lines have significant slopes in such cases transformation of the dataset is recommended to achieve additivity which is required for the statistical analysis as described by stewart oaten et al 1986 to be valid however due to the nature of the dataset the high frequency of values equal to zero there was no transformation that resulted in additivity this suggests that the results reported in table 1 are invalid and a different procedure should be used for statistical analysis 3 3 beta distribution the use of the beta distribution exhibited results that also disagreed with the bacip method but agreed at least for the calibration period with those found by the paired watershed design the mean cumulative ratio between cssd and fssd was 0 4014 in 2006 which was significantly lower than that for 2007 0 6172 table 2 the increase in the ratio in 2007 compared with 2006 indicated that the daily sum total n load from the cssd zone was closer to the daily sum total n load from the fssd zone this result agrees with that observed by the paired watershed design in 2008 when the two locations were treated differently the cumulative ratio 0 4166 was similar to that observed in 2006 0 4014 in contrast the bacip method found that the difference in 2008 was significantly lower than that observed in 2006 table 1 suggesting that the total n load from the cssd zone was lower than that in the fssd zone for the year 2009 there was an increase in the cumulative ratio which was greater than that of 2006 and 2008 but similar to that of 2007 the results observed with the bacip method disagree with those found by the cumulative ratio again the bacip method showed that in 2009 the difference between the two treatments was the smallest compared with the other three years suggesting that in 2009 the same amount of total n leached out of both sites 3 4 gamma distribution the results observed with the gamma distribution were very similar to those observed with the beta distribution with the exception for the cumulative ratio in 2009 and slightly different estimates of s 2 table 2 in 2009 the ratios between cssd and fssd zones were 0 6318 and 0 8649 for the beta and gamma distribution respectively the main reason for this difference is that values greater than 1 are excluded from analysis when using the beta distribution there was a period in 2009 when the cssd zone had higher total n loads than the fssd zone which happened soon after the cssd zone was managed to allow the treatment to drain fig 4d grayed area this resulted in ratio values greater than 1 which are excluded using the beta distribution analysis but are used in the analysis when using the gamma distribution at the end of the season the total cumulative n load in the cssd zone was 1 3 kg n ha 1 while in the fssd zone it was 2 4 kg n ha 1 with the ratio of these two values being 0 5417 fig 4d therefore the results obtained with the beta and gamma distributions are more realistic and similar to the results observed in the field compared with the paired watershed and bacip approaches 3 5 time series the main function that can detect the occurrence of breakpoints in a given time series data require a dataset that is free of autocorrelation thus as a first step daily nitrate load values from fssd and cssd fields were fit with time series model fssd followed an arma model with parameters p 6 and q 8 while cssd was fit with an arima model with p 4 d 1 and q 6 after these models are fit to the data from each field the time series sets for the detection of breakpoints are free of autocorrelation next figs 5 and 6 show the two statistics bic and rss associated with all possible breakpoints based just on these two graphs the best choice would be 1 breakpoint since bic reaches its lowest value for this choice in both fields however the choice of the breakpoints is dictated by both statistics and weir board management thus the two breakpoint set was selected m 2 out a range of possible values of m from 0 to 5 the choice for 2 breakpoints assume that the difference in bic values between 1 breakpoint and 2 breakpoints are acceptable fssd 1 6 and cssd 0 3 three data segments are now generated at each dataset and they correspond to two periods calibration 2006 2008 and treatment 2008 2009 and two sub segments of the calibration period with similar field management at both fssd and cssd free drainage in 2006 and controlled drainage in 2007 fig 7 the next step was to compare the means of three data segments from each field with student t test following a variance test at fssd there was no significant difference between the three segments fssd average 1 and fssd average 2 p value 0 426 fssd average 2 and fssd average 3 p value 0 439 the means of cssd average 1 and cssd average 2 were not significantly different p value 0 647 in contrast a significant difference was found between cssd average 2 and cssd average 3 p value 0 018 table 3 the nitrate load values for cssd average 2 and cssd average 3 were 0 0388 and 0 0184 no3 n kg ha respectively difference 52 5 4 discussion the five methods used for statistical analysis of the total n load in the cssd data showed very different results the paired watershed approach showed that during the calibration period 2006 and 2007 both zones were linearly related with the fssd management condition having higher daily sum total n loads than the cssd management condition when the two zones were managed differently 2008 and 2009 one as fssd and the other as cssd the lack of a clear linear relationship between the two zones as a result of 0 values introduced in the cssd treatment prevented the use of this approach to determine what the effect of cssd was in relation to fssd during the treatment period the bacip showed an apparent improvement over the paired watershed approach as it allowed for comparisons between the before and after periods the use of a t test t test with unequal variance welch test or u test did not change the interpretation of the results though there was some difference in the p values for the mean comparisons table 1 when the bacip method was compared with the paired watershed method for 2006 and 2007 an interesting contradiction was observed by comparing the mean difference in total n load between cssd and fssd during 2006 and 2007 bacip found no significant differences in contrast the paired watershed approach suggested that in 2007 there was a significant increase in the slope of the regression equation indicating the amounts of total n leaching from both zones was more similar than in 2006 indirectly this result suggests a decrease in the difference in 2007 compared with 2006 which was not observed by the bacip approach in 2008 the difference in total n load increased compared with 2006 and 2007 suggesting that there was a reduction in the amount of total n leaching from the cssd zone whereas in 2009 there was a reduction in the magnitude of the difference between fssd and cssd which suggests that the amount of total n leaching from the cssd zone increased compared with the fssd zone the reasons for these contrasting results could be a result of the violation of additivity required for the t and u tests to be valid as indicated by stewart oaten et al 1986 using the approaches that did not require assumptions of additivity or normality were found to have advantages over approaches that require these assumptions to be met the results obtained with the beta distribution for 2006 and 2007 agreed with those reported by the paired watershed approach however the advantage of using the beta distribution was that comparisons of the ratio in 2008 and 2009 with all other years were also possible there were two major differences between the beta and gamma distribution 1 beta distribution omitted values greater than 1 and 2 the beta distribution showed that there was a significant correlation in the dataset whereas the gamma distribution failed to find such correlation the major differences between using a beta and a gamma distribution were only observed in 2009 when the cssd zone had higher flow than the fssd zone for part of the season as mentioned previously however if the flow in the cssd zone was lower than that in the fssd zone for all 2009 then the results using either the beta or the gamma distribution would have been very similar as it was observed for the other three years this indicates that the dataset will dictate whether the beta or gamma distribution is the best approach when the ratios between cssd and fssd zones is less than 1 either approach is correct but when there are times of the year when the ratio is greater than 1 then the gamma distribution might be the best approach furthermore there might also be cases though not common when the ratio between cssd and fssd zones is greater than 1 for the whole year and in those cases the gamma distribution would be recommended the time series method differs from the previous four methods presented in this text as it uses mean daily nitrate load instead of a cumulative ratio data as the target statistic for the analysis after analysis it became apparent that the model for fssd field data arma 6 8 revealed the existence of autocorrelation in the data set while that for the cssd field dataset showed there was non stationarity in the dataset arima 4 1 6 such non stationarity required a one step difference data lag 1 data necessary to model the data set appropriately again the 4 year period was divided into 3 segments with two segments covering the calibration period and one segment for the treatment period the two years of the treatment period were lumped together in the time series analysis modeling each data set with time series techniques constrained the method into in a comparison of average daily nitrate load within each data set fssd field daily nitrate load averages were compared between the three segments 2 segments for calibration period and one for the treatment period a similar comparison of daily nitrate load was conducted at the cssd the purpose of the time series method still aims at reaching the overall goal of the paired watershed is there any significant difference between the calibration and the treatment periods at the control field and at the treatment field the results showed that for fssd there was no difference between the calibration and treatment periods for cssd however there was a significant difference with a p value of 0 009 at a 5 level between the second segment 2007 of the calibration period and the treatment period 2008 2009 this result differs from the previous methods as there was a clear difference between the fssd and cssd field during the calibration period where the fssd field has higher daily sum than the cssd field the unique feature with the time series method is the identification of the breakpoints two in this case to delineate the structural change in the data sets the data segments thus identified allowed the use of simple testing methods variance test and student t test to compare means of daily nitrate load over calibration period and treatment period for each field 5 conclusion this paper discussed the use of five methods for statistical analysis of the same dataset which was collected from a field trial that compared daily sum total n load from a fssd zone with a cssd zone in a replicated design although all five methods are valid methods for several datasets in certain circumstances none of the methods may be appropriate for example statistical analysis challenges arise with the presence of days when no water and nutrient flow is taking place in the cssd zone but free flowing water is present in the fssd zone in this paper it was observed that fitting a beta or gamma distribution to cumulative ratio data and subsequently utilizing analysis of variance techniques for interpretation were a better option than the paired watershed or bacip approaches for this dataset furthermore the time series method showed an approach that segmented the dataset into periods of differing treatments each field was checked within itself if the treatment period brought any significant change to the behavior of that field with respect to daily nitrate load the time series method also brought some level of simplification for testing the significant difference by using the most basic test of statistics t test further studies should be conducted to determine if this type of statistical analysis is the most appropriate or if new statistical methodologies need to be developed for statistical analysis of controlled drainage studies declaration of competing interest the

10352,field scale experiments are seldom replicated due to size constraints and limitations of other resources this presents a difficulty in performing statistical analysis and interpretation of the results collected in this paper we will evaluate water and nutrient effluent data from two fields one managed under controlled subsurface drainage cssd compared with an adjacent field under conventional free subsurface drainage fssd the purpose of this paper is to compare approaches for statistical analysis of unreplicated paired design drainage experiments the methods tested include the paired watershed design a before after control impact paired bacip design time series and analysis using a beta and a gamma distribution the assumptions used in the paired watershed and bacip designs require the data to follow a normal distribution with identically and independently distributed errors while the beta and gamma distributions do not require the assumption of normality analysis of the data set using a normal distribution was found to be inappropriate due to the nature of the data set which violates the assumptions required for analysis of variance whereas the analysis of the data using a beta distribution was found to produce the most appropriate results the time series approach mimicked the physical treatments applied to fssd and cssd fields and led to a significant effect of cssd compared to fssd future work should focus on confirming that the beta distribution or time series are the best approaches for statistical analysis of field scale unreplicated paired design drainage experiments keywords drainage statistics unreplicated experiment paired design time series beta distribution 1 introduction water table management by artificial drainage is a required practice to increase crop productivity in southwest minnesota as well as in several other regions around the globe shallow water tables can limit root development and oxygen supply to roots which in turn limits above ground growth and decreases yield one option to lower the water table is to adopt a practice called free subsurface drainage fssd free drainage consists of plastic corrugated drainage installed at variable depths e g 0 6 1 2 m within a field with an open unrestricted outlet which allows for excess water to freely move out of the field quickly by directing its flow into ditches or streams although this practice has important positive economic aspects it also has potential for negative environmental consequences for example the potential for leaching of nutrients no3 and h2po4 and pesticides can significantly increase in fields that have adopted fssd lalonde et al 1996 the use of controlled subsurface drainage cssd has been suggested to minimize the potential for nutrient and pesticides leaching from agricultural drained fields controlled drainage allows for the opportunity to manage the subsurface drainage system according to seasonal needs strock et al 2010 controlled drainage involves the use of variable height weir boards in a water level control structure to manage the outlet elevation of a drainage system water control structures when installed in a ditch main sub main or lateral drainage line allow the manager to set the drainage outlet at any level between the ground surface undrained condition and the drain depth free drainage the water table must rise above the elevation setting of the weirs in the structure before drainage can occur controlled drainage has been shown to minimize no3 losses from 46 to as much as 95 when compared with fssd lalonde et al 1996 dinnes et al 2002 this method has gained popularity and its adoption is increasing in southwest minnesota because of the potential positive impact that cssd might have on water quality personal communications however approaches for statistical analysis of this type of experiment is lacking in the literature the majority of the research reported in the literature that has compared cssd with fssd has utilized small plots usually 0 2 ha plot 1 which are replicated kalita and kanwar 1993 drury et al 1996 lalonde et al 1996 fisher et al 1999 although the use of plot scale experiments is important for understanding the processes underlying the principle of cssd the extrapolation of plot scale experiments to entire fields or to a watershed scale might not be realistic furthermore taking a plot scale experiment to a whole field or watershed scale experiment has significant limitations for example the amount of funds required for implementation of the system will limit the number of controlled structures that can be implemented in each field or the landscape slope might also limit the numbers of structures to be installed in each field and randomization replication of experimental units and treatment assignment to experimental units is also affected by the combination of the previous two reasons the biggest limitation from a research perspective is that field or watershed experiments conducted to compare nutrient losses between fssd and cssd in the majority of the cases might not be replicated replication should be thought of as the number of experimental units receiving each of the treatments applied and not the number of samples collected from each experimental unit field scale experiments comparing fssd and cssd usually have two experimental units each receiving one of the two treatments hurlbert 1984 has indicated that statistical analysis on data sets coming from unreplicated studies can and will in the majority of the studies lead to pseudoreplication the author has defined pseudoreplication as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated or replicates are not statistically independent however other authors have argued that by assuring that three essential assumptions for statistical analysis are not violated randomization replication and independence of errors statistical analysis of unreplicated experiments can proceed stewart oaten et al 1986 1992 and few methods have been reported in the literature stewart oaten et al 1986 1992 smith et al 1993 smith 2006 clausen et al 1996 the use of before and after control impact pairs bacip some refer to this approach also as baci when the sites are not paired methodology has been used for statistical analysis of data generated by unreplicated experiments stewart oaten et al 1986 1992 smith et al 1993 smith 2006 the bacip method is most commonly utilized to quantify the magnitude of the change or the difference between the site managed as a control no changes and a site in which management has changed treatment in other words monitoring both sites at the same time repeatedly for a predetermined period of time allows the researcher to determine the relationship between the two sites measurements continue to be collected in both sites after the change in management happens and the difference in the relationship before and after the change indicates the magnitude of the effect however this method requires that repeated measurements over time be collected before and after the change in management so it satisfies the replication requirement randomization in certain cases cannot be achieved for example in instances where there are only two experimental units available and one must be the control site and the other must be the treatment site due to site characteristics the problem with the lack of independent errors i e correlated errors can be corrected by properly modeling the correlation structures of error terms prior to data analysis and interpretation in fact modeling of error terms in today s statistical analysis should be a priority and a procedure adopted by any researcher who uses statistical analysis for inference in treatment effects of field studies the studies reported by stewart oaten et al 1986 1992 smith et al 1993 and smith 2006 are mostly focused on the effects of power plants on water ecology clausen et al 1996 has taken an agricultural approach to the bacip design and named it paired watershed in clausen et al 1996 for example water runoff is measured in two watersheds before a change in management takes place this period is termed the calibration period regression analysis is used to establish a relationship between the two experimental units water runoff measurements continue to be collected after the change in management in one watershed takes place while the other watershed remains managed as before and the new relationship between the two watersheds is determined this period is called the treatment period by comparing the slopes of the relationship between the calibration and treatment periods the authors can identify if there was a change in water runoff due to the change in management the same approach can be used to assess the effect of management changes in other parameters of interest for example the amount of a contaminant or nutrient in the water exported from agricultural fields experiments that are performed to compare cssd and fssd present additional difficulties for example consider an experiment initiated to evaluate annual cumulative total n leached between two drainage systems within a given year specifically the problem of non replication arises as the researchers attempt to compare two single annual values one from each experimental unit without a proper error term associated with each value this problem is alleviated as the researcher collects information over the course of several years and can then estimate the variability and therefore a valid error term of each experimental unit and start drawing conclusions about the amount of nutrient losses between the two drainage systems however the number of years required for a meaningful or valid statistical comparison cannot be predicted and might be beyond the timeline that the research would have supporting funds another issue that arises from cssd experiments is that zones under cssd may result in no drainage effluent the end result of which is effectively no no3 loss or zeros for data collected for some portion of a particular season while in the fssd zone data may be continuously collected as water is free to flow on a daily basis the literature reports some work on the theory behind bacip experiments stewart oaten et al 1986 stewart oaten 1992 with a small number of reports that actually used case studies as examples of how the methods work smith et al 1993 clausen et al 1996 perrett and higgins 2006 the intent of this paper is to illustrate and compare some of the statistical techniques that have been used to evaluate experiments that are not replicated or may have unique conditions or situations that make some methods inappropriate or that the data types create a statistical analysis problem i e the zero s one possible approach to assessing a paired watershed experiment is through the techniques of time series statistics data collected from each cssd and fssd field over time is considered a series and within each series a model will be built models for times series encompass autoregressive ar or moving average ma types a combination of both models gives an autoregressive moving average version arma cowpertwait and metcalfe 2009 meek et al 2000 for a non stationary dataset an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model may be called upon to simulate the time series non stationary data refers to a dataset whose statistics such as average standard deviation or and autocorrelation show increasing or decreasing trends cryer and chan 2008 in addition to the models previously discussed time series can be assessed with changepoint detection technique to find a time when the data statistics for example the mean or variance shifts significantly a changepoint is a period date over which the entire series can be split in two and where the change in means is significantly different an equivalent method is also called homogeneity test for time series whitcher et al 2002 ribeiro et al 2016 furthermore other techniques for processing time series such as structural change allows for the identification of more than one changepoints in the data zeilis et al 2002 2010 this flexibility in identifying multiple significant points within the series called breakpoints helps to better approximate the field physical changes during the time when the experiment is being conducted the structural change technique requires for its application a set of data free of auto correlation thus the time series models presented previously becomes a necessary step the selection of the appropriate statistical tool for data analysis of cssd experiments is challenging due to the nature of the data collected the lack of standards for analysis of such data sets creates further complications when trying to publish such studies in peer reviewed journals as different reviewers will have different opinions on how to best analyze the data and in some cases no consensus can be achieved this paper attempts to create a resource where researchers studying controlled drainage or unreplicated watershed studies can go to for options on how to statistically analyze their dataset a real dataset from an experiment conducted for four years at one location is used for the illustration of the statistical methods under consideration the technical mathematical and mechanical aspects of the methods discussed here have been published elsewhere and citations are provided when each method is introduced therefore for reasons of space and simplicity the mathematical discussions will be omitted after reading the manuscript the reader should have adequate information to help deciding whether the procedures described in this manuscript could be used in their current research or not 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study site drainage structures were installed at a farmer s field located in southwest minnesota in 2006 for this paper four years of data were collected starting in 2006 and ending in 2009 the drainage system was designed and installed to accommodate field subdivision into east 14 2 ha and west 22 3 ha management zones randomly the east zone was assigned to the fssd system and the west zone was assigned to the cssd system the first two years 2006 2007 covers the calibration period during which the two fields are managed under the same conditions so that an initial relationship can be established between the two fields both under fssd in 2006 and under cssd in 2007 years 2008 and 2009 encompass the treatment period for which the two fields are treated differently with one remaining in fssd and the other undergoing the treatment cssd data loggers were utilized to collect stage height information and isco samplers were installed to collected water samples in two water level control structures used to manage the drainage system outlet elevation the data loggers were programmed to take water height measurements every 15 min 24 h a day 7 days a week from the start of snow melt variable within each year to the time of the year when the ground was frozen and no measurements could be collected due to freezing conditions automated samplers were set up to collect water samples after 37 8 m3 of water flow had been registered water samples were used for the determination of total suspended solids and total nutrient leaching for phosphorus p and nitrogen n however in this manuscript only the data for total n will be presented 2 2 defining the nature of the dataset for statistical analysis data loggers and sensors in cssd experiments monitor the water volume that flows through the system at predetermined time intervals for example during times of the season when flow is minimal the sampling period can be set to every 15 min on the other hand when large storm events occur and a large amount of water is expected to flow through the system then the sampling period can be as little as every minute or even more frequently therefore the dataset to be used for statistical analysis can take on several forms depending on what the hypothesis for the study is and the nature of statistical methods utilized to analyze the dataset for this manuscript the data loggers were set to collect information every 15 min and the daily sum total n load was calculated as the sum of total n load at each of the 96 15 min intervals 24 h 1440 min 96 intervals of 15 min five selected approaches for statistical analysis of this dataset either use the daily sum total n flow or a new value derived from the daily sum total n load and its derivation is explained within each section for each approach the selected approaches include the paired watershed design bacip time series modeling analysis using a beta distribution and analysis using a gamma distribution each of the five approaches is described below 2 3 approaches for statistical analysis of daily measurements 2 3 1 paired watershed design approach this method consists of determining the linear relationship between the parameters of interest from the two experimental units during a calibration period and also after the treatments have been implemented clausen et al 1996 for example the daily sum total n load in the cssd zone can be expressed as a linear function of the daily sum total n load in the fssd zone in some cases the relationship is not linear however it can become linear after transformation the regression parameter of interest from that relationship is slope the slope estimated for the linear regression between the two zones during the calibration period is then compared with the slope estimated in the treatment period clausen et al 1996 a significant change in the slope indicates that the treatment did have a significant effect on the parameter of interest all statistical analysis for this approach was performed using the open source statistical software r r 2007 2 3 2 before after control impact paired approach bacip in this approach the zone under fssd and the zone under cssd are paired and samples are collected at both locations simultaneously stewart oaten et al 1986 suggested that if the assumptions of additivity and independence are met then the dataset can be evaluated by a parametric t test or a non parametric mann whitney u test however if the assumptions are violated the tests are both invalid the authors also suggested that the meaning of the assumptions should be evaluated more frequently using datasets collected from field experiments to ensure the implications of assumption violation could be determined the dataset collected for the cssd experiment presents an opportunity for testing the consequences of violating the assumptions and also to investigate if this approach is a better approach for statistical analysis of this type of dataset than the other four approaches all statistical analysis for this approach was performed using the open source statistical software r r development core team 2007 the first step is to define the nature of the dataset to be used for the bacip it has been recommended to calculate the average daily difference between daily sum total n load in the two locations before the treatment period and after the treatment period for each year individually x ijkl x i jkl stewart oaten et al 1986 that is the average of the differences between x 1 1 l daily sum total n load for the fssd zone averaged over all j th days during the calibration period during the l th year x 2 1 l daily sum total n load at the cssd zone averaged over all j th days during the before treatment period during the l th year the dataset should be checked against additivity and independence of error this dataset was evaluated for correlation of errors by the durbin watson test and the results showed the assumption of independence was met although the raw data did show weak serial correlations for each year the difference x ijkl x i jkl which is the data used in the statistical analysis did not inherit the correlation from the raw data stewart oaten et al 1986 suggested it is possible that differences between two observations which are correlated in time might not be correlated at all the results of the durbin watson test for this dataset corroborates with stewart oaten et al 1986 all statistical analysis for this approach was performed using the open source statistical software r r development core team 2007 2 3 3 analysis using a beta distribution the beta distribution has been used in several disciplines ranging from strategic planning engineering marketing and weather forecasting moitra 1990 the wide range of its application shows that this distribution is extremely versatile especially when the variable being modeled is a ratio ranging between 0 x ijkl 1 therefore to use a beta distribution for analysis of cssd systems the dataset must be converted into a ratio or fraction for the daily sum total n load dataset the best approach is to calculate the cumulative daily sum ratio for the total n load for each year however one must be cautious as values greater than 1 will be omitted from the analysis thus let x ijkl be the daily sum total n load mean at the i th location fssd or cssd in the j th day of the k th treatment before or after treatment implementation for the l th year then the x ij kl is the cumulative total n load from day j to day j and is estimated as x i j k l j j x i k l the cumulative daily sum ratio is then computed as x 2 j k l x 1 j k l x 2 j k l x 1 j k l x 2 j k l x 1 j k l where 2 represents the cssd zone and 1 represents the fssd zone the cssd zone was chosen as the numerator because it was expected to have the higher daily sum total n load between the two systems as reported in fig 1a and b analysis of variance using the beta distribution was performed in sas 9 2 sas institute 2010 using the following code proc glimmix data beta nobound class year vargrp day model ratio year dist beta link logit ddfm kr random day type cs random residual group vargrp lsmeans year ilink diff lines lsmeans year ilink diff lines adjusted bon lsmeans year ilink diff lines adjusted tukey run briefly year is a vector with the number of years in the study dist beta indicates that a beta distribution should be used instead of a normal distribution day is a vector which contains the day of each measurement at each year and is used to calculate the autocorrelation between measurements with random day type cs indicating that the autocorrelation has a compound symmetry form lastly vargrp is a parameter indicating that different years have different variances represented by random residual group vargrp a compound symmetry variance structure was used because it was the one that resulted in the best fit according to the aic criteria for more details on the code the reader is referred to the sas manuals the cumulative ratios associated standard errors and a summary of the multiple comparison tests among all years are reported in table 2 the multiple comparison tests were performed using the fisher lsd the adjustments proposed by tukey kramer and bonferroni results are presented in the discussion section 2 3 4 analysis using a gamma distribution the gamma distribution has been used for statistical analysis of datasets that contain zeros as well as experiments in population abundance epidemiology and climate simulations dennis and patil 1984 wilks 1990 watterson and dix 2003 in contrast to the beta distribution the gamma distribution can handle any dataset where x ijkl 0 therefore the difference x ijkl x i jkl between the daily sum total n load in the cssd and fssd cannot be used as the data set for statistical analysis using the gamma distribution the best option is to use the cumulative daily sum ratio as was suggested in the beta distribution section the advantage of using a gamma distribution over the beta distribution is that the gamma distribution also accepts values greater than 1 therefore no data is omitted during the analysis analysis of variance using the beta distribution was performed in sas 9 2 using the following code proc glimmix data gamma class year model ratio year dist gamma link logit ddfm kr lsmeans year ilink lines lsmeans year ilink lines adjust bon lsmeans year ilink lines adjust tukey run dist gamma indicates that the gamma distribution be used this code has some differences compared with the previous code as it omits the statements random and random residual this is because calculations for autocorrelation and the use of heterogeneous variances among years did not improve the model and the simplest model was fit the cumulative ratios associated standard errors and a summary of the multiple comparison tests among all years are reported in table 2 the multiple comparison tests were performed using the fisher lsd the adjustments proposed by tukey kramer and bonferroni results are shown in the discussion section 2 3 5 analysis using time series approach the focus of this analysis was two fold 1 find the appropriate time series model for the daily nitrate load data over the 4 year period for each field and 2 find the most appropriate segmentation of the monitoring period that corresponds to the physical manipulation of the drainage boards at the control structure of each field a function called strucchange in r stats stands out among the time series tools to represent statistically the field manipulation of the boards at the drainage outlets specifically this function requires uncorrelated time series data thus the first step is to identify a time series model which removes the correlation good starting models are autoregressive moving average arma or autoregressive integrated moving average arima for each set of data the use of such models produces uncorrelated data by checking the model stability and invertibility five steps are needed for this part of the analysis 1 fit arma arima time series models to original data and obtain uncorrelated time series data 2 apply strucchange function on modeled data 3 by applying strucchange function on each data set two statistics bayesian information criterion bic and residuals sum of squares rss are obtained to decide on which number of breakpoints values correspond to the physical manipulation of control boards in the field breakpoint values are associated with actual dates from each data set the model with the lowest bic is generally the best fit for a dataset 4 extract p values for each breakpoint segments fstats and sctest functions 5 test the means of adjacent data segments from each field separated by breakpoints from step 4 with variance test and student t test from each field there are three data segments 1 before the first breakpoint 2 between the first and second breakpoints and 3 after the second breakpoint the two data segments before the second breakpoint belong to the calibration period drainage boards at each field were changed twice while the remaining data segment covers the treatment period the function strucchange is based on a couple of methods that can capture instabilities in parametric models f statistics andrews 1993 andrews and ploberger 1994 and generalized fluctuations test kuan and hornik 1995 f statistics test against a breakpoint of undetermined timing in that regard the ordinary least square ols residuals from segmented regression are compared to the residuals of unsegmented model the set of techniques for generalized fluctuations test captures departure from constancy in a graphic way departures from constancy appear in either residuals or parameter estimates for the dating of breakpoints the minimum residual sum of square rss for each segment model corresponding to each breakpoint is first calculated the correct breakpoints minimize an objective function formulated with rss over all model partitions 3 results 3 1 paired watershed approach the daily sum total n load dataset shows a strong linear relationship between the cssd and fssd zones while they were being managed similarly in the 2 year calibration period fig 1a and b in 2006 fig 1a both were managed as fssd and in 2007 fig 1b both were managed as cssd this result shows that the method proposed by clausen et al 1996 would be a useful statistical approach to analyze this experiment however the cssd system presents another challenge for statistical analysis that has not been presented and discussed in the literature although the two sites are strongly related during the 2 year calibration period fig 1a and b when the treatment period begins this relationship becomes non existent fig 2a and b this happens because in the experimental unit assigned to the fssd treatment nitrogen load will take place at any time when there is water flowing out of the system however for the experimental unit assigned to the cssd treatment there will be flow taking place only at specific times during the season when the researcher sees a reason to allow drainage to take place drainage in the cssd treatment will also take place when the system is saturated and water is free to move above the elevation of the weir boards in the control structure which is used to manage water flow the relationship between the two experimental units needed for the use of the clausen et al 1996 method is not present when one structure is freely flowing and the other is not due to the water being held in place therefore the method of clausen et al 1996 can no longer be used as described by the authors and other methods are required for proper statistical inference on the effects of cssd on total loads of nutrient sediment pesticides or any other parameter being monitored 3 2 bacip approach table 1 represents the average daily difference at each site for each year and also summarizes the t test and u test of the differences between all years used in the study from 2006 to 2009 both the t test and u test show that the differences in total n load in 2006 and 2007 are not statistically significant table 1 however there are significant differences for all other comparisons in total n load among 2006 2008 and 2009 as well as among 2007 2008 and 2009 furthermore the use of the t test and u test led to the same conclusions in addition table 1 also shows the estimate of the variances s 2 for the differences in each year variance tests were used to compare the s 2 among the years and the t tests were corrected to account for the years when the s 2 were statistically different table 1 the results using either the corrected t test welch t test or the standard t test shows very similar results table 1 which would not change the significance of the test being performed and either would lead to the same conclusion for this dataset however very different results could be observed between the welch t test and the standard t test if a different dataset was used assuming that the effects of location and time on the mean are additive when in fact they are non additive can also invalidate the t and u tests the intent of this paper is not to discuss how non additivity could be introduced into a dataset neither how to fix it but rather what the effects of non additivity is on the statistical tests fig 3 shows a plot of the differences as a function of the average daily total n load if the regression equation has a slope 0 then the effects can be assumed to be additive however when the slope is 0 then the effects are non additive there is clear evidence that the effects of location and time are non additive as the regression lines have significant slopes in such cases transformation of the dataset is recommended to achieve additivity which is required for the statistical analysis as described by stewart oaten et al 1986 to be valid however due to the nature of the dataset the high frequency of values equal to zero there was no transformation that resulted in additivity this suggests that the results reported in table 1 are invalid and a different procedure should be used for statistical analysis 3 3 beta distribution the use of the beta distribution exhibited results that also disagreed with the bacip method but agreed at least for the calibration period with those found by the paired watershed design the mean cumulative ratio between cssd and fssd was 0 4014 in 2006 which was significantly lower than that for 2007 0 6172 table 2 the increase in the ratio in 2007 compared with 2006 indicated that the daily sum total n load from the cssd zone was closer to the daily sum total n load from the fssd zone this result agrees with that observed by the paired watershed design in 2008 when the two locations were treated differently the cumulative ratio 0 4166 was similar to that observed in 2006 0 4014 in contrast the bacip method found that the difference in 2008 was significantly lower than that observed in 2006 table 1 suggesting that the total n load from the cssd zone was lower than that in the fssd zone for the year 2009 there was an increase in the cumulative ratio which was greater than that of 2006 and 2008 but similar to that of 2007 the results observed with the bacip method disagree with those found by the cumulative ratio again the bacip method showed that in 2009 the difference between the two treatments was the smallest compared with the other three years suggesting that in 2009 the same amount of total n leached out of both sites 3 4 gamma distribution the results observed with the gamma distribution were very similar to those observed with the beta distribution with the exception for the cumulative ratio in 2009 and slightly different estimates of s 2 table 2 in 2009 the ratios between cssd and fssd zones were 0 6318 and 0 8649 for the beta and gamma distribution respectively the main reason for this difference is that values greater than 1 are excluded from analysis when using the beta distribution there was a period in 2009 when the cssd zone had higher total n loads than the fssd zone which happened soon after the cssd zone was managed to allow the treatment to drain fig 4d grayed area this resulted in ratio values greater than 1 which are excluded using the beta distribution analysis but are used in the analysis when using the gamma distribution at the end of the season the total cumulative n load in the cssd zone was 1 3 kg n ha 1 while in the fssd zone it was 2 4 kg n ha 1 with the ratio of these two values being 0 5417 fig 4d therefore the results obtained with the beta and gamma distributions are more realistic and similar to the results observed in the field compared with the paired watershed and bacip approaches 3 5 time series the main function that can detect the occurrence of breakpoints in a given time series data require a dataset that is free of autocorrelation thus as a first step daily nitrate load values from fssd and cssd fields were fit with time series model fssd followed an arma model with parameters p 6 and q 8 while cssd was fit with an arima model with p 4 d 1 and q 6 after these models are fit to the data from each field the time series sets for the detection of breakpoints are free of autocorrelation next figs 5 and 6 show the two statistics bic and rss associated with all possible breakpoints based just on these two graphs the best choice would be 1 breakpoint since bic reaches its lowest value for this choice in both fields however the choice of the breakpoints is dictated by both statistics and weir board management thus the two breakpoint set was selected m 2 out a range of possible values of m from 0 to 5 the choice for 2 breakpoints assume that the difference in bic values between 1 breakpoint and 2 breakpoints are acceptable fssd 1 6 and cssd 0 3 three data segments are now generated at each dataset and they correspond to two periods calibration 2006 2008 and treatment 2008 2009 and two sub segments of the calibration period with similar field management at both fssd and cssd free drainage in 2006 and controlled drainage in 2007 fig 7 the next step was to compare the means of three data segments from each field with student t test following a variance test at fssd there was no significant difference between the three segments fssd average 1 and fssd average 2 p value 0 426 fssd average 2 and fssd average 3 p value 0 439 the means of cssd average 1 and cssd average 2 were not significantly different p value 0 647 in contrast a significant difference was found between cssd average 2 and cssd average 3 p value 0 018 table 3 the nitrate load values for cssd average 2 and cssd average 3 were 0 0388 and 0 0184 no3 n kg ha respectively difference 52 5 4 discussion the five methods used for statistical analysis of the total n load in the cssd data showed very different results the paired watershed approach showed that during the calibration period 2006 and 2007 both zones were linearly related with the fssd management condition having higher daily sum total n loads than the cssd management condition when the two zones were managed differently 2008 and 2009 one as fssd and the other as cssd the lack of a clear linear relationship between the two zones as a result of 0 values introduced in the cssd treatment prevented the use of this approach to determine what the effect of cssd was in relation to fssd during the treatment period the bacip showed an apparent improvement over the paired watershed approach as it allowed for comparisons between the before and after periods the use of a t test t test with unequal variance welch test or u test did not change the interpretation of the results though there was some difference in the p values for the mean comparisons table 1 when the bacip method was compared with the paired watershed method for 2006 and 2007 an interesting contradiction was observed by comparing the mean difference in total n load between cssd and fssd during 2006 and 2007 bacip found no significant differences in contrast the paired watershed approach suggested that in 2007 there was a significant increase in the slope of the regression equation indicating the amounts of total n leaching from both zones was more similar than in 2006 indirectly this result suggests a decrease in the difference in 2007 compared with 2006 which was not observed by the bacip approach in 2008 the difference in total n load increased compared with 2006 and 2007 suggesting that there was a reduction in the amount of total n leaching from the cssd zone whereas in 2009 there was a reduction in the magnitude of the difference between fssd and cssd which suggests that the amount of total n leaching from the cssd zone increased compared with the fssd zone the reasons for these contrasting results could be a result of the violation of additivity required for the t and u tests to be valid as indicated by stewart oaten et al 1986 using the approaches that did not require assumptions of additivity or normality were found to have advantages over approaches that require these assumptions to be met the results obtained with the beta distribution for 2006 and 2007 agreed with those reported by the paired watershed approach however the advantage of using the beta distribution was that comparisons of the ratio in 2008 and 2009 with all other years were also possible there were two major differences between the beta and gamma distribution 1 beta distribution omitted values greater than 1 and 2 the beta distribution showed that there was a significant correlation in the dataset whereas the gamma distribution failed to find such correlation the major differences between using a beta and a gamma distribution were only observed in 2009 when the cssd zone had higher flow than the fssd zone for part of the season as mentioned previously however if the flow in the cssd zone was lower than that in the fssd zone for all 2009 then the results using either the beta or the gamma distribution would have been very similar as it was observed for the other three years this indicates that the dataset will dictate whether the beta or gamma distribution is the best approach when the ratios between cssd and fssd zones is less than 1 either approach is correct but when there are times of the year when the ratio is greater than 1 then the gamma distribution might be the best approach furthermore there might also be cases though not common when the ratio between cssd and fssd zones is greater than 1 for the whole year and in those cases the gamma distribution would be recommended the time series method differs from the previous four methods presented in this text as it uses mean daily nitrate load instead of a cumulative ratio data as the target statistic for the analysis after analysis it became apparent that the model for fssd field data arma 6 8 revealed the existence of autocorrelation in the data set while that for the cssd field dataset showed there was non stationarity in the dataset arima 4 1 6 such non stationarity required a one step difference data lag 1 data necessary to model the data set appropriately again the 4 year period was divided into 3 segments with two segments covering the calibration period and one segment for the treatment period the two years of the treatment period were lumped together in the time series analysis modeling each data set with time series techniques constrained the method into in a comparison of average daily nitrate load within each data set fssd field daily nitrate load averages were compared between the three segments 2 segments for calibration period and one for the treatment period a similar comparison of daily nitrate load was conducted at the cssd the purpose of the time series method still aims at reaching the overall goal of the paired watershed is there any significant difference between the calibration and the treatment periods at the control field and at the treatment field the results showed that for fssd there was no difference between the calibration and treatment periods for cssd however there was a significant difference with a p value of 0 009 at a 5 level between the second segment 2007 of the calibration period and the treatment period 2008 2009 this result differs from the previous methods as there was a clear difference between the fssd and cssd field during the calibration period where the fssd field has higher daily sum than the cssd field the unique feature with the time series method is the identification of the breakpoints two in this case to delineate the structural change in the data sets the data segments thus identified allowed the use of simple testing methods variance test and student t test to compare means of daily nitrate load over calibration period and treatment period for each field 5 conclusion this paper discussed the use of five methods for statistical analysis of the same dataset which was collected from a field trial that compared daily sum total n load from a fssd zone with a cssd zone in a replicated design although all five methods are valid methods for several datasets in certain circumstances none of the methods may be appropriate for example statistical analysis challenges arise with the presence of days when no water and nutrient flow is taking place in the cssd zone but free flowing water is present in the fssd zone in this paper it was observed that fitting a beta or gamma distribution to cumulative ratio data and subsequently utilizing analysis of variance techniques for interpretation were a better option than the paired watershed or bacip approaches for this dataset furthermore the time series method showed an approach that segmented the dataset into periods of differing treatments each field was checked within itself if the treatment period brought any significant change to the behavior of that field with respect to daily nitrate load the time series method also brought some level of simplification for testing the significant difference by using the most basic test of statistics t test further studies should be conducted to determine if this type of statistical analysis is the most appropriate or if new statistical methodologies need to be developed for statistical analysis of controlled drainage studies declaration of competing interest the

under field conditions the irrigation regimes were w0 non irrigated w2 every furrow irrigated at jointing and anthesis w3 every furrow irrigated before wintering and at jointing and grain filling and afi each of two neighboring furrows irrigated either before wintering or at grain filling and every furrow irrigated at jointing our results show that grain yield above ground nitrogen uptake agn including n from fertilizers and soil and nue were lowest in the w0 treatment and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency grain yield agn including n from fertilizers and soil nue nitrogen uptake efficiency upe 15n recovery efficiency and n accumulation in grains were significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment agn increased due to a higher amount of n derived from both fertilizers and soil more n was derived from soil than from fertilizers thus the proportion of n derived from fertilizers decreased no significant differences in grain yield and nue were observed between the afi and w3 treatments agn decreased when soil n luxury uptake and n accumulation in stems and leaves decreased greater n utilization efficiency and a higher n harvest index were observed in the afi treatment compared with the w3 treatment in addition afi increased nitrate n contents in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm and reduced nitrate n movement to deeper soil compared to the w2 and w3 treatments therefore afi may be an appropriate irrigation method for improving nue and decreasing water consumption in winter wheat without reducing yield keywords alternate furrow irrigation yield nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen harvest index winter wheat 1 introduction limited water availability for agriculture is becoming an acute problem worldwide cornish et al 2004 sandhu et al 2019 zehnder et al 2003 in china water scarce regions are found mainly in the north where major irrigation water resources are used for winter wheat triticum aestivum l sound practices for the efficient use of water and nutrients are urgently needed to ensure high crop yields under water limited conditions alternate furrow irrigation afi an irrigation strategy that employs partial root zone drying and thus increases water use efficiency ahmadi et al 2010 du et al 2013 jia et al 2014 kang and zhang 2004 sandhu et al 2019 sarker et al 2019 2020 sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 allows for a reduction in irrigation water use without compromising crop yields ahmadi et al 2010 casa and rouphael 2014 kang et al 2000 melo abreu et al 1993 ramadan and ragab 2018 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 nitrogen n is essential for maintaining crop physiological and agronomic traits mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 and efficient n uptake is important for improving crop growth and development wang et al 2012 water and nitrogen use efficiencies in crops are closely correlated di paolo and rinaldi 2008 frederick and camberato 1995 pandey et al 2001 wu et al 2008 a water shortage in soil may affect n availability and absorption by plant roots whereas an efficient water supply system improves grain nutrient n phosphorus p and potassium k uptake and crop productivity kumari et al 2017 kresoviÄ et al 2016 showed that despite a 25 reduction in irrigation water supply satisfactory grain yield in maize was maintained by increasing water use efficiency and reducing nutrient losses an excessive irrigation regime can lead to inefficient use of both water and applied n sarker et al 2020 and increase nitrate n leaching into deep soils or groundwater ju et al 2003 liu 2015 lu et al 2019 maeda et al 2003 the n that is taken up by crops comes mainly from two sources soil initial n and applied n fertilizers dai et al 2013 qi et al 2020 n uptake by plants and the fate of applied n from fertilizers depend largely on climatic factors and agricultural management practices kirda et al 2005 numerous studies have investigated the effects of alternate partial root zone irrigation apri on n uptake by the root system apri reportedly boosted leaf n levels by enhancing soil n availability wang et al 2012 reduced n luxury uptake hu et al 2009 and increased total n uptake nitrogen use efficiency nue and n partitioning to reproductive tissues skinner et al 1999 in maize han and kang 2002 li et al 2007 wang 2017 wheat li et al 2005 potato liu et al 2015 and tomato hou et al 2017 apri improved fertilizer n recovery resulting in less mineral n left in the soil compared with full irrigation and deficit irrigation treatments hu et al 2009 kirda et al 2005 li et al 2007 qi et al 2020 indicating that this irrigation strategy can be optimized with an appropriate fertilization scheme and adequate water supply in addition apri can improve the growth and distribution of maize roots and reduce the potential for nitrate leaching compared with conventional irrigation qi et al 2017 qi and hu 2016 skinner et al 1999 similarly afi is an established irrigation technique that can save water without reducing crop yields and it has been demonstrated to promote n uptake and improve nue therefore exploring the mechanisms by which afi enhances crop nue is essential for ensuring high economic returns and environmental protection in this region nevertheless afi can lead to reduced n uptake compared with conventional irrigation decreased fertilizer n uptake has been observed in corn during a dry year under afi when rainfall is rare throughout the growing season benjamin et al 1997 sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 found that nue in winter wheat was lower under afi than under ordinary furrow irrigation the reasons behind the reduced nue with afi may be lower grain yield and n leaching out of the roots zone as a result of abundant rainfall from late fall to early spring about 400 mm many studies have indicated that afi can maintain high wheat grain yield with a reduction in irrigation water and then promote irrigation water productivity and increase water use efficiency batool et al 2019 li et al 2017 soothar et al 2019 tari 2016 studies have shown that the interaction of this irrigation strategy with other strategies including the planting method and optimal n fertilizer rate can result in promoting irrigation water productivity in wheat mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 2019 but few studies have examined the effects of afi on the n uptake of wheat furthermore the mechanism underlying the variation in n uptake and nue in winter wheat under afi remain unclear changes in the components of nue sources of above ground n uptake and the n harvest index nhi with afi have not been documented adequately we previously reported that afi could increase water use efficiency and maintain yields during winter wheat cultivation in a northern chinese field where water resources were scarce jia et al 2014 in the current follow up study we examined how different irrigation strategies including afi and ordinary furrow irrigation w0 w2 and w3 affected nue including n uptake efficiency upe and n utilization efficiency ute n uptake from fertilizers and soil the distribution of n among different organs and soil nitrate n in two seasons under field conditions the mechanisms by which afi enhances nue are also discussed with regard to changes in above ground n uptake agn the nhi and grain n concentration gnc 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil characteristics field experiments on winter wheat were conducted for two consecutive years 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 at shandong agricultural university tai an shandong p r china the coordinates of the study area are 36 09 n and 117 09 e and the area is located at an elevation of 127 m above sea level in a semi humid continental temperate monsoon climate zone on average there are more than 2627 h of sunshine annually and the annual accumulated temperature above 10 c is more than 4213 c the frost free period is 195 days annual precipitation is 697 mm and the seasonal distribution of rainfall is uneven weather parameters were recorded at the study site throughout the crop growing period in 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 and mean values were calculated over the years 2001 2011 fig 1 rainfall distribution differed between the two growing seasons weather conditions were drier in general in the first season 2009 2010 than in the second season 2010 2011 with a total rainfall of 148 5 mm versus 172 2 mm in the second season rainfall was low in autumn and winter but abundant in spring moreover 132 mm of rainfall in may contributed substantially to improved crop yields the soil type was sandy loam with a mean soil bulk density of 1 53 g cm 3 the cultivated layer 0 40 cm had a ph of 6 58 levels of organic matter alkali hydrolyzable n rapidly available p and rapidly available k were 1 92 84 7 mg kg 1 21 12 mg kg 1 and 83 5 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design experiments were run using a complete randomized block design with three replicates per treatment the experimental winter wheat cultivar tainong 18 was sown on october 9 and 10 in 2009 and 2010 respectively at a seeding rate of 270 seeds m 2 four irrigation levels were used w0 no irrigation w2 irrigation at jointing and anthesis w3 conventional irrigation irrigation before wintering and at jointing and grain filling and afi irrigation of one of every two neighboring furrows before wintering and at jointing and the other furrows at jointing and grain filling the four irrigation schedules are shown in table 1 water meters installed at the discharge ends of pipes controlled the irrigation volumes the plots were uniformly irrigated to attain maximum soil moisture capacity at 1 week prior to sowing n p and k were applied as chemical fertilizers at rates of 120 kg ha 1 of n 105 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 150 kg ha 1 of k2o to all plots before planting and n was applied again 120 kg ha 1 at the jointing stage n topdressing of soil at jointing was carried out using a mini side dressing fertilizer applicator sl 4b shenglu machinery factory qufu p r china with an application depth of 10 cm and the field was irrigated immediately thereafter the plots were 20 m long and each contained six rows spaced 0 25 m apart each plot area was 30 m2 20 m 1 5 m and the furrow width was 1 50 m ma et al 2005 reported that at 20 of the average soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer an irrigation quota of 60 mm may lead to 70 cm of water side penetration into neighboring non irrigated plots based on local farming habits and the machinery used in this area the typical plot width is 1 5 m aside from irrigation field management was carried out in the same way for all plots following local agricultural practices 15n labeled urea was added to analyze the sources of agn in both seasons a ferrous thickness 3 mm box 50 cm 20 cm 40 cm without a top or bottom was embedded into the soil to create a micro environment for plant growth in each plot with the longer side of the box oriented perpendicular to the rows and the upper edges located 3 5 cm above the ground 15n labeled urea was the only n fertilizer used in the box and the application procedure and times were the same as those for the field trials all other fertilizers p2o5 and k2o were applied in the same way as in the field seeds numbers based on seeding rate were sowed artificially in two rows parallel to the row direction and final singling was carried out as in the field 2 3 measurement methods 2 3 1 grain yields final grain yields were determined by harvesting all plants in a 4 5 m2 sample area six rows of length 3 m in each plot at maturity sampled plants were dried in the sun to a standard moisture content of 12 to determine grain yields 88 dry matter t ha 1 grain yield in the afi treatment was calculated as the average yield across the alternately irrigated furrows 2 3 2 plant n analysis plant material samples were taken at maturity in both seasons by manually cutting all plants in a quadrat comprising six rows of length 50 cm at ground level plant materials in each sample were mixed and 30 single stems were subsampled and separated into leaves sheaths and stems and ears to calculate n accumulation rates in different organs all organ samples were oven dried at 70 c to constant weight to estimate dry matter accumulation then ears were divided into grains glumes and ear rachis and differences in ear dry matter and grain dry matter were measured oven dried samples were milled and analyzed for n concentration using the semi micro kjeldahl method kjeltec 8200 auto distillation unit foss hillerÃ¸d denmark bremner 1960 yuen and pollard 1953 and n accumulation was calculated by multiplying the element concentration by dry weight all plants in individual micro habitat boxes were sampled at ground level and then separated weighed and milled using the same methods described above isotopic abundance was measured using an isoprime 100 instrument isoprime cheadle uk 2 3 3 calculation of n indicators n indicators were calculated as follows nue grain dry matter yield per unit n available from both soil and fertilizers unitless kg kg 1 agn total n uptake

grains over grain dry matter at harvest 100 2 3 4 measurement of nitrate n content of soil soil samples were taken randomly from three areas in each plot after the winter wheat harvest using an auger inner diameter 4 0 cm to a depth of 200 cm at 20 cm intervals for each depth the three samples collected from each plot were mixed thoroughly to produce one composite sample fresh soil samples were sieved through a 2 mm mesh and 10 g of each sample was extracted by shaking with 50 ml of 1 mol l 1 kcl solution for 1 h after filtration extracts were analyzed immediately to determine n concentrations using a continuous flow analyzer autoanalyzer 3 bran luebbe hamburg germany soil water content was determined after drying at 105 c for 24 h amounts of nitrate n kg n ha 1 in the 0 200 cm soil profile at harvest were calculated according to the equation by emteryd 1989 with some modifications as follows y i t i b d i no 3 i 0 1 where t i is the thickness of the soil layer cm bd i is bulk density g cm 3 calculated to be 1 56 1 57 1 59 1 47 1 48 1 39 1 54 1 64 1 64 and 1 63 g cm 3 for the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 120 120 140 140 160 160 180 and 180 200 cm soil layers respectively no3 i is soil nitrate n concentration mg kg 1 which was calculated as the mean nitrate n concentration across different depths and the conversion coefficient is 0 1 the amount of nitrate n leached was taken to be the nitrate n accumulated in the 80 200 cm soil layer 2 4 statistical analysis all data were assembled and analyzed using microsoft excel 2010 redmond wa usa figures were plotted in sigmaplot 10 0 systat software san jose ca usa the statistical significance of differences among treatment means was determined using the general linear model procedure in sas v 6 12 sas institute cary nc usa all treatment means were compared across columns or rows using the least significant difference method with p 0 05 taken to denote statistical significance data collected in 2010 and 2011 were analyzed separately 3 results 3 1 grain yields and nitrogen use efficiency nue the effects of irrigation and year on grain yields were significant table 2 grain yields ranged from 6 21 to 9 06 t ha 1 88 dry matter across all treatments grain yields were lowest in the w0 treatment 6 21 t ha 1 in 2010 and 6 94 t ha 1 in 2011 and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency grain yields were significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment same irrigation amounts by 8 28 and 9 20 in 2010 and 2011 respectively in addition there was no significant difference in grain yields between the afi and w3 treatments these results indicate that afi can maintain the same high grain yields as conventional irrigation while reducing the amount of irrigation water by 33 the grain yield obtained in 2011 was 13 21 higher than that in 2010 which might have resulted from higher rainfall and irrigation amounts the effects of irrigation and year on nue were significant table 2 nue ranged from 15 98 to 24 30 kg kg 1 across all treatments because the same amount of n was available from soil and fertilizers in all treatments nue was affected similarly percentage wise as grain yield in each corresponding irrigation treatment in both seasons nue was lowest in the w0 treatment 15 98 kg kg 1 in 2010 and 18 62 kg kg 1 in 2011 and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency nue was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment whereas nue did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments for the same cropping periods 3 2 nitrogen uptake efficiency upe the effects of irrigation year and their interaction on upe were significant table 2 upe ranged from 46 50 to 82 50 across all treatments and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency upe was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment with afi improving upe by 8 09 in 2010 and 15 53 in 2011 relative to the w2 treatment however upe decreased by 8 27 in 2010 and 5 84 in 2011 with afi compared to the w3 treatment nue and upe were positively correlated table 4 upe is calculated as agn divided by available n because available n remained the same among the different treatments in this study variations in upe were completely determined by fluctuations in agn which was calculated to be 180 70 307 56 kg ha 1 across all treatments table 4 and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency agn was affected similarly percentage wise as upe in each year in each corresponding irrigation treatment because available n amounts were constant agn was 12 41 higher in 2011 than in 2010 sources of agn included n from fertilizers and soil the increase in agn was essentially due to an increase in n derived from both fertilizers and soil which tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency fig 2 accordingly the increase in n derived from both fertilizers and soil was positively related to agn fig 3 n from fertilizers was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment by 6 74 and 13 77 in 2010 and 2011 respectively n from fertilizers did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments because the same amount of fertilizer n was available the 15n recovery efficiency percentage of 15n taken up over that applied was significantly higher in the afi treatment average 41 1 than in the w2 treatment average 37 2 n from soil was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment by 8 71 and 16 56 in 2010 and 2011 respectively however n from soil was significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 11 34 and 8 23 in 2010 and 2011 respectively the contribution of fertilizer n to total agn tended to decrease with increasing irrigation frequency fig 2 the contribution of fertilizer n to total agn with afi was significantly higher than that in the w3 treatment by 6 60 and 4 77 in 2010 and 2011 respectively whereas the contribution of fertilizer n to total agn did not differ significantly between the afi and w2 treatments 3 3 nitrogen utilization efficiency ute the effects of irrigation and year irrigation on ute were significant table 2 ute was 28 62 34 68 kg kg 1 across all treatments and tended to decrease with increasing irrigation frequency ute was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 7 97 and 4 55 in 2010 and 2011 respectively ute did not differ significantly between the afi and w2 treatments in 2010 but was lower by 6 41 in the afi treatment in 2011 ute was positively related to nhi and negatively related to grain n accumulation table 3 ute decreased according to decreases in nhi which were significantly affected by irrigation time nhi ranged from 71 72 to 82 85 across all treatments and tended to decrease with increasing irrigation frequency table 4 nhi was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 8 23 and 3 76 in 2010 and 2011 respectively but did not differ significantly between the afi and w2 treatments afi maintained a high nhi by improving n transport from vegetative organs to grains compared with the treatment with the same grain yields w3 grain n accumulation was significantly affected by irrigation time ranging from 145 2 to 242 1 kg ha 1 across all treatments and tending to increase with increasing irrigation frequency table 4 grain n accumulation was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment by 7 66 and 15 76 in 2010 and 2011 respectively but did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments 3 4 distribution of n among different vegetative organs at maturity n accumulated and was distributed among different vegetative organs at maturity according to the following order stem spike axis and husk leaf fig 4 the amount of n accumulated and n proportions in wheat leaves spike axes and husks and stems tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency the amount of n accumulated in leaves was significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 38 61 and 29 14 in 2010 and 2011 respectively and that in stems was significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 30 88 and 23 05 in 2010 and 2011 respectively however the amount of n accumulated in spike axes and husks did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments n proportions in leaves were significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 33 08 and 24 73 in 2010 and 2011 respectively and those in stems were significantly lower in the afi treatment by 34 65 and 18 27 in 2010 and 2011 respectively fig 4 however n proportions in spike axes and husks did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments the results show that afi decreased n accumulation and proportions in leaves and stems compared to the w3 treatment thus afi promoted n transport from leaves and stems to grains in winter wheat 3 5 soil nitrate n in the 0 200 cm soil layer at maturity the irrigation schemes adopted in this study significantly affected soil nitrate n contents in the 0 200 cm soil layer at maturity fig 5 with increasing irrigation nitrate n contents tended to decrease in the 0 60 cm soil layer and increase in the 80 140 cm soil layer in the 160 200 cm soil layer no significant differences were observed among treatments in either growing season afi increased nitrate n contents in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm but decreased nitrate n contents in the deeper soil layer 80 140 cm compared to the w2 and w3 treatments fig 5 nitrate n contents in the 0 60 cm soil layer were higher in 2011 than in 2010 this could have been due to the large amount of organic fertilizers applied before wheat sowing in 2010 which might have led to higher soil nitrate n contents at maturity in 2011 compared with the w2 and w3 treatments afi reduced nitrate n leaching by 7 1 and 13 9 respectively in 2010 and by 9 5 and 20 5 respectively in 2011 fig 6 this indicates that afi dramatically decreased nitrate n movement to deeper soil thus maintaining high nitrate n contents in the upper soil layer 4 discussion water deficits lead to reduced wheat yields and increasing the irrigation supply can increase grain yields xue et al 2006 in our study grain yields were lowest in the w0 non irrigated treatment and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency table 2 in agreement with previous reports tari 2016 torrion and stougaard 2017 afi has been shown to be an effective water saving irrigation method kang and zhang 2004 in this study grain yields were higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment even though the same amount of irrigation water was used table 2 similarly increased crop yields with afi have been reported for wheat sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 yang et al 2010 rice cabangon et al 2011 potato sarker et al 2019 cotton tang et al 2005 and maize liang et al 2013 sarker et al 2020 wang et al 2012 furthermore our experimental field results revealed that in the afi treatment irrigation water use was reduced by 33 compared to the w3 treatment but grain yields did not decrease significantly table 2 which is consistent with previous findings belder et al 2004 du et al 2008 howell et al 2015 mishra and salokhe 2010 richards and sander 2014 here we defined nue as grain yield divided by available n therefore changes in nue exhibited the same trends as grain yield due to available n staying the same across different treatments in this study nue can also be expressed as the product of upe and ute we found that nue was positively correlated with upe table 3 indicating that by optimizing the irrigation scheme nue can be improved through increases in upe the dependence of nue on upe has also been reported previously barraclough et al 2010 dai et al 2013 giambalvo et al 2010 muurinen et al 2006 upe was calculated as agn divided by available n because available n remained unchanged among the different treatments variations in upe were completely determined by fluctuations in agn the positive association between agn and upe table 3 indicates that the increase in upe resulted mainly from increases in agn with increased irrigation table 4 in general total agn is derived from n in both recently applied fertilizers and soil ahmadi et al 2010 barraclough et al 2010 in our study n derived from fertilizers and soil increased with increased irrigation frequency and amount fig 2 and n uptake from both sources was positively correlated with agn fig 3 indicating that increasing irrigation improved the capture of n from fertilizers and soil thus increasing agn field studies have shown that root dimensions and distribution influence wheat n uptake from soil asseng et al 1997 barraclough 1986 thorup kristensen et al 2009 excessive drought stress inhibits root growth and the spatial and temporal distribution of roots in soil limiting root n uptake gajri et al 1989 an appropriate amount of irrigation can promote root growth increase root distribution in soil li et al 2010 and enhance water and n uptake qi et al 2012 therefore the increase in agn might have resulted from an increase in root dimensions and distribution as agn increases with increasing irrigation more n comes from the soil meng et al 2011 qi et al 2020 consistent with our findings that n derived from soil increases with increasing irrigation and n derived from soil was much higher than n derived from fertilizers in the wheat plants in all treatments two factors may account for the greater contribution of soil n to agn first the low contribution of n from fertilizers can be attributed to water flow and higher rates of fertilizer n leaching below the rooting zone during irrigation whereas soil n is isolated and held within soil particles kirda et al 2005 second full irrigation or afi which results in the alternate drying and wetting of soil may produce soil moisture conditions that accelerate the mineralization rate of soil organic n wang et al 2010 2012 which then makes more soil n available for use by plants therefore the proportion of n in agn derived from fertilizers tended to decrease with increasing irrigation frequency and amount fig 2 positive associations between root growth and root absorptive capacity and n uptake in wheat have been demonstrated in field studies barraclough 1986 thorup kristensen et al 2009 dai et al 2013 afi may promote root growth burgess et al 1998 du et al 2006 and has been shown to increase root volume and biomass kang et al 2000 yang et al 2010 improve root absorptive capacity ben asher and silberbush 1992 han and kang 2002 kang et al 1998 li et al 2005 mingo et al 2004 shi and kang 2000 and increase n including n from fertilizers and soil uptake and accumulation cabangon et al 2011 wang et al 2009 2010a 2010b 2012 in our study afi increased n including n from fertilizers and soil uptake compared to the w2 treatment even though the same amounts of irrigation water were used table 4 fig 2 this could have been due to the buffering capacity of soil under natural conditions which enables plants to maintain or even increase root growth in dry soil additionally rewatering soil dried roots causes a flush of secondary roots to grow liang et al 1996 the ability of roots to absorb nutrients is improved by alternate drying and rewatering in a horizontal direction or along a vertical soil profile ben asher and silberbush 1992 han and kang 2002 li et al 2005 shi and kang 2000 furthermore soil moisture gradients between the wet and dry root zones allow roots in dry soil to remain viable for extended periods of time kang and zhang 2004 enabling greater access to water and nutrients deeper in the soil yang et al 2009 because available fertilizer n remained constant afi increased 15n recovery efficiency compared to the w2 treatment same irrigation amounts used consistent with findings by hou et al 2017 and wang et al 2017 our data indicate that afi can increase n from fertilizers and soil uptake as well as agn and upe thereby improving nue and grain yields previous studies have shown that afi reduces excessive vegetative growth in crops and plant redundant growth dry and loveys 1998 graterol et al 1993 kang and cai 2002 kirda et al 2004 while enhancing grain filling rates zhang et al 2010 2012 thereby maintaining or even increasing crop yields graterol et al 1993 liang et al 1998 stone and nofziger 1993 we have also previously reported that afi can maintain yields and improve the harvest index by reducing redundant growth in plants by an appropriate amount compared to the w3 treatment jia et al 2014 in this study afi decreased agn by 8 3 in 2010 and 5 9 in 2011 compared to the w3 treatment table 4 indicating that an appropriate decrease in plant redundant growth can lead to decreased agn compared to the w3 treatment afi decreased agn table 4 by decreasing the amount of n derived from soil fig 2 but it did not significantly affect n from fertilizers fig 2 grain yields or grain n accumulation table 4 fig 2 indicating that afi decreased agn by reducing soil n luxury uptake and increased nhi and ute compared with the w3 treatment ute was positively related to nhi table 3 and gnc did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments table 4 supporting the other results moreover our results show that n accumulation and the percentages of n accumulated in leaves and stems were significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment fig 4 indicating that afi can reduce n accumulation in leaves and stems and increase n partitioning from n uptake to grain thus confirming previous findings that afi increases n partitioning to reproductive growth skinner et al 1999 furthermore afi can increase residual levels of soil n and maintain high soil fertility thus afi should be included in environment friendly n management models in previous studies afi has been shown to reduce the likelihood of nitrate n leaching as irrigation water is alternately supplied to wet and dry areas of the root system during crop growth stages lu et al 2019 skinner et al 1999 apri can promote upward movement of nitrate n within a deeper soil layer compared to conventional furrow irrigation wang et al 2014 in our study afi increased nitrate n content in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm but decreased that in the deeper soil layer 80 200 cm compared to the w2 and w3 treatments fig 5 similar results were presented by han et al 2014 who concluded that compared to conventional furrow irrigation apri increased nitrate n in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm by 30 60 but decreased that in the deeper soil layer 60 200 cm by 13 33 we found that afi reduced nitrate n leaching by an average of 8 3 and 16 6 compared to the w2 and w3 treatments respectively fig 6 indicating that afi dramatically decreased nitrate n movement to deeper soil while maintaining high grain yields 5 conclusion in this study we hypothesized that afi can maintain high grain yields and improve nue in winter wheat if appropriate irrigation schedules are applied afi treatment resulted in increased grain yields and upe and decreased or similar ute compared with the w2 treatment in which the same irrigation amount was used the increase in upe which was essentially due to more n from fertilizers and soil offset the reduction in ute and improved nue additionally afi led to higher ute and nhi by reducing agn compared with the w3 treatment which produced the same grain yields the decrease in agn was achieved by reducing soil n luxury uptake and n accumulation in stems and leaves as well as increasing n partitioning from n uptake to grains furthermore afi increased nitrate n content in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm and decreased nitrate n movement to deeper soil thus reducing the

10353,the objective of this study was to determine whether grain yield and nitrogen n use efficiency nue in winter wheat triticum aestivum l could be improved by alternate furrow irrigation afi during the 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 crop seasons the effects of afi on grain yield nue and its components the recovery of 15n labeled fertilizer n uptake and distribution and soil nitrate n were evaluated under field conditions the irrigation regimes were w0 non irrigated w2 every furrow irrigated at jointing and anthesis w3 every furrow irrigated before wintering and at jointing and grain filling and afi each of two neighboring furrows irrigated either before wintering or at grain filling and every furrow irrigated at jointing our results show that grain yield above ground nitrogen uptake agn including n from fertilizers and soil and nue were lowest in the w0 treatment and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency grain yield agn including n from fertilizers and soil nue nitrogen uptake efficiency upe 15n recovery efficiency and n accumulation in grains were significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment agn increased due to a higher amount of n derived from both fertilizers and soil more n was derived from soil than from fertilizers thus the proportion of n derived from fertilizers decreased no significant differences in grain yield and nue were observed between the afi and w3 treatments agn decreased when soil n luxury uptake and n accumulation in stems and leaves decreased greater n utilization efficiency and a higher n harvest index were observed in the afi treatment compared with the w3 treatment in addition afi increased nitrate n contents in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm and reduced nitrate n movement to deeper soil compared to the w2 and w3 treatments therefore afi may be an appropriate irrigation method for improving nue and decreasing water consumption in winter wheat without reducing yield keywords alternate furrow irrigation yield nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen harvest index winter wheat 1 introduction limited water availability for agriculture is becoming an acute problem worldwide cornish et al 2004 sandhu et al 2019 zehnder et al 2003 in china water scarce regions are found mainly in the north where major irrigation water resources are used for winter wheat triticum aestivum l sound practices for the efficient use of water and nutrients are urgently needed to ensure high crop yields under water limited conditions alternate furrow irrigation afi an irrigation strategy that employs partial root zone drying and thus increases water use efficiency ahmadi et al 2010 du et al 2013 jia et al 2014 kang and zhang 2004 sandhu et al 2019 sarker et al 2019 2020 sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 allows for a reduction in irrigation water use without compromising crop yields ahmadi et al 2010 casa and rouphael 2014 kang et al 2000 melo abreu et al 1993 ramadan and ragab 2018 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 nitrogen n is essential for maintaining crop physiological and agronomic traits mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 and efficient n uptake is important for improving crop growth and development wang et al 2012 water and nitrogen use efficiencies in crops are closely correlated di paolo and rinaldi 2008 frederick and camberato 1995 pandey et al 2001 wu et al 2008 a water shortage in soil may affect n availability and absorption by plant roots whereas an efficient water supply system improves grain nutrient n phosphorus p and potassium k uptake and crop productivity kumari et al 2017 kresoviÄ et al 2016 showed that despite a 25 reduction in irrigation water supply satisfactory grain yield in maize was maintained by increasing water use efficiency and reducing nutrient losses an excessive irrigation regime can lead to inefficient use of both water and applied n sarker et al 2020 and increase nitrate n leaching into deep soils or groundwater ju et al 2003 liu 2015 lu et al 2019 maeda et al 2003 the n that is taken up by crops comes mainly from two sources soil initial n and applied n fertilizers dai et al 2013 qi et al 2020 n uptake by plants and the fate of applied n from fertilizers depend largely on climatic factors and agricultural management practices kirda et al 2005 numerous studies have investigated the effects of alternate partial root zone irrigation apri on n uptake by the root system apri reportedly boosted leaf n levels by enhancing soil n availability wang et al 2012 reduced n luxury uptake hu et al 2009 and increased total n uptake nitrogen use efficiency nue and n partitioning to reproductive tissues skinner et al 1999 in maize han and kang 2002 li et al 2007 wang 2017 wheat li et al 2005 potato liu et al 2015 and tomato hou et al 2017 apri improved fertilizer n recovery resulting in less mineral n left in the soil compared with full irrigation and deficit irrigation treatments hu et al 2009 kirda et al 2005 li et al 2007 qi et al 2020 indicating that this irrigation strategy can be optimized with an appropriate fertilization scheme and adequate water supply in addition apri can improve the growth and distribution of maize roots and reduce the potential for nitrate leaching compared with conventional irrigation qi et al 2017 qi and hu 2016 skinner et al 1999 similarly afi is an established irrigation technique that can save water without reducing crop yields and it has been demonstrated to promote n uptake and improve nue therefore exploring the mechanisms by which afi enhances crop nue is essential for ensuring high economic returns and environmental protection in this region nevertheless afi can lead to reduced n uptake compared with conventional irrigation decreased fertilizer n uptake has been observed in corn during a dry year under afi when rainfall is rare throughout the growing season benjamin et al 1997 sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 found that nue in winter wheat was lower under afi than under ordinary furrow irrigation the reasons behind the reduced nue with afi may be lower grain yield and n leaching out of the roots zone as a result of abundant rainfall from late fall to early spring about 400 mm many studies have indicated that afi can maintain high wheat grain yield with a reduction in irrigation water and then promote irrigation water productivity and increase water use efficiency batool et al 2019 li et al 2017 soothar et al 2019 tari 2016 studies have shown that the interaction of this irrigation strategy with other strategies including the planting method and optimal n fertilizer rate can result in promoting irrigation water productivity in wheat mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 2019 but few studies have examined the effects of afi on the n uptake of wheat furthermore the mechanism underlying the variation in n uptake and nue in winter wheat under afi remain unclear changes in the components of nue sources of above ground n uptake and the n harvest index nhi with afi have not been documented adequately we previously reported that afi could increase water use efficiency and maintain yields during winter wheat cultivation in a northern chinese field where water resources were scarce jia et al 2014 in the current follow up study we examined how different irrigation strategies including afi and ordinary furrow irrigation w0 w2 and w3 affected nue including n uptake efficiency upe and n utilization efficiency ute n uptake from fertilizers and soil the distribution of n among different organs and soil nitrate n in two seasons under field conditions the mechanisms by which afi enhances nue are also discussed with regard to changes in above ground n uptake agn the nhi and grain n concentration gnc 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil characteristics field experiments on winter wheat were conducted for two consecutive years 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 at shandong agricultural university tai an shandong p r china the coordinates of the study area are 36 09 n and 117 09 e and the area is located at an elevation of 127 m above sea level in a semi humid continental temperate monsoon climate zone on average there are more than 2627 h of sunshine annually and the annual accumulated temperature above 10 c is more than 4213 c the frost free period is 195 days annual precipitation is 697 mm and the seasonal distribution of rainfall is uneven weather parameters were recorded at the study site throughout the crop growing period in 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 and mean values were calculated over the years 2001 2011 fig 1 rainfall distribution differed between the two growing seasons weather conditions were drier in general in the first season 2009 2010 than in the second season 2010 2011 with a total rainfall of 148 5 mm versus 172 2 mm in the second season rainfall was low in autumn and winter but abundant in spring moreover 132 mm of rainfall in may contributed substantially to improved crop yields the soil type was sandy loam with a mean soil bulk density of 1 53 g cm 3 the cultivated layer 0 40 cm had a ph of 6 58 levels of organic matter alkali hydrolyzable n rapidly available p and rapidly available k were 1 92 84 7 mg kg 1 21 12 mg kg 1 and 83 5 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design experiments were run using a complete randomized block design with three replicates per treatment the experimental winter wheat cultivar tainong 18 was sown on october 9 and 10 in 2009 and 2010 respectively at a seeding rate of 270 seeds m 2 four irrigation levels were used w0 no irrigation w2 irrigation at jointing and anthesis w3 conventional irrigation irrigation before wintering and at jointing and grain filling and afi irrigation of one of every two neighboring furrows before wintering and at jointing and the other furrows at jointing and grain filling the four irrigation schedules are shown in table 1 water meters installed at the discharge ends of pipes controlled the irrigation volumes the plots were uniformly irrigated to attain maximum soil moisture capacity at 1 week prior to sowing n p and k were applied as chemical fertilizers at rates of 120 kg ha 1 of n 105 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 150 kg ha 1 of k2o to all plots before planting and n was applied again 120 kg ha 1 at the jointing stage n topdressing of soil at jointing was carried out using a mini side dressing fertilizer applicator sl 4b shenglu machinery factory qufu p r china with an application depth of 10 cm and the field was irrigated immediately thereafter the plots were 20 m long and each contained six rows spaced 0 25 m apart each plot area was 30 m2 20 m 1 5 m and the furrow width was 1 50 m ma et al 2005 reported that at 20 of the average soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer an irrigation quota of 60 mm may lead to 70 cm of water side penetration into neighboring non irrigated plots based on local farming habits and the machinery used in this area the typical plot width is 1 5 m aside from irrigation field management was carried out in the same way for all plots following local agricultural practices 15n labeled urea was added to analyze the sources of agn in both seasons a ferrous thickness 3 mm box 50 cm 20 cm 40 cm without a top or bottom was embedded into the soil to create a micro environment for plant growth in each plot with the longer side of the box oriented perpendicular to the rows and the upper edges located 3 5 cm above the ground 15n labeled urea was the only n fertilizer used in the box and the application procedure and times were the same as those for the field trials all other fertilizers p2o5 and k2o were applied in the same way as in the field seeds numbers based on seeding rate were sowed artificially in two rows parallel to the row direction and final singling was carried out as in the field 2 3 measurement methods 2 3 1 grain yields final grain yields were determined by harvesting all plants in a 4 5 m2 sample area six rows of length 3 m in each plot at maturity sampled plants were dried in the sun to a standard moisture content of 12 to determine grain yields 88 dry matter t ha 1 grain yield in the afi treatment was calculated as the average yield across the alternately irrigated furrows 2 3 2 plant n analysis plant material samples were taken at maturity in both seasons by manually cutting all plants in a quadrat comprising six rows of length 50 cm at ground level plant materials in each sample were mixed and 30 single stems were subsampled and separated into leaves sheaths and stems and ears to calculate n accumulation rates in different organs all organ samples were oven dried at 70 c to constant weight to estimate dry matter accumulation then ears were divided into grains glumes and ear rachis and differences in ear dry matter and grain dry matter were measured oven dried samples were milled and analyzed for n concentration using the semi micro kjeldahl method kjeltec 8200 auto distillation unit foss hillerÃ¸d denmark bremner 1960 yuen and pollard 1953 and n accumulation was calculated by multiplying the element concentration by dry weight all plants in individual micro habitat boxes were sampled at ground level and then separated weighed and milled using the same methods described above isotopic abundance was measured using an isoprime 100 instrument isoprime cheadle uk 2 3 3 calculation of n indicators n indicators were calculated as follows nue grain dry matter yield per unit n available from both soil and fertilizers unitless kg kg 1 agn total n uptake

grains over grain dry matter at harvest 100 2 3 4 measurement of nitrate n content of soil soil samples were taken randomly from three areas in each plot after the winter wheat harvest using an auger inner diameter 4 0 cm to a depth of 200 cm at 20 cm intervals for each depth the three samples collected from each plot were mixed thoroughly to produce one composite sample fresh soil samples were sieved through a 2 mm mesh and 10 g of each sample was extracted by shaking with 50 ml of 1 mol l 1 kcl solution for 1 h after filtration extracts were analyzed immediately to determine n concentrations using a continuous flow analyzer autoanalyzer 3 bran luebbe hamburg germany soil water content was determined after drying at 105 c for 24 h amounts of nitrate n kg n ha 1 in the 0 200 cm soil profile at harvest were calculated according to the equation by emteryd 1989 with some modifications as follows y i t i b d i no 3 i 0 1 where t i is the thickness of the soil layer cm bd i is bulk density g cm 3 calculated to be 1 56 1 57 1 59 1 47 1 48 1 39 1 54 1 64 1 64 and 1 63 g cm 3 for the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 120 120 140 140 160 160 180 and 180 200 cm soil layers respectively no3 i is soil nitrate n concentration mg kg 1 which was calculated as the mean nitrate n concentration across different depths and the conversion coefficient is 0 1 the amount of nitrate n leached was taken to be the nitrate n accumulated in the 80 200 cm soil layer 2 4 statistical analysis all data were assembled and analyzed using microsoft excel 2010 redmond wa usa figures were plotted in sigmaplot 10 0 systat software san jose ca usa the statistical significance of differences among treatment means was determined using the general linear model procedure in sas v 6 12 sas institute cary nc usa all treatment means were compared across columns or rows using the least significant difference method with p 0 05 taken to denote statistical significance data collected in 2010 and 2011 were analyzed separately 3 results 3 1 grain yields and nitrogen use efficiency nue the effects of irrigation and year on grain yields were significant table 2 grain yields ranged from 6 21 to 9 06 t ha 1 88 dry matter across all treatments grain yields were lowest in the w0 treatment 6 21 t ha 1 in 2010 and 6 94 t ha 1 in 2011 and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency grain yields were significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment same irrigation amounts by 8 28 and 9 20 in 2010 and 2011 respectively in addition there was no significant difference in grain yields between the afi and w3 treatments these results indicate that afi can maintain the same high grain yields as conventional irrigation while reducing the amount of irrigation water by 33 the grain yield obtained in 2011 was 13 21 higher than that in 2010 which might have resulted from higher rainfall and irrigation amounts the effects of irrigation and year on nue were significant table 2 nue ranged from 15 98 to 24 30 kg kg 1 across all treatments because the same amount of n was available from soil and fertilizers in all treatments nue was affected similarly percentage wise as grain yield in each corresponding irrigation treatment in both seasons nue was lowest in the w0 treatment 15 98 kg kg 1 in 2010 and 18 62 kg kg 1 in 2011 and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency nue was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment whereas nue did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments for the same cropping periods 3 2 nitrogen uptake efficiency upe the effects of irrigation year and their interaction on upe were significant table 2 upe ranged from 46 50 to 82 50 across all treatments and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency upe was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment with afi improving upe by 8 09 in 2010 and 15 53 in 2011 relative to the w2 treatment however upe decreased by 8 27 in 2010 and 5 84 in 2011 with afi compared to the w3 treatment nue and upe were positively correlated table 4 upe is calculated as agn divided by available n because available n remained the same among the different treatments in this study variations in upe were completely determined by fluctuations in agn which was calculated to be 180 70 307 56 kg ha 1 across all treatments table 4 and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency agn was affected similarly percentage wise as upe in each year in each corresponding irrigation treatment because available n amounts were constant agn was 12 41 higher in 2011 than in 2010 sources of agn included n from fertilizers and soil the increase in agn was essentially due to an increase in n derived from both fertilizers and soil which tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency fig 2 accordingly the increase in n derived from both fertilizers and soil was positively related to agn fig 3 n from fertilizers was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment by 6 74 and 13 77 in 2010 and 2011 respectively n from fertilizers did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments because the same amount of fertilizer n was available the 15n recovery efficiency percentage of 15n taken up over that applied was significantly higher in the afi treatment average 41 1 than in the w2 treatment average 37 2 n from soil was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment by 8 71 and 16 56 in 2010 and 2011 respectively however n from soil was significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 11 34 and 8 23 in 2010 and 2011 respectively the contribution of fertilizer n to total agn tended to decrease with increasing irrigation frequency fig 2 the contribution of fertilizer n to total agn with afi was significantly higher than that in the w3 treatment by 6 60 and 4 77 in 2010 and 2011 respectively whereas the contribution of fertilizer n to total agn did not differ significantly between the afi and w2 treatments 3 3 nitrogen utilization efficiency ute the effects of irrigation and year irrigation on ute were significant table 2 ute was 28 62 34 68 kg kg 1 across all treatments and tended to decrease with increasing irrigation frequency ute was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 7 97 and 4 55 in 2010 and 2011 respectively ute did not differ significantly between the afi and w2 treatments in 2010 but was lower by 6 41 in the afi treatment in 2011 ute was positively related to nhi and negatively related to grain n accumulation table 3 ute decreased according to decreases in nhi which were significantly affected by irrigation time nhi ranged from 71 72 to 82 85 across all treatments and tended to decrease with increasing irrigation frequency table 4 nhi was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 8 23 and 3 76 in 2010 and 2011 respectively but did not differ significantly between the afi and w2 treatments afi maintained a high nhi by improving n transport from vegetative organs to grains compared with the treatment with the same grain yields w3 grain n accumulation was significantly affected by irrigation time ranging from 145 2 to 242 1 kg ha 1 across all treatments and tending to increase with increasing irrigation frequency table 4 grain n accumulation was significantly higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment by 7 66 and 15 76 in 2010 and 2011 respectively but did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments 3 4 distribution of n among different vegetative organs at maturity n accumulated and was distributed among different vegetative organs at maturity according to the following order stem spike axis and husk leaf fig 4 the amount of n accumulated and n proportions in wheat leaves spike axes and husks and stems tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency the amount of n accumulated in leaves was significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 38 61 and 29 14 in 2010 and 2011 respectively and that in stems was significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 30 88 and 23 05 in 2010 and 2011 respectively however the amount of n accumulated in spike axes and husks did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments n proportions in leaves were significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment by 33 08 and 24 73 in 2010 and 2011 respectively and those in stems were significantly lower in the afi treatment by 34 65 and 18 27 in 2010 and 2011 respectively fig 4 however n proportions in spike axes and husks did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments the results show that afi decreased n accumulation and proportions in leaves and stems compared to the w3 treatment thus afi promoted n transport from leaves and stems to grains in winter wheat 3 5 soil nitrate n in the 0 200 cm soil layer at maturity the irrigation schemes adopted in this study significantly affected soil nitrate n contents in the 0 200 cm soil layer at maturity fig 5 with increasing irrigation nitrate n contents tended to decrease in the 0 60 cm soil layer and increase in the 80 140 cm soil layer in the 160 200 cm soil layer no significant differences were observed among treatments in either growing season afi increased nitrate n contents in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm but decreased nitrate n contents in the deeper soil layer 80 140 cm compared to the w2 and w3 treatments fig 5 nitrate n contents in the 0 60 cm soil layer were higher in 2011 than in 2010 this could have been due to the large amount of organic fertilizers applied before wheat sowing in 2010 which might have led to higher soil nitrate n contents at maturity in 2011 compared with the w2 and w3 treatments afi reduced nitrate n leaching by 7 1 and 13 9 respectively in 2010 and by 9 5 and 20 5 respectively in 2011 fig 6 this indicates that afi dramatically decreased nitrate n movement to deeper soil thus maintaining high nitrate n contents in the upper soil layer 4 discussion water deficits lead to reduced wheat yields and increasing the irrigation supply can increase grain yields xue et al 2006 in our study grain yields were lowest in the w0 non irrigated treatment and tended to increase with increasing irrigation frequency table 2 in agreement with previous reports tari 2016 torrion and stougaard 2017 afi has been shown to be an effective water saving irrigation method kang and zhang 2004 in this study grain yields were higher in the afi treatment than in the w2 treatment even though the same amount of irrigation water was used table 2 similarly increased crop yields with afi have been reported for wheat sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 yang et al 2010 rice cabangon et al 2011 potato sarker et al 2019 cotton tang et al 2005 and maize liang et al 2013 sarker et al 2020 wang et al 2012 furthermore our experimental field results revealed that in the afi treatment irrigation water use was reduced by 33 compared to the w3 treatment but grain yields did not decrease significantly table 2 which is consistent with previous findings belder et al 2004 du et al 2008 howell et al 2015 mishra and salokhe 2010 richards and sander 2014 here we defined nue as grain yield divided by available n therefore changes in nue exhibited the same trends as grain yield due to available n staying the same across different treatments in this study nue can also be expressed as the product of upe and ute we found that nue was positively correlated with upe table 3 indicating that by optimizing the irrigation scheme nue can be improved through increases in upe the dependence of nue on upe has also been reported previously barraclough et al 2010 dai et al 2013 giambalvo et al 2010 muurinen et al 2006 upe was calculated as agn divided by available n because available n remained unchanged among the different treatments variations in upe were completely determined by fluctuations in agn the positive association between agn and upe table 3 indicates that the increase in upe resulted mainly from increases in agn with increased irrigation table 4 in general total agn is derived from n in both recently applied fertilizers and soil ahmadi et al 2010 barraclough et al 2010 in our study n derived from fertilizers and soil increased with increased irrigation frequency and amount fig 2 and n uptake from both sources was positively correlated with agn fig 3 indicating that increasing irrigation improved the capture of n from fertilizers and soil thus increasing agn field studies have shown that root dimensions and distribution influence wheat n uptake from soil asseng et al 1997 barraclough 1986 thorup kristensen et al 2009 excessive drought stress inhibits root growth and the spatial and temporal distribution of roots in soil limiting root n uptake gajri et al 1989 an appropriate amount of irrigation can promote root growth increase root distribution in soil li et al 2010 and enhance water and n uptake qi et al 2012 therefore the increase in agn might have resulted from an increase in root dimensions and distribution as agn increases with increasing irrigation more n comes from the soil meng et al 2011 qi et al 2020 consistent with our findings that n derived from soil increases with increasing irrigation and n derived from soil was much higher than n derived from fertilizers in the wheat plants in all treatments two factors may account for the greater contribution of soil n to agn first the low contribution of n from fertilizers can be attributed to water flow and higher rates of fertilizer n leaching below the rooting zone during irrigation whereas soil n is isolated and held within soil particles kirda et al 2005 second full irrigation or afi which results in the alternate drying and wetting of soil may produce soil moisture conditions that accelerate the mineralization rate of soil organic n wang et al 2010 2012 which then makes more soil n available for use by plants therefore the proportion of n in agn derived from fertilizers tended to decrease with increasing irrigation frequency and amount fig 2 positive associations between root growth and root absorptive capacity and n uptake in wheat have been demonstrated in field studies barraclough 1986 thorup kristensen et al 2009 dai et al 2013 afi may promote root growth burgess et al 1998 du et al 2006 and has been shown to increase root volume and biomass kang et al 2000 yang et al 2010 improve root absorptive capacity ben asher and silberbush 1992 han and kang 2002 kang et al 1998 li et al 2005 mingo et al 2004 shi and kang 2000 and increase n including n from fertilizers and soil uptake and accumulation cabangon et al 2011 wang et al 2009 2010a 2010b 2012 in our study afi increased n including n from fertilizers and soil uptake compared to the w2 treatment even though the same amounts of irrigation water were used table 4 fig 2 this could have been due to the buffering capacity of soil under natural conditions which enables plants to maintain or even increase root growth in dry soil additionally rewatering soil dried roots causes a flush of secondary roots to grow liang et al 1996 the ability of roots to absorb nutrients is improved by alternate drying and rewatering in a horizontal direction or along a vertical soil profile ben asher and silberbush 1992 han and kang 2002 li et al 2005 shi and kang 2000 furthermore soil moisture gradients between the wet and dry root zones allow roots in dry soil to remain viable for extended periods of time kang and zhang 2004 enabling greater access to water and nutrients deeper in the soil yang et al 2009 because available fertilizer n remained constant afi increased 15n recovery efficiency compared to the w2 treatment same irrigation amounts used consistent with findings by hou et al 2017 and wang et al 2017 our data indicate that afi can increase n from fertilizers and soil uptake as well as agn and upe thereby improving nue and grain yields previous studies have shown that afi reduces excessive vegetative growth in crops and plant redundant growth dry and loveys 1998 graterol et al 1993 kang and cai 2002 kirda et al 2004 while enhancing grain filling rates zhang et al 2010 2012 thereby maintaining or even increasing crop yields graterol et al 1993 liang et al 1998 stone and nofziger 1993 we have also previously reported that afi can maintain yields and improve the harvest index by reducing redundant growth in plants by an appropriate amount compared to the w3 treatment jia et al 2014 in this study afi decreased agn by 8 3 in 2010 and 5 9 in 2011 compared to the w3 treatment table 4 indicating that an appropriate decrease in plant redundant growth can lead to decreased agn compared to the w3 treatment afi decreased agn table 4 by decreasing the amount of n derived from soil fig 2 but it did not significantly affect n from fertilizers fig 2 grain yields or grain n accumulation table 4 fig 2 indicating that afi decreased agn by reducing soil n luxury uptake and increased nhi and ute compared with the w3 treatment ute was positively related to nhi table 3 and gnc did not differ significantly between the afi and w3 treatments table 4 supporting the other results moreover our results show that n accumulation and the percentages of n accumulated in leaves and stems were significantly lower in the afi treatment than in the w3 treatment fig 4 indicating that afi can reduce n accumulation in leaves and stems and increase n partitioning from n uptake to grain thus confirming previous findings that afi increases n partitioning to reproductive growth skinner et al 1999 furthermore afi can increase residual levels of soil n and maintain high soil fertility thus afi should be included in environment friendly n management models in previous studies afi has been shown to reduce the likelihood of nitrate n leaching as irrigation water is alternately supplied to wet and dry areas of the root system during crop growth stages lu et al 2019 skinner et al 1999 apri can promote upward movement of nitrate n within a deeper soil layer compared to conventional furrow irrigation wang et al 2014 in our study afi increased nitrate n content in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm but decreased that in the deeper soil layer 80 200 cm compared to the w2 and w3 treatments fig 5 similar results were presented by han et al 2014 who concluded that compared to conventional furrow irrigation apri increased nitrate n in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm by 30 60 but decreased that in the deeper soil layer 60 200 cm by 13 33 we found that afi reduced nitrate n leaching by an average of 8 3 and 16 6 compared to the w2 and w3 treatments respectively fig 6 indicating that afi dramatically decreased nitrate n movement to deeper soil while maintaining high grain yields 5 conclusion in this study we hypothesized that afi can maintain high grain yields and improve nue in winter wheat if appropriate irrigation schedules are applied afi treatment resulted in increased grain yields and upe and decreased or similar ute compared with the w2 treatment in which the same irrigation amount was used the increase in upe which was essentially due to more n from fertilizers and soil offset the reduction in ute and improved nue additionally afi led to higher ute and nhi by reducing agn compared with the w3 treatment which produced the same grain yields the decrease in agn was achieved by reducing soil n luxury uptake and n accumulation in stems and leaves as well as increasing n partitioning from n uptake to grains furthermore afi increased nitrate n content in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm and decreased nitrate n movement to deeper soil thus reducing the likelihood of nitrate n leaching into ground water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10354,this study proposed a calculation framework to reasonably and effectively calculate the agricultural irrigation water consumption aiwc and reused irrigation return flow i r f r in multi source irrigation systems based on the modified soil and water assessment tool swat the calculation framework was applied in the yangshudang ysd watershed in southern china over the years results showed that total aiwc and i r f r of the irrigation system increased as the degree of drought increased the improved total aiwc a i w c n e w g which considered the reuse of return flow is less than the traditional total aiwc a i w c o g in addition to the backbone water source of the zhanghe reservoir 44 54 of the a i w c o g of the ysd watershed came from ponds inside the ysd watershed under multiyear average conditions the i r f r accounted for 6 49 of the a i w c o g and the a i w c n e w g accounted for 93 51 of the a i w c o g for accuracy and management this calculation framework and improved aiwc are suggested to be used in the multi source irrigation systems keywords calculation framework agricultural irrigation water consumption multi source irrigation system modified swat reuse of return flow 1 introduction the water resources bulletin is an important government document that counts and records the amount of water resources water storage dynamics water consumption water quality of rivers and lakes and important water events in each province in china in the previous years to improve the quality of the water resources bulletin and support the assessment of the most stringent water resource management system in china it is necessary to measure or calculate the total water consumption agricultural water consumption is a very important part of the total water consumption for example in china agricultural water consumption accounts for 60 of the total water consumption chang et al 2017 hence the estimation of agricultural water consumption is of utmost significance for determining the total water consumption furthermore the agricultural irrigation water consumption aiwc accounts for a large part of agricultural water consumption e g 90 in china and 92 in canada beaulieu et al 2007 therefore the accurate estimation of aiwc is vital to improve the accuracy of the determination of the total water consumption irrigation systems are the basic objects of aiwc estimation hu et al 2018 currently the estimation of aiwc is mainly based on a typical survey in china the typical survey mainly focused on the observed irrigation quota and the actual irrigation area since the traditional aiwc for an irrigation system is equal to the product of the irrigation quota and the irrigation area huffman et al 2013 shen et al 2016 the accuracy of this method depends on the number and representativeness of typical surveys in southern china there are multi source irrigation systems that involves a combination of reservoirs ponds and canals those multi source irrigation systems are named as melons on a vine irrigation system guo 1965 crop irrigation is characterized by a high degree of randomness when taking water from different water sources in these systems wang and zheng 2016 wu et al 2019b in addition the reuse of return flow is very common in multi source irrigation systems because of the spatial variability of land uses soil types and water source conditions in multi source irrigation systems it is difficult to calculate the aiwc from the sources to irrigation areas in view of this modeling is an effective method to estimate the aiwc in complex irrigation systems especially in multi source irrigation systems in southern china there are many models that can be used to simulate irrigation water use in irrigation systems among them many field scale models have been used by some researchers to simulate irrigation water use qureshi et al 2002 li et al 2017 however these models can only use water from a single water source therefore it is not appropriate to use field scale models to estimate the aiwc of irrigation systems especially in multi source irrigation systems some statistical methods have also been used to simulate aiwc for example zai et al 2009 used the least squares support vector machine method to predict the aiwc of a canal irrigation system ma et al 2012 used multiple linear regression models and back propagation bp neural network models to simulate the net irrigation water consumption in farming areas these methods are mainly used for forecasting aiwc in future years and require models to be built based on statistical aiwc data from many years for the complex multi source irrigation systems in southern china it is difficult to guarantee the reliability of historical aiwc data since they did not distinguish aiwc from different water sources in previous years considering the spatial heterogeneity of multi source irrigation systems distributed hydrological models are excellent tools to simulate the water balance in a river basin or an irrigation system the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 have been applied in many irrigation systems with good prospects xie and cui 2011 dai et al 2016 to effectively simulate irrigation water consumption some researchers modified the automatic irrigation module in the swat model for other specific goals chen et al 2018 uniyal and dietrich 2019 considering the hydrological characteristics and irrigation behavior in multi source irrigation systems in southern china wu et al 2019a b added a multi source auto irrigation module to calculate the aiwc from different water sources which provides an effective way to estimate the aiwc in multi source irrigation systems the reuse of return flow is very common in irrigation systems wang and cui 2011 especially in multi source irrigation systems however aiwc calculated in previous studies does not take the reuse of return flow into account after water is transferred from a water source e g a reservoir to fields for irrigation the irrigation return flow enters drainage channels ponds or other water storage facilities through surface runoff deep percolation and lateral seepage those return flows can be reused for irrigating fields downstream the i r f r should not be considered as a part of the true aiwc of the irrigation systems therefore the true aiwc of multi source irrigation systems and the reused irrigation return flow i r f r need to be defined and calculated separately there are some studies focused on the estimation of return flow and the amount reused zulu et al 1996 mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 chien and fang 2012 ha et al 2017 wu et al 2019b also proposed a method that can effectively calculate the i r f r well in multi source irrigation systems in this study considering the spatial heterogeneities and the reuse of return flow in multi source irrigation systems a calculation framework is proposed to provide an effective method for the calculation of the true aiwc and the aiwc from different water sources in a multi source irrigation system the framework is composed of a modified swat model wu et al 2019a b a method for calculating i r f r wu et al 2019b and a classification and definition of aiwc the ysd watershed in the zhanghe irrigation system zis in southern china is evaluated as a study case for the application of this calculation framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 modified swat model description swat is a continuous time spatially semi distributed physically based model arnold et al 1998 the watershed is divided into multiple subbasins based on the digital elevation model dem which are then further subdivided into specific soil land use slope characteristic units that are called hydrological response units hrus in order to completely represent the characteristics of the irrigation system and simulate its hydrological processes more reasonably especially the multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice in southern china some researchers modified or developed some modules of swat in terms of the paddy field water balance simulation in swat xie and cui 2011 considered that the area of a paddy field was equal to that of an hru covered by paddy rice and the evapotranspiration et of paddy field was calculated by stages namely the impounded stage and the non impounded stage a technique with three critical depths the maximum fitting depth h max the minimum fitting depth h min and the maximum allowable depth of impoundment after rainfall h p was introduced by xie and cui 2011 to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy field in addition dai et al 2016 had also made some modifications to the paddy field water balance simulation in swat a crop coefficient k c was introduced to compute the et of paddy field and a water utilization coefficient of the canal system Î· c a n a l was introduced to calculate the canal seepage loss and the calculation of lateral flow in paddy fields was added to swat furthermore wu et al 2019a b integrated the abovementioned developments of paddy field water balance and proposed a multi source auto irrigation module for swat producing a modified swat model suitable for the simulation of hydrological processes in multi source irrigation systems the relationship among these developments or modifications is shown in fig 1 the multi source auto irrigation module of modified swat model could be used to simulate the aiwcs from different water sources in multi source irrigation systems the subbasins are used as the analysis objects first the water sources and their orders are specified for each subbasin generally the river channel and ponds inside the subbasin are the first and second water sources respectively and other water sources e g reservoirs or water sources outside the watershed are designated the third water source the fourth water source etc all hrus belonging to the same subbasin have the same irrigation water sources and orders second according to the irrigation conditions of the hrus covered by upland crops and hrus covered by paddy rice when they occur the irrigation water requirements are calculated third the water stored in the specified water sources is fetched to irrigate crops growing in hrus from the first water source to the last one finally the aiwcs from different water sources can be obtained by summing the irrigation amount according to the type of water source 2 2 description of the method for calculating reused irrigation return flow in multi source irrigation systems after irrigation the irrigation return flow mainly enters ponds and river channels and is reused when the water in the ponds and river channels is extracted to irrigate fields according to the characteristics of multi source irrigation systems wu et al 2019b proposed a method to calculate the i r f r based on the modified swat model the detailed description is as follows 1 the multi source auto irrigation module of the modified swat model can simulate and output the irrigation amounts from different water sources for each hru by summing the irrigation amounts from ponds i o p n d and that from river channels i o r c h of each subbasin can be obtained moreover the modified swat model can also simulate and output the irrigation return flow into the ponds i r f p and that into the river channels i r f r for each hru on the day of irrigation the i r f p and i r f r of each subbasin can be obtained by summing the values of the hrus 2 the subbasins are used as the analysis objects to determine the i r f r which is divided into two parts namely the reused irrigation return flow into ponds and into river channels i r f p r and i r f r r respectively for one subbasin i r f p r takes the minimum value of i o p n d and i r f p in the same way the i r f r r also takes the minimum value of i o r c h and i r f r considering that the river channels establish connections between the upstream and downstream subbasins when the i r f r r is less than i r f r in the upstream subbasin some of the return flow of the upstream subbasin will flow out and be used in the downstream subbasin which is considered when calculating i r f r r in the downstream subbasin 3 according to the above steps we can obtain the i r f p r and i r f r r of each subbasin and sum them to obtain the reused irrigation return flow into ponds and into river channels throughout the whole irrigation system i r f p r a l l and i r f r r a l l respectively and these values can then be combined to obtain the reused irrigation return flow of the whole irrigation system i r f r a l l 2 3 calculation framework for agricultural irrigation water consumption 2 3 1 classification of agricultural irrigation water consumption the multi source irrigation systems in southern china have many large or small reservoirs and ponds distributed in the irrigation system generally large and medium sized reservoirs are the backbone water sources in irrigation systems and water is conveyed to the fields through a canal system currently most reservoir management departments monitor the amount of water released from reservoirs for irrigation by monitoring facilities ponds are usually distributed near fields and farmers usually pump water from ponds to fields to irrigate crops or directly dig a ditch to introduce water into fields for irrigation taking water from ponds for irrigation is highly random and it is very difficult to measure this portion of the water in addition there are many river channels or drainage channels in multi source irrigation systems and farmers also intercept this water to irrigate the fields near river channels this part of the water consumption is also difficult to measure in summary the water sources in multi source irrigation systems in southern china can be classified as measurable backbone water sources such as large and medium sized reservoirs from which the water consumption can be measured and ponds and river channels from which the water consumption is difficult to measure therefore according to the types of water sources the aiwc is classified as the aiwc from river channels a i w c r c h the aiwc from ponds a i w c p n d and the aiwc from backbone water sources such as large and medium sized reservoirs a i w c r e s 2 3 2 definition of agricultural irrigation water consumption traditionally the total aiwc of an irrigation system is equal to the sum of the irrigation water taken from various water sources which is defined here as the traditional aiwc the traditional aiwc includes the i r f r but the i r f r itself is generated because of irrigation so it should not be counted as a part of the aiwc the i r f r should be subtracted from the traditional aiwc therefore regarding the combination of the types of water sources in the multi source irrigation systems in southern china the following definitions and relations are presented 1 a i w c o g a i w c o r c h a i w c o p n d a i w c o r e s where a i w c o g a i w c o r c h a i w c o p n d and a i w c o r e s represent the traditional aiwc from all water sources river channels ponds and large and medium sized reservoirs respectively m3 considering the reuse of return flow the improved aiwc of an irrigation system is defined as follows 2 a i w c n e w g a i w c n e w r c h a i w c n e w p n d a i w c n e w r e s where a i w c n e w g a i w c n e w r c h a i w c n e w p n d and a i w c n e w r e s are the improved aiwc from all water sources river channels ponds and large and medium sized reservoirs respectively which consider the reuse of return flow m3 for multi source irrigation systems after irrigation the irrigation return flow mainly enters ponds and river channels and is reused when the water in the ponds and river channels is taken to irrigate fields wu et al 2019b for large and medium sized reservoirs the irrigation area is usually downstream of the reservoirs so the irrigation return flow rarely enters the reservoirs therefore the following relations can be stated 3 i r f r a l l i r f p r a l l i r f r r a l l 4 a i w c n e w p n d a i w c o p n d i r f p r a l l 5 a i w c n e w r c h a i w c o r c h i r f r r a l l 6 a i w c n e w r e s a i w c o r e s 7 a i w c n e w g a i w c o g i r f r a l l where i r f r a l l is the reused irrigation return flow of an irrigation system m3 and i r f p r a l l and i r f r r a l l are the reused irrigation return flow into ponds and river channels respectively of an irrigation system m3 2 3 3 calculating agricultural irrigation water consumption based on the spatial data of the irrigation system meteorological data farmland management measures and other data the modified swat model can be used to set up a distributed hydrological model of the irrigation system the modified swat model divides the irrigation system into multiple subbasins and for each subbasin its irrigation amounts from different water sources can be obtained by simulating the hydrological processes of the irrigation system with the modified swat model these irrigation amounts are traditional irrigation amounts since the reuse of return flow is not considered based on the simulation outputs of the modified swat model wu et al 2019b proposed a method to calculate the return flow and the reused amount which can be used to calculate the reused irrigation return flow into ponds and that into river channels in each subbasin see section 2 2 therefore considering the reuse of return flow according to the definitions described above the new irrigation amounts in each subbasin can be calculated as follows 8 i i n e w p n d i i o p n d i r f p i r 9 i i n e w r c h i i o r c h i r f r i r 10 i i n e w r e s i i o r e s where i is the number of subbasins i i n e w p n d and i i o p n d are the new and traditional irrigation amounts respectively from ponds in subbasin i m3 i i n e w r c h and i i o r c h are the new and traditional irrigation amounts respectively from river channels in subbasin i m3 i i n e w r e s and i i o r e s are the new and traditional irrigation amounts respectively from large and medium sized reservoirs in subbasin i m3 and i r f p i r and i r f r i r are the reused irrigation return flows into ponds and into river channels respectively in subbasin i m3 thus the aiwc and i r f r of the whole multi source irrigation system are as follows 11 i r f r a l l i 1 n i r f p i r i r f r i r 12 a i w c n e w p n d i 1 n i i n e w p n d 13 a i w c n e w r c h i 1 n i i n e w r c h 14 a i w c o p n d i 1 n i i o p n d 15 a i w c o r c h i 1 n i i o r c h 16 a i w c n e w r e s a i w c o r e s i 1 n i i o r e s where n is the total number of subbasins in the irrigation system finally the a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g can be calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 2 4 study area a typical multi source irrigation system the ysd watershed was chosen as the study area which was located in the zis of hubei province china the ysd watershed is enclosed by the third main canal of the zis in the northeast the first tributary canal of the third main canal in the west and a small branch canal in the southeast as shown in fig 2 and it is a relatively closed small watershed with an area of approximately 43 3 km2 a subtropical continental climate with an annual average temperature of 17 c a maximum temperature of 40 9 c and an annual mean rainfall of 821 mm in the study area the mainland includes paddy fields dry lands and forests of which the paddy fields account for approximately 60 of the area as shown in fig 3 the soil type is predominantly yellow brown earth paddy soil in the study area crops such as rice cotton and rapeseed are cultivated rice is the main irrigated crop and an intermittent irrigation mode is used for its irrigation 2 5 swat model setup calibration and validation 2 5 1 model setup according to the dem of the study area with a 25 m resolution as shown in fig 3 and setting the ysd reservoir as the outlet of the ysd watershed the study area was divided into 10 subbasins as shown in fig 2 then the 10 subbasins were subdivided into 105 hrus based on the land cover types as shown in fig 3 soil type distribution and slopes a hydrological distributed model for the study area was set up with the modified swat model the meteorological data from 1986 to 2017 pond parameters and other data were input to the model in which the irrigation and drainage of the hrus covered by paddy rice were controlled by the h max h min and h p in the different growing stages of paddy rice which were obtained from the tuanlin experimental station in addition according to the actual conditions of the ysd watershed the irrigation water sources and the sequence for the hrus covered by paddy rice in each subbasin were set as follows the internal river channels of the subbasin ponds and the zhanghe reservoir the water in the zhanghe reservoir was conveyed to the ysd watershed for irrigation through the three main canals of the zhanghe reservoir and the first tributary canal of the third main canal while the water in the river channels and ponds was directly pumped to irrigate nearby fields therefore two different traditional irrigation efficiency ie0 values were set for the different water sources these values were ie01 0 90 for the local water sources river channels and ponds and ie02 0 65 for the zhanghe reservoir which were provided by the tuanlin experimental station a detailed description of the modeling process and data is presented in the references wu et al 2019a 2 5 2 model calibration and validation according to a survey from the staff of the zhanghe reservoir and elderly farmers in the ysd watershed the land cover and planting structure of the ysd watershed have remained basically unchanged for the last 30 years therefore after calibration and validation based on the observed data the distributed hydrological model of the study area can not only effectively simulate the hydrological processes occurring in years when the hydrological elements were observed but also can simulate the hydrological processes of the other years in terms of the study area compared with the previous research by wu et al 2019a b in this paper some observed data from 2016 to 2017 were added to calibrate and validate the modified swat model specifically the observed data used in this paper were as follows 1 the observed daily discharge series of the ysd watershed outlet in the paddy rice growth period from 2005 to 2009 and that from 2016 to 2017 which were observed at temporary hydrometric stations fig 1 from 2005 2009 a temporary hydrometric station was set up by tuanlin experimental station at the ysd watershed outlet the discharge was measured per 2 h and the average of the measured discharges in every day was taken as the observed discharge for that day then the temporary hydrometric station was damaged and there was no observational data from 2010 to 2015 until 2016 due to experimental needs another temporary hydrometric station was installed at the same location to observe the discharge during the paddy rice growth period 2 the observed daily et series in the paddy rice growth period in an experimental paddy field located in tuanlin experiment station from 2007 to 2008 which were measured through lysimeters of 2 m 2 m and that in another experimental paddy field located in no 4 subbasin as shown in fig 2 from 2016 to 2017 which were measured through measuring cylinders with a diameter of 618 mm for the lysimeters and measuring cylinders the impermeable layers were set at their bottom and the depth of water layer or soil moisture content in the lysimeter or measuring cylinder was measured at 8 00 a m every morning because of the impermeable layer there was basically no seepage and the precipitation was also observed every day the daily et was calculated by the water balance equation 3 the observed aiwc from local water sources namely river channels and ponds in the ysd watershed and the zhanghe reservoir from 2005 to 2008 which were provided by the management bureau of zis this department obtained the aiwc from local water sources in the ysd watershed through investigations and reports from farmers and obtained the aiwc from zhanghe reservoir through monitoring facilities set up at the third main canal of the zis and the first tributary canal of the third main canal and the observed irrigation amounts in the experimental paddy field located in the no 4 subbasin in 2016 and 2017 which were obtained through field water balance experiments the filed water level was observed and recorded in the experiment paddy field during the paddy growth period when the field water layer was lower than the h min the experimental paddy field was irrigated through a water pipe and a water meter was installed on the water pipe to record the irrigation amount each time with the coefficient of determination r2 santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the relative error re gupta et al 1999 as the objective functions using 2005 2009 as the calibration period the observed daily discharge series of the ysd watershed outlet in 2005 2009 the observed daily et series in 2007 2008 and the observed aiwc from local water sources and the zhanghe reservoir in 2005 2008 were used to calibrate the modified swat model for the study area via the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 and manual tuning parameters method notably the observed aiwc is the traditional aiwc and the traditional aiwc from local sources a i w c o l o c a l is the sum of a i w c o r c h and a i w c o p n d furthermore after calibration and the completion of an acceptable simulation of the daily discharge the daily et and aiwc in the corresponding years the observed daily discharge series in 2016 to 2017 the observed daily et series in 2016 to 2017 and the observed irrigation amounts in the experimental paddy field located in no 4 subbasin in 2016 and 2017 were used to validate the modified swat model in the same modeling environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation results after calibration and validation the simulation processes of daily discharges and daily et and the simulation results of aiwc in the calibration period 2005 2009 are basically similar to those of the reference wu et al 2019a so the detailed processes in the calibration period can be seen in the reference further the comparison of the observed values and simulated values in the validation period 2016 2017 were shown in figs 4 6 figs 4 6 showed that the daily discharge daily et and irrigation amounts simulated by the modified swat model were generally in good agreement with the observed values that is the modified swat model could effectively simulate the hydrological processes in the study area however from fig 4 there were lager errors between the simulated discharges and the observed values in some periods the main reason for this phenomenon was that the modified swat model controlled irrigation and drainage via the h max h min and h p and assumed that the h max h min and h p were same in the whole ysd watershed and that all paddy fields in the same hru were irrigated or drained on the same day however in actuality there were certain differences in the h max h min and h p of different paddy fields and the farmers might irrigate or drain the paddy fields on different days therefore to more truly reflect the actual situation of human activities in irrigation systems the in depth development of the modified swat model on paddy rice irrigation and drainage should continue to be carried out additionally fig 5 showed that the modified swat model underestimated et from september 1 10 in 2016 corresponding to the ripening dry stage of paddy rice growth stage this underestimation occurred because the modified swat model assumed that the paddy field was in the non impoundment stage once there was water it would be drained immediately resulting in a gradual decrease in the soil water content in contrast the experimental paddy field retained a small amount of water in the first few days of this period so the simulated et was lower than the observed values regarding the irrigation amount simulation in previous research wu et al 2019a used only the total observed aiwcs from local water sources and the zhanghe reservoir in the whole ysd watershed and the data were not sufficiently detailed in this paper the observed irrigation amounts in an experimental paddy field were added to verify the simulation of irrigation amounts in the small scale area of an hru and the results from fig 6 showed that the irrigation amounts in small scale areas could also be simulated well which further proved that the modified swat model could effectively simulate the irrigation amounts of fields and the aiwc of irrigation systems to further demonstrate the performance of the model simulation the calibration and validation evaluations for daily discharge daily et aiwc and irrigation amounts were shown in table 1 the results in table 1 further showed that the hydrological processes and aiwc in multi source irrigation systems could be simulated effectively with the modified swat model in addition wu et al 2019b compared the calculated irrigation return flow with the measured the result suggested that the method they proposed can be used to calculate the irrigation return flow in multi source irrigation systems in other words the method proposed by wu et al 2019b can be combined with the modified swat model to calculate the true aiwc from different water sources in multi source irrigation systems namely a i w c n e w r c h a i w c n e w p n d a i w c n e w r e s and a i w c n e w g 3 2 statistics and analysis of agricultural irrigation water consumption 3 2 1 agricultural irrigation water consumption in different hydrological years with 1986 1987 set as the warm up period the modified swat model was used to simulate the hydrological processes of the ysd watershed from 1988 to 2017 after calibration and validation in particular the multi source auto irrigation module was used to simulate the irrigation amounts of each hru covered by paddy fields in the ysd watershed based on the irrigation simulation results of hrus covered by paddy fields the traditional aiwc from different water sources in the ysd watershed was statistically obtained then based on the simulation outputs of the modified swat model the method proposed by wu et al 2019b was used to calculate the i r f r a l l of the ysd watershed finally the improved aiwc was calculated using eqs 1 7 we ranked the rainfall amount from large to small during the paddy rice growth period in the study area from 1988 to 2017 and calculated the rainfall frequency the traditional aiwc the i r f r a l l and the improved aiwc were calculated in three hydrological years which were the wet year of 2004 rainfall frequency is 10 the normal year of 2002 rainfall frequency is 50 and the dry year of 2010 rainfall frequency is 90 and the results were shown in fig 7 the following conclusions can be derived from fig 7 1 in different hydrological years the total aiwc both a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g of the irrigation system increased as the degree of drought increased because there was more rainfall in wet years which reduced the lack of water in paddy fields so the irrigation water demand during the whole growth period was lower in contrast the opposite situation was observed for dry years for the normal years the situation was halfway between the two conditions in addition a i w c n e w g was less than a i w c o g because of the reuse of return flow 2 regarding the aiwc from local water sources that is the sum of the aiwc from river channels and the aiwc from ponds in different hydrological years the same pattern as the total aiwc was not observed this difference occurred because the water in the local water sources was mainly from rainfall and the change in the amount of water in the local water sources during the whole crop growth period was related to the distribution of rainfall over time which directly affected the availability of water from local water sources when crops need irrigation it was possible that the wet years were due to several heavy rain events during periods with heavy rain the local water sources were abundant but the crops did not need irrigation at this time however many days after rains when crops need irrigation the local water supply was reduced and the water in the large and medium sized reservoirs needed to be taken to supply irrigation in normal years if rainfall was evenly distributed during the crop growth period the water in the local water sources can be used more for irrigation in dry years the amount of water in local water sources was generally low because of little rainfall which caused the aiwc from local water sources to also be small 3 in different hydrological years the i r f r of the irrigation system also increased as the degree of drought increased because with an increase in drought the number of irrigations and the amount of irrigation water would increase which caused the return flow produced by irrigation to increase so the i r f r increased accordingly 4 fig 7 also showed that the a i w c n e w r c h was zero in the ysd watershed combined with eq 5 we could see that the a i w c o r c h was equal to the i r f r r in the ysd watershed the reason was that the river channels in the ysd watershed were basically drainage channels and the water in the drainage channels came from rainfall or irrigation that is the a i w c o r c h was derived from the return flow the a i w c o r c h was less than the total irrigation return flow so the a i w c o r c h was equal to the i r f r r 3 2 2 water supply ratios of different water sources to analyze the composition of the a i w c o g and the relationship between a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g the water supply ratio of a water source was defined as the percentage of the aiwc from this water source in the a i w c o g in the irrigation systems where the aiwc from the water source considered the reuse of return flow e g a i w c n e w p n d and a i w c n e w r c h and the irrigation water reuse rate Î· i was defined as the percentage of the i r f r in the a i w c o g in the irrigation systems according to the simulation results from 1988 to 2017 with the modified swat model the annual averages of the a i w c n e w r c h a i w c n e w p n d a i w c n e w r e s a i w c n e w g i r f r a i w c o g Î· i and the annual averages of the water supply ratio of different water sources of the ysd watershed were calculated the results are shown in table 2 table 2 showed that the crop irrigation in the ysd watershed was mainly supplied by the ponds inside the ysd watershed and the zhanghe reservoir the a i w c n e w r c h in the ysd watershed was zero because the water in river channels or drainage channels used to irrigate the crops was return flow additionally except for the backbone water source of the zhanghe reservoir 44 54 of the a i w c o g in the ysd watershed came from the ponds inside the ysd watershed under multiyear average conditions therefore monitoring only the amount of irrigation water passing through the canals of the backbone water sources to calculate the aiwc in multi source irrigation systems will result in relatively large error nevertheless there are many water sources such as ponds and river channels distributed in multi source irrigation systems in which the water intake for irrigation was sporadic and difficult to measure which made the measurement of the aiwc in multi source irrigation systems difficult the modified swat model can simulate and calculate the aiwc from different water sources in each year and can therefore effectively calculate the a i w c o g in irrigation systems in addition it could be seen in table 2 that the i r f r of the ysd watershed accounts for 6 49 of the a i w c o g under multiple years conditions which meant that the Î· i was 6 49 thus the i r f r was the reuse of irrigation water within the irrigation system not the amount of water redrawn from outside the irrigation system therefore the i r f r should be deducted from the improved aiwc of the irrigation system that is for the ysd watershed the improved total aiwc was the a i w c n e w g of 1023 104 m3 not the a i w c o g of 1094 104 m3 and the former was 93 51 of the latter in this way in the multi source irrigation systems in southern china managers of irrigation systems should use the more representative a i w c n e w g instead of a i w c o g which overestimates the aiwc of irrigation systems this paper argues that the improved aiwc of an irrigation system does not include the i r f r which is equal to the traditional aiwc minus the i r f r as shown in eq 7 the a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g can be linked to the traditional irrigation efficiency i e 0 guo 1997 huffman et al 2013 and the new irrigation efficiency considering the reuse of return flow i e r wu et al 2019c according to the description of two irrigation efficiency definitions by wu et al 2019c the numerator of both irrigation efficiencies is the net irrigation water consumption w s and the denominator of i e 0 is a i w c o g and the denominator of i e r is a i w c n e w g the modified swat model can effectively and relatively accurately simulate the w s of the whole irrigation system and a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g can be obtained by the calculation framework in this study so i e 0 and i e r can be directly calculated in addition the traditional water saving potential w s p 0 and the water saving potential considering the reuse of return flow w s p r wu et al 2019c can be directly calculated in this study as follows 17 w s p 0 a w i c o g b a w i c o g a 18 w s p r a w i c n e w g b a w i c n e w g a where the superscripts b and a represent before and after the application of the water saving approaches moreover there are differences in aiwcs under different scenarios for example climate change will lead to changes in irrigation water requirements wang et al 2017 the calculation framework can predict the aiwcs under climate change thereby providing decision support for irrigation managers to develop future water use plans the aiwc under different water saving scenarios can also be estimated and according to the simulation results the effect of water saving measures can be evaluated guiding the direction of future water saving transformation finally the aiwc of irrigation systems can be calculated by this calculation framework for many years and can therefore provide the basis for the statistical analysis of aiwc over large areas such as provinces and even all of china chen et al 2020 4 conclusion a calculation framework was proposed in this paper for calculating the aiwcs in multi source irrigation systems and it consisted of a modified swat model wu et al 2019a b a method for calculating i r f r wu et al 2019b and a definition and calculation of the aiwc from different water sources in this calculation framework the aiwc was classified as a i w c r c h a i w c p n d and a i w c r e s according to the types of water sources and the difficulty of measurement and the improved aiwc was defined as the traditional aiwc minus the i r f r the modified swat model was used to estimate the traditional aiwc from different water sources and the method proposed by wu et al 2019b was used to calculate i r f r finally the improved aiwc can be obtained the calculation framework was applied to the ysd watershed in the zis in southern china results showed that the modified swat model could effectively simulate the hydrological processes and estimate the traditional aiwc and the method proposed by wu et al 2019b could reasonably calculate the i r f r in the ysd watershed the aiwc values in ysd watershed were also calculated and analyzed results showed that the total aiwc a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g and i r f r of the irrigation system increased as the degree of drought increased and that the a i w c n e w g was less than the a i w c o g because of the reuse of return flow furthermore in terms of a multi source irrigation system in southern china except for the backbone water source a large part of the a i w c o g came from ponds and other water sources and the i r f r should not be considered as a part of the aiwc of the irrigation system therefore for accuracy managers of irrigation systems should use the more representative a i w c n e w g instead of the a i w c o g declaration of competing interest

10354,this study proposed a calculation framework to reasonably and effectively calculate the agricultural irrigation water consumption aiwc and reused irrigation return flow i r f r in multi source irrigation systems based on the modified soil and water assessment tool swat the calculation framework was applied in the yangshudang ysd watershed in southern china over the years results showed that total aiwc and i r f r of the irrigation system increased as the degree of drought increased the improved total aiwc a i w c n e w g which considered the reuse of return flow is less than the traditional total aiwc a i w c o g in addition to the backbone water source of the zhanghe reservoir 44 54 of the a i w c o g of the ysd watershed came from ponds inside the ysd watershed under multiyear average conditions the i r f r accounted for 6 49 of the a i w c o g and the a i w c n e w g accounted for 93 51 of the a i w c o g for accuracy and management this calculation framework and improved aiwc are suggested to be used in the multi source irrigation systems keywords calculation framework agricultural irrigation water consumption multi source irrigation system modified swat reuse of return flow 1 introduction the water resources bulletin is an important government document that counts and records the amount of water resources water storage dynamics water consumption water quality of rivers and lakes and important water events in each province in china in the previous years to improve the quality of the water resources bulletin and support the assessment of the most stringent water resource management system in china it is necessary to measure or calculate the total water consumption agricultural water consumption is a very important part of the total water consumption for example in china agricultural water consumption accounts for 60 of the total water consumption chang et al 2017 hence the estimation of agricultural water consumption is of utmost significance for determining the total water consumption furthermore the agricultural irrigation water consumption aiwc accounts for a large part of agricultural water consumption e g 90 in china and 92 in canada beaulieu et al 2007 therefore the accurate estimation of aiwc is vital to improve the accuracy of the determination of the total water consumption irrigation systems are the basic objects of aiwc estimation hu et al 2018 currently the estimation of aiwc is mainly based on a typical survey in china the typical survey mainly focused on the observed irrigation quota and the actual irrigation area since the traditional aiwc for an irrigation system is equal to the product of the irrigation quota and the irrigation area huffman et al 2013 shen et al 2016 the accuracy of this method depends on the number and representativeness of typical surveys in southern china there are multi source irrigation systems that involves a combination of reservoirs ponds and canals those multi source irrigation systems are named as melons on a vine irrigation system guo 1965 crop irrigation is characterized by a high degree of randomness when taking water from different water sources in these systems wang and zheng 2016 wu et al 2019b in addition the reuse of return flow is very common in multi source irrigation systems because of the spatial variability of land uses soil types and water source conditions in multi source irrigation systems it is difficult to calculate the aiwc from the sources to irrigation areas in view of this modeling is an effective method to estimate the aiwc in complex irrigation systems especially in multi source irrigation systems in southern china there are many models that can be used to simulate irrigation water use in irrigation systems among them many field scale models have been used by some researchers to simulate irrigation water use qureshi et al 2002 li et al 2017 however these models can only use water from a single water source therefore it is not appropriate to use field scale models to estimate the aiwc of irrigation systems especially in multi source irrigation systems some statistical methods have also been used to simulate aiwc for example zai et al 2009 used the least squares support vector machine method to predict the aiwc of a canal irrigation system ma et al 2012 used multiple linear regression models and back propagation bp neural network models to simulate the net irrigation water consumption in farming areas these methods are mainly used for forecasting aiwc in future years and require models to be built based on statistical aiwc data from many years for the complex multi source irrigation systems in southern china it is difficult to guarantee the reliability of historical aiwc data since they did not distinguish aiwc from different water sources in previous years considering the spatial heterogeneity of multi source irrigation systems distributed hydrological models are excellent tools to simulate the water balance in a river basin or an irrigation system the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 have been applied in many irrigation systems with good prospects xie and cui 2011 dai et al 2016 to effectively simulate irrigation water consumption some researchers modified the automatic irrigation module in the swat model for other specific goals chen et al 2018 uniyal and dietrich 2019 considering the hydrological characteristics and irrigation behavior in multi source irrigation systems in southern china wu et al 2019a b added a multi source auto irrigation module to calculate the aiwc from different water sources which provides an effective way to estimate the aiwc in multi source irrigation systems the reuse of return flow is very common in irrigation systems wang and cui 2011 especially in multi source irrigation systems however aiwc calculated in previous studies does not take the reuse of return flow into account after water is transferred from a water source e g a reservoir to fields for irrigation the irrigation return flow enters drainage channels ponds or other water storage facilities through surface runoff deep percolation and lateral seepage those return flows can be reused for irrigating fields downstream the i r f r should not be considered as a part of the true aiwc of the irrigation systems therefore the true aiwc of multi source irrigation systems and the reused irrigation return flow i r f r need to be defined and calculated separately there are some studies focused on the estimation of return flow and the amount reused zulu et al 1996 mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 chien and fang 2012 ha et al 2017 wu et al 2019b also proposed a method that can effectively calculate the i r f r well in multi source irrigation systems in this study considering the spatial heterogeneities and the reuse of return flow in multi source irrigation systems a calculation framework is proposed to provide an effective method for the calculation of the true aiwc and the aiwc from different water sources in a multi source irrigation system the framework is composed of a modified swat model wu et al 2019a b a method for calculating i r f r wu et al 2019b and a classification and definition of aiwc the ysd watershed in the zhanghe irrigation system zis in southern china is evaluated as a study case for the application of this calculation framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 modified swat model description swat is a continuous time spatially semi distributed physically based model arnold et al 1998 the watershed is divided into multiple subbasins based on the digital elevation model dem which are then further subdivided into specific soil land use slope characteristic units that are called hydrological response units hrus in order to completely represent the characteristics of the irrigation system and simulate its hydrological processes more reasonably especially the multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice in southern china some researchers modified or developed some modules of swat in terms of the paddy field water balance simulation in swat xie and cui 2011 considered that the area of a paddy field was equal to that of an hru covered by paddy rice and the evapotranspiration et of paddy field was calculated by stages namely the impounded stage and the non impounded stage a technique with three critical depths the maximum fitting depth h max the minimum fitting depth h min and the maximum allowable depth of impoundment after rainfall h p was introduced by xie and cui 2011 to control the irrigation and drainage of paddy field in addition dai et al 2016 had also made some modifications to the paddy field water balance simulation in swat a crop coefficient k c was introduced to compute the et of paddy field and a water utilization coefficient of the canal system Î· c a n a l was introduced to calculate the canal seepage loss and the calculation of lateral flow in paddy fields was added to swat furthermore wu et al 2019a b integrated the abovementioned developments of paddy field water balance and proposed a multi source auto irrigation module for swat producing a modified swat model suitable for the simulation of hydrological processes in multi source irrigation systems the relationship among these developments or modifications is shown in fig 1 the multi source auto irrigation module of modified swat model could be used to simulate the aiwcs from different water sources in multi source irrigation systems the subbasins are used as the analysis objects first the water sources and their orders are specified for each subbasin generally the river channel and ponds inside the subbasin are the first and second water sources respectively and other water sources e g reservoirs or water sources outside the watershed are designated the third water source the fourth water source etc all hrus belonging to the same subbasin have the same irrigation water sources and orders second according to the irrigation conditions of the hrus covered by upland crops and hrus covered by paddy rice when they occur the irrigation water requirements are calculated third the water stored in the specified water sources is fetched to irrigate crops growing in hrus from the first water source to the last one finally the aiwcs from different water sources can be obtained by summing the irrigation amount according to the type of water source 2 2 description of the method for calculating reused irrigation return flow in multi source irrigation systems after irrigation the irrigation return flow mainly enters ponds and river channels and is reused when the water in the ponds and river channels is extracted to irrigate fields according to the characteristics of multi source irrigation systems wu et al 2019b proposed a method to calculate the i r f r based on the modified swat model the detailed description is as follows 1 the multi source auto irrigation module of the modified swat model can simulate and output the irrigation amounts from different water sources for each hru by summing the irrigation amounts from ponds i o p n d and that from river channels i o r c h of each subbasin can be obtained moreover the modified swat model can also simulate and output the irrigation return flow into the ponds i r f p and that into the river channels i r f r for each hru on the day of irrigation the i r f p and i r f r of each subbasin can be obtained by summing the values of the hrus 2 the subbasins are used as the analysis objects to determine the i r f r which is divided into two parts namely the reused irrigation return flow into ponds and into river channels i r f p r and i r f r r respectively for one subbasin i r f p r takes the minimum value of i o p n d and i r f p in the same way the i r f r r also takes the minimum value of i o r c h and i r f r considering that the river channels establish connections between the upstream and downstream subbasins when the i r f r r is less than i r f r in the upstream subbasin some of the return flow of the upstream subbasin will flow out and be used in the downstream subbasin which is considered when calculating i r f r r in the downstream subbasin 3 according to the above steps we can obtain the i r f p r and i r f r r of each subbasin and sum them to obtain the reused irrigation return flow into ponds and into river channels throughout the whole irrigation system i r f p r a l l and i r f r r a l l respectively and these values can then be combined to obtain the reused irrigation return flow of the whole irrigation system i r f r a l l 2 3 calculation framework for agricultural irrigation water consumption 2 3 1 classification of agricultural irrigation water consumption the multi source irrigation systems in southern china have many large or small reservoirs and ponds distributed in the irrigation system generally large and medium sized reservoirs are the backbone water sources in irrigation systems and water is conveyed to the fields through a canal system currently most reservoir management departments monitor the amount of water released from reservoirs for irrigation by monitoring facilities ponds are usually distributed near fields and farmers usually pump water from ponds to fields to irrigate crops or directly dig a ditch to introduce water into fields for irrigation taking water from ponds for irrigation is highly random and it is very difficult to measure this portion of the water in addition there are many river channels or drainage channels in multi source irrigation systems and farmers also intercept this water to irrigate the fields near river channels this part of the water consumption is also difficult to measure in summary the water sources in multi source irrigation systems in southern china can be classified as measurable backbone water sources such as large and medium sized reservoirs from which the water consumption can be measured and ponds and river channels from which the water consumption is difficult to measure therefore according to the types of water sources the aiwc is classified as the aiwc from river channels a i w c r c h the aiwc from ponds a i w c p n d and the aiwc from backbone water sources such as large and medium sized reservoirs a i w c r e s 2 3 2 definition of agricultural irrigation water consumption traditionally the total aiwc of an irrigation system is equal to the sum of the irrigation water taken from various water sources which is defined here as the traditional aiwc the traditional aiwc includes the i r f r but the i r f r itself is generated because of irrigation so it should not be counted as a part of the aiwc the i r f r should be subtracted from the traditional aiwc therefore regarding the combination of the types of water sources in the multi source irrigation systems in southern china the following definitions and relations are presented 1 a i w c o g a i w c o r c h a i w c o p n d a i w c o r e s where a i w c o g a i w c o r c h a i w c o p n d and a i w c o r e s represent the traditional aiwc from all water sources river channels ponds and large and medium sized reservoirs respectively m3 considering the reuse of return flow the improved aiwc of an irrigation system is defined as follows 2 a i w c n e w g a i w c n e w r c h a i w c n e w p n d a i w c n e w r e s where a i w c n e w g a i w c n e w r c h a i w c n e w p n d and a i w c n e w r e s are the improved aiwc from all water sources river channels ponds and large and medium sized reservoirs respectively which consider the reuse of return flow m3 for multi source irrigation systems after irrigation the irrigation return flow mainly enters ponds and river channels and is reused when the water in the ponds and river channels is taken to irrigate fields wu et al 2019b for large and medium sized reservoirs the irrigation area is usually downstream of the reservoirs so the irrigation return flow rarely enters the reservoirs therefore the following relations can be stated 3 i r f r a l l i r f p r a l l i r f r r a l l 4 a i w c n e w p n d a i w c o p n d i r f p r a l l 5 a i w c n e w r c h a i w c o r c h i r f r r a l l 6 a i w c n e w r e s a i w c o r e s 7 a i w c n e w g a i w c o g i r f r a l l where i r f r a l l is the reused irrigation return flow of an irrigation system m3 and i r f p r a l l and i r f r r a l l are the reused irrigation return flow into ponds and river channels respectively of an irrigation system m3 2 3 3 calculating agricultural irrigation water consumption based on the spatial data of the irrigation system meteorological data farmland management measures and other data the modified swat model can be used to set up a distributed hydrological model of the irrigation system the modified swat model divides the irrigation system into multiple subbasins and for each subbasin its irrigation amounts from different water sources can be obtained by simulating the hydrological processes of the irrigation system with the modified swat model these irrigation amounts are traditional irrigation amounts since the reuse of return flow is not considered based on the simulation outputs of the modified swat model wu et al 2019b proposed a method to calculate the return flow and the reused amount which can be used to calculate the reused irrigation return flow into ponds and that into river channels in each subbasin see section 2 2 therefore considering the reuse of return flow according to the definitions described above the new irrigation amounts in each subbasin can be calculated as follows 8 i i n e w p n d i i o p n d i r f p i r 9 i i n e w r c h i i o r c h i r f r i r 10 i i n e w r e s i i o r e s where i is the number of subbasins i i n e w p n d and i i o p n d are the new and traditional irrigation amounts respectively from ponds in subbasin i m3 i i n e w r c h and i i o r c h are the new and traditional irrigation amounts respectively from river channels in subbasin i m3 i i n e w r e s and i i o r e s are the new and traditional irrigation amounts respectively from large and medium sized reservoirs in subbasin i m3 and i r f p i r and i r f r i r are the reused irrigation return flows into ponds and into river channels respectively in subbasin i m3 thus the aiwc and i r f r of the whole multi source irrigation system are as follows 11 i r f r a l l i 1 n i r f p i r i r f r i r 12 a i w c n e w p n d i 1 n i i n e w p n d 13 a i w c n e w r c h i 1 n i i n e w r c h 14 a i w c o p n d i 1 n i i o p n d 15 a i w c o r c h i 1 n i i o r c h 16 a i w c n e w r e s a i w c o r e s i 1 n i i o r e s where n is the total number of subbasins in the irrigation system finally the a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g can be calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 2 4 study area a typical multi source irrigation system the ysd watershed was chosen as the study area which was located in the zis of hubei province china the ysd watershed is enclosed by the third main canal of the zis in the northeast the first tributary canal of the third main canal in the west and a small branch canal in the southeast as shown in fig 2 and it is a relatively closed small watershed with an area of approximately 43 3 km2 a subtropical continental climate with an annual average temperature of 17 c a maximum temperature of 40 9 c and an annual mean rainfall of 821 mm in the study area the mainland includes paddy fields dry lands and forests of which the paddy fields account for approximately 60 of the area as shown in fig 3 the soil type is predominantly yellow brown earth paddy soil in the study area crops such as rice cotton and rapeseed are cultivated rice is the main irrigated crop and an intermittent irrigation mode is used for its irrigation 2 5 swat model setup calibration and validation 2 5 1 model setup according to the dem of the study area with a 25 m resolution as shown in fig 3 and setting the ysd reservoir as the outlet of the ysd watershed the study area was divided into 10 subbasins as shown in fig 2 then the 10 subbasins were subdivided into 105 hrus based on the land cover types as shown in fig 3 soil type distribution and slopes a hydrological distributed model for the study area was set up with the modified swat model the meteorological data from 1986 to 2017 pond parameters and other data were input to the model in which the irrigation and drainage of the hrus covered by paddy rice were controlled by the h max h min and h p in the different growing stages of paddy rice which were obtained from the tuanlin experimental station in addition according to the actual conditions of the ysd watershed the irrigation water sources and the sequence for the hrus covered by paddy rice in each subbasin were set as follows the internal river channels of the subbasin ponds and the zhanghe reservoir the water in the zhanghe reservoir was conveyed to the ysd watershed for irrigation through the three main canals of the zhanghe reservoir and the first tributary canal of the third main canal while the water in the river channels and ponds was directly pumped to irrigate nearby fields therefore two different traditional irrigation efficiency ie0 values were set for the different water sources these values were ie01 0 90 for the local water sources river channels and ponds and ie02 0 65 for the zhanghe reservoir which were provided by the tuanlin experimental station a detailed description of the modeling process and data is presented in the references wu et al 2019a 2 5 2 model calibration and validation according to a survey from the staff of the zhanghe reservoir and elderly farmers in the ysd watershed the land cover and planting structure of the ysd watershed have remained basically unchanged for the last 30 years therefore after calibration and validation based on the observed data the distributed hydrological model of the study area can not only effectively simulate the hydrological processes occurring in years when the hydrological elements were observed but also can simulate the hydrological processes of the other years in terms of the study area compared with the previous research by wu et al 2019a b in this paper some observed data from 2016 to 2017 were added to calibrate and validate the modified swat model specifically the observed data used in this paper were as follows 1 the observed daily discharge series of the ysd watershed outlet in the paddy rice growth period from 2005 to 2009 and that from 2016 to 2017 which were observed at temporary hydrometric stations fig 1 from 2005 2009 a temporary hydrometric station was set up by tuanlin experimental station at the ysd watershed outlet the discharge was measured per 2 h and the average of the measured discharges in every day was taken as the observed discharge for that day then the temporary hydrometric station was damaged and there was no observational data from 2010 to 2015 until 2016 due to experimental needs another temporary hydrometric station was installed at the same location to observe the discharge during the paddy rice growth period 2 the observed daily et series in the paddy rice growth period in an experimental paddy field located in tuanlin experiment station from 2007 to 2008 which were measured through lysimeters of 2 m 2 m and that in another experimental paddy field located in no 4 subbasin as shown in fig 2 from 2016 to 2017 which were measured through measuring cylinders with a diameter of 618 mm for the lysimeters and measuring cylinders the impermeable layers were set at their bottom and the depth of water layer or soil moisture content in the lysimeter or measuring cylinder was measured at 8 00 a m every morning because of the impermeable layer there was basically no seepage and the precipitation was also observed every day the daily et was calculated by the water balance equation 3 the observed aiwc from local water sources namely river channels and ponds in the ysd watershed and the zhanghe reservoir from 2005 to 2008 which were provided by the management bureau of zis this department obtained the aiwc from local water sources in the ysd watershed through investigations and reports from farmers and obtained the aiwc from zhanghe reservoir through monitoring facilities set up at the third main canal of the zis and the first tributary canal of the third main canal and the observed irrigation amounts in the experimental paddy field located in the no 4 subbasin in 2016 and 2017 which were obtained through field water balance experiments the filed water level was observed and recorded in the experiment paddy field during the paddy growth period when the field water layer was lower than the h min the experimental paddy field was irrigated through a water pipe and a water meter was installed on the water pipe to record the irrigation amount each time with the coefficient of determination r2 santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the relative error re gupta et al 1999 as the objective functions using 2005 2009 as the calibration period the observed daily discharge series of the ysd watershed outlet in 2005 2009 the observed daily et series in 2007 2008 and the observed aiwc from local water sources and the zhanghe reservoir in 2005 2008 were used to calibrate the modified swat model for the study area via the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 and manual tuning parameters method notably the observed aiwc is the traditional aiwc and the traditional aiwc from local sources a i w c o l o c a l is the sum of a i w c o r c h and a i w c o p n d furthermore after calibration and the completion of an acceptable simulation of the daily discharge the daily et and aiwc in the corresponding years the observed daily discharge series in 2016 to 2017 the observed daily et series in 2016 to 2017 and the observed irrigation amounts in the experimental paddy field located in no 4 subbasin in 2016 and 2017 were used to validate the modified swat model in the same modeling environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation results after calibration and validation the simulation processes of daily discharges and daily et and the simulation results of aiwc in the calibration period 2005 2009 are basically similar to those of the reference wu et al 2019a so the detailed processes in the calibration period can be seen in the reference further the comparison of the observed values and simulated values in the validation period 2016 2017 were shown in figs 4 6 figs 4 6 showed that the daily discharge daily et and irrigation amounts simulated by the modified swat model were generally in good agreement with the observed values that is the modified swat model could effectively simulate the hydrological processes in the study area however from fig 4 there were lager errors between the simulated discharges and the observed values in some periods the main reason for this phenomenon was that the modified swat model controlled irrigation and drainage via the h max h min and h p and assumed that the h max h min and h p were same in the whole ysd watershed and that all paddy fields in the same hru were irrigated or drained on the same day however in actuality there were certain differences in the h max h min and h p of different paddy fields and the farmers might irrigate or drain the paddy fields on different days therefore to more truly reflect the actual situation of human activities in irrigation systems the in depth development of the modified swat model on paddy rice irrigation and drainage should continue to be carried out additionally fig 5 showed that the modified swat model underestimated et from september 1 10 in 2016 corresponding to the ripening dry stage of paddy rice growth stage this underestimation occurred because the modified swat model assumed that the paddy field was in the non impoundment stage once there was water it would be drained immediately resulting in a gradual decrease in the soil water content in contrast the experimental paddy field retained a small amount of water in the first few days of this period so the simulated et was lower than the observed values regarding the irrigation amount simulation in previous research wu et al 2019a used only the total observed aiwcs from local water sources and the zhanghe reservoir in the whole ysd watershed and the data were not sufficiently detailed in this paper the observed irrigation amounts in an experimental paddy field were added to verify the simulation of irrigation amounts in the small scale area of an hru and the results from fig 6 showed that the irrigation amounts in small scale areas could also be simulated well which further proved that the modified swat model could effectively simulate the irrigation amounts of fields and the aiwc of irrigation systems to further demonstrate the performance of the model simulation the calibration and validation evaluations for daily discharge daily et aiwc and irrigation amounts were shown in table 1 the results in table 1 further showed that the hydrological processes and aiwc in multi source irrigation systems could be simulated effectively with the modified swat model in addition wu et al 2019b compared the calculated irrigation return flow with the measured the result suggested that the method they proposed can be used to calculate the irrigation return flow in multi source irrigation systems in other words the method proposed by wu et al 2019b can be combined with the modified swat model to calculate the true aiwc from different water sources in multi source irrigation systems namely a i w c n e w r c h a i w c n e w p n d a i w c n e w r e s and a i w c n e w g 3 2 statistics and analysis of agricultural irrigation water consumption 3 2 1 agricultural irrigation water consumption in different hydrological years with 1986 1987 set as the warm up period the modified swat model was used to simulate the hydrological processes of the ysd watershed from 1988 to 2017 after calibration and validation in particular the multi source auto irrigation module was used to simulate the irrigation amounts of each hru covered by paddy fields in the ysd watershed based on the irrigation simulation results of hrus covered by paddy fields the traditional aiwc from different water sources in the ysd watershed was statistically obtained then based on the simulation outputs of the modified swat model the method proposed by wu et al 2019b was used to calculate the i r f r a l l of the ysd watershed finally the improved aiwc was calculated using eqs 1 7 we ranked the rainfall amount from large to small during the paddy rice growth period in the study area from 1988 to 2017 and calculated the rainfall frequency the traditional aiwc the i r f r a l l and the improved aiwc were calculated in three hydrological years which were the wet year of 2004 rainfall frequency is 10 the normal year of 2002 rainfall frequency is 50 and the dry year of 2010 rainfall frequency is 90 and the results were shown in fig 7 the following conclusions can be derived from fig 7 1 in different hydrological years the total aiwc both a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g of the irrigation system increased as the degree of drought increased because there was more rainfall in wet years which reduced the lack of water in paddy fields so the irrigation water demand during the whole growth period was lower in contrast the opposite situation was observed for dry years for the normal years the situation was halfway between the two conditions in addition a i w c n e w g was less than a i w c o g because of the reuse of return flow 2 regarding the aiwc from local water sources that is the sum of the aiwc from river channels and the aiwc from ponds in different hydrological years the same pattern as the total aiwc was not observed this difference occurred because the water in the local water sources was mainly from rainfall and the change in the amount of water in the local water sources during the whole crop growth period was related to the distribution of rainfall over time which directly affected the availability of water from local water sources when crops need irrigation it was possible that the wet years were due to several heavy rain events during periods with heavy rain the local water sources were abundant but the crops did not need irrigation at this time however many days after rains when crops need irrigation the local water supply was reduced and the water in the large and medium sized reservoirs needed to be taken to supply irrigation in normal years if rainfall was evenly distributed during the crop growth period the water in the local water sources can be used more for irrigation in dry years the amount of water in local water sources was generally low because of little rainfall which caused the aiwc from local water sources to also be small 3 in different hydrological years the i r f r of the irrigation system also increased as the degree of drought increased because with an increase in drought the number of irrigations and the amount of irrigation water would increase which caused the return flow produced by irrigation to increase so the i r f r increased accordingly 4 fig 7 also showed that the a i w c n e w r c h was zero in the ysd watershed combined with eq 5 we could see that the a i w c o r c h was equal to the i r f r r in the ysd watershed the reason was that the river channels in the ysd watershed were basically drainage channels and the water in the drainage channels came from rainfall or irrigation that is the a i w c o r c h was derived from the return flow the a i w c o r c h was less than the total irrigation return flow so the a i w c o r c h was equal to the i r f r r 3 2 2 water supply ratios of different water sources to analyze the composition of the a i w c o g and the relationship between a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g the water supply ratio of a water source was defined as the percentage of the aiwc from this water source in the a i w c o g in the irrigation systems where the aiwc from the water source considered the reuse of return flow e g a i w c n e w p n d and a i w c n e w r c h and the irrigation water reuse rate Î· i was defined as the percentage of the i r f r in the a i w c o g in the irrigation systems according to the simulation results from 1988 to 2017 with the modified swat model the annual averages of the a i w c n e w r c h a i w c n e w p n d a i w c n e w r e s a i w c n e w g i r f r a i w c o g Î· i and the annual averages of the water supply ratio of different water sources of the ysd watershed were calculated the results are shown in table 2 table 2 showed that the crop irrigation in the ysd watershed was mainly supplied by the ponds inside the ysd watershed and the zhanghe reservoir the a i w c n e w r c h in the ysd watershed was zero because the water in river channels or drainage channels used to irrigate the crops was return flow additionally except for the backbone water source of the zhanghe reservoir 44 54 of the a i w c o g in the ysd watershed came from the ponds inside the ysd watershed under multiyear average conditions therefore monitoring only the amount of irrigation water passing through the canals of the backbone water sources to calculate the aiwc in multi source irrigation systems will result in relatively large error nevertheless there are many water sources such as ponds and river channels distributed in multi source irrigation systems in which the water intake for irrigation was sporadic and difficult to measure which made the measurement of the aiwc in multi source irrigation systems difficult the modified swat model can simulate and calculate the aiwc from different water sources in each year and can therefore effectively calculate the a i w c o g in irrigation systems in addition it could be seen in table 2 that the i r f r of the ysd watershed accounts for 6 49 of the a i w c o g under multiple years conditions which meant that the Î· i was 6 49 thus the i r f r was the reuse of irrigation water within the irrigation system not the amount of water redrawn from outside the irrigation system therefore the i r f r should be deducted from the improved aiwc of the irrigation system that is for the ysd watershed the improved total aiwc was the a i w c n e w g of 1023 104 m3 not the a i w c o g of 1094 104 m3 and the former was 93 51 of the latter in this way in the multi source irrigation systems in southern china managers of irrigation systems should use the more representative a i w c n e w g instead of a i w c o g which overestimates the aiwc of irrigation systems this paper argues that the improved aiwc of an irrigation system does not include the i r f r which is equal to the traditional aiwc minus the i r f r as shown in eq 7 the a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g can be linked to the traditional irrigation efficiency i e 0 guo 1997 huffman et al 2013 and the new irrigation efficiency considering the reuse of return flow i e r wu et al 2019c according to the description of two irrigation efficiency definitions by wu et al 2019c the numerator of both irrigation efficiencies is the net irrigation water consumption w s and the denominator of i e 0 is a i w c o g and the denominator of i e r is a i w c n e w g the modified swat model can effectively and relatively accurately simulate the w s of the whole irrigation system and a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g can be obtained by the calculation framework in this study so i e 0 and i e r can be directly calculated in addition the traditional water saving potential w s p 0 and the water saving potential considering the reuse of return flow w s p r wu et al 2019c can be directly calculated in this study as follows 17 w s p 0 a w i c o g b a w i c o g a 18 w s p r a w i c n e w g b a w i c n e w g a where the superscripts b and a represent before and after the application of the water saving approaches moreover there are differences in aiwcs under different scenarios for example climate change will lead to changes in irrigation water requirements wang et al 2017 the calculation framework can predict the aiwcs under climate change thereby providing decision support for irrigation managers to develop future water use plans the aiwc under different water saving scenarios can also be estimated and according to the simulation results the effect of water saving measures can be evaluated guiding the direction of future water saving transformation finally the aiwc of irrigation systems can be calculated by this calculation framework for many years and can therefore provide the basis for the statistical analysis of aiwc over large areas such as provinces and even all of china chen et al 2020 4 conclusion a calculation framework was proposed in this paper for calculating the aiwcs in multi source irrigation systems and it consisted of a modified swat model wu et al 2019a b a method for calculating i r f r wu et al 2019b and a definition and calculation of the aiwc from different water sources in this calculation framework the aiwc was classified as a i w c r c h a i w c p n d and a i w c r e s according to the types of water sources and the difficulty of measurement and the improved aiwc was defined as the traditional aiwc minus the i r f r the modified swat model was used to estimate the traditional aiwc from different water sources and the method proposed by wu et al 2019b was used to calculate i r f r finally the improved aiwc can be obtained the calculation framework was applied to the ysd watershed in the zis in southern china results showed that the modified swat model could effectively simulate the hydrological processes and estimate the traditional aiwc and the method proposed by wu et al 2019b could reasonably calculate the i r f r in the ysd watershed the aiwc values in ysd watershed were also calculated and analyzed results showed that the total aiwc a i w c o g and a i w c n e w g and i r f r of the irrigation system increased as the degree of drought increased and that the a i w c n e w g was less than the a i w c o g because of the reuse of return flow furthermore in terms of a multi source irrigation system in southern china except for the backbone water source a large part of the a i w c o g came from ponds and other water sources and the i r f r should not be considered as a part of the aiwc of the irrigation system therefore for accuracy managers of irrigation systems should use the more representative a i w c n e w g instead of the a i w c o g declaration of competing interest
