8530,study region the annually flooded barotse floodplain in the upper zambezi river basin in the western province of zambia southern africa study focus discharge variability plays a significant role in inundation extent and thus it controls habitat conditions of river channels and the linked wetlands the linkage between discharge and inundation extent in the barotse floodplain allowed us to analyse the trends in extent overtime using optical satellite imagery modis the desert flood index a surface water extraction algorithm was used to generate time series of inundation extent for validation of the inundation extent we used a flood mask extracted from a supervised classification land cover map using landsat imagery the land cover map was validated using the error matrix method with ground truthed data the estimated inundation extent time series enabled us to test the inundation correlation with discharge and water level using pearson r correlation a parametric statistical test based on the established correlation we used the mann kendall a non parametric test to analyse trends in the inundation extent and discharge and water level time series from which we made inferences on the direction of the historical trend in inundation extent new hydrological insights for the region the results revealed that there is observable inter annual variability in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain with prominent differences demonstrated in both the flood ascending peak and receding period for the period 2003 2013 the results indicated a rising trend in inundation extent with a mann kendall z statistic of 1 71 and increase in magnitude of 33 1 km2 at significance level alpha of 0 05 strong correlations between inundation extent and water level and between inundation extent and discharge with correlation coefficients of determination of 0 86 and 0 89 respectively were observed for the period 2000 2011 water level time series showed a rising trend with the mann kendall z statistic of 2 97 and increase in magnitude of 0 1 m at significance level alpha of 0 05 overall during the period 1952 2004 discharge in the floodplain showed a declining trend with mann kendall z statistics of 2 88 and 3 38 at the inlet and outlet of the floodplain respectively by correlation inference the overall inundation extent trend in the floodplain was in a downward movement rainfall and discharge variability high evapotranspiration and the changes in the land cover use in the catchment of the floodplain are largely the factors affecting the observed variability and trends in inundation extent in the floodplain the presented remote sensing based approach significantly reduces the need for the expensive and time limiting traditional physical field based wetland inundation mapping methods that form a limitation for achieving progress in wetland monitoring especially in open and sparsely gauged floodplains such as the barotse keywords desert flood index discharge floodplain inundation extent modis remote sensing 1 introduction ecosystem functions and associated services in wetlands are determined by inundation dynamics degroot et al 2006 thus implications of wetland inundation on water wetland policies and management are immense changes in temporal and spatial dynamics of wetland inundation may be an important indicator of the modifications in the functioning of wetland ecosystem erwin 2009 clare and creed 2014 kingsford et al 2016 there is a recognition of the significance of wetlands at regional level as it concerns nutrient export to surface waters greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity foster et al 2012 therefore monitoring of wetlands has taken on a heightened relevance erwin 2009 however the complexities in assessing the spatial and temporal regimes make it extremely challenging to make the necessary observations for deepened understanding of the inundation dynamics and the potential implications on wetland ecosystems of the various flow components stisen et al 2008 erwin 2009 in the zambezi basin this challenge is compounded by inadequate and dilapidated hydro meteorological stations cohen et al 2014 including time and financial resource limitations associated with traditional field survey wetland mapping methods in many cases this problem is so severe that even the application of conventional prediction tools is severely limited in this part of africa cohen et al 2014 the application of satellite based remote sensing techniques in inundation extent assessments provides an important and expanded avenue for data collection on the dynamic state of inundation especially for vast wetlands where ground based methods are virtually impractical schumann et al 2007 ticehurst et al 2014 with the advantage of area coverage spatial resolution regular revisit time temporal resolution and acquisition of data in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum spectral resolution the remote sensing approach is best suited for study of inundation dynamics as compared to conventional mapping methods ticehurst et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 a host of satellite sensors are currently generating enormous amounts of data at various resolutions that form the core for both historical and continued monitoring of inundation regimes and other landforms among the vast spectrum of uses earth observation based data has increasingly become an important source of information for water use planning monitoring and management at various levels of management such as field catchment and regional scale mu et al 2007 though some studies related to floodplain inundation mapping using satellite imagery have previously been conducted in zambia e g tiger initiative 2008 aduah and mantey 2012 meire 2012 cai et al 2015 only one publication cai et al 2015 in public domain was done in the barotse floodplain however the landsat imagery used by cai et al 2015 imposed a limitation on the number of time series they could generate and compare which affected their analysis of the variations in inundation extent furthermore none of the studies attempted to statistically analyse trends in floodplain inundation extent and the correlation with flow and water level the need to further understand the within season and inter annual variations in inundation and how it relates to discharge water level motivated this study to use a different and simple satellite remote sensing and statistical analysis approach to add to the existing knowledge on the inundation dynamics in the barotse floodplain for inundation extent mapping the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis data presents a better option for large wetland inundation mapping ticehurst et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 despite the inherent limitation of cloud cover modis is seen as a better option because all historical data from 2000 to the present are readily available for free it has near global spatial coverage 250 m 1 km a better temporal scale 1 2 times day and can easily be processed with most available satellite imagery data processing computer software ticehurst et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 for mapping of open water features with optical satellite imagery the use of indices is the most common practice baig et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 various spectral based water features extraction indices have been developed and include the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1973 normalised difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 modified normalised difference water index mndwi xu 2006 automated water extraction index awei feyisa et al 2014 and the desert flood index dfi developed by baig et al 2013 the ndwi developed by mcfeeters 1996 and the mndwi by xu 2006 are the most utilised water feature extraction indices baig et al 2013 however baig et al 2013 discovered that under all the experimental conditions they subjected the dfi and mndwi the dfi performed better the performance assessment of the two indices was carried out on modis and landsat images in a flooding season of the indus river in pakistan the dfi focuses on more precision in the calculation of water proportion at sub pixel level and the increasing of the contrast between water and non water features the other multi band based indices such as the ndwi and the mndwi are focused on differentiating the water body from the non water body information by using pixel scales instead of the proportion of the water area which critically affects precision in water information extraction wang 2007 baig et al 2013 based on the nature of the study area and the focus of our study modis imagery and the dfi were seen as better options and that the modis imagery were readily available furthermore the statistical approach sought to augment our understanding of the interaction between inundation discharge and water level however climate and hydrological data such as discharge and water level are known to be non normal hence statistical characterisation is normally done using non parametric statistical tests hirsch and helsel 2002 to detect change point s and trends in hydrological data the pettit and the mann kendall are commonly used non parametric tests hirsch and helsel 2002 the pettit 1979 homogeneity test approach is a common non parametric application in change point detection studies involving hydrological or climate series pohlert 2014 hirsch and helsel 2002 the mann kendall test possesses advantage over other tests because it does not need the data to be normally distributed and has low sensitivity to abrupt changes due to inhomogeneity in time series data hirsch and helsel 2002 to assess relationships between variables the pearson s r is the most used measure of correlation it is sometimes referred to as the linear correlation coefficient because of its measure of linear association between two variables hirsch and helsel 2002 in this paper we therefore describe results of the mapping of extent of inundation in the barotse floodplain using modis satellite imagery and the desert flood index we estimate inundation extent observe both within season and inter annual patterns and establish correlations of inundation extent with discharge and water level furthermore we make inferences on the overall trend in inundation extent based on the trends in discharge and water level following the objectives i to quantify the inundation extent for within and across season at different stages of flooding in the floodplain ii to ascertain correlation of inundation extent with discharge and water level in the floodplain iii to detect historical change points in the means of discharge and water level time series for the given periods and iv to assess historical trends in the time series of inundation extent discharge and water level in the floodplain 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site the barotse floodplain is a relatively flat plateau which stretches from lukulu at the confluence of the zambezi with kabompo river in the north to senanga in the south fig 1 a stretch of about 230 km timberlake 1997 iucn 2003 fanshawe 2010 it is geographically located between 13 and 17 south and 22 24 east of western zambia southern africa the suggestion is that the floodplain formed as a result of tectonic lift williams 1986 though the precise nature of the uplift is not well understood the elevation over the floodplain ranges from 1192 m above sea level in the north eastern part at lukulu to about 900 m above sea level in the southern part at senanga to the south around the ngonye falls the hard rock has resulted in the impoundment of the river above the falls this is because the rock has resisted the river s tendency to cut a channel down into it and thus acts more like a dam behind it the floodplain has formed the low relief of the area possibly disrupted these drainages with lines of dambos and pans marking original courses however below the falls the river falls nearly twice as fast as it does on the plain and flows more swiftly in a narrower valley less prone to flooding moore et al 2007 the floodplain averages 30 km width along most of its length and is about 50 km at the widest north of mongu town the western province headquarters situated at its edge estimates have put the main body of the floodplain at 5500 km2 though the maximum flooded area is approximated at 10 750 km2 when the floodplains of the several tributaries such as the luena flats are taken into account timberlake 1997 iucn 2003 the barotse floodplain is generally covered by the kalahari sands extending from lukulu to downstream of senanga moore et al 2007 fanshawe 2010 the annual inundation in the area is influenced by the zambezi river and its tributaries such as the lungwebungu and the luanginga emanating from the lungwebungu and luanginga basins in angola as well as the kabompo river from the kabompo basin in north western zambia fig 1 much of the discharge into the barotse floodplain is from upstream in angola and north western zambia which receives an average of above 1000 mm of rainfall rainfall over the barotse floodplain catchment is a result of the movements of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz between october and april of a hydrological year considerable variability in rainfall occurs across the catchment with very high inter annual variability in rainfall coefficient of variation 0 35 iucn 2003 fanshawe 2010 beilfuss 2012 mean annual potential evapotranspiration across the barotse basin is 1560 mm with potential evaporation exceeding rainfall during every month of the calendar year beilfuss 2012 phiri 2013 the floodplain experiences peak in inundation about 3 months after the peak of the rainy season up to 1500 mm of rain falls over the headwater catchments of the zambezi each year in january february by april the flood normally has reached its peak and recedes in may to july when grasses rapidly grow on the exposed plain iucn 2003 fanshawe 2010 baidu forson et al 2014 2 2 materials 2 2 1 satellite images modis and landsat the mod09a1 and landsat 8 oli tirs level 1t imagery used in this study were accessed from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa via the internet portal glovis http glovis usg gov the shape file covering the study area was used to cut out and download mod09a1 data for the years 2003 2013 as well as the june 6th 2015 imagery the 7th of june 2015 landsat 8 oli tirs data were downloaded from scenes at paths 174 176 with rows at 070 071 the modis is designed for acquisition of large scale global dynamics measurements the modis mod09a1 data provides surface reflectance bands 1 7 table 1 at 500 m resolution in an 8 day gridded level 3 product in the sinusoidal projection each pixel in the level 3 product mod09a1 contain the best possible l2g observation during an 8 day period it has high observation coverage low view angle absence of clouds or cloud shadow and aerosol loading vermote et al 2011 and has been espoused as suitable for mapping floodplain inundation ticehurst et al 2013 modis bands 1 2 4 and 6 baig et al 2013 were used in this study since the focus of our study included the rainy season which is prone to cloud cover on most days the eight day revisit time was deemed adequate for the purposes landsat 8 oli tirs on the other hand have a relatively higher spatial resolution 30 m than modis but with a longer revisit time 16 days which proved difficult to generate sufficient data sets for adequate time series analysis of inundation extent very few cloud free landsat imagery were available during the flooding period the landsat images available during the flood season differed on the dates they were acquired each year hence the decision to settle for modis imagery which had several images available on the same dates each year the modis imagery data made it possible to compare inundation extent on each particular day of the year across the years however taking advantage of its spatial resolution and the ground truthing process the landsat 8 oli tirs data was used to validate inundation extent as detected by modis landsat 8 oli tirs has 11 bands ranging from the costal aerosal to the thermal infra red 2 table 2 landsat 8 oli tirs bands 4 5 6 and 7 were used in the study 2 2 2 field data collection three field surveys were conducted during the study the first two were reconnaissance surveys carried out in february rainy season and june dry season in 2014 during which data to derive training data regions of interest for the supervised land cover classification was collected the data collected included flooded grassland river channels settlements crop fields and various vegetation types including forests the survey was done in mongu senanga kalabo and lukulu districts involving all immediate upland areas in the catchment of the floodplain during the same time daily water level and discharge data sets for senanga and lukulu gauge stations fig 1 were obtained from the department of water resources development mongu western zambia both gauge stations are operated manually discharge and water level is recorded three 3 times daily at 6 h intervals 06 00 am 12 00 am and 06 00 pm during the flooding period at senanga gauge station some of the water from the floodplain passes over and above the main channel where the gauge is located the second field survey was done in june 2015 after carrying out the land cover classification the month of june in zambia is the best time to conduct land cover classification exercise because during this period it is easy to differentiate the various land cover classes this is a transition period between the wet and dry season mukosha 2014 thus the survey was done to collect ground truthed data to validate the june 2015 land cover classification map as well as the june 2015 mod09a inundation mask we decided to compare the june 2015 modis and landsat imagery inundation masks data sets based on the same land cover scenarios this was critical for assessing the accuracy of the modis inundation mask 2 3 data pre processing 2 3 1 radiometric calibration of landsat 8 oli tirs the raw landsat 8 oli tirs imagery was calibrated to reflectance product as recommended by song et al 2001 chander and markham 2003 lillesand et al 2004 and usgs 2015 using the first line of sight atmospheric analysis of hypercubes flaash atmospheric correction module acm cooley et al 2002 envi user s guide 2009 in envi 5 1 radiance was calculated using the radiometric calibration tool in envi 5 1 the data was inputted using the meta data mtl txt file the output interleave was set to band interleaved by line bil format the output data type was set to float point data the scaling factor was automatically set at 0 1 to obtain an atmospheric corrected reflectance product the radiance file was inputted in the flaash atmospheric calibration module the module automatically inputs some parameters from the radiance image while other parameters such as the flight date and time and ground elevation had to be manually inputted atmospheric model was set to tropical aerosal model to rural aerosal retrieval was automatically set to 2 band k t kaufman tanre method the input parameters differed from scene to scene all reflectance products had values between 0 and 1 bands 4 5 6 and 7 were used the reflectance images were then mosaicked and used in the land cover classification using the supervised classification method with the maximum likelihood algorithm 2 3 2 data validation for water level and discharge time series the water level and discharge time series were tested for outliers using the dixon test hirsch and helsel 2002 the years with missing data were not included in the analysis 3 methods 3 1 quantification of inundated area quantification of inundated area was done by first detecting the inundated area validation of the detected inundated area and thereafter all pixels detected to have been inundated were quantified 3 1 1 detection of inundated area with modis and landsat imagery the desert flood index dfi baig et al 2013 was used to detect inundated area from modis mod09a1 imagery the indices were first stretched to an output range of between 0 and 1 the otsu method otsu 1979 performed in matlab was used to generate threshold values from the stretched greyscale images dfi indices the threshold values ranged between 0 3 and 0 7 the resultant threshold values were then used to extract binary masks binary masks were obtained for all imagery examined for each year 3 1 2 validation of inundation extent maps validation of the inundation extent maps was done with a ground truth based five class land cover classification map from the june 2015 landsat 8 oli tirs imagery generated with the maximum likelihood algorithm lillesand et al 2004 ahmad and quegan 2012 in envi 5 1 validation of the landsat 8 oli tirs land cover classification map was done using the error matrix method lillesand et al 2004 a minimum of 50 ground truth points per class the number of points increasing with the size of land cover classes were generated using the stratified method a total of 350 points for ground truthing were generated the shape file of the generated ground truthing points in envi 5 1 where converted to a compatible format keyhole markup language klm file in arcgis 10 3 for use in the trimble juno 3d global position system gps and google earth software a hybrid method of obtaining ground truth data was used in which field generated and google earth software based data were combined to validate the classification a handheld trimble juno 3d differential gps with accuracy level of 2 5 metres was used to pick coordinates in the field during the field work campaign in june 2015 a total of 10 points for each class was validated based on actual ground data while the rest of the points for each class were validated using high resolution google earth software with the image for the month of june the 10 ground based data were used as control for the google earth data the mask from the class flooded area regularly flooded vegetation from the validated june 2015 land cover classification was generated using the raster calculator in arcgis 10 3 the june dfi binary mask and the binary mask from the land cover classification were then compared 3 1 3 pixel based quantification of inundated area after validation of the inundation extent map the number of inundated pixels from the binary masks were obtained from the attribute table the estimates of inundated area were obtained by multiplying the number of inundated pixels with the pixel size of mod09a1 which is 0 25 km2 the mean annual inundation extent was obtained by averaging inundation extent values of the six 6 days considered for each year the days used to get the annual means were three 3 from the ascending peak period days 089 097 and 105 and three 3 from the receding period days 113 121 129 we used the year 2004 to exemplify the annual inundation pattern because it recorded the highest daily peak inundation extent and had more days with cloud free images compared to other years during the period 3 2 correlation of inundation extent with discharge and water level the pearson r was used to ascertain the extent to which inundation extent discharge and water level correlated pearson s r is the most commonly used measure of correlation it is sometimes referred to as the linear correlation coefficient because of its measure of linear association between two variables hirsch and helsel 2002 the pearson r correlation test was applied after the data sets were tested for outliers and homogeneity hirsch and helsel 2002 3 3 assessment of change points in discharge and water level time series we used the pettit 1979 homogeneity test approach a common non parametric application in change point detection studies involving hydrological or climate series which are known to be non normal data pohlert 2014 hirsch and helsel 2002 when the change point was found significant the time series were divided into two parts at the location of the change point the pettit test was then conducted on the time series from which the change was detected hirsch and helsel 2002 3 4 assessment of trends in the time series the mann kendall trends test hirsch et al 1982 hamed and rao 1998 sirois 1998 hirsch and helsel 2002 salmi et al 2002 was used to detect trends in the mean monthly and annual time series of inundation extent discharge and water level the tests for trends in the time series were based on the results of the pettit homogeneity test pettit 1979 each period was tested for trends based on the detected change point in the time series hirsch and helsel 2002 the discharge time series were for the inlet lukulu gauge station and outlet senanga gauge station water level time series were for the outlet of the floodplain at senanga refer to fig 1 for location of gauge stations the five years two for senanga station and three for lukulu station with missing mean annual discharge data were not included in the trends analysis 4 results 4 1 quantification of inundated area 4 1 1 detection of inundated area with modis and landsat imagery the modis false colour composite image fig 2 a showed the extent of inundation in the floodplain the dfi algorithm produced grey scale images with values between 1 and 1 fig 2b which were stretched to values between 0 and 1 fig 2c from which the binary masks fig 2d were obtained after application of the otsu threshold value 4 1 2 validation of inundation extent maps the ground truth results showed a generally good agreement between the classification and the real world with an overall accuracy of 86 29 percent and a kappa statistic of 0 83 table 3 segments of landsat 8 oli tirs red and mod09a1 blue flood masks for the month of june 2015 obtained on the 06th and 07th of the month respectively were compared fig 3 landsat and modis have different capture and revisit times the inundation extent on 7th june 2015 under mod09a1 was at 1356 km2 while inundation extent for landsat 8 oli tirs on the 6th of june 2015 was 1 341 71 km2 which was a difference of 14 29 km2 the accuracy percentage between the dfi generated inundation extent mask and the maximum likelihood classification validated with ground truthing data was 98 95 the difference in inundated area could be attributed to the differences in the spectral and spatial resolutions of landsat 8 oli tirs and modis data as well as the methods used to extract the inundation extent masks for instance landsat has a spatial resolution of 30 m by 30 m while the mod09a1 used has a 500 m by 500 m resolution 4 1 3 pixel based quantification of inundated area quantification of the detected inundated area was pixel based as shown in the calculations for the year 2004 in table 4 the calculated estimates of inundated area for each year in the period 2003 2013 are given in attachment 1 in the supplementary material maximum peak flow inundation extent was observed on day 105 at 5572 25 km2 while the minimum low flow inundation extent was observed on day 161 at 233 50 km2 peak inundation was observed between days 097 and 105 then starting to steadily decline from day 113 inundation extent starts to increase from day 305 in november table 4 which is at the start of the rain season 4 1 4 variations in inundation extent inundation extent maps fig 4 showed that the first areas to be inundated were also the first to have the floods recede and the last areas to be inundated were last to have the flood recede for instance on day 033 the upstream and the middle part of the floodplain was more flooded than the downstream fig 4 on the other hand day 169 showed receded inundation in the upstream while the middle and downstream areas were still inundated this phenomenon indicates differences in the onset and recession of inundation within the floodplain instigated by various geological and spatial variables in the floodplain i e the constriction of the floodplain at the outlet at senanga gives the floodplain a dam like nature that affects the rate of outflows which affects inundation behaviour the inter annual variations in inundation extent across the period 2003 2004 were clearly visible fig 5 and attachment 6 in the supplementary material the inter annual variations were more visible during the receding period i e from day 113 to day 345 fig 5 and attachment 6 in the supplementary material at peak period for daily inundation extent we estimated maximum and minimum inundation extent in the barotse floodplain at about 5572 km2 in 2004 day 105 and 2595 25 km2 in 2005 day 089 attachment 1 in the supplementary material the rest of the years had daily peak inundation extent oscillate between the two values as for the mean annual inundation extent the variations were clearly discernible fig 6 based on the estimated inundation extents the year 2003 had the highest while the year 2005 had the lowest mean annual inundation extent fig 6 the calculations of the mean annual inundation extent were based on the cloud free images available in each year which differed from year to year as shown in attachment 1 in the supplementary material 4 2 correlation of inundation extent with discharge and water level the inundated area and the outflow at senanga gauge station for the year 2004 were significantly correlated throughout the year with correlation coefficient of 0 94 and a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 89 with p value 0 01 at alpha of 0 05 table 5 and fig 7 a when compared water level with inundation extent showed a similar relationship as was the case with discharge with a coefficient of correlation r of 0 93 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 86 table 5 and fig 7b the correlation scatter plots are as shown in attachment 2 in the supplementary material the interpretation is that inundation extent increases or decrease with increase or decrease in discharge and water level in the floodplain 4 3 assessment of change points in discharge and water level time series the pettit homogeneity test showed that there were changes in the mean monthly and annual discharge at the two hydrometric stations assessed lukulu and senanga stations showed changes in the mean monthly values in the same year but different months may 1981 and july 1981 respectively and december 1997 for both stations table 6 the difference in the months in which the change in the mean monthly discharge occurred can be attributed to the time lag in the movement of water from lukulu to senanga for lukulu station at confidence level of 99 percent with p value 0 01 a change point was observed in may 1981 from 846 52 m3 month 1 to 614 97 m3 month 1 after the change another change point in february 1991 from a mean monthly value of 647 38 m3 month 1 to 606 15 m3 month 1 was observed a final upward change point was observed in december 1997 from 487 02 m3 month 1 to 888 70 m3 month 1 table 6 for senanga gauge station mean monthly discharge time series only one significant abrupt change was observed in july 1981 from a mean monthly discharge of 1065 m3 month 1 to 828 48 m3 month 1 detected at 99 percent confidence with the computed p value of 0 01 table 6 since the mean monthly values were based on the hydrological year october to september the changes in the mean monthly values of discharge at the two stations occurred in the same hydrological year 1981 significant downward abrupt changes were observed in mean annual discharge time series at both lukulu and senanga gauge stations during the same period as was in the mean monthly time series table 6 and fig 8 a b significant downward change point in the monthly means of water level at senanga gauge station was observed in july 1981 from 2 61 m to 2 13 m for lukulu station an abrupt change in the mean annual discharge was observed in the hydrological year 1980 1981 from a mean of 810 42 m3 year 1 to 604 66 m3 year 1 at senanga station a downward abrupt change was observed in the 1979 1980 hydrological year from 1078 00 m3 year 1 to 873 26 m3 year 1 the changes in the 1997 mean annual discharge for senanga and in 1998 for lukulu were not adequate to register significance at alpha level 0 05 table 6 the mean annual water level change point was the same with the discharge change point at senanga gauge station table 6 the mean annual discharge time series showed similar time space for abrupt changes as exhibited in the mean monthly discharge time series overall significant abrupt changes in the monthly and mean annual rate of discharge were observed in the hydrological years 1979 1980 and 1981 1982 and showed a downward trend 4 4 assessment of trends in the time series 4 4 1 seasonal mann kendall trends analysis for discharge for lukulu station data no significant trends in the mean monthly discharge were observed in the segmented periods 1967 1981 1982 1997 and 1998 2003 however there was a significant downward trend with a kendall statistic of 0 21 with computed p value 0 05 between the time space 1967 and 2003 table 7 further investigations with the fitting of the linear regression with ordinary least squares revealed insignificant upward trends for the periods 1967 1981 1982 1997 table 7 significant downward trend was noted for the overall period 1967 2003 with slope coefficients of 0 03 and r2 of 0 03 table 8 the overall trend for monthly discharge at lukulu station for the period 1967 2003 was downward for senanga station the mann kendall trends test detected no significant trend in the mean monthly discharge time series for the periods 1967 1981 and 1982 2004 the kendall statistic and the computed p values for the two periods were 0 09 0 12 and 0 44 0 10 respectively table 7 above with computed p values 0 05 in all scenarios the h0 that there was no trend in the data was accepted however the overall mann kendall test for the period 1967 2004 detected a significant downward trend the kendall statistic and the computed p value for this period were 0 23 and 0 05 respectively table 7 above the computed p value was less than 0 05 the h0 was therefore rejected and the ha that there was a trend in the discharge time series was accepted fitting of the linear regression with ordinary least squares revealed a downward trend for the 1952 1981 with a slope coefficient of 0 04 and r2 of 0 01 table 8 above the periods 1982 2004 had a slope coefficient of 0 02 and r2 of 0 01 which indicated an upward trend overall 1967 2004 had a slope coefficient of 0 02 and r2 of 0 01 which indicated a downward trend in the time series generally the trends in the mean monthly flows for the period 1967 2003 4 for both lukulu and senanga stations were downward 4 4 2 trends analysis for mean annual time series of inundation extent discharge and water level for the period 2003 2013 the mann kendall trends test showed a significant rising trend in inundation extent with z statistic of 1 71 and p value 0 05 at significance level alpha 0 05 the magnitude of trend as given by the sens slope was 33 10 km2 table 9 fig 9 and attachment 3 in the supplementary material for the period 2000 2011 water level time series showed a significant rising trend with z statistic of 2 67 with p value 0 05 at alpha level 0 5 table 9 fig 10 and attachment 4 in the supplementary material the trend in water level is very similar to the trend in inundation extent for the period discharge data for the period 2003 2013 was not available while water level data was only available up to 2011 for the period 1952 1979 senanga station mean annual discharge time series attachment 5 in the supplementary material had no significant trend p value of 0 56 and no significant trend from 1980 to 2004 p value of 0 74 however when the entire period 1952 2004 was considered there was a significant trend with a z statistic value of 3 38 a p value of 0 05 at alpha level 0 001 with an annual rate of decrease in discharge of 6 94 m3 year 1 table 7 above fig 11 a for lukulu station upstream of the wetland there was no significant trend in discharge during the period 1952 1980 or the period 1981 2003 for the period 1952 2003 however there was a significant downward trend with a z statistic value of 2 88 p value of 0 05 at alpha level of 0 01 with an annual rate of decrease of 4 68 m3 year 1 table 7 above fig 11b for the period 1952 2004 the observed general trend in mean annual discharge in the floodplain both inflows and outflows was downward 5 discussion remote sensing provides an affordable and expanded platform for mapping inundation one of the most essential abiotic characteristics of wetlands across the landscape ticehurst et al 2014 several studies have demonstrated that modis imagery can be used to map wetland inundation meire 2012 baig et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 in this study we demonstrate that modis generated data can be utilised to show variability and trends in wetland inundation as well as be used with ground based data to highlight interlinkages with key variables such as discharge and water level 5 1 detection of inundation extent with modis and the dfi first despite the cloud scenario during the rainy season the temporal resolution of modis made it possible to generate sufficient time series for analysis this is in contrast with other freely available optical satellite data sets such as landsat we noted that few cloud free modis images were available during the ascending period as compared to the receding period fig 12 and attachment 1 in the supplementary material this is because unlike during the ascending period there is an overall reduction in the number of rain days during the flood receding period hence fewer days with cloud cover the challenge of cloud cover is an inherent attribute of optical satellite data such as modis which has been noted by many wang 2007 di baldassarre 2012 meire 2012 ticehurst et al 2014 proud et al 2011 ticehurst et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 although ticehurst et al 2013 observed that some temporal information is lost when mapping wetland inundation with the composite 8 day interval with the mod09a1 product the temporal loss was considered not to be significant because the flooding in the barotse floodplain can be assumed as not fast flowing as it takes about four 4 to six 6 weeks for flood water to move from the floodplain inlet at lukulu gauge station to the outlet at senanga gauge station kasimona and makwaya 1995 considering that this study sought to assess the trend across the years and not necessarily within a flooding season the 8 day interval mod09a1 product was adequate while a number of studies have indicated the difficulty in ascertaining inundation extent in vegetated areas schumann et al 2007 baig et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 the degree to which vegetation affects the mapping of inundation is dependent on several factors such as the structure and density of vegetation and the relative size of the area covered by vegetation and water silva et al 2008 byrd et al 2014 furthermore a same piece of vegetation would give two different spectral signatures when subjected to dry and inundated conditions to this extent the barotse floodplain is largely an open grassland with intermittent vegetation of biomass standing above flood water moreover other than the observable visual differences between non inundated and the inundated vegetation in the floodplain the spectral signatures are also different for instance the spectral separability graph for the regions of interest used in the supervised land cover classification in this study showed different spectral signatures between inundated grassland and the dry grassland additionally the multi temporal nature of our study within and across seasons further enabled us to differentiate between inundated and none inundated areas we observed that ground based surveys enhances satellite imagery based inundation mapping as it provides insight on some aspects that may be overlooked if no ground data is available for example we observed that in the case of the barotse floodplain most areas with grass thickets and trees were inundated with high water levels fig 13 furthermore the floodplain has a generally flat terrain which ensures that most of the floodplain is virtually flooded except in raised platforms such as hills the challenge of capturing inundation under vegetation cover is one of the issues the developers of the desert flood index wanted to minimise with the dfi we observed that there is a clear distinction in the intensities of between inundated vegetation i e grassland and non inundated vegetation this was visible across the annual seasons i e during wet and dry seasons from this study we learned that having prior knowledge of the study area and the validation of satellite imagery mapped inundation extent provides basis for acquiring fairly accurate wetland inundation information from satellite imagery i e modis 5 2 quantification of inundated area across seasons and correlations 5 2 1 quantification of inundated area at peak period we estimated maximum and minimum inundation extent in the barotse floodplain at about 5572 km2 in 2004 day 105 and 2595 25 km2 in 2005 day 089 attachment 1 in the supplementary material the estimation is within the documented annually inundated area of 5500 km2 for the main floodplain at peak flood iucn 2003 beilfuss 2012 cai et al 2015 for instance cai et al 2015 estimated the maximum and minimum inundated area at about 5520 km2 and 2500 km2 respectively the difference in the estimated inundated area between the two studies could be due to the delineation of what were termed as the barotse floodplain the type of imagery and the date of capture as well as methods used in each study in this study we delineated and estimated inundation extent based on what is commonly regarded as the main barotse floodplain fig 1 cai et al 2015 used landsat imagery and the supervised classification method to extract inundated area furthermore we observed that the otsu threshold values for the receding period were low as compared to the ascending peak period this possibly resulted in both under and overestimation of inundation extent this challenge can be observed starting from day 177 which showed varying extents during the receding period and the dry season may october attachment 1 in the supplementary material baig et al 2013 also experienced the challenge of low threshold values with the dfi which made them manually obtain the values from the dfi grayscale image thus the dfi produce better threshold values and more accurate inundation delineation during the ascending and peak flood period when there is a lot of water than during the receding period when there is less water the estimated inundation extent by this study demonstrates that modis and the dfi can be used as an effective approach to delineate and quantify open wetland inundation especially during the high flood period 5 2 2 correlations of inundation extent with discharge and water level what has been documented is that inundation in the barotse floodplain is as a result of the discharge of the zambezi river and its tributaries that the discharge is largely dependent on the rainfall pattern in the upper catchment of the floodplain iucn 2003 fanshawe 2010 beilfuss 2012 according to naiman et al 1995 and sparks 1995 variations in stream flow regimes is the most serious and continuous threat to ecological sustainability of rivers and their associated wetlands anchored on the highlighted linkages we sought to show the statistical correlation extent of the inundation and the discharge water level in the barotse floodplain despite the non availability of gauge inflow data for all tributaries of the zambezi river and the non quantification of evapotranspiration and other potential loses we observed that inundation extent in the barotse floodplain had high correlations coefficients of determination of 0 89 and 0 86 with discharge and water level respectively these observations are regardless of the time lag between rainfall in the upper catchment and discharge in the floodplain fig 14 peak rainfall in the upper catchment is between december and february but peak discharge is in march april for instance the 1998 used for illustrative purpose only kabompo meteorological station in the barotse floodplain catchment rainfall time series and the lukulu discharge time series show the time lag between peak rainfall and peak discharge there is a four to six weeks time lag for discharge between lukulu and senanga kasimona and makwaya 1995 the lukulu senanga discharge time lag is brought about by the processes of inundation in the floodplain the travel distance between the two gauge stations and the constriction at senanga s ngonye falls which slows the movement of water from the floodplain moore et al 2007 kasimona and makwaya 1995 this is because the constriction at senanga acts like a dam releasing given quantities of water as the inundation recedes in the floodplain thus the lukulu senanga discharge time lag and the constriction at senanga results in a time lag between inundation extent and discharge water level i e fig 7 above based on the established correlation of inundation and discharge water level we note that factors affecting flows into the barotse floodplain will directly impinge inundation as well 5 2 3 variations and trends in inundation extent cai et al 2015 showed that there are inter annual variations in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain however the landsat imagery they used imposed a limitation on the amount of both within season and mean annual time series they were able to generate and thus compare across years in this study in affirmation with cai et al 2015 we show that there are variations in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain but with increased number of both mean annual and within season inundation extent time series clearly revealing the variability figs 5 and 12 above fig 15 and attachment 6 in the supplementary material in this regard our study underscores the advantage of modis over landsat imagery in large wetland inundation mapping as recommended by ticehurst et al 2014 from the comparison of daily inundation extent across seasons we observed that no single day of the year had same inundation extent for the entire 2003 2013 period examined fig 5 above and 15 during the period 2003 2013 we observed a rising trend in inundation extent with a magnitude of 33 10 km2 this implies that there was generally an increasing trajectory in inundated area during the period 2003 2013 which was also observed in the trend for water level for the same period and driven by factors such as rainfall and discharge however based on the inundation extent with discharge correlation the overall inundation trajectory for the 1952 2004 period was downward 5 3 change points and trends in discharge and inferred trends in inundation extent 5 3 1 change points and trends changes in stream discharge volumes has consequences on the ecological health of rivers and their associated wetlands naiman et al 1995 sparks 1995 we observed significant changes in the mean annual discharge of the zambezi river in the barotse floodplain for instance a major change in mean annual discharge between 1952 and 2004 occurred in 1981 from 1078 to 873 26 m3 year 1 and 810 42 604 66 m3 year 1 at senanga and lukulu gauge stations respectively these changes translated to about 19 and 25 percent reduction in the mean annual discharge at senanga and lukulu stations respectively the 1981 abrupt change in flows was also observed by beilfuss 2012 for the entire zambezi basin despite the upward change in the mean annual discharge values in 1997 at lukulu gauge station the change value was lower than the before 1981 mean discharge values the observed change points are likely to be due to climate change and land cover use change factors in the floodplain catchment however it is also possible the changes were due to the shifts in the gauge sites and the reference points and may not necessarily be due to climate and anthropogenic variables nonetheless what is critical is that since the observed 1981 change in discharge was also detected by beilfuss 2012 for the entire zambezi river basin the most probable variables responsible for the change are climate change and the changes in land cover use in the catchment of the floodplain furthermore there is generally low runoff efficiency low drainage densities and relatively high aridity in the catchment beilfuss 2012 these variables indicate a high sensitivity to climate change the rainfall runoff process is non linear thus a small change in annual precipitation or annual potential evaporation have a large impact on annual river flows beilfuss 2012 therefore climate change is a more probable cause of the observed abrupt change rather than the change in measurement systems the change was in a downward direction which meant a reduction in the amount of water into the floodplain generally the trend in the means of the annual inflow and outflows in the floodplain showed a downward trajectory revealed by the mann kendall test results therefore by the correlation of the inundation extent with discharge as ascertained by this study inundation in the barotse floodplain had been in the same downward trajectory over the period 1952 2004 moreover the indication by some barotse floodplain residents spoken to was that the inundation extent had changed for instance the farmers at sefula irrigation scheme in the floodplain mentioned that some areas that used to flood some decades ago no longer floods this observation by the farmers is in tandem with the findings of this study concerning the downward trend in flows into the floodplain that the farmers mentioned to have noticed the changes some decades ago could go to validate the 1981 significant change point made by this study 5 3 2 potential contributing factors to the observed variations and trends in inundation noting the correlation between inundation extent and discharge water level as established by this study the influence of rainfall on discharge variability paul et al 2006 kim et al 2012 and the impact of discharge variability on inundation extent naiman et al 1995 sparks 1995 the observation is that rainfall variability in the catchment is crucial in the inundation dynamics of the barotse floodplain several studies have explored rainfall variability in the zambezi basin jain 2007 thurlow et al 2009 yamba et al 2009 beilfuss 2012 for the entire zambezi basin beilfuss 2012 ascertained inter annual variability in rainfall with a high coefficient of variation of 0 35 other studies with focus on the agro ecological regions of zambia put the rainfall variability in region iii representative of the zambezi headwaters between 0 09 0 15 coefficients of variation i e 0 09 for thurlow et al 2009 and 0 15 for yamba et al 2009 the 2010 2070 rainfall variability projected by yamba et al 2009 seem to align with the 0 15 historical 1967 2007 value however at zambian regional level all studies conclude that in any given year normal rainfall is not guaranteed in any of the regions of zambia at the zambezi basin level beilfuss 2012 could not determine long rainfall variability because of the spatial and temporal nature of the variability on the other hand the regional study by christensen and hewitson 2007 projected a reduction in rainfall over southern africa based on the interlinkage between rainfall discharge and inundation it is expected that rainfall variability in the catchment of the barotse floodplain will continue to influence inundation extent thus the timing and consistency of the rains in the headwaters catchments of the zambezi the timing and volumes of flow of the zambezi river and its tributaries will bring about variations in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain additionally the floodplain is located in a region with high rates of evapotranspiration kasimona and makwaya 1995 beilfuss 2012 phiri 2013 which affects rainfall and discharge and could cut into the residence time of the water thereby affect the inundation extent the projection is that evapotranspiration in the zambezi basin will increase by 10 25 rate over the next 100 years arnell 1999 as cited in beilfuss 2012 therefore it is expected that high rate of evapotranspiration will continue to affect inundation in the barotse floodplain other than the high rainfall variability and the high evapotranspiration beilfuss 2012 phiri 2013 the annual rainfall and discharge quantities are declining for instance kampata et al 2008 used the mann kendall test to analyse trends in rainfall in the headstreams of the zambezi river basin they analysed rainfall time series between 1945 and 2005 for kabompo kasempa mwinilunga kaoma and mongu meteorological stations they concluded that there was no evidence of significant trends in the annual rainfall at 0 05 significance level for all the individual stations as the computed z statistics were found to be less than the critical value of 1 96 however they indicated that although the trends are not significant the rainfall is generally decreasing as evident from the negative values of the mann kendall statistics s furthermore the observation by kampata et al 2008 is in tandem with the overall scenario analyses for southern africa by frich et al 2002 new et al 2005 and christensen and hewitson 2007 which indicate reduction in rainfall through the mann kendall trends test we have shown that the mean monthly and mean annual discharge values are declining the results of the discharge trends analysis in our study therefore is in tandem with the highlighted rainfall scenarios for the headstreams of the zambezi river basin and for southern africa in general additionally changes in land cover use in particular due to deforestation has been cited as one of the major contributors to wetland degradation mainly through increased catchment erosion and nutrient loading blumenfeld et al 2009 changes in land cover use have taken place in the upper zambezi basin simwinji 1997 timberlake 1997 timberlake 2000 fanshawe 2010 mukosha 2014 which are likely to have contributed to catchment erosion and increased sediment yield into river channels and the floodplain thus it is plausible that land cover use changes in the catchment of the floodplain is affecting inundation extent in the barotse floodplain however beilfuss and santos 2001 argued that land use and land cover changes are unlikely to have had a significant effect on zambezi runoff patterns kasimona and makwaya 1995 also argued that the zambezi headwaters region covered by relatively infertile kalahari sands is frequently burned and cleared for small agricultural plots machambas but retains dense forest cover over most of the region beilfuss and santos 2001 further argued that water diversions are currently negligible relative to the mean annual flow and unlikely to affect runoff patterns in the near future what is critical to note is that land cover use is not statistic and thus many significant changes with potential to impact on flows and sedimentation in the floodplain could have taken place especially with the increased mining activities in the upstream of the floodplain s catchment in north western zambia 5 3 3 implications of the correlation s based on the correlations of inundation extent with discharge and water level established by this study the inference is that the downward upward trend in discharge water level are mirrored in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain the ipcc 2001 paul et al 2006 and kim et al 2012 point to how climate variables such as increased temperature and rainfall variability will impact on wetlands globally through changes in water quantity and quality according to the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 blumenfeld et al 2009 and woodward et al 2014 understanding the interlinkages between wetlands changes in land cover and use and between climate and hydrological variables such as discharge rainfall and temperature is crucial to the management of water resources in general and wetlands in particular hence the downward trend in discharge into the floodplain will have impact on the quantity and quality of water in the barotse floodplain which will consequently impact its ecological health and the other system services and livelihood streams it sustains 5 4 study limitations the challenge of cloud cover affected the time series available for analysis especially for the ascending period which is during the high rainfall period thus if the focus is to analyse the ascending flood patterns the ideal method would be to use imagery data sets other than the modis product we used which are not affected by the cloud cover factor i e synthetic aperture radar data however compared to other freely available optical satellite imagery such as landsat we find modis to be able to provide more cloud free images and thus more inundation extent time series for analysis the dfi produced low threshold values for the receding period hence proved a challenge to estimate inundation extent with low water levels and disconnected water pools this potentially contributed to the high variability observed during the receding period i e especially after day 177 when the main flood waters had receded and also during the dry season i e june october this is likely to have contributed to either overestimation or underestimation of the daily and the overall mean annual inundation extent values this is why when ascertaining the 2003 2013 trend we only used days 089 up to day 129 to estimate the mean annual inundation extent i e to ensure homogeneity in the assessed inundation extent time series however fig 6 was generated from the means generated from all daily inundation extent values in each year our experience with the dfi is that it produces better threshold values and hence more accurate inundation extent results during high flood periods the mean annual discharge time series had some missing values at both lukulu and senanga gauge stations this has potential to affect the accuracy of the mann kendall trends results and consequently the inferred historical inundation extent trend however collaborative evidence as revealed in the rainfall trends for the zambezi river basin goes to affirm the result of our study concerning the overall downward trend in mean annual discharge time series in the barotse floodplain 6 conclusions i the study has demonstrated that wetland inundation at different stages can be effectively delineated and quantified using modis imagery and the desert flood index for instance we were able to delineate and quantify different inundation stages within and across seasons with the highest peak inundation extent observed in 2004 at 5572 25 km2 while the lowest extent was observed in the year 2005 at 2595 25 km2 furthermore with modis imagery more inundation extent time series for a relatively adequate analysis can be generated overall the satellite based approach employed in this study when used together with ground based data provides an affordable avenue that can be utilised to overcome the challenge of inadequate and dilapidated hydrometric stations for monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics the approach can contribute availability of data on wetland inundation dynamics in zambia and the southern africa as a region where such data are scanty due to poor wetland inundation data capture systems ii the inter annual variability in inundation extent is clearly evident in the barotse floodplain with prominent differences demonstrated in the flood receding period more than in the ascending peak period the inter annual variability in inundation extent i e especially as observed during the receding period is a key parameter in managing crop and livestock productivity in the barotse floodplain iii very strong relationship exists between inundation extent and discharge water level the pearson correlation coefficient of inundation extent and water level was 0 93 while discharge and inundation extent showed a coefficient of 0 94 with coefficients of determination of 0 86 and 0 89 respectively this implies that trends in inundation extent are mirrored in trends of discharge water level and the reverse holds true iv during the period 1952 to 2004 there were significant abrupt changes in both mean monthly and mean annual values of discharge in the barotse floodplain for instance lukulu station experienced a major change point in the mean monthly values in the month of may 1981 from 846 52 m3 month 1 to 614 97 m3 month 1 after the change another change point was observed in february 1991 from a mean monthly value of 647 38 m3 month 1 to 606 15 m3 month 1 a final change point was in december 1997 from 487 02 m3 month 1 to 888 70 m3 month 1 for senanga gauge station only one significant abrupt change was noted in july 1981 from a mean monthly discharge of 1065 m3 month 1 to 828 48 m3 month 1 as regards abrupt changes in the mean annual values of discharge lukulu station experienced a significant change in the hydrological year 1980 1981 from a mean of 810 42 m3 year 1 to 604 66 m3 year 1 senanga station time series revealed an abrupt change in the 1979 1980 hydrological year from 1078 m3 year 1 to 873 26 m3 year 1 generally significant downward abrupt changes in the monthly and annual means of discharge were observed in the hydrological years 1979 1980 and 1981 1982 climate change and the changes in the land cover use in the catchment of the floodplain could have occasioned the observed changes in mean discharge values into the floodplain v inundation extent showed an increasing trend in the period 2003 2013 with a mann kendall z statistic of 1 87 at alpha level 0 05 the trend in inundation extent was similar to the water level trend which also showed a rising scenario mann kendall z statistic of 2 67 for the period 2000 2011 vi during the period 1952 2004 the barotse floodplain experienced a downward trend in inflows and outflows as the study has shown for instance at alpha level 0 05 senanga and lukulu stations mean annual discharge time series for the period 1952 2004 showed significant downward trends with z statistics of 3 38 and 2 88 respectively vii based on this study s established correlations between inundation extent and discharge water level it can be inferred that during the period 1952 2004 the overall trend in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain was also in the downward direction in tandem with the downward trend in discharge time series viii key factors affecting the inundation in the barotse floodplain are the timing and consistency of the rains in the headwater catchments of the zambezi the timing and volumes of flow of the zambezi river and its tributaries and the high evapotranspiration in the basin ix the study applied an approach of assessing variability and historical trends in inundation extent that has never been applied before in the barotse floodplain the presented remote sensing based approach significantly reduces the full employment of the expensive and time limiting traditional physical field based wetland inundation mapping methods that form a limitation for achieving progress in

8530,study region the annually flooded barotse floodplain in the upper zambezi river basin in the western province of zambia southern africa study focus discharge variability plays a significant role in inundation extent and thus it controls habitat conditions of river channels and the linked wetlands the linkage between discharge and inundation extent in the barotse floodplain allowed us to analyse the trends in extent overtime using optical satellite imagery modis the desert flood index a surface water extraction algorithm was used to generate time series of inundation extent for validation of the inundation extent we used a flood mask extracted from a supervised classification land cover map using landsat imagery the land cover map was validated using the error matrix method with ground truthed data the estimated inundation extent time series enabled us to test the inundation correlation with discharge and water level using pearson r correlation a parametric statistical test based on the established correlation we used the mann kendall a non parametric test to analyse trends in the inundation extent and discharge and water level time series from which we made inferences on the direction of the historical trend in inundation extent new hydrological insights for the region the results revealed that there is observable inter annual variability in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain with prominent differences demonstrated in both the flood ascending peak and receding period for the period 2003 2013 the results indicated a rising trend in inundation extent with a mann kendall z statistic of 1 71 and increase in magnitude of 33 1 km2 at significance level alpha of 0 05 strong correlations between inundation extent and water level and between inundation extent and discharge with correlation coefficients of determination of 0 86 and 0 89 respectively were observed for the period 2000 2011 water level time series showed a rising trend with the mann kendall z statistic of 2 97 and increase in magnitude of 0 1 m at significance level alpha of 0 05 overall during the period 1952 2004 discharge in the floodplain showed a declining trend with mann kendall z statistics of 2 88 and 3 38 at the inlet and outlet of the floodplain respectively by correlation inference the overall inundation extent trend in the floodplain was in a downward movement rainfall and discharge variability high evapotranspiration and the changes in the land cover use in the catchment of the floodplain are largely the factors affecting the observed variability and trends in inundation extent in the floodplain the presented remote sensing based approach significantly reduces the need for the expensive and time limiting traditional physical field based wetland inundation mapping methods that form a limitation for achieving progress in wetland monitoring especially in open and sparsely gauged floodplains such as the barotse keywords desert flood index discharge floodplain inundation extent modis remote sensing 1 introduction ecosystem functions and associated services in wetlands are determined by inundation dynamics degroot et al 2006 thus implications of wetland inundation on water wetland policies and management are immense changes in temporal and spatial dynamics of wetland inundation may be an important indicator of the modifications in the functioning of wetland ecosystem erwin 2009 clare and creed 2014 kingsford et al 2016 there is a recognition of the significance of wetlands at regional level as it concerns nutrient export to surface waters greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity foster et al 2012 therefore monitoring of wetlands has taken on a heightened relevance erwin 2009 however the complexities in assessing the spatial and temporal regimes make it extremely challenging to make the necessary observations for deepened understanding of the inundation dynamics and the potential implications on wetland ecosystems of the various flow components stisen et al 2008 erwin 2009 in the zambezi basin this challenge is compounded by inadequate and dilapidated hydro meteorological stations cohen et al 2014 including time and financial resource limitations associated with traditional field survey wetland mapping methods in many cases this problem is so severe that even the application of conventional prediction tools is severely limited in this part of africa cohen et al 2014 the application of satellite based remote sensing techniques in inundation extent assessments provides an important and expanded avenue for data collection on the dynamic state of inundation especially for vast wetlands where ground based methods are virtually impractical schumann et al 2007 ticehurst et al 2014 with the advantage of area coverage spatial resolution regular revisit time temporal resolution and acquisition of data in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum spectral resolution the remote sensing approach is best suited for study of inundation dynamics as compared to conventional mapping methods ticehurst et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 a host of satellite sensors are currently generating enormous amounts of data at various resolutions that form the core for both historical and continued monitoring of inundation regimes and other landforms among the vast spectrum of uses earth observation based data has increasingly become an important source of information for water use planning monitoring and management at various levels of management such as field catchment and regional scale mu et al 2007 though some studies related to floodplain inundation mapping using satellite imagery have previously been conducted in zambia e g tiger initiative 2008 aduah and mantey 2012 meire 2012 cai et al 2015 only one publication cai et al 2015 in public domain was done in the barotse floodplain however the landsat imagery used by cai et al 2015 imposed a limitation on the number of time series they could generate and compare which affected their analysis of the variations in inundation extent furthermore none of the studies attempted to statistically analyse trends in floodplain inundation extent and the correlation with flow and water level the need to further understand the within season and inter annual variations in inundation and how it relates to discharge water level motivated this study to use a different and simple satellite remote sensing and statistical analysis approach to add to the existing knowledge on the inundation dynamics in the barotse floodplain for inundation extent mapping the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis data presents a better option for large wetland inundation mapping ticehurst et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 despite the inherent limitation of cloud cover modis is seen as a better option because all historical data from 2000 to the present are readily available for free it has near global spatial coverage 250 m 1 km a better temporal scale 1 2 times day and can easily be processed with most available satellite imagery data processing computer software ticehurst et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 for mapping of open water features with optical satellite imagery the use of indices is the most common practice baig et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 various spectral based water features extraction indices have been developed and include the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1973 normalised difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 modified normalised difference water index mndwi xu 2006 automated water extraction index awei feyisa et al 2014 and the desert flood index dfi developed by baig et al 2013 the ndwi developed by mcfeeters 1996 and the mndwi by xu 2006 are the most utilised water feature extraction indices baig et al 2013 however baig et al 2013 discovered that under all the experimental conditions they subjected the dfi and mndwi the dfi performed better the performance assessment of the two indices was carried out on modis and landsat images in a flooding season of the indus river in pakistan the dfi focuses on more precision in the calculation of water proportion at sub pixel level and the increasing of the contrast between water and non water features the other multi band based indices such as the ndwi and the mndwi are focused on differentiating the water body from the non water body information by using pixel scales instead of the proportion of the water area which critically affects precision in water information extraction wang 2007 baig et al 2013 based on the nature of the study area and the focus of our study modis imagery and the dfi were seen as better options and that the modis imagery were readily available furthermore the statistical approach sought to augment our understanding of the interaction between inundation discharge and water level however climate and hydrological data such as discharge and water level are known to be non normal hence statistical characterisation is normally done using non parametric statistical tests hirsch and helsel 2002 to detect change point s and trends in hydrological data the pettit and the mann kendall are commonly used non parametric tests hirsch and helsel 2002 the pettit 1979 homogeneity test approach is a common non parametric application in change point detection studies involving hydrological or climate series pohlert 2014 hirsch and helsel 2002 the mann kendall test possesses advantage over other tests because it does not need the data to be normally distributed and has low sensitivity to abrupt changes due to inhomogeneity in time series data hirsch and helsel 2002 to assess relationships between variables the pearson s r is the most used measure of correlation it is sometimes referred to as the linear correlation coefficient because of its measure of linear association between two variables hirsch and helsel 2002 in this paper we therefore describe results of the mapping of extent of inundation in the barotse floodplain using modis satellite imagery and the desert flood index we estimate inundation extent observe both within season and inter annual patterns and establish correlations of inundation extent with discharge and water level furthermore we make inferences on the overall trend in inundation extent based on the trends in discharge and water level following the objectives i to quantify the inundation extent for within and across season at different stages of flooding in the floodplain ii to ascertain correlation of inundation extent with discharge and water level in the floodplain iii to detect historical change points in the means of discharge and water level time series for the given periods and iv to assess historical trends in the time series of inundation extent discharge and water level in the floodplain 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site the barotse floodplain is a relatively flat plateau which stretches from lukulu at the confluence of the zambezi with kabompo river in the north to senanga in the south fig 1 a stretch of about 230 km timberlake 1997 iucn 2003 fanshawe 2010 it is geographically located between 13 and 17 south and 22 24 east of western zambia southern africa the suggestion is that the floodplain formed as a result of tectonic lift williams 1986 though the precise nature of the uplift is not well understood the elevation over the floodplain ranges from 1192 m above sea level in the north eastern part at lukulu to about 900 m above sea level in the southern part at senanga to the south around the ngonye falls the hard rock has resulted in the impoundment of the river above the falls this is because the rock has resisted the river s tendency to cut a channel down into it and thus acts more like a dam behind it the floodplain has formed the low relief of the area possibly disrupted these drainages with lines of dambos and pans marking original courses however below the falls the river falls nearly twice as fast as it does on the plain and flows more swiftly in a narrower valley less prone to flooding moore et al 2007 the floodplain averages 30 km width along most of its length and is about 50 km at the widest north of mongu town the western province headquarters situated at its edge estimates have put the main body of the floodplain at 5500 km2 though the maximum flooded area is approximated at 10 750 km2 when the floodplains of the several tributaries such as the luena flats are taken into account timberlake 1997 iucn 2003 the barotse floodplain is generally covered by the kalahari sands extending from lukulu to downstream of senanga moore et al 2007 fanshawe 2010 the annual inundation in the area is influenced by the zambezi river and its tributaries such as the lungwebungu and the luanginga emanating from the lungwebungu and luanginga basins in angola as well as the kabompo river from the kabompo basin in north western zambia fig 1 much of the discharge into the barotse floodplain is from upstream in angola and north western zambia which receives an average of above 1000 mm of rainfall rainfall over the barotse floodplain catchment is a result of the movements of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz between october and april of a hydrological year considerable variability in rainfall occurs across the catchment with very high inter annual variability in rainfall coefficient of variation 0 35 iucn 2003 fanshawe 2010 beilfuss 2012 mean annual potential evapotranspiration across the barotse basin is 1560 mm with potential evaporation exceeding rainfall during every month of the calendar year beilfuss 2012 phiri 2013 the floodplain experiences peak in inundation about 3 months after the peak of the rainy season up to 1500 mm of rain falls over the headwater catchments of the zambezi each year in january february by april the flood normally has reached its peak and recedes in may to july when grasses rapidly grow on the exposed plain iucn 2003 fanshawe 2010 baidu forson et al 2014 2 2 materials 2 2 1 satellite images modis and landsat the mod09a1 and landsat 8 oli tirs level 1t imagery used in this study were accessed from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa via the internet portal glovis http glovis usg gov the shape file covering the study area was used to cut out and download mod09a1 data for the years 2003 2013 as well as the june 6th 2015 imagery the 7th of june 2015 landsat 8 oli tirs data were downloaded from scenes at paths 174 176 with rows at 070 071 the modis is designed for acquisition of large scale global dynamics measurements the modis mod09a1 data provides surface reflectance bands 1 7 table 1 at 500 m resolution in an 8 day gridded level 3 product in the sinusoidal projection each pixel in the level 3 product mod09a1 contain the best possible l2g observation during an 8 day period it has high observation coverage low view angle absence of clouds or cloud shadow and aerosol loading vermote et al 2011 and has been espoused as suitable for mapping floodplain inundation ticehurst et al 2013 modis bands 1 2 4 and 6 baig et al 2013 were used in this study since the focus of our study included the rainy season which is prone to cloud cover on most days the eight day revisit time was deemed adequate for the purposes landsat 8 oli tirs on the other hand have a relatively higher spatial resolution 30 m than modis but with a longer revisit time 16 days which proved difficult to generate sufficient data sets for adequate time series analysis of inundation extent very few cloud free landsat imagery were available during the flooding period the landsat images available during the flood season differed on the dates they were acquired each year hence the decision to settle for modis imagery which had several images available on the same dates each year the modis imagery data made it possible to compare inundation extent on each particular day of the year across the years however taking advantage of its spatial resolution and the ground truthing process the landsat 8 oli tirs data was used to validate inundation extent as detected by modis landsat 8 oli tirs has 11 bands ranging from the costal aerosal to the thermal infra red 2 table 2 landsat 8 oli tirs bands 4 5 6 and 7 were used in the study 2 2 2 field data collection three field surveys were conducted during the study the first two were reconnaissance surveys carried out in february rainy season and june dry season in 2014 during which data to derive training data regions of interest for the supervised land cover classification was collected the data collected included flooded grassland river channels settlements crop fields and various vegetation types including forests the survey was done in mongu senanga kalabo and lukulu districts involving all immediate upland areas in the catchment of the floodplain during the same time daily water level and discharge data sets for senanga and lukulu gauge stations fig 1 were obtained from the department of water resources development mongu western zambia both gauge stations are operated manually discharge and water level is recorded three 3 times daily at 6 h intervals 06 00 am 12 00 am and 06 00 pm during the flooding period at senanga gauge station some of the water from the floodplain passes over and above the main channel where the gauge is located the second field survey was done in june 2015 after carrying out the land cover classification the month of june in zambia is the best time to conduct land cover classification exercise because during this period it is easy to differentiate the various land cover classes this is a transition period between the wet and dry season mukosha 2014 thus the survey was done to collect ground truthed data to validate the june 2015 land cover classification map as well as the june 2015 mod09a inundation mask we decided to compare the june 2015 modis and landsat imagery inundation masks data sets based on the same land cover scenarios this was critical for assessing the accuracy of the modis inundation mask 2 3 data pre processing 2 3 1 radiometric calibration of landsat 8 oli tirs the raw landsat 8 oli tirs imagery was calibrated to reflectance product as recommended by song et al 2001 chander and markham 2003 lillesand et al 2004 and usgs 2015 using the first line of sight atmospheric analysis of hypercubes flaash atmospheric correction module acm cooley et al 2002 envi user s guide 2009 in envi 5 1 radiance was calculated using the radiometric calibration tool in envi 5 1 the data was inputted using the meta data mtl txt file the output interleave was set to band interleaved by line bil format the output data type was set to float point data the scaling factor was automatically set at 0 1 to obtain an atmospheric corrected reflectance product the radiance file was inputted in the flaash atmospheric calibration module the module automatically inputs some parameters from the radiance image while other parameters such as the flight date and time and ground elevation had to be manually inputted atmospheric model was set to tropical aerosal model to rural aerosal retrieval was automatically set to 2 band k t kaufman tanre method the input parameters differed from scene to scene all reflectance products had values between 0 and 1 bands 4 5 6 and 7 were used the reflectance images were then mosaicked and used in the land cover classification using the supervised classification method with the maximum likelihood algorithm 2 3 2 data validation for water level and discharge time series the water level and discharge time series were tested for outliers using the dixon test hirsch and helsel 2002 the years with missing data were not included in the analysis 3 methods 3 1 quantification of inundated area quantification of inundated area was done by first detecting the inundated area validation of the detected inundated area and thereafter all pixels detected to have been inundated were quantified 3 1 1 detection of inundated area with modis and landsat imagery the desert flood index dfi baig et al 2013 was used to detect inundated area from modis mod09a1 imagery the indices were first stretched to an output range of between 0 and 1 the otsu method otsu 1979 performed in matlab was used to generate threshold values from the stretched greyscale images dfi indices the threshold values ranged between 0 3 and 0 7 the resultant threshold values were then used to extract binary masks binary masks were obtained for all imagery examined for each year 3 1 2 validation of inundation extent maps validation of the inundation extent maps was done with a ground truth based five class land cover classification map from the june 2015 landsat 8 oli tirs imagery generated with the maximum likelihood algorithm lillesand et al 2004 ahmad and quegan 2012 in envi 5 1 validation of the landsat 8 oli tirs land cover classification map was done using the error matrix method lillesand et al 2004 a minimum of 50 ground truth points per class the number of points increasing with the size of land cover classes were generated using the stratified method a total of 350 points for ground truthing were generated the shape file of the generated ground truthing points in envi 5 1 where converted to a compatible format keyhole markup language klm file in arcgis 10 3 for use in the trimble juno 3d global position system gps and google earth software a hybrid method of obtaining ground truth data was used in which field generated and google earth software based data were combined to validate the classification a handheld trimble juno 3d differential gps with accuracy level of 2 5 metres was used to pick coordinates in the field during the field work campaign in june 2015 a total of 10 points for each class was validated based on actual ground data while the rest of the points for each class were validated using high resolution google earth software with the image for the month of june the 10 ground based data were used as control for the google earth data the mask from the class flooded area regularly flooded vegetation from the validated june 2015 land cover classification was generated using the raster calculator in arcgis 10 3 the june dfi binary mask and the binary mask from the land cover classification were then compared 3 1 3 pixel based quantification of inundated area after validation of the inundation extent map the number of inundated pixels from the binary masks were obtained from the attribute table the estimates of inundated area were obtained by multiplying the number of inundated pixels with the pixel size of mod09a1 which is 0 25 km2 the mean annual inundation extent was obtained by averaging inundation extent values of the six 6 days considered for each year the days used to get the annual means were three 3 from the ascending peak period days 089 097 and 105 and three 3 from the receding period days 113 121 129 we used the year 2004 to exemplify the annual inundation pattern because it recorded the highest daily peak inundation extent and had more days with cloud free images compared to other years during the period 3 2 correlation of inundation extent with discharge and water level the pearson r was used to ascertain the extent to which inundation extent discharge and water level correlated pearson s r is the most commonly used measure of correlation it is sometimes referred to as the linear correlation coefficient because of its measure of linear association between two variables hirsch and helsel 2002 the pearson r correlation test was applied after the data sets were tested for outliers and homogeneity hirsch and helsel 2002 3 3 assessment of change points in discharge and water level time series we used the pettit 1979 homogeneity test approach a common non parametric application in change point detection studies involving hydrological or climate series which are known to be non normal data pohlert 2014 hirsch and helsel 2002 when the change point was found significant the time series were divided into two parts at the location of the change point the pettit test was then conducted on the time series from which the change was detected hirsch and helsel 2002 3 4 assessment of trends in the time series the mann kendall trends test hirsch et al 1982 hamed and rao 1998 sirois 1998 hirsch and helsel 2002 salmi et al 2002 was used to detect trends in the mean monthly and annual time series of inundation extent discharge and water level the tests for trends in the time series were based on the results of the pettit homogeneity test pettit 1979 each period was tested for trends based on the detected change point in the time series hirsch and helsel 2002 the discharge time series were for the inlet lukulu gauge station and outlet senanga gauge station water level time series were for the outlet of the floodplain at senanga refer to fig 1 for location of gauge stations the five years two for senanga station and three for lukulu station with missing mean annual discharge data were not included in the trends analysis 4 results 4 1 quantification of inundated area 4 1 1 detection of inundated area with modis and landsat imagery the modis false colour composite image fig 2 a showed the extent of inundation in the floodplain the dfi algorithm produced grey scale images with values between 1 and 1 fig 2b which were stretched to values between 0 and 1 fig 2c from which the binary masks fig 2d were obtained after application of the otsu threshold value 4 1 2 validation of inundation extent maps the ground truth results showed a generally good agreement between the classification and the real world with an overall accuracy of 86 29 percent and a kappa statistic of 0 83 table 3 segments of landsat 8 oli tirs red and mod09a1 blue flood masks for the month of june 2015 obtained on the 06th and 07th of the month respectively were compared fig 3 landsat and modis have different capture and revisit times the inundation extent on 7th june 2015 under mod09a1 was at 1356 km2 while inundation extent for landsat 8 oli tirs on the 6th of june 2015 was 1 341 71 km2 which was a difference of 14 29 km2 the accuracy percentage between the dfi generated inundation extent mask and the maximum likelihood classification validated with ground truthing data was 98 95 the difference in inundated area could be attributed to the differences in the spectral and spatial resolutions of landsat 8 oli tirs and modis data as well as the methods used to extract the inundation extent masks for instance landsat has a spatial resolution of 30 m by 30 m while the mod09a1 used has a 500 m by 500 m resolution 4 1 3 pixel based quantification of inundated area quantification of the detected inundated area was pixel based as shown in the calculations for the year 2004 in table 4 the calculated estimates of inundated area for each year in the period 2003 2013 are given in attachment 1 in the supplementary material maximum peak flow inundation extent was observed on day 105 at 5572 25 km2 while the minimum low flow inundation extent was observed on day 161 at 233 50 km2 peak inundation was observed between days 097 and 105 then starting to steadily decline from day 113 inundation extent starts to increase from day 305 in november table 4 which is at the start of the rain season 4 1 4 variations in inundation extent inundation extent maps fig 4 showed that the first areas to be inundated were also the first to have the floods recede and the last areas to be inundated were last to have the flood recede for instance on day 033 the upstream and the middle part of the floodplain was more flooded than the downstream fig 4 on the other hand day 169 showed receded inundation in the upstream while the middle and downstream areas were still inundated this phenomenon indicates differences in the onset and recession of inundation within the floodplain instigated by various geological and spatial variables in the floodplain i e the constriction of the floodplain at the outlet at senanga gives the floodplain a dam like nature that affects the rate of outflows which affects inundation behaviour the inter annual variations in inundation extent across the period 2003 2004 were clearly visible fig 5 and attachment 6 in the supplementary material the inter annual variations were more visible during the receding period i e from day 113 to day 345 fig 5 and attachment 6 in the supplementary material at peak period for daily inundation extent we estimated maximum and minimum inundation extent in the barotse floodplain at about 5572 km2 in 2004 day 105 and 2595 25 km2 in 2005 day 089 attachment 1 in the supplementary material the rest of the years had daily peak inundation extent oscillate between the two values as for the mean annual inundation extent the variations were clearly discernible fig 6 based on the estimated inundation extents the year 2003 had the highest while the year 2005 had the lowest mean annual inundation extent fig 6 the calculations of the mean annual inundation extent were based on the cloud free images available in each year which differed from year to year as shown in attachment 1 in the supplementary material 4 2 correlation of inundation extent with discharge and water level the inundated area and the outflow at senanga gauge station for the year 2004 were significantly correlated throughout the year with correlation coefficient of 0 94 and a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 89 with p value 0 01 at alpha of 0 05 table 5 and fig 7 a when compared water level with inundation extent showed a similar relationship as was the case with discharge with a coefficient of correlation r of 0 93 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 86 table 5 and fig 7b the correlation scatter plots are as shown in attachment 2 in the supplementary material the interpretation is that inundation extent increases or decrease with increase or decrease in discharge and water level in the floodplain 4 3 assessment of change points in discharge and water level time series the pettit homogeneity test showed that there were changes in the mean monthly and annual discharge at the two hydrometric stations assessed lukulu and senanga stations showed changes in the mean monthly values in the same year but different months may 1981 and july 1981 respectively and december 1997 for both stations table 6 the difference in the months in which the change in the mean monthly discharge occurred can be attributed to the time lag in the movement of water from lukulu to senanga for lukulu station at confidence level of 99 percent with p value 0 01 a change point was observed in may 1981 from 846 52 m3 month 1 to 614 97 m3 month 1 after the change another change point in february 1991 from a mean monthly value of 647 38 m3 month 1 to 606 15 m3 month 1 was observed a final upward change point was observed in december 1997 from 487 02 m3 month 1 to 888 70 m3 month 1 table 6 for senanga gauge station mean monthly discharge time series only one significant abrupt change was observed in july 1981 from a mean monthly discharge of 1065 m3 month 1 to 828 48 m3 month 1 detected at 99 percent confidence with the computed p value of 0 01 table 6 since the mean monthly values were based on the hydrological year october to september the changes in the mean monthly values of discharge at the two stations occurred in the same hydrological year 1981 significant downward abrupt changes were observed in mean annual discharge time series at both lukulu and senanga gauge stations during the same period as was in the mean monthly time series table 6 and fig 8 a b significant downward change point in the monthly means of water level at senanga gauge station was observed in july 1981 from 2 61 m to 2 13 m for lukulu station an abrupt change in the mean annual discharge was observed in the hydrological year 1980 1981 from a mean of 810 42 m3 year 1 to 604 66 m3 year 1 at senanga station a downward abrupt change was observed in the 1979 1980 hydrological year from 1078 00 m3 year 1 to 873 26 m3 year 1 the changes in the 1997 mean annual discharge for senanga and in 1998 for lukulu were not adequate to register significance at alpha level 0 05 table 6 the mean annual water level change point was the same with the discharge change point at senanga gauge station table 6 the mean annual discharge time series showed similar time space for abrupt changes as exhibited in the mean monthly discharge time series overall significant abrupt changes in the monthly and mean annual rate of discharge were observed in the hydrological years 1979 1980 and 1981 1982 and showed a downward trend 4 4 assessment of trends in the time series 4 4 1 seasonal mann kendall trends analysis for discharge for lukulu station data no significant trends in the mean monthly discharge were observed in the segmented periods 1967 1981 1982 1997 and 1998 2003 however there was a significant downward trend with a kendall statistic of 0 21 with computed p value 0 05 between the time space 1967 and 2003 table 7 further investigations with the fitting of the linear regression with ordinary least squares revealed insignificant upward trends for the periods 1967 1981 1982 1997 table 7 significant downward trend was noted for the overall period 1967 2003 with slope coefficients of 0 03 and r2 of 0 03 table 8 the overall trend for monthly discharge at lukulu station for the period 1967 2003 was downward for senanga station the mann kendall trends test detected no significant trend in the mean monthly discharge time series for the periods 1967 1981 and 1982 2004 the kendall statistic and the computed p values for the two periods were 0 09 0 12 and 0 44 0 10 respectively table 7 above with computed p values 0 05 in all scenarios the h0 that there was no trend in the data was accepted however the overall mann kendall test for the period 1967 2004 detected a significant downward trend the kendall statistic and the computed p value for this period were 0 23 and 0 05 respectively table 7 above the computed p value was less than 0 05 the h0 was therefore rejected and the ha that there was a trend in the discharge time series was accepted fitting of the linear regression with ordinary least squares revealed a downward trend for the 1952 1981 with a slope coefficient of 0 04 and r2 of 0 01 table 8 above the periods 1982 2004 had a slope coefficient of 0 02 and r2 of 0 01 which indicated an upward trend overall 1967 2004 had a slope coefficient of 0 02 and r2 of 0 01 which indicated a downward trend in the time series generally the trends in the mean monthly flows for the period 1967 2003 4 for both lukulu and senanga stations were downward 4 4 2 trends analysis for mean annual time series of inundation extent discharge and water level for the period 2003 2013 the mann kendall trends test showed a significant rising trend in inundation extent with z statistic of 1 71 and p value 0 05 at significance level alpha 0 05 the magnitude of trend as given by the sens slope was 33 10 km2 table 9 fig 9 and attachment 3 in the supplementary material for the period 2000 2011 water level time series showed a significant rising trend with z statistic of 2 67 with p value 0 05 at alpha level 0 5 table 9 fig 10 and attachment 4 in the supplementary material the trend in water level is very similar to the trend in inundation extent for the period discharge data for the period 2003 2013 was not available while water level data was only available up to 2011 for the period 1952 1979 senanga station mean annual discharge time series attachment 5 in the supplementary material had no significant trend p value of 0 56 and no significant trend from 1980 to 2004 p value of 0 74 however when the entire period 1952 2004 was considered there was a significant trend with a z statistic value of 3 38 a p value of 0 05 at alpha level 0 001 with an annual rate of decrease in discharge of 6 94 m3 year 1 table 7 above fig 11 a for lukulu station upstream of the wetland there was no significant trend in discharge during the period 1952 1980 or the period 1981 2003 for the period 1952 2003 however there was a significant downward trend with a z statistic value of 2 88 p value of 0 05 at alpha level of 0 01 with an annual rate of decrease of 4 68 m3 year 1 table 7 above fig 11b for the period 1952 2004 the observed general trend in mean annual discharge in the floodplain both inflows and outflows was downward 5 discussion remote sensing provides an affordable and expanded platform for mapping inundation one of the most essential abiotic characteristics of wetlands across the landscape ticehurst et al 2014 several studies have demonstrated that modis imagery can be used to map wetland inundation meire 2012 baig et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 in this study we demonstrate that modis generated data can be utilised to show variability and trends in wetland inundation as well as be used with ground based data to highlight interlinkages with key variables such as discharge and water level 5 1 detection of inundation extent with modis and the dfi first despite the cloud scenario during the rainy season the temporal resolution of modis made it possible to generate sufficient time series for analysis this is in contrast with other freely available optical satellite data sets such as landsat we noted that few cloud free modis images were available during the ascending period as compared to the receding period fig 12 and attachment 1 in the supplementary material this is because unlike during the ascending period there is an overall reduction in the number of rain days during the flood receding period hence fewer days with cloud cover the challenge of cloud cover is an inherent attribute of optical satellite data such as modis which has been noted by many wang 2007 di baldassarre 2012 meire 2012 ticehurst et al 2014 proud et al 2011 ticehurst et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 although ticehurst et al 2013 observed that some temporal information is lost when mapping wetland inundation with the composite 8 day interval with the mod09a1 product the temporal loss was considered not to be significant because the flooding in the barotse floodplain can be assumed as not fast flowing as it takes about four 4 to six 6 weeks for flood water to move from the floodplain inlet at lukulu gauge station to the outlet at senanga gauge station kasimona and makwaya 1995 considering that this study sought to assess the trend across the years and not necessarily within a flooding season the 8 day interval mod09a1 product was adequate while a number of studies have indicated the difficulty in ascertaining inundation extent in vegetated areas schumann et al 2007 baig et al 2013 ticehurst et al 2014 the degree to which vegetation affects the mapping of inundation is dependent on several factors such as the structure and density of vegetation and the relative size of the area covered by vegetation and water silva et al 2008 byrd et al 2014 furthermore a same piece of vegetation would give two different spectral signatures when subjected to dry and inundated conditions to this extent the barotse floodplain is largely an open grassland with intermittent vegetation of biomass standing above flood water moreover other than the observable visual differences between non inundated and the inundated vegetation in the floodplain the spectral signatures are also different for instance the spectral separability graph for the regions of interest used in the supervised land cover classification in this study showed different spectral signatures between inundated grassland and the dry grassland additionally the multi temporal nature of our study within and across seasons further enabled us to differentiate between inundated and none inundated areas we observed that ground based surveys enhances satellite imagery based inundation mapping as it provides insight on some aspects that may be overlooked if no ground data is available for example we observed that in the case of the barotse floodplain most areas with grass thickets and trees were inundated with high water levels fig 13 furthermore the floodplain has a generally flat terrain which ensures that most of the floodplain is virtually flooded except in raised platforms such as hills the challenge of capturing inundation under vegetation cover is one of the issues the developers of the desert flood index wanted to minimise with the dfi we observed that there is a clear distinction in the intensities of between inundated vegetation i e grassland and non inundated vegetation this was visible across the annual seasons i e during wet and dry seasons from this study we learned that having prior knowledge of the study area and the validation of satellite imagery mapped inundation extent provides basis for acquiring fairly accurate wetland inundation information from satellite imagery i e modis 5 2 quantification of inundated area across seasons and correlations 5 2 1 quantification of inundated area at peak period we estimated maximum and minimum inundation extent in the barotse floodplain at about 5572 km2 in 2004 day 105 and 2595 25 km2 in 2005 day 089 attachment 1 in the supplementary material the estimation is within the documented annually inundated area of 5500 km2 for the main floodplain at peak flood iucn 2003 beilfuss 2012 cai et al 2015 for instance cai et al 2015 estimated the maximum and minimum inundated area at about 5520 km2 and 2500 km2 respectively the difference in the estimated inundated area between the two studies could be due to the delineation of what were termed as the barotse floodplain the type of imagery and the date of capture as well as methods used in each study in this study we delineated and estimated inundation extent based on what is commonly regarded as the main barotse floodplain fig 1 cai et al 2015 used landsat imagery and the supervised classification method to extract inundated area furthermore we observed that the otsu threshold values for the receding period were low as compared to the ascending peak period this possibly resulted in both under and overestimation of inundation extent this challenge can be observed starting from day 177 which showed varying extents during the receding period and the dry season may october attachment 1 in the supplementary material baig et al 2013 also experienced the challenge of low threshold values with the dfi which made them manually obtain the values from the dfi grayscale image thus the dfi produce better threshold values and more accurate inundation delineation during the ascending and peak flood period when there is a lot of water than during the receding period when there is less water the estimated inundation extent by this study demonstrates that modis and the dfi can be used as an effective approach to delineate and quantify open wetland inundation especially during the high flood period 5 2 2 correlations of inundation extent with discharge and water level what has been documented is that inundation in the barotse floodplain is as a result of the discharge of the zambezi river and its tributaries that the discharge is largely dependent on the rainfall pattern in the upper catchment of the floodplain iucn 2003 fanshawe 2010 beilfuss 2012 according to naiman et al 1995 and sparks 1995 variations in stream flow regimes is the most serious and continuous threat to ecological sustainability of rivers and their associated wetlands anchored on the highlighted linkages we sought to show the statistical correlation extent of the inundation and the discharge water level in the barotse floodplain despite the non availability of gauge inflow data for all tributaries of the zambezi river and the non quantification of evapotranspiration and other potential loses we observed that inundation extent in the barotse floodplain had high correlations coefficients of determination of 0 89 and 0 86 with discharge and water level respectively these observations are regardless of the time lag between rainfall in the upper catchment and discharge in the floodplain fig 14 peak rainfall in the upper catchment is between december and february but peak discharge is in march april for instance the 1998 used for illustrative purpose only kabompo meteorological station in the barotse floodplain catchment rainfall time series and the lukulu discharge time series show the time lag between peak rainfall and peak discharge there is a four to six weeks time lag for discharge between lukulu and senanga kasimona and makwaya 1995 the lukulu senanga discharge time lag is brought about by the processes of inundation in the floodplain the travel distance between the two gauge stations and the constriction at senanga s ngonye falls which slows the movement of water from the floodplain moore et al 2007 kasimona and makwaya 1995 this is because the constriction at senanga acts like a dam releasing given quantities of water as the inundation recedes in the floodplain thus the lukulu senanga discharge time lag and the constriction at senanga results in a time lag between inundation extent and discharge water level i e fig 7 above based on the established correlation of inundation and discharge water level we note that factors affecting flows into the barotse floodplain will directly impinge inundation as well 5 2 3 variations and trends in inundation extent cai et al 2015 showed that there are inter annual variations in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain however the landsat imagery they used imposed a limitation on the amount of both within season and mean annual time series they were able to generate and thus compare across years in this study in affirmation with cai et al 2015 we show that there are variations in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain but with increased number of both mean annual and within season inundation extent time series clearly revealing the variability figs 5 and 12 above fig 15 and attachment 6 in the supplementary material in this regard our study underscores the advantage of modis over landsat imagery in large wetland inundation mapping as recommended by ticehurst et al 2014 from the comparison of daily inundation extent across seasons we observed that no single day of the year had same inundation extent for the entire 2003 2013 period examined fig 5 above and 15 during the period 2003 2013 we observed a rising trend in inundation extent with a magnitude of 33 10 km2 this implies that there was generally an increasing trajectory in inundated area during the period 2003 2013 which was also observed in the trend for water level for the same period and driven by factors such as rainfall and discharge however based on the inundation extent with discharge correlation the overall inundation trajectory for the 1952 2004 period was downward 5 3 change points and trends in discharge and inferred trends in inundation extent 5 3 1 change points and trends changes in stream discharge volumes has consequences on the ecological health of rivers and their associated wetlands naiman et al 1995 sparks 1995 we observed significant changes in the mean annual discharge of the zambezi river in the barotse floodplain for instance a major change in mean annual discharge between 1952 and 2004 occurred in 1981 from 1078 to 873 26 m3 year 1 and 810 42 604 66 m3 year 1 at senanga and lukulu gauge stations respectively these changes translated to about 19 and 25 percent reduction in the mean annual discharge at senanga and lukulu stations respectively the 1981 abrupt change in flows was also observed by beilfuss 2012 for the entire zambezi basin despite the upward change in the mean annual discharge values in 1997 at lukulu gauge station the change value was lower than the before 1981 mean discharge values the observed change points are likely to be due to climate change and land cover use change factors in the floodplain catchment however it is also possible the changes were due to the shifts in the gauge sites and the reference points and may not necessarily be due to climate and anthropogenic variables nonetheless what is critical is that since the observed 1981 change in discharge was also detected by beilfuss 2012 for the entire zambezi river basin the most probable variables responsible for the change are climate change and the changes in land cover use in the catchment of the floodplain furthermore there is generally low runoff efficiency low drainage densities and relatively high aridity in the catchment beilfuss 2012 these variables indicate a high sensitivity to climate change the rainfall runoff process is non linear thus a small change in annual precipitation or annual potential evaporation have a large impact on annual river flows beilfuss 2012 therefore climate change is a more probable cause of the observed abrupt change rather than the change in measurement systems the change was in a downward direction which meant a reduction in the amount of water into the floodplain generally the trend in the means of the annual inflow and outflows in the floodplain showed a downward trajectory revealed by the mann kendall test results therefore by the correlation of the inundation extent with discharge as ascertained by this study inundation in the barotse floodplain had been in the same downward trajectory over the period 1952 2004 moreover the indication by some barotse floodplain residents spoken to was that the inundation extent had changed for instance the farmers at sefula irrigation scheme in the floodplain mentioned that some areas that used to flood some decades ago no longer floods this observation by the farmers is in tandem with the findings of this study concerning the downward trend in flows into the floodplain that the farmers mentioned to have noticed the changes some decades ago could go to validate the 1981 significant change point made by this study 5 3 2 potential contributing factors to the observed variations and trends in inundation noting the correlation between inundation extent and discharge water level as established by this study the influence of rainfall on discharge variability paul et al 2006 kim et al 2012 and the impact of discharge variability on inundation extent naiman et al 1995 sparks 1995 the observation is that rainfall variability in the catchment is crucial in the inundation dynamics of the barotse floodplain several studies have explored rainfall variability in the zambezi basin jain 2007 thurlow et al 2009 yamba et al 2009 beilfuss 2012 for the entire zambezi basin beilfuss 2012 ascertained inter annual variability in rainfall with a high coefficient of variation of 0 35 other studies with focus on the agro ecological regions of zambia put the rainfall variability in region iii representative of the zambezi headwaters between 0 09 0 15 coefficients of variation i e 0 09 for thurlow et al 2009 and 0 15 for yamba et al 2009 the 2010 2070 rainfall variability projected by yamba et al 2009 seem to align with the 0 15 historical 1967 2007 value however at zambian regional level all studies conclude that in any given year normal rainfall is not guaranteed in any of the regions of zambia at the zambezi basin level beilfuss 2012 could not determine long rainfall variability because of the spatial and temporal nature of the variability on the other hand the regional study by christensen and hewitson 2007 projected a reduction in rainfall over southern africa based on the interlinkage between rainfall discharge and inundation it is expected that rainfall variability in the catchment of the barotse floodplain will continue to influence inundation extent thus the timing and consistency of the rains in the headwaters catchments of the zambezi the timing and volumes of flow of the zambezi river and its tributaries will bring about variations in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain additionally the floodplain is located in a region with high rates of evapotranspiration kasimona and makwaya 1995 beilfuss 2012 phiri 2013 which affects rainfall and discharge and could cut into the residence time of the water thereby affect the inundation extent the projection is that evapotranspiration in the zambezi basin will increase by 10 25 rate over the next 100 years arnell 1999 as cited in beilfuss 2012 therefore it is expected that high rate of evapotranspiration will continue to affect inundation in the barotse floodplain other than the high rainfall variability and the high evapotranspiration beilfuss 2012 phiri 2013 the annual rainfall and discharge quantities are declining for instance kampata et al 2008 used the mann kendall test to analyse trends in rainfall in the headstreams of the zambezi river basin they analysed rainfall time series between 1945 and 2005 for kabompo kasempa mwinilunga kaoma and mongu meteorological stations they concluded that there was no evidence of significant trends in the annual rainfall at 0 05 significance level for all the individual stations as the computed z statistics were found to be less than the critical value of 1 96 however they indicated that although the trends are not significant the rainfall is generally decreasing as evident from the negative values of the mann kendall statistics s furthermore the observation by kampata et al 2008 is in tandem with the overall scenario analyses for southern africa by frich et al 2002 new et al 2005 and christensen and hewitson 2007 which indicate reduction in rainfall through the mann kendall trends test we have shown that the mean monthly and mean annual discharge values are declining the results of the discharge trends analysis in our study therefore is in tandem with the highlighted rainfall scenarios for the headstreams of the zambezi river basin and for southern africa in general additionally changes in land cover use in particular due to deforestation has been cited as one of the major contributors to wetland degradation mainly through increased catchment erosion and nutrient loading blumenfeld et al 2009 changes in land cover use have taken place in the upper zambezi basin simwinji 1997 timberlake 1997 timberlake 2000 fanshawe 2010 mukosha 2014 which are likely to have contributed to catchment erosion and increased sediment yield into river channels and the floodplain thus it is plausible that land cover use changes in the catchment of the floodplain is affecting inundation extent in the barotse floodplain however beilfuss and santos 2001 argued that land use and land cover changes are unlikely to have had a significant effect on zambezi runoff patterns kasimona and makwaya 1995 also argued that the zambezi headwaters region covered by relatively infertile kalahari sands is frequently burned and cleared for small agricultural plots machambas but retains dense forest cover over most of the region beilfuss and santos 2001 further argued that water diversions are currently negligible relative to the mean annual flow and unlikely to affect runoff patterns in the near future what is critical to note is that land cover use is not statistic and thus many significant changes with potential to impact on flows and sedimentation in the floodplain could have taken place especially with the increased mining activities in the upstream of the floodplain s catchment in north western zambia 5 3 3 implications of the correlation s based on the correlations of inundation extent with discharge and water level established by this study the inference is that the downward upward trend in discharge water level are mirrored in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain the ipcc 2001 paul et al 2006 and kim et al 2012 point to how climate variables such as increased temperature and rainfall variability will impact on wetlands globally through changes in water quantity and quality according to the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 blumenfeld et al 2009 and woodward et al 2014 understanding the interlinkages between wetlands changes in land cover and use and between climate and hydrological variables such as discharge rainfall and temperature is crucial to the management of water resources in general and wetlands in particular hence the downward trend in discharge into the floodplain will have impact on the quantity and quality of water in the barotse floodplain which will consequently impact its ecological health and the other system services and livelihood streams it sustains 5 4 study limitations the challenge of cloud cover affected the time series available for analysis especially for the ascending period which is during the high rainfall period thus if the focus is to analyse the ascending flood patterns the ideal method would be to use imagery data sets other than the modis product we used which are not affected by the cloud cover factor i e synthetic aperture radar data however compared to other freely available optical satellite imagery such as landsat we find modis to be able to provide more cloud free images and thus more inundation extent time series for analysis the dfi produced low threshold values for the receding period hence proved a challenge to estimate inundation extent with low water levels and disconnected water pools this potentially contributed to the high variability observed during the receding period i e especially after day 177 when the main flood waters had receded and also during the dry season i e june october this is likely to have contributed to either overestimation or underestimation of the daily and the overall mean annual inundation extent values this is why when ascertaining the 2003 2013 trend we only used days 089 up to day 129 to estimate the mean annual inundation extent i e to ensure homogeneity in the assessed inundation extent time series however fig 6 was generated from the means generated from all daily inundation extent values in each year our experience with the dfi is that it produces better threshold values and hence more accurate inundation extent results during high flood periods the mean annual discharge time series had some missing values at both lukulu and senanga gauge stations this has potential to affect the accuracy of the mann kendall trends results and consequently the inferred historical inundation extent trend however collaborative evidence as revealed in the rainfall trends for the zambezi river basin goes to affirm the result of our study concerning the overall downward trend in mean annual discharge time series in the barotse floodplain 6 conclusions i the study has demonstrated that wetland inundation at different stages can be effectively delineated and quantified using modis imagery and the desert flood index for instance we were able to delineate and quantify different inundation stages within and across seasons with the highest peak inundation extent observed in 2004 at 5572 25 km2 while the lowest extent was observed in the year 2005 at 2595 25 km2 furthermore with modis imagery more inundation extent time series for a relatively adequate analysis can be generated overall the satellite based approach employed in this study when used together with ground based data provides an affordable avenue that can be utilised to overcome the challenge of inadequate and dilapidated hydrometric stations for monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics the approach can contribute availability of data on wetland inundation dynamics in zambia and the southern africa as a region where such data are scanty due to poor wetland inundation data capture systems ii the inter annual variability in inundation extent is clearly evident in the barotse floodplain with prominent differences demonstrated in the flood receding period more than in the ascending peak period the inter annual variability in inundation extent i e especially as observed during the receding period is a key parameter in managing crop and livestock productivity in the barotse floodplain iii very strong relationship exists between inundation extent and discharge water level the pearson correlation coefficient of inundation extent and water level was 0 93 while discharge and inundation extent showed a coefficient of 0 94 with coefficients of determination of 0 86 and 0 89 respectively this implies that trends in inundation extent are mirrored in trends of discharge water level and the reverse holds true iv during the period 1952 to 2004 there were significant abrupt changes in both mean monthly and mean annual values of discharge in the barotse floodplain for instance lukulu station experienced a major change point in the mean monthly values in the month of may 1981 from 846 52 m3 month 1 to 614 97 m3 month 1 after the change another change point was observed in february 1991 from a mean monthly value of 647 38 m3 month 1 to 606 15 m3 month 1 a final change point was in december 1997 from 487 02 m3 month 1 to 888 70 m3 month 1 for senanga gauge station only one significant abrupt change was noted in july 1981 from a mean monthly discharge of 1065 m3 month 1 to 828 48 m3 month 1 as regards abrupt changes in the mean annual values of discharge lukulu station experienced a significant change in the hydrological year 1980 1981 from a mean of 810 42 m3 year 1 to 604 66 m3 year 1 senanga station time series revealed an abrupt change in the 1979 1980 hydrological year from 1078 m3 year 1 to 873 26 m3 year 1 generally significant downward abrupt changes in the monthly and annual means of discharge were observed in the hydrological years 1979 1980 and 1981 1982 climate change and the changes in the land cover use in the catchment of the floodplain could have occasioned the observed changes in mean discharge values into the floodplain v inundation extent showed an increasing trend in the period 2003 2013 with a mann kendall z statistic of 1 87 at alpha level 0 05 the trend in inundation extent was similar to the water level trend which also showed a rising scenario mann kendall z statistic of 2 67 for the period 2000 2011 vi during the period 1952 2004 the barotse floodplain experienced a downward trend in inflows and outflows as the study has shown for instance at alpha level 0 05 senanga and lukulu stations mean annual discharge time series for the period 1952 2004 showed significant downward trends with z statistics of 3 38 and 2 88 respectively vii based on this study s established correlations between inundation extent and discharge water level it can be inferred that during the period 1952 2004 the overall trend in inundation extent in the barotse floodplain was also in the downward direction in tandem with the downward trend in discharge time series viii key factors affecting the inundation in the barotse floodplain are the timing and consistency of the rains in the headwater catchments of the zambezi the timing and volumes of flow of the zambezi river and its tributaries and the high evapotranspiration in the basin ix the study applied an approach of assessing variability and historical trends in inundation extent that has never been applied before in the barotse floodplain the presented remote sensing based approach significantly reduces the full employment of the expensive and time limiting traditional physical field based wetland inundation mapping methods that form a limitation for achieving progress in

8531,study region nebraska national forest in the high plains aquifer nebraska sand hills u s a study focus this research aimed to investigate the effects of grassland conversions to forest on recharge rates in a century old experimental forest the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dreamzs global optimization algorithm was used to calibrate the effective soil hydraulic parameters from observed soil moisture contents for 220 cm deep uniform soil profiles the historical recharge rates were then estimated by applying the numerical model hydrus 1 d for simulation of two plots representing grasslands and dense pine forest conditions new hydrological insights the results indicate that conversion from grasslands to dense pine forests led to vegetation induced changes in soil hydraulic properties increased rooting depth and greater leaf area index which together altered the water budget considerably the impacts of land use change expressed in percent of gross precipitation include a 7 increase in interception associated with an increase in leaf area index a nearly 10 increase in actual evapotranspiration and an overall reduction of groundwater recharge by nearly 17 simulated average annual recharge rates decreased from 9 65 cm yr 1 in the grassland to 0 07 cm yr 1 in the pine plot these outcomes highlight the significance of the grassland ecology for water resources particularly groundwater recharge in the nebraska sand hills and the overall sustainability and vitality of the high plains aquifer keywords land use change afforestation high plains aquifer groundwater recharge numerical model 1 introduction over time the ever increasing alteration of landscapes and the exploitation of plants have provided various ecosystem services but also caused ill effects to the environment for example while the increase in agricultural lands and productivity in the last two centuries has increased the capacity to sustain unprecedented population growth it has also caused extensive deforestation soil erosion and degradation desertification loss of biodiversity and depletion of groundwater resources concerns over the magnitude of deforestation and its associated impact on global climate change has made it imperative to maintain current forest coverage and reduce net loss of forest area through reforestation and afforestation programs afforestation reforestation and natural forest expansion have reduced net loss of forest area from approximately 9 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 7 3 million hectares per year by 2005 fao 2005a most afforestation programs however have not been undertaken through conversion of agricultural lands but at the expense of natural vegetation particularly grasslands in fact vast areas of grasslands

of land use change on water resources at global continental and local scales elmhagen et al 2015 with particular emphasis on groundwater recharge rates recharge rates for brevity that feed shallow aquifers groundwater levels of many aquifers around the world have been decreasing over the last few decades due to excessive groundwater extraction for irrigation that surpasses groundwater recharge and replenishing rates scanlon et al 2012 terrell et al 2002 the vulnerability of groundwater resources emphasizes the need to know reliable relationships between land use change and recharge rates particularly in semi arid regions where water scarcity is a critical concern while the effect of natural vegetation conversion to agricultural land with respect to water resources has been well documented scanlon et al 2007 studies on water resources impacts of other land use changes not associated with cropland are less common in particular the effect of grassland conversions to forests on water resources need further consideration due to the recent expansion of afforestation efforts and future forest restoration plans all over the world including in the united states adane and gates

the grassland and dense pine plots using imko t3 probe imko micromodultechnik gmbh ettlingen germany the tdr instrument was calibrated to the local sandy soil properties the plot profiles extended to 220 cm depth at approximately 20 30 cm intervals and data collected from march 2005 to january 2012 were used in this study the historic record contained some missing data due to sensor malfunction and maintenance this resulted in a total of 66 readings over the span of 7 years that was used in model calibration and validation 3 3 hydrological model 3 3 1 model set up the water fluxes in the soil plant atmosphere system are simulated using the hydrus 1 d software package šimůnek et al 2008 which numerically solves the one dimensional richards equation for variably saturated soil moisture

t 1 is the sink term function that describes volumetric macroscopic root water uptake the units adopted in this paper are day d and centimeter cm for the dimensions of time t and length l respectively the soil water retention function θ h is described by van genuchten s equation van genuchten 1980 3 h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m with mualem s condition mualem 1976 4 m 1 1 n where α cm 1 m and n are shape

effective soil hydraulic properties e g nasta and romano 2016 net precipitation and potential evaporation represent the system dependent atmospheric upper boundary conditions whereas free drainage is assumed at the lower boundary of the soil profile and is considered potential groundwater recharge r in this study direct measurements of soil moisture values along the vertical dimension at initial time step of model simulation represent the initial condition the term tp determines the potential root water uptake ζ h which is reduced through the feddes condition feddes et al 2001 two simulations are set up in hydrus 1 d a grass with kc 0 95 and 50 cm root depth and b pine with kc 1 0 and 200 cm root depth the feddes parameters were retrieved from the database available within in hydrus 1 d 3 3 2 model calibration and validation for each of the two simulations the effective soil hydraulic parameters featuring in van genuchten s relations eqs 3 5 are unknown and need to be estimated by inverse modeling the robustness of any optimization algorithm used for inverse modeling often determines its suitability for specific parameter estimation the first optimization routines were the local search algorithms such as the least square estimators like the one embedded in hydrus 1 d the results in these algorithms strongly depend on the initial guesses of each parameter value thus facing a high risk of early termination and failure in multiple local minima vrugt et al 2003 in order to eliminate the dependence on the parameter initial guesses there have been a series of robust global search algorithms to optimize soil hydraulic parameters one of the most popular techniques proposed in the scientific literature the differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm dreamzs coupled to the efficient markov chain monte carlo sampling scheme laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt 2016 vrugt et al 2008 is adopted in this study because a bayesian interpretation is more appropriate in order to infer the most probable set of parameters and their corresponding uncertainties moradkhani et al 2005 the bayesian statistical inference combines the data likelihood with a priori distribution to derive the posterior probability density functions of the model parameters the objective function φ p to be minimized in the optimization routine is defined as the root mean squared deviation rmsd which quantifies the discrepancy between observed and simulated soil moisture values 9 min p φ p z t 1 t t o t z 1 z t o t θ t d r z t θ s i m z t p 2 t t o t z t o t 1 where the vector p θr θs α n and ks contains the optimization parameters and the subscripts tdr and sim denote the observed and simulated soil water content values corresponding to soil depth z at observation time t for 66 days between 2005 up to 2012 at approximately one daily record per month maintenance months where data were not collected and data points that are unrealistically high were not considered hydrus 1 d model was implemented in dreamzs using the matlab environment the minimum and maximum bounds for the grass profile soil hydraulic parameters were selected based on field data for valentine sand unpublished pedotransfer function kettler et al 2001 and global sand textures reported by carsel and parish 1988 the soil hydraulic property bounds for the pine profile were further broadened in order to account for the impact of soil hydrophobicity adane et al 2017 ranges are shown in table 2 the main matlab text file selector in is automatically updated within the program with a new set of the five hydraulic parameters θr θs α n and ks that have to be optimized whereas the simulated water content values for each observation z depth and each time step t are retrieved from the text file obs node out the number of observed water contents were 660 in total and were recorded at 10 different depths and in 66 days distributed over 7 years a vector of 370 observed water content values 10 depths in 37 days collected over 4 years were used for calibration 2005 2008 and the remaining 290 10 depths in 29 days collected over 3 years were used for model validation 2009 2011 the performance diagnostic is quantified through the root mean squared deviation rmsd according to eq 9 4 results 4 1 soil moisture the soil moisture content was generally greater in the grassland plot soil profile than in the dense pine plot the total average moisture content for the grassland plot profile was approximately 13 ranging from 11 3 to 17 2 the dp plot soil profile was drier compared with the g plot with the soil moisture content averaging approximately 9 and the average for each depth interval ranging from 8 3 to 12 7 over the 7 year dataset the g plot profile had greater overall average soil moisture content for each depth interval by approximately 48 to 84 gravimetric measurements taken from soil profile cores in 2012 suggest that the average soil moisture contents were 8 4 for the grass and 4 5 for the dense pine profiles adane and gates 2015 however the low moisture values may also be partially attributed to the fact that 2012 was one of the driest years on record 4 2 historical climate trend the average annual precipitation for the 1950 2000 time period was approximately 57 0 cm yr 1 with the minimum of 35 8 cm yr 1 and the maximum of 82 3 cm yr 1 occurring in 1955 and 1977 respectively the annual historical precipitation data also deviated from the mean by approximately 12 5 cm yr 1 the decadal averages of the historical precipitation data suggest an increase in precipitation from approximately 53 cm yr 1 in the 1950s to 60 cm yr 1 in the 1990s the reference potential evapotranspiration rate estimates were substantially greater than the annual precipitation with an average of 114 0 cm yr 1 and standard deviation of about 5 0 cm yr 1 fig 4 illustrates the historical trends in annual averages of gross precipitation and reference evapotranspiration between 1950 and 2000 4 3 model calibration and validation results the calibration results comparing the observed and simulated soil moisture data subjected to observed net precipitation pnet and potential evapotranspiration etp daily values are depicted in fig 5 ten observed black stars θ values corresponding to each soil depth are reported at each time step while the gray bands signify the modeled θ values of the uniform soil profile corresponding to posterior probability density functions of the effective soil hydraulic parameters the most probable values of the three estimated effective soil hydraulic parameters correspond to the median values of their posterior frequency distributions and are reported in table 3 the θr and θs parameter estimates for the grass and dense pine profiles were 0 041 and 0 021 and 0 43 and 0 32 respectively the α parameter results were 0 077 cm 1 and 0 011 cm 1 while the n parameter results were 1 65 and 1 36 for the grassland and dense pine plot soil profiles respectively one of the most uncertain parameters in this optimization for both grassland and dense pine soil profiles was ks with values of 218 cm d 1 and 185 cm d 1 respectively since the study site generally consists of homogenous valentine sands the optimized ks values are reasonable and are consistent with unpublished field data ks 240 cm d 1 despite being much lower than the ks 713 cm d 1 reported for a global sand texture in carsel and parish 1988 while the coefficients of variation cv indicate greater confidence in the θr θs and n parameter 6 7 1 9 and 1 3 estimates uncertainties were greater for α cv 36 1 and ks 31 9 parameters table 3 the coefficients of variation were also notably greater for the pine profile and suggest that while the overall calibration is robust it could be improved by refining individual parameter estimates it is important to note that approximations applied in the model such as uniform soil profile estimated root depth and root distribution coupled with a coarse sporadic and at times non contiguous temporal resolution of daily observed soil moisture content data can generate epistemic errors and uncertainties nasta and romano 2016 the model simulations were essentially able to reproduce the hydrological dynamics and trends of the observed soil moisture contents in both vegetation plots reasonably well the rmsd values were relatively low 4 2 and 3 6 in the calibration and validation periods respectively for the grassland plot fig 5b similarly the dense pine plot soil moisture content calibration and validation processes resulted in low rmsd of 4 1 and 3 5 respectively fig 5c considering the calibrations were done based on a set of limited data the optimization was reasonably robust even though previous investigations have reported more robust performances wöhling and vrugt 2011 4 4 simulated historical recharge rate and water budget results fig 6 shows the average annual balance in terms of pgross percentages whereas tables 4 and 5 report the summary statistics of annual average water balance components for grass and pine respectively the average annual gross precipitation for the 1950 2000 time period was 57 0 cm yr 1 for the area the estimated vegetation canopy interception of gross precipitation was approximately 1 3 cm yr 1 in the grassland and 5 6 cm yr 1 in the dense pine plots and accounted for approximately 2 2 and 9 9 of gross precipitation respectively the grass potential evapotranspiration etp is lower than the pine because of the marginal effect of kc kc 0 95 for the grass and kc 1 for the pine and the considerable impact of lai on tp which is null for the grass plot during the dormant season the average annual actual evapotranspiration estimates were 45 9 cm yr 1 in the grass to 51 4 cm yr 1 for the dense pine plots the averages of total actual evapotranspiration rates represented 81 and 90 of the gross precipitation in the grass and dense pine profiles respectively these estimates are consistent with the results of szilagyi et al 2011 that reported the ponderosa pine plantations in the nnf evaporated 5 to 10 more than the average annual precipitation the average recharge rate estimates were 9 7 cm yr 1 for the grass and 0 07 cm yr 1 for the dense pine plots which represent 17 and 0 13 of gross precipitation respectively 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with recharge studies in the sand hills the historical recharge rate estimates were generally consistent with other field and modeled studies in the nebraska sand hills the average historical recharge rate estimated for the grasslands in this study was approximately 9 65 cm yr 1 and 17 of precipitation and is close to the results of crosbie et al 2013 which estimated 10 15 cm yr 1 and 20 30 of annual precipitation the recharge estimates for the grasslands were also consistent with scanlon et al 2012 that reported a range of 2 5 cm yr 1 to 21 0 cm yr 1 for an average of 9 2 cm yr 1 for the sand hills in the northern high plains while szilagyi et al 2011 estimated recharge rates to range between 3 7 and 4 9 cm yr 1 an improved model in szilagyi et al 2011 estimated an average rate of 7 3 cm yr 1 billesbach and arkebauer 2012 also reported 11 5 2 0 cm yr 1 for a grazed grassland site with no plantations located approximately 110 km from the present study site a chloride mass balance study used to corroborate the remote sensing results estimated 10 3 cm yr 1 for a sampling location closest to this study area near halsey ne szilagyi et al 2011 a study using soil moisture network data inverse modeling at halsey estimated an annual recharge rate of 5 0 cm yr 1 and 7 1 of precipitation wang et al 2016 a chloride mass balance and sulfate mass balance recharge study for the same plot used in this study also estimated 3 7 cm yr 1 and 10 0 cm yr 1 respectively for the grasslands adane and gates 2015 however the study conducted in the middle of a severe drought in 2012 contained considerably lower soil moisture contents compared to the long term soil moisture data obtained from tdr measurements and can potentially affect the final estimates of recharge a study that used chemical tracers mcmahon et al 2006 estimated that recharge rates for the sand hills grassland can exhibit a broad range between 0 02 cm yr 1 to 7 0 cm yr 1 while there have been a number of recharge studies in the sand hills the range of estimates can still vary drastically because of spatial differences in precipitation and temperature gradient as such careful considerations of averaged values and thoughtful geographical partitioning of the nsh will provide more valuable information on recharge rates and the water balance whereas few recharge estimates were available for the grasslands estimates for the dense pine plantations have been even rarer this study estimated almost negligible 0 07 cm yr 1 average historical recharge rates for the dense pine plot this result is consistent with the chloride mass balance method where adane and gates 2015 estimated the average recharge rate beneath the dense pine plot at approximately 0 7 1 0 cm yr 1 in reference to the dense ponderosa pine plantation in the nnf szilagyi et al 2011 reported that the plantations may evaporate more than annual precipitation suggesting that the recharge rate beneath the dense pine plantations may likely be negligible in a temperate climate in south western australia farrington and bartle 1991 estimated recharge beneath pines pinus pinaster was 11 4 cm 15 of precipitation but still 35 less than the adjacent woodlands in the semi arid mediterranean climate in spain bellot et al 1999 also estimated recharge beneath pine trees to be negligible sharma et al 1983 in australia reported that conversion from grassland to pines pinus radiata resulted in negligible recharge rates similarly holmes and colville 1970a b documented that conversion recharge rates beneath grasslands 6 3 cm yr 1 were reduced to 0 cm yr 1 beneath 24 year old pines the severity of reduction in recharge is influenced by the plantation density of the pine trees adane and gates 2015 reported that compared to the native grassland recharge beneath the sparse pine trees lai 0 3 was only reduced by 14 in the meantime recharge beneath the pine savannah lai 1 7 and dense pine trees lai 2 2 were reduced by 51 and 73 respectively comparing thinned and unthinned loblolly pine stands stogsdili et al 1992 found that increased moisture in the soil profile is more a function of reduced leaf interception loss and increased throughfall rather than reduced water use from the tree stands in addition to tree water use understory vegetation climate and soil type play important roles on the severity of recharge reduction 5 2 the impact of land use change on recharge and the soil water balance the annual recharge rates for the grassland and dense pine profiles from 1950 to 2000 are shown in fig 7 the impact of land use change on recharge rates and water balance was assessed through the difference between the native grassland and the dense pine plots indicating the change in the historical land use this change included an increased root depth from 50 cm in the grassland to 200 cm in the pine vegetation as well as increased canopy cover where the lai ranged from 0 to 1 2 in the grasses and 1 87 for the evergreen dense ponderosa pines these changes to the land use have increased average interception more than fourfold from 1 3 cm yr 1 to 5 4 cm yr 1 which are equivalent to 2 3 and 9 0 of gross precipitation such increase in canopy interception in trees is consistent with what has been reported by bosch and hewlett 1982 who found that canopy interception of 10 to 40 which was considerably less than the 25 40 reported for coniferous trees in the uk calder 2003 19 4 for pines in nepal ghimire et al 2012 and 17 in semi arid pine forest in portugal valante et al 1997 the conversion from grassland to dense pine vegetation also increased actual evapotranspiration from 45 9 cm yr 1 to 51 4 cm yr 1 which agrees with the conclusions of zhang et al 2001 who reported that greater evapotranspiration in forests than pasture for semi arid regions with less than 60 0 cm yr 1 precipitation the average annual actual evapotranspiration including interception losses accounted for approximately 83 of the average gross precipitation in the grass plot and approximately 100 in the dense pines profiles which are consistent with studies that estimated 90 in semi arid climates huxman et al 2005 szilagyi et al 2011 also estimated that evapotranspiration rates may exceed annual precipitation by up to 10 in the dense ponderosa pine of the nnf the average transpiration rates were 16 1 greater in the dense pine plot 21 8 cm yr 1 than in the grasses 18 3 cm yr 1 which is a conclusion consistent with other studies zhang et al 2001 bosch and hewitt 1982 the actual evaporation estimate was also 13 4 greater in the dense pine 29 4 cm yr 1 than in the grassland 25 3 cm yr 1 profile possibly in response to a 15 reduction experienced in soil hydraulic conductivity of the dense pine plot the results are consistent with allen and chapman 2001 and calder and newson 1980 who reported the rate of extra water loss by evaporation in forests is much more efficient than grasslands due to turbulent winds generated by trees greater evaporation losses in the dense pine plot may also likely be due to longer exposure to radiation and the atmosphere compared to the grassland conversely greater evaporation rates in grasses than trees have also been reported in kelliher et al 1993 where annual average evaporation rates were 0 46 cm day 1 compared to 0 40 cm day 1 in the coniferous trees likely due to the greater canopy cover of forests subsequently land use change through grassland afforestation has reduced the average historical recharge rate by approximately 100 from 19 65 cm yr 1 to 0 07 cm yr 1 and was in agreement with the results of adane and gates 2015 who reported reductions up to 90 for the same study site the recharge rate has also been reduced from 16 9 of precipitation in grasslands to 0 13 in the dense pine 5 3 sensitivity of groundwater recharge to maximum rooting depth root depth zr determines how deep plants can access moisture in the soil profile thus root depth has substantial influence on groundwater recharge and actual transpiration a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of changing zr on recharge the results indicate that groundwater recharge rate sensitivity to root depth was greater in the grassland plot than the dense pine as can be seen in fig 8 while both plots are sensitive to rooting depth it is important to note that recharge rates beneath the dense pine plot were considerably lower in general and practically negligible when maximum rooting depth exceeds 150 cm meanwhile increasing rooting depth to 220 cm reduced groundwater recharge by 14 cm in the grass plot if the grassland zr is altered from the original value 50 cm to either 100 cm or 10 cm r decreases by 39 and increases by 58 respectively it is also noteworthy that the grass plot with rooting depth at 220 cm produced more simulated groundwater recharge than the dense pines with extremely shallow 10 cm maximum rooting depth which further highlights the significance of the grassland ecology in the nebraska sand hills 6 conclusion this study was among a very few site specific investigations that evaluated the impact of land use change on recharge rates in the nebraska sand hills this study quantified the considerable impact that land use change has on recharge rates and overall water balance the conversion from the historical native grassland to forested land reduced recharge rate by approximately 17 relative to gross precipitation the actual evapotranspiration rates of the dense forest profile were also substantially greater than the grassland in response to increased canopy cover and greater root extinction depth the results of a sensitivity analysis indicate that groundwater recharge rate sensitivity to root depth was greater in the grassland plot than the dense pine evaporation rate was also greater under the dense pine profile partly due to lower saturated hydraulic conductivity value and longer exposure to ambient temperature and atmospheric demand proper consideration needs to be given to the intrinsic uncertainties in the data the simulations and the parameter assumptions the numerical model simulations did not consider the impact of preferential flow discretized layer with different soil hydraulic properties and hysteresis to mention a few while the uncertainties in this analysis may have contributed to the drastic conclusion the severe reduction in groundwater recharge as a result of land use change in the sand hills should attract the attentions of water resources managers who will need to consider management actions such as identifying tree species that are less water intensive optimum plantation density and adaptive forest management activities e g clearing and thinning directed at prolonging the vitality of the nebraska sand hills and the long term sustainability of the high plains aquifer in the effort to combat co2 emissions and global climate change many semi arid grasslands have been identified as suitable for future forestation programs worldwide this case study provides further evidence of the importance of grassland ecology to water resources particularly to groundwater systems thus the impact of these plantation efforts on water sustainability especially considering uncertainties in future climate projections in semi arid regions must be thoroughly considered conflicts of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the usda national institute of food and agriculture mcintire stennis project 1008861 the

8531,study region nebraska national forest in the high plains aquifer nebraska sand hills u s a study focus this research aimed to investigate the effects of grassland conversions to forest on recharge rates in a century old experimental forest the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dreamzs global optimization algorithm was used to calibrate the effective soil hydraulic parameters from observed soil moisture contents for 220 cm deep uniform soil profiles the historical recharge rates were then estimated by applying the numerical model hydrus 1 d for simulation of two plots representing grasslands and dense pine forest conditions new hydrological insights the results indicate that conversion from grasslands to dense pine forests led to vegetation induced changes in soil hydraulic properties increased rooting depth and greater leaf area index which together altered the water budget considerably the impacts of land use change expressed in percent of gross precipitation include a 7 increase in interception associated with an increase in leaf area index a nearly 10 increase in actual evapotranspiration and an overall reduction of groundwater recharge by nearly 17 simulated average annual recharge rates decreased from 9 65 cm yr 1 in the grassland to 0 07 cm yr 1 in the pine plot these outcomes highlight the significance of the grassland ecology for water resources particularly groundwater recharge in the nebraska sand hills and the overall sustainability and vitality of the high plains aquifer keywords land use change afforestation high plains aquifer groundwater recharge numerical model 1 introduction over time the ever increasing alteration of landscapes and the exploitation of plants have provided various ecosystem services but also caused ill effects to the environment for example while the increase in agricultural lands and productivity in the last two centuries has increased the capacity to sustain unprecedented population growth it has also caused extensive deforestation soil erosion and degradation desertification loss of biodiversity and depletion of groundwater resources concerns over the magnitude of deforestation and its associated impact on global climate change has made it imperative to maintain current forest coverage and reduce net loss of forest area through reforestation and afforestation programs afforestation reforestation and natural forest expansion have reduced net loss of forest area from approximately 9 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 7 3 million hectares per year by 2005 fao 2005a most afforestation programs however have not been undertaken through conversion of agricultural lands but at the expense of natural vegetation particularly grasslands in fact vast areas of grasslands worldwide were found suitable for future forest restoration programs to offset anthropogenic co2 emissions bond 2016 in the last 100 years natural regeneration and afforestation programs on various land uses have increased forest coverage mccleery 1992 although forests provide several well documented ecosystem services nasi et al 2002 seppelt et al 2011 a number of studies have also documented circumstances where conversions to forests have reduced streamflow brown et al 2013 altered soil hydraulic properties kajiura et al 2012 reduced soil moisture james et al 2003 and reduced recharge rates adane and gates 2015 the loss of soil moisture and groundwater recharge reductions have been attributed to the relatively higher evapotranspiration rates of the planted woody vegetation gates et al 2011 huang and pang 2011 other studies have also partially associated these reductions in soil moisture and recharge rates to vegetation induced soil water repellency adane et al 2017 and greater rainfall interception of the introduced plantations allen and chapman 2001 owens et al 2006 simic et al 2014 starks et al 2014 in the early 20th century over 75 215 million hectares of the grassland coverage in the western united states was reported to be experiencing widespread degradation in the great plains most counties have lost at least part of their natural grassland vegetation klopatek et al 1979 for instance 85 to 95 of the native bluestem prairie vegetation in some areas had been converted to cropland sieg et al 1999 the loss of grasslands has subsequently led to changes in the composition of vegetation a loss of species diversity and reductions in wildlife such as the buffalo and prairie dogs in the great plains while the sand hills grasslands are considered relatively intact at 85 of historical coverage the region has experienced degradation related to conversion to cropland habitat fragmentation and overgrazing fao 2005b changes in soils associated with grassland deterioration include a reduction in soil porosity decrease in organic matter and decrease in nutrient contents as well as reductions in water retention capacity burke et al 1989 such large scale and rapid land use change has been known to cause significant changes to the environment including changes in hydrological regimes schilling et al 2008 spracklen and garcia carreras 2015 land degradation bruun et al 2013 ozalp et al 2016 loss of habitat and wild life ochoa quintero et al 2015 and contributing to climate change longobardi et al 2016 there is also a growing interest in the consequences of land use change on water resources at global continental and local scales elmhagen et al 2015 with particular emphasis on groundwater recharge rates recharge rates for brevity that feed shallow aquifers groundwater levels of many aquifers around the world have been decreasing over the last few decades due to excessive groundwater extraction for irrigation that surpasses groundwater recharge and replenishing rates scanlon et al 2012 terrell et al 2002 the vulnerability of groundwater resources emphasizes the need to know reliable relationships between land use change and recharge rates particularly in semi arid regions where water scarcity is a critical concern while the effect of natural vegetation conversion to agricultural land with respect to water resources has been well documented scanlon et al 2007 studies on water resources impacts of other land use changes not associated with cropland are less common in particular the effect of grassland conversions to forests on water resources need further consideration due to the recent expansion of afforestation efforts and future forest restoration plans all over the world including in the united states adane and gates 2015 eggemeyer et al 2009 huxman et al 2005 scanlon et al 2009 china gates et al 2011 huang and pang 2011 yang et al 2012 and india calder et al 1997 this study evaluated the impact of land use change from grassland to forest on historical recharge rates in a century old natural laboratory setting in the semi arid great plains hydrus 1 d was used to numerically simulate the plot scale water balance at representative grassland and forest sites the objectives of this study are 1 to obtain effective soil hydraulic properties for the grass and dense pine profiles through inverse modeling using field observations and 2 to evaluate the impact of grassland conversions to forests on recharge and the overall water budget 2 site description the nebraska national forest nnf bessey ranger district is located in the south central part of the nebraska sand hills nsh and within the northern part of the high plains aquifer fig 1 41 51 45 n and 100 22 06 w near halsey nebraska usa the high plains aquifer covers an area of 450 000 km2 and is ranked first in groundwater withdrawal for irrigation in the united states maupin and barber 2005 scanlon et al 2012 the nsh landscape is comprised mainly of eolian sand dunes that were deposited as recently as a few thousand years ago miao et al 2007 the soil is approximately 92 97 sand wang et al 2009 and that contributes to the greatest recharge rates in the high plains aquifer scanlon et al 2012 the native vegetation of the nsh region consists of mixed prairie grassland including little bluestem schizachyrium scoparium switchgrass panicum virgatum sand dropseed sporobolus cryptandrus and kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis and is suitable to the historical land uses of ranching and cattle grazing eggemeyer et al 2009 the climate is semi arid continental with mean annual precipitation ranging between 40 and 70 cm yr 1 and potential evapotranspiration ranging between 30 136 cm yr 1 szilagyi et al 2011 the nebraska national forest is the largest man made forest in the united states covering over 10 000 ha and it contains various coniferous tree species which were planted as early as the 1930s hellerich 2006 the forest is predominantly planted with ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and is surrounded by the native grassland ecosystem the grass g plot with 10 m 10 m dimensions is selected because the plot is the best approximation of the natural grassland conditions of the nsh within the forest fig 1 the dense pine dp plot contains ponderosa pine trees at density rate of 700 1000 trees ha 1 and represents the dominant change in land use from the native grassland table 1 the selected dense pine plot contains the greatest pine tree plantation density of the entire forest the forest also contains pine savannah and thinned pines plots with much less tree density that are thoroughly described in adane and gates 2015 and adane et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 model conceptualization hydrus 1 d šimůnek et al 2008 was selected to simulate the water balance in the soil plant atmosphere system at the two plots g and dp hydrus 1 d numerically solves the one dimensional water movement in the partially saturated soil domain fig 2 illustrates the modeling approach and conceptualization climate forcing data inputs are historical precipitation p and reference potential evapotranspiration et0 these atmospheric variables represent the climate inputs that are the same for all land use types the impact of specific vegetation cover on p and et0 depends on crop coefficient kc and leaf area index lai while kc converts et0 into specific crop potential evapotranspiration etp lai determines rainfall interception i and the partitioning of etp into potential evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp given the effect of foliage interception gross pgross and net pnet precipitation are differentiated in the remainder of this paper prior to running model simulations it is necessary to set up the soil hydraulic properties shps root distribution rd water stress function wsf parameters and maximum root depth zr for each specific vegetation type in this study the hydrus database default rd was applied where maximum root distribution is at the soil surface and minimum is at the bottom of soil profile maximum root depth was assumed to be 50 cm for grass and 200 cm for the pine tree respectively the shps were calibrated through inverse modeling by using sporadic daily measurements of soil moisture contents calibration was performed by using a global optimization tool namely

the hargreaves equation hargreaves and allen 2003 whilst precipitation is defined as gross precipitation pgross 3 2 2 leaf area index the leaf area index lai was measured for both the grassland and the dense pine plots the lai for the evergreen dense pine plot was determined to be 1 9 using hemispheric camera 360 images with ellipsoid campbell calculation method hellerich 2006 robbins 2005 this value was assumed as time invariant throughout the year the forest was planted in areas where the dense pine forests exist in non contiguous patches in a grassland setting the forest also contains parts that are pine savannah thinned pine and mixed vegetation patches with sparse pine trees with much lower average lai values ranging from 0 6 to 1 9 adane et al 2017 lai values of the grasslands were obtained approximately once every month through a destructive method where grass leaves removed from representative 0 25 m 0 25 m quadrant sub plots were scanned using li 3100 leaf area meter li

september 150 to 270 days and subsequently declines to 0 in late october 3 2 3 soil moisture data the time domain reflectometry tdr soil moisture daily measurements were collected once a month in both the grassland and dense pine plots using imko t3 probe imko micromodultechnik gmbh ettlingen germany the tdr instrument was calibrated to the local sandy soil properties the plot profiles extended to 220 cm depth at approximately 20 30 cm intervals and data collected from march 2005 to january 2012 were used in this study the historic record contained some missing data due to sensor malfunction and maintenance this resulted in a total of 66 readings over the span of 7 years that was used in model calibration and validation 3 3 hydrological model 3 3 1 model set up the water fluxes in the soil plant atmosphere system are simulated using the hydrus 1 d software package šimůnek et al 2008 which numerically solves the one dimensional richards equation for variably saturated soil moisture flow 2 θ t z k h z 1 ζ where t t is time z l is the vertical coordinate h l is the water pressure head θ l3 l 3 is the soil volumetric water content k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity and ζ l3 l 3 t 1 is the sink term function that describes volumetric macroscopic root water uptake the units adopted in this paper are day d and centimeter cm for the dimensions of time t and length l respectively the soil water retention function θ h is described by van genuchten s equation van genuchten 1980 3 h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m with mualem s condition mualem 1976 4 m 1 1 n where α cm 1 m and n are shape parameters θr cm3 cm 3 and θs cm3 cm 3 are residual and saturated water contents respectively using degree of soil saturation se which varies from 0 at θ θr to 1 at θ θs an expression for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function k se is given by 5 k s e k s s e τ 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where ks cm d 1 is saturated hydraulic conductivity τ is the tortuosity parameter assumed to be τ 0 5 mualem 1976 the potential evapotranspiration etp referred to the specific vegetation type is calculated by multiplying et0 by the specific crop coefficient kc subsequently etp is partitioned into potential evaporation ep cm d 1 and potential transpiration tp cm d 1 according to the following empirical equation 6 e p e t p e k l a i where κ is the dimensionless extinction

falls to the soil surface the soil profile which extends to 220 cm depth maximum depth of direct measurements of soil moisture is considered homogeneous over a single uniform layer with a set of effective soil hydraulic properties e g nasta and romano 2016 net precipitation and potential evaporation represent the system dependent atmospheric upper boundary conditions whereas free drainage is assumed at the lower boundary of the soil profile and is considered potential groundwater recharge r in this study direct measurements of soil moisture values along the vertical dimension at initial time step of model simulation represent the initial condition the term tp determines the potential root water uptake ζ h which is reduced through the feddes condition feddes et al 2001 two simulations are set up in hydrus 1 d a grass with kc 0 95 and 50 cm root depth and b pine with kc 1 0 and 200 cm root depth the feddes parameters were retrieved from the database available within in hydrus 1 d 3 3 2 model calibration and validation for each of the two simulations the effective soil hydraulic parameters featuring in van genuchten s relations eqs 3 5 are unknown and need to be estimated by inverse modeling the robustness of any optimization algorithm used for inverse modeling often determines its suitability for specific parameter estimation the first optimization routines were the local search algorithms such as the least square estimators like the one embedded in hydrus 1 d the results in these algorithms strongly depend on the initial guesses of each parameter value thus facing a high risk of early termination and failure in multiple local minima vrugt et al 2003 in order to eliminate the dependence on the parameter initial guesses there have been a series of robust global search algorithms to optimize soil hydraulic parameters one of the most popular techniques proposed in the scientific literature the differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm dreamzs coupled to the efficient markov chain monte carlo sampling scheme laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt 2016 vrugt et al 2008 is adopted in this study because a bayesian interpretation is more appropriate in order to infer the most probable set of parameters and their corresponding uncertainties moradkhani et al 2005 the bayesian statistical inference combines the data likelihood with a priori distribution to derive the posterior probability density functions of the model parameters the objective function φ p to be minimized in the optimization routine is defined as the root mean squared deviation rmsd which quantifies the discrepancy between observed and simulated soil moisture values 9 min p φ p z t 1 t t o t z 1 z t o t θ t d r z t θ s i m z t p 2 t t o t z t o t 1 where the vector p θr θs α n and ks contains the optimization parameters and the subscripts tdr and sim denote the observed and simulated soil water content values corresponding to soil depth z at observation time t for 66 days between 2005 up to 2012 at approximately one daily record per month maintenance months where data were not collected and data points that are unrealistically high were not considered hydrus 1 d model was implemented in dreamzs using the matlab environment the minimum and maximum bounds for the grass profile soil hydraulic parameters were selected based on field data for valentine sand unpublished pedotransfer function kettler et al 2001 and global sand textures reported by carsel and parish 1988 the soil hydraulic property bounds for the pine profile were further broadened in order to account for the impact of soil hydrophobicity adane et al 2017 ranges are shown in table 2 the main matlab text file selector in is automatically updated within the program with a new set of the five hydraulic parameters θr θs α n and ks that have to be optimized whereas the simulated water content values for each observation z depth and each time step t are retrieved from the text file obs node out the number of observed water contents were 660 in total and were recorded at 10 different depths and in 66 days distributed over 7 years a vector of 370 observed water content values 10 depths in 37 days collected over 4 years were used for calibration 2005 2008 and the remaining 290 10 depths in 29 days collected over 3 years were used for model validation 2009 2011 the performance diagnostic is quantified through the root mean squared deviation rmsd according to eq 9 4 results 4 1 soil moisture the soil moisture content was generally greater in the grassland plot soil profile than in the dense pine plot the total average moisture content for the grassland plot profile was approximately 13 ranging from 11 3 to 17 2 the dp plot soil profile was drier compared with the g plot with the soil moisture content averaging approximately 9 and the average for each depth interval ranging from 8 3 to 12 7 over the 7 year dataset the g plot profile had greater overall average soil moisture content for each depth interval by approximately 48 to 84 gravimetric measurements taken from soil profile cores in 2012 suggest that the average soil moisture contents were 8 4 for the grass and 4 5 for the dense pine profiles adane and gates 2015 however the low moisture values may also be partially attributed to the fact that 2012 was one of the driest years on record 4 2 historical climate trend the average annual precipitation for the 1950 2000 time period was approximately 57 0 cm yr 1 with the minimum of 35 8 cm yr 1 and the maximum of 82 3 cm yr 1 occurring in 1955 and 1977 respectively the annual historical precipitation data also deviated from the mean by approximately 12 5 cm yr 1 the decadal averages of the historical precipitation data suggest an increase in precipitation from approximately 53 cm yr 1 in the 1950s to 60 cm yr 1 in the 1990s the reference potential evapotranspiration rate estimates were substantially greater than the annual precipitation with an average of 114 0 cm yr 1 and standard deviation of about 5 0 cm yr 1 fig 4 illustrates the historical trends in annual averages of gross precipitation and reference evapotranspiration between 1950 and 2000 4 3 model calibration and validation results the calibration results comparing the observed and simulated soil moisture data subjected to observed net precipitation pnet and potential evapotranspiration etp daily values are depicted in fig 5 ten observed black stars θ values corresponding to each soil depth are reported at each time step while the gray bands signify the modeled θ values of the uniform soil profile corresponding to posterior probability density functions of the effective soil hydraulic parameters the most probable values of the three estimated effective soil hydraulic parameters correspond to the median values of their posterior frequency distributions and are reported in table 3 the θr and θs parameter estimates for the grass and dense pine profiles were 0 041 and 0 021 and 0 43 and 0 32 respectively the α parameter results were 0 077 cm 1 and 0 011 cm 1 while the n parameter results were 1 65 and 1 36 for the grassland and dense pine plot soil profiles respectively one of the most uncertain parameters in this optimization for both grassland and dense pine soil profiles was ks with values of 218 cm d 1 and 185 cm d 1 respectively since the study site generally consists of homogenous valentine sands the optimized ks values are reasonable and are consistent with unpublished field data ks 240 cm d 1 despite being much lower than the ks 713 cm d 1 reported for a global sand texture in carsel and parish 1988 while the coefficients of variation cv indicate greater confidence in the θr θs and n parameter 6 7 1 9 and 1 3 estimates uncertainties were greater for α cv 36 1 and ks 31 9 parameters table 3 the coefficients of variation were also notably greater for the pine profile and suggest that while the overall calibration is robust it could be improved by refining individual parameter estimates it is important to note that approximations applied in the model such as uniform soil profile estimated root depth and root distribution coupled with a coarse sporadic and at times non contiguous temporal resolution of daily observed soil moisture content data can generate epistemic errors and uncertainties nasta and romano 2016 the model simulations were essentially able to reproduce the hydrological dynamics and trends of the observed soil moisture contents in both vegetation plots reasonably well the rmsd values were relatively low 4 2 and 3 6 in the calibration and validation periods respectively for the grassland plot fig 5b similarly the dense pine plot soil moisture content calibration and validation processes resulted in low rmsd of 4 1 and 3 5 respectively fig 5c considering the calibrations were done based on a set of limited data the optimization was reasonably robust even though previous investigations have reported more robust performances wöhling and vrugt 2011 4 4 simulated historical recharge rate and water budget results fig 6 shows the average annual balance in terms of pgross percentages whereas tables 4 and 5 report the summary statistics of annual average water balance components for grass and pine respectively the average annual gross precipitation for the 1950 2000 time period was 57 0 cm yr 1 for the area the estimated vegetation canopy interception of gross precipitation was approximately 1 3 cm yr 1 in the grassland and 5 6 cm yr 1 in the dense pine plots and accounted for approximately 2 2 and 9 9 of gross precipitation respectively the grass potential evapotranspiration etp is lower than the pine because of the marginal effect of kc kc 0 95 for the grass and kc 1 for the pine and the considerable impact of lai on tp which is null for the grass plot during the dormant season the average annual actual evapotranspiration estimates were 45 9 cm yr 1 in the grass to 51 4 cm yr 1 for the dense pine plots the averages of total actual evapotranspiration rates represented 81 and 90 of the gross precipitation in the grass and dense pine profiles respectively these estimates are consistent with the results of szilagyi et al 2011 that reported the ponderosa pine plantations in the nnf evaporated 5 to 10 more than the average annual precipitation the average recharge rate estimates were 9 7 cm yr 1 for the grass and 0 07 cm yr 1 for the dense pine plots which represent 17 and 0 13 of gross precipitation respectively 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with recharge studies in the sand hills the historical recharge rate estimates were generally consistent with other field and modeled studies in the nebraska sand hills the average historical recharge rate estimated for the grasslands in this study was approximately 9 65 cm yr 1 and 17 of precipitation and is close to the results of crosbie et al 2013 which estimated 10 15 cm yr 1 and 20 30 of annual precipitation the recharge estimates for the grasslands were also consistent with scanlon et al 2012 that reported a range of 2 5 cm yr 1 to 21 0 cm yr 1 for an average of 9 2 cm yr 1 for the sand hills in the northern high plains while szilagyi et al 2011 estimated recharge rates to range between 3 7 and 4 9 cm yr 1 an improved model in szilagyi et al 2011 estimated an average rate of 7 3 cm yr 1 billesbach and arkebauer 2012 also reported 11 5 2 0 cm yr 1 for a grazed grassland site with no plantations located approximately 110 km from the present study site a chloride mass balance study used to corroborate the remote sensing results estimated 10 3 cm yr 1 for a sampling location closest to this study area near halsey ne szilagyi et al 2011 a study using soil moisture network data inverse modeling at halsey estimated an annual recharge rate of 5 0 cm yr 1 and 7 1 of precipitation wang et al 2016 a chloride mass balance and sulfate mass balance recharge study for the same plot used in this study also estimated 3 7 cm yr 1 and 10 0 cm yr 1 respectively for the grasslands adane and gates 2015 however the study conducted in the middle of a severe drought in 2012 contained considerably lower soil moisture contents compared to the long term soil moisture data obtained from tdr measurements and can potentially affect the final estimates of recharge a study that used chemical tracers mcmahon et al 2006 estimated that recharge rates for the sand hills grassland can exhibit a broad range between 0 02 cm yr 1 to 7 0 cm yr 1 while there have been a number of recharge studies in the sand hills the range of estimates can still vary drastically because of spatial differences in precipitation and temperature gradient as such careful considerations of averaged values and thoughtful geographical partitioning of the nsh will provide more valuable information on recharge rates and the water balance whereas few recharge estimates were available for the grasslands estimates for the dense pine plantations have been even rarer this study estimated almost negligible 0 07 cm yr 1 average historical recharge rates for the dense pine plot this result is consistent with the chloride mass balance method where adane and gates 2015 estimated the average recharge rate beneath the dense pine plot at approximately 0 7 1 0 cm yr 1 in reference to the dense ponderosa pine plantation in the nnf szilagyi et al 2011 reported that the plantations may evaporate more than annual precipitation suggesting that the recharge rate beneath the dense pine plantations may likely be negligible in a temperate climate in south western australia farrington and bartle 1991 estimated recharge beneath pines pinus pinaster was 11 4 cm 15 of precipitation but still 35 less than the adjacent woodlands in the semi arid mediterranean climate in spain bellot et al 1999 also estimated recharge beneath pine trees to be negligible sharma et al 1983 in australia reported that conversion from grassland to pines pinus radiata resulted in negligible recharge rates similarly holmes and colville 1970a b documented that conversion recharge rates beneath grasslands 6 3 cm yr 1 were reduced to 0 cm yr 1 beneath 24 year old pines the severity of reduction in recharge is influenced by the plantation density of the pine trees adane and gates 2015 reported that compared to the native grassland recharge beneath the sparse pine trees lai 0 3 was only reduced by 14 in the meantime recharge beneath the pine savannah lai 1 7 and dense pine trees lai 2 2 were reduced by 51 and 73 respectively comparing thinned and unthinned loblolly pine stands stogsdili et al 1992 found that increased moisture in the soil profile is more a function of reduced leaf interception loss and increased throughfall rather than reduced water use from the tree stands in addition to tree water use understory vegetation climate and soil type play important roles on the severity of recharge reduction 5 2 the impact of land use change on recharge and the soil water balance the annual recharge rates for the grassland and dense pine profiles from 1950 to 2000 are shown in fig 7 the impact of land use change on recharge rates and water balance was assessed through the difference between the native grassland and the dense pine plots indicating the change in the historical land use this change included an increased root depth from 50 cm in the grassland to 200 cm in the pine vegetation as well as increased canopy cover where the lai ranged from 0 to 1 2 in the grasses and 1 87 for the evergreen dense ponderosa pines these changes to the land use have increased average interception more than fourfold from 1 3 cm yr 1 to 5 4 cm yr 1 which are equivalent to 2 3 and 9 0 of gross precipitation such increase in canopy interception in trees is consistent with what has been reported by bosch and hewlett 1982 who found that canopy interception of 10 to 40 which was considerably less than the 25 40 reported for coniferous trees in the uk calder 2003 19 4 for pines in nepal ghimire et al 2012 and 17 in semi arid pine forest in portugal valante et al 1997 the conversion from grassland to dense pine vegetation also increased actual evapotranspiration from 45 9 cm yr 1 to 51 4 cm yr 1 which agrees with the conclusions of zhang et al 2001 who reported that greater evapotranspiration in forests than pasture for semi arid regions with less than 60 0 cm yr 1 precipitation the average annual actual evapotranspiration including interception losses accounted for approximately 83 of the average gross precipitation in the grass plot and approximately 100 in the dense pines profiles which are consistent with studies that estimated 90 in semi arid climates huxman et al 2005 szilagyi et al 2011 also estimated that evapotranspiration rates may exceed annual precipitation by up to 10 in the dense ponderosa pine of the nnf the average transpiration rates were 16 1 greater in the dense pine plot 21 8 cm yr 1 than in the grasses 18 3 cm yr 1 which is a conclusion consistent with other studies zhang et al 2001 bosch and hewitt 1982 the actual evaporation estimate was also 13 4 greater in the dense pine 29 4 cm yr 1 than in the grassland 25 3 cm yr 1 profile possibly in response to a 15 reduction experienced in soil hydraulic conductivity of the dense pine plot the results are consistent with allen and chapman 2001 and calder and newson 1980 who reported the rate of extra water loss by evaporation in forests is much more efficient than grasslands due to turbulent winds generated by trees greater evaporation losses in the dense pine plot may also likely be due to longer exposure to radiation and the atmosphere compared to the grassland conversely greater evaporation rates in grasses than trees have also been reported in kelliher et al 1993 where annual average evaporation rates were 0 46 cm day 1 compared to 0 40 cm day 1 in the coniferous trees likely due to the greater canopy cover of forests subsequently land use change through grassland afforestation has reduced the average historical recharge rate by approximately 100 from 19 65 cm yr 1 to 0 07 cm yr 1 and was in agreement with the results of adane and gates 2015 who reported reductions up to 90 for the same study site the recharge rate has also been reduced from 16 9 of precipitation in grasslands to 0 13 in the dense pine 5 3 sensitivity of groundwater recharge to maximum rooting depth root depth zr determines how deep plants can access moisture in the soil profile thus root depth has substantial influence on groundwater recharge and actual transpiration a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of changing zr on recharge the results indicate that groundwater recharge rate sensitivity to root depth was greater in the grassland plot than the dense pine as can be seen in fig 8 while both plots are sensitive to rooting depth it is important to note that recharge rates beneath the dense pine plot were considerably lower in general and practically negligible when maximum rooting depth exceeds 150 cm meanwhile increasing rooting depth to 220 cm reduced groundwater recharge by 14 cm in the grass plot if the grassland zr is altered from the original value 50 cm to either 100 cm or 10 cm r decreases by 39 and increases by 58 respectively it is also noteworthy that the grass plot with rooting depth at 220 cm produced more simulated groundwater recharge than the dense pines with extremely shallow 10 cm maximum rooting depth which further highlights the significance of the grassland ecology in the nebraska sand hills 6 conclusion this study was among a very few site specific investigations that evaluated the impact of land use change on recharge rates in the nebraska sand hills this study quantified the considerable impact that land use change has on recharge rates and overall water balance the conversion from the historical native grassland to forested land reduced recharge rate by approximately 17 relative to gross precipitation the actual evapotranspiration rates of the dense forest profile were also substantially greater than the grassland in response to increased canopy cover and greater root extinction depth the results of a sensitivity analysis indicate that groundwater recharge rate sensitivity to root depth was greater in the grassland plot than the dense pine evaporation rate was also greater under the dense pine profile partly due to lower saturated hydraulic conductivity value and longer exposure to ambient temperature and atmospheric demand proper consideration needs to be given to the intrinsic uncertainties in the data the simulations and the parameter assumptions the numerical model simulations did not consider the impact of preferential flow discretized layer with different soil hydraulic properties and hysteresis to mention a few while the uncertainties in this analysis may have contributed to the drastic conclusion the severe reduction in groundwater recharge as a result of land use change in the sand hills should attract the attentions of water resources managers who will need to consider management actions such as identifying tree species that are less water intensive optimum plantation density and adaptive forest management activities e g clearing and thinning directed at prolonging the vitality of the nebraska sand hills and the long term sustainability of the high plains aquifer in the effort to combat co2 emissions and global climate change many semi arid grasslands have been identified as suitable for future forestation programs worldwide this case study provides further evidence of the importance of grassland ecology to water resources particularly to groundwater systems thus the impact of these plantation efforts on water sustainability especially considering uncertainties in future climate projections in semi arid regions must be thoroughly considered conflicts of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the usda national institute of food and agriculture mcintire stennis project 1008861 the

8532,study region region in lower saxony north germany covered by the measuring range of the weather radar device located near hanover approx 50 000 m2 study focus this study investigates the performance of various spatial interpolation techniques for climate variables meteorological observations are usually recorded as site specific point information by weather stations and estimation accuracy for unobserved locations depends generally on station density temporal resolution spatial variation of the variable and choice of interpolation method this work aims to evaluate the influence of these factors on interpolation performance of different climate variables a cross validation analysis was performed for precipitation temperature humidity cloud coverage sunshine duration and wind speed observations hourly to yearly temporal resolutions and different additional information were considered new hydrological insights geostatistical techniques provide a better performance for all climate variables compared to simple methods radar data improves the estimation of rainfall with hourly temporal resolution while topography is useful for weekly to yearly values and temperature in general no helpful information was found for cloudiness sunshine duration and wind speed while interpolation of humidity benefitted from additional temperature data the influences of temporal resolution spatial variability and additional information appear to be stronger than station density effects high spatial variability of hourly precipitation causes the highest error followed by wind speed cloud coverage and sunshine duration lowest errors occur for temperature and humidity keywords climate data geostatistics kriging interpolation 1 introduction climate or weather information more generally is usually recorded as site specific point information by meteorological stations however the modelling of many processes in hydrology or environmental science requires areal input data or in many cases data for unobserved locations is needed spatial interpolation techniques are a reliable approach in order to estimate climate information for unobserved locations from nearby measurements many different techniques have been proposed for various climate information while the estimation performance depends not only on the selected interpolation method but also on other factors like station network configuration temporal data resolution spatial variability of the variable and whether a useful additional information can be incorporated into the interpolation procedure first investigations towards the issue of rainfall interpolation were carried out by thiessen 1911 who used polygons drawn around the locations of rain gauges on a station network map in order to obtain an estimation of rainfall based on the nearest neighbouring station shepard 1968 proposed a technique wherein the estimate is computed as a weighted average of adjacent rain gauges the impact of each station is defined according to the inverse of its distance from the location to be estimated geostatistical methods like kriging allow the consideration of the spatial correlation of adjacent observations for the estimation of unknown locations several studies reported that ordinary kriging can outperform simpler approaches dirks et al 1998 phillips et al 1992 tabios and salas 1985 moreover methods based on spline fitting have been applied hutchinson 1998a the fitting of three variate splines even allows for the incorporation of elevation data hutchinson 1998b the consideration of elevation as additional information resulted in a significant improvement of interpolation performance at certain time scales annual or mean annual precipitation was predicted using regression daly et al 1994 nalder and wein 1998 and geostatistics hevesi et al 1992a b lloyd 2005 martínez cob 1996 a study by goovaerts 2000 reported that the incorporation of elevation in various kriging methods can outperform linear regression as well as univariate interpolation for the estimation of monthly and annual rainfall quantitative precipitation estimates from weather radar was proven to be useful additional information in the interpolation of short term rainfall however radar data tends to be strongly biased seo et al 1999 and is prone to a variety of different measuring errors for instance a variation in the relationship between reflected energy and rainfall intensity changes in precipitation particles before reaching the ground anomalous beam propagation attenuation and clutter haberlandt 2007 as well as verworn and haberlandt 2011 applied kriging with external drift in addition to indicator kriging with external drift for hourly data and achieved an improvement compared with univariate techniques cokriging was applied by krajewski 1987 and provided slightly better estimation compared to using rain gauges only a further technique to combine radar and rain gauge data is the so called conditional merging approach reported by ehret 2003 according to sinclair and pegram 2005 it can efficiently reduce bias and error variance of quantitative precipitation estimates goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 compared different merging algorithms using daily rainfall data and preferred geostatistical techniques over univariate rain gauge interpolation and radar data adjustment techniques like mean field bias correction smith and krajewski 1991 overall kriging with external drift performed best berndt et al 2014 reported that conditional merging outperforms kriging with external drift and indicator kriging with external drift for temporal resolutions from 10 min to 360 min spline fitting price et al 2000 as well as regression based approaches nalder and wein 1998 taking into account the elevation were also applied for the estimation of air temperature and provided a better estimation quality than simple methods other techniques are based on a linear lapse rate dodson and marks 1997 stahl et al 2006 compared different approaches based on lapse rates and spatial interpolation they found that a combination of computing a regression based lapse rate and inverse distance weighting performed best hudson and wackernagel 1994 applied kriging with external drift for january averages of temperature and concluded that the incorporation of topography results in a substantial improvement of interpolation performance compared to univariate interpolation of station data other climate variables such as wind speed humidity and sunshine duration are less often studied regarding spatial interpolation issues however interpolation is often performed if exhaustive data sets are generated for a certain region jeffrey et al 2001 li et al 2014 most of the previous work focused in improving the interpolation performance for one specific temporal resolution of a specific climate variable a comparison of interpolation performances for different climate variables is difficult to find in the literature only some studies compare the interpolation performance among different station densities goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 krajewski 1987 nanding et al 2015 yoon et al 2012 and even fewer among different time scales bárdossy and pegram 2013 dirks et al 1998 although network density is considered to have a strong impact on the estimation accuracy additionally the spatial variability of certain climate information depends significantly on the accumulation time a combined evaluation of all influencing factors in order to provide a guidance for the choice of interpolation method depending on study area climate variable network configuration temporal resolution and intended data use is not available this paper aims at evaluating the different impacts on the interpolation performance for a region in north germany geostatistical techniques as well as simple methods are considered in the cross validation experiments that were performed here for observations of precipitation temperature relative humidity cloud coverage sunshine duration and wind speed different station network density scenarios as well as temporal data resolutions ranging from 1 h to 1 year were taken into account the paper is organised as follows chapter 2 contains a brief description of all interpolation techniques geostatistical approaches were considered since they are widely applied in hydrology and environmental science simpler techniques specifically nearest neighbour and inverse distance weighting are included as a standard for comparison chapter 3 describes the study region as well as data and their pre processing the cross validation strategy considering different network densities and the performance assessment of spatial estimation are presented in ch 4 all results of the analysis are shown and discussed in ch 5 while the main findings and conclusions are summarised in ch 6 2 interpolation methods 2 1 simple interpolation techniques the nearest neighbour interpolation technique nn also known as the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 is a basic interpolation approach that is often used for the spatial interpolation of rainfall data it can be easily applied for the interpolation of other meteorological variables as well each location to be estimated within the regarded domain is simply assigned with the closest available observation inverse distance weighting shepard 1968 is able to account for a simple spatial dependency in the interpolation of point observations it does not require an a priori investigation of spatial variability for the regarded variable in contrast to the more sophisticated geostatistical approaches the estimation of each unknown location is calculated according to 1 z u 0 i 1 4 λ i z u i the estimate z at location u 0 is calculated as a linear combination of the closest four measurements one station is taken into account for each quadrant based on u 0 northeast southeast southwest northwest the weights λ i are calculated according to the inverse of the squared distance of the corresponding station from u 0 2 λ i 1 d u 0 u i 2 i 1 4 1 d u 0 u i 2 with d u 0 u i representing the distance between the locations u 0 and u i 2 2 geostatistical approaches this section gives a short summary of the main concepts and basic assumptions used in geostatistical interpolation methods for further reading regarding the mathematical as well as statistical background the reader is referred to geostatistical textbooks for instance goovaerts 1997 and isaaks and srivastava 1990 all computations shown in this section were performed using the geostatistical software library gslib by deutsch and journel 1992 2 2 1 variogram estimation all geostatistical interpolation techniques need information about the spatial persistence of the variable prior to performing any estimations for unknown locations the investigation is carried out by calculating the empirical variogram and fitting a theoretical model in order to achieve this the difference in point pair data values is investigated depending on their spatial distance 3 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z u i z u j 2 with γ h being the variogram value of the distance class h n h representing the number of available point pairs belonging to h as well as z u i and z u j being measured values of the variable at the locations u i and u j separated approximately by h this spatial dependency measure is widely applied in geostatistics due to reasons of simplification the semivariogram is referred to as variogram henceforth theoretically a variogram model needs to be fitted for each time step of the variable that is interpolated however previous research by verworn and haberlandt 2011 showed that the choice of variogram has only a minor impact on the performance when continuous time series are interpolated they found that the use of event specific averaged variograms delivers a similar interpolation performance compared to using an individual variogram for each time step due to this average variograms were used here as well a standardisation with the spatial variance was carried out for each time step prior to averaging 4 γ avg h 1 n i 1 n γ i h v ar z t in this equation n is the number of time steps γ i h the variogram value for distance class h and of time step i and var z t is the variance of observations z t for time step t the exponential variogram model was used for all climate variables 5 γ h c 0 c 1 exp h a where a is the range c the partial sill and c 0 the nugget effect the r package nlme pinheiro et al 2016 was used for obtaining all parameters by an automatic fitting procedure a least squares approach was used while the same weight was assigned to each distance class 2 2 2 ordinary kriging ordinary kriging ok is the most common and most frequently applied interpolation technique in geostatistics it is classified as a univariate approach i e it only allows for the consideration of one data source and no additional information can be taken into account an important assumption is that the expected value of the underlying random function is equal within the entire domain the ok estimate is generally unbiased and calculated as follows z u 0 i 1 n λ i z u i where λ i is the weight of each of the n adjacent observations taken into account the weights are obtained by solving the kriging system 6 j 1 n λ j γ u i u j μ λ γ u i u 0 for i 1 n j 1 n λ j 1 here μ is a lagrange multiplier 2 2 3 kriging with external drift kriging with external drift ked allows the incorporation of one or more additional variables that are used as background information for the interpolation of the primary variable ked assumes that the expected value of the random function is linearly related with m additional variables y k u k 1 m 7 e z u y 1 u y 2 u y m u b 0 k 1 m b k y k u where b 0 b 1 b m are unknown constants the same estimator as for ok is used for computing the ked estimates however the kriging system for determining the weights is changed as follows 8 j 1 n λ j γ u i u j μ 0 k 1 m μ k y k u i λ γ u i u 0 for i 1 n j 1 n λ j 1 j 1 n λ j y u j y u where n is he number of neighbours m is the number of additional variables y k and μ k are the m 1 lagrange multipliers theoretically the variogram for ked should be estimated from the residuals z u m u however this is usually not a simple procedure since neither the residuals nor the trend m u is known a priori as it was also performed by haberlandt 2007 the experimental variograms for ked were inferred by a simplified approach i e using only the observations z u delrieu et al 2014 compared three different variograms for the merging of rain gauge and radar data using ked they found that the use of rainfall variograms as they are also required for ok results in a similar interpolation performance like the use of residual variograms obtained by applying the method of velasco forero et al 2009 only a pure nugget effect variogram resulted in a significant worsening of interpolation performance the ked procedure is applied for each time step independently when time series are interpolated the coefficients b 0 b 1 b m of eq 7 will thus vary in space and time which allows the consideration of a space time variable relationship between the primary variable and any additional information 2 2 4 conditional merging conditional merging cm is a specific approach for merging radar and rain gauge data it was first described by ehret 2003 and later adapted for simulated rainfall fields by sinclair and pegram 2005 according to berndt et al 2014 it outperformed other techniques for the interpolation of 10 min to 360 min rainfall accumulations the cm estimate is computed according to the following stepwise procedure 1 rain gauge data point information and gridded radar data are available 2 rain gauge observations are interpolated by ok onto the radar grid 3 radar pixel information are extracted for all rain gauge locations 4 pixel information at gauge locations are interpolated by ok onto the radar grid 5 the deviation between interpolated radar pixel information step 4 and the original radar field step 1 is computed at each grid point 6 the deviation grid step 5 is added to the interpolated rain gauge field from step 2 3 study region and data 3 1 study region and observation networks the study region is located within the 128 km range of the radar station hanover in lower saxony north germany fig 1 shows the location of the study area it is identical to the measuring range of the radar device located in hanover with an area of approx 50 000 m2 and covers a large area of the german federal state lower saxony as well as the entire federal city state of bremen moreover small areas of neighbouring federal states are included the northern part of the study area can be characterised as entirely flat being located in the north german plain the harz mountains are found towards the southeast of the study area and have a maximum elevation of 1141 m a s l according to the digital elevation model of the german federal agency for cartography and geodesy bkg which has been used in this study table 1 contains minima and maxima of long term averages for all meteorological variables considered in this study the ranges of the variables were determined from the daily station data provided by the german weather service deutscher wetterdienst dwd for each station the long term average temperature relative humidity sunshine duration wind speed cloudiness or the annual sums rainfall were computed minimum as well as maximum value within the study area are reported the dwd operates different nation wide station networks i e point related weather information is recorded at various locations the time period from 2008 to 2013 was used for the cross validation investigations of this study see section 4 this time span provided a relative constant number of stations for all meteorological variables except for the cloud coverage recordings the analysis of cloud coverage was conducted using a shorter investigation period i e the years 2009 2010 and 2011 the data of those stations which do not cover the complete study period were not taken into account however stations with time series that contained missing values for single time steps were considered in the evaluations table 2 contains a summary of all climate variables with the respective number of stations all data was obtained from the climate data center of the dwd the observation networks are presented in fig 2 a different number of stations is available for each meteorological variable 3 2 data pre processing daily rainfall observations were converted to longer time scales by accumulation to weekly monthly and annual rainfall sums the daily observations of other climate variables were averaged for the same time scales these long term accumulations and averages were used together with the hourly recordings for the cross validation analyses radar data of the c band instrument at hanover were provided as raw reflectivities with an azimuth resolution of 1 and a time discretisation of 5 min dx product of the dwd the pre processing is only briefly summarised here the same procedure as in berndt et al 2014 was applied a clutter correction was performed and the radar reflectivities were converted to rainfall intensities using a constant z r relationship according to 9 z a r b where z is the reflectivity in mm6m 3 and r the rainfall intensity in mm h the parameters were set to a 256 and b 1 42 according to the standard dwd relationship riedl 1986 seltmann 1997 thereafter a transformation from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates was performed all non clutter observation points were interpolated on a 1 km 1 km grid by using inverse distance weighting the gridded rainfall intensities in mm h obtained by application of the z r relationship were converted into the corresponding 5 min rainfall depths and a spatio temporal smoothing filter was applied in the same way as in berndt et al 2014 in the last step the smoothed 5 min radar grids were accumulated to all required temporal resolutions 4 cross validation strategy the interpolation performance was assessed by applying leave one out cross validation this method is based on a simple principle a successive estimation of all sampled locations is performed by using all other stations while always excluding the sample value at the regarded location 4 1 network density scenarios and temporal resolutions the cross validation experiments were performed for a wide range of network densities and temporal resolutions the time scales considered here are based on the temporal resolution of the observed data however coarser temporal resolutions were analysed as well in order to obtain a comparison of interpolation performance among different time scales the network density scenarios were defined according to the number of available stations for the investigation period cross validation using scenarios containing the same number of stations for instance 17 and 24 allows a comparison of interpolation performance among all climate variables table 3 contains an overview about all network density scenarios taken into account for each network density scenario the stations were selected randomly from the total available number of time series for each climate variable due to the variability of available stations among the climate variables the network density scenarios could not be defined in a way so that the exact same stations are used for each meteorological information in order to achieve a better comparability of interpolation performance among different climate information the cross validation analysis was based on ten realisations of each network density scenario i e the performance evaluation was carried out for ten different random subsamples that were drawn from the entire set of stations for each realisation the random selection of stations is designed in a way that the 17 stations of the lowest network density scenario are present in all other network scenarios as well the computation of the performance criteria see section 4 2 only takes into account observed and estimated values at these 17 locations however depending on the network density scenario more stations might have been used for calculating the estimates this slightly modified cross validation procedure allows the comparison of interpolation performances for different density scenarios using a different number of stations for calculating the interpolation performance of each network density scenario i e the entire number of stations in the scenario leads to a variation in the validation sample and impairs the comparability among the density scenarios 4 2 performance assessment the following performance measures were used to compare the estimations z and observations z for the n locations the simple bias criterion 10 bias 1 n i 1 n z u i z u i the root mean square normalised with the average of the observations 11 rmse 1 z 1 n i 1 n z u i z u i 2 and the rvar coefficient which indicates the preservation of variance of observed information 12 rvar var z u i var z u i 5 analyses and results 5 1 variogram inference fig 3 shows all theoretical variogram models that were inferred for this study using always all available stations for each climate variable see table 2 the variogram models are grouped by climate variable and the variograms for different temporal resolutions are correspondingly shown in the same panel all parameters of the exponential model are shown in table 4 an identical automatic fitting procedure was used for all variograms see section 2 2 1 a maximum value of 1 5 was used as the upper limit of the partial sill c in order to allow a stable fitting for precipitation only time steps with an average of 0 1 mm or higher were taken into account for the calculation of empirical variograms this ensures that time steps with no rainfall are omitted there is a general decrease of the nugget c0 with increasing time step in addition the results show a relationship between time scale and variogram range the lower the temporal resolution of the data the lower the effective range aeff of the variogram model the range obtained for the annual temporal resolution is particularly low this surprising behaviour might be caused by the automatic fitting procedure that has a strong impact on the resulting nugget parameter moreover the exponential variogram model is highly adjustable for low distance classes and accordingly the third data point distance 30 km γ 0 96 is affecting the shape of the model in a substantial manner in the case of mean annual temperature the fitting of the theoretical model is clear and simple for the hourly and daily time scale however the spatial persistence of monthly and annual data is not as obvious although there is a general increase of variogram value with increasing distance the variogram points scatter heavily around the theoretical model it can be concluded that the spatial persistence of annual mean temperature is lower than the spatial persistence of temperature averages for shorter periods the corresponding range parameter also indicates a stronger spatial dependency for short aggregation periods in contrast to rainfall there is no clear influence of the temporal resolution on the nugget effect c0 the lower parameter values of the partial sill c for monthly and annual data might result from the automatic fitting in combination with the indistinctive behaviour of the experimental variogram a clear spatial persistence is present in the recordings of relative humidity however the variograms tend to have relatively high nugget values in particular for the temporal resolution of 1 h the variogram obtained for hourly data has a higher range aeff compared to the variograms for other temporal resolutions it appears that the mean slope of the variogram is increasing with increasing time interval i e the annual humidity has a steeper incline of variogram value than the hourly humidity due to the high number of missing cloudiness values usually occurring at night a threshold of available cloud coverage recordings was established in order to filter out time steps with too few observations twelve non missing recordings had to be available for a time step to be taken into account like with temperature the spatial persistence is more obvious and clearer for higher temporal resolutions the variogram parameters obtained for the hourly temporal resolution differ significantly from the parameters for other time scales the nugget effect c0 and the range aeff are significantly lower however only the variogram point obtained for the shortest distance class causes this behaviour it might be explained by the different number of stations for hourly data and the implication that less point pairs are available due to this when comparing the variogram parameters from daily to annual temporal resolution it is noticed that there is a decrease in range and nugget effect for sunshine duration a threshold for the mean of the observations of 0 1 min and 0 1 h was established for the hourly and all other temporal resolutions respectively the idea was to leave out the time steps with no sunshine at all in order to compute a more accurate variogram the night time steps that are entirely without sun are removed hence by this constraint the spatial persistence of sunshine duration is clear and distinct for rather high temporal resolutions in the case of larger time scales in particular for the annual scale there are higher deviations of the experimental points from the theoretical model the decrease of spatial persistence with decreasing temporal resolution appears to be less strong compared to other climate variables a relatively high nugget effect c0 is seen for a temporal resolution of 1 h daily weekly and monthly average sunshine durations show low nugget values while the nugget value obtained for the annual time scale is slightly higher a lower interpolation quality of hourly sunshine duration is expected due to this in the case of wind speed the experimental variograms show an unclear behaviour for lower temporal resolutions and a decent spatial persistence for hourly data among all meteorological observations wind speed shows the weakest relationship between distance and similarity of recorded values for weekly monthly and annual data an objective manual fitting of the theoretical model was not possible since no clear behaviour is seen the cross validation of wind speed is carried out using the obtained variogram parameters regardless of the poor fitting result 5 2 interpolation performance a separate analysis of interpolation performance was performed for each climate variable nn invd ok and ked using different additional information were considered in the evaluations cm the specific merging technique for rain gauge and radar data is only present in the evaluations for precipitation in general the cross validation analysis was performed for ten realisations of each station density scenario and the performance criteria were averaged different additional information was used as a background variable in ked and the cross validation result is only shown for selected additional information in the following figures however all numerical cross validation results are shown in corresponding tables i e also the additional information that could not improve the interpolation performance in comparison to ok is presented the numerical values of all performance criteria are averaged over all network density scenarios for each temporal resolution 5 2 1 precipitation the cross validation results of precipitation are shown in fig 4 the performance criteria were computed for all time steps of each temporal resolution however only the average performance calculated from all time steps with a mean station rainfall higher than 1 0 mm is shown radar data was used successfully in several studies and is therefore taken into account here as one of the additional information being used in ked and cm due to errors in radar data and the absence of a thorough attenuation correction it is expected that the benefit of incorporating radar information might be restricted to certain accumulation times moreover a digital elevation model dem was taken into account as it can aid spatial interpolation the rmse performance is plotted on the vertical axis while the horizontal axes contain the information about temporal resolution and station density in addition the surface colour illustrates the relative improvement of interpolation quality with respect to ok there is a general decrease of interpolation performance with increasing temporal resolution and network density nn performs worse than ok for all combinations of temporal resolution and network density the relative difference to ok ranges from 17 1h to 35 1a the decline in interpolation quality is less strong for the network density of 200 stations invd performs similarly to ok i e for most network density scenarios and temporal resolutions the interpolation performance is around 1 to 5 however for the 200 stations scenario and for the hourly temporal resolution of the scenarios with 90 and 70 stations invd performs slightly better than ok using the dem as the only additional information in ked can improve the interpolation performance especially at the annual time scale whereas the rmse of ked is around 12 to 30 lower than the rmse of ok the improvement of monthly interpolation performance is somewhat weaker it ranges from approximately 5 to 12 on the weekly time scale there is only a minor benefit of using the dem while on the daily time scale the interpolation performance of ked is already slightly lower than those of ok for most network densities only for the scenario using 200 stations and the scenario using 90 stations is a minimal improvement seen in the case of hourly data the ked interpolation performance is approx 3 lower the results of ked based on radar data are different for the annual temporal resolution there is only a significant improvement of interpolation performance for the scenario consisting of 200 stations the other annual network densities show either a minor decrease or increase of interpolation performance the monthly and weekly time scales show each a slight improvement of around 5 for all network densities except for 200 stations here an improvement of around 12 is achieved the daily temporal resolution is improved by approx 6 17 stations to approx 12 200 stations in the case of hourly data the maximum benefit of using ked with radar can be quantified to 13 in comparison with ok however there is a strong decrease in interpolation performance of approx 10 for the network density of 17 stations ked using the additional information of both dem and radar results in an improvement of interpolation performance compared to ok for almost all combinations of temporal resolutions and network density scenarios only for a low station density together with hourly data it performs worse than ok ked using both additional information behaves for low temporal resolutions like ked using the elevation only for high temporal resolutions it is similar to ked using radar only however the performance of ked radar dem with an hourly temporal resolution is somewhat lower than the corresponding interpolation performance of ked radar cm performs best at fine temporal resolutions the hourly rmse values are approx 13 to 14 lower than those of ok also for low station densities an improvement in comparison to ok can be achieved cm and ok deliver a relatively similar interpolation performance for the daily temporal resolution i e for some station densities cm performs slightly worse in contrast to ked radar cm performs worse than ok at the weekly monthly and annual time scale only for 90 and 200 stations there is a slightly better interpolation quality of cm it is assumed that this different behaviour of cm in comparison to ked results from the more direct use of radar data implemented in the cm method ked uses the radar images in combination with station data to obtain the weights required for calculating the rainfall estimate based on adjacent station recordings in contrast cm computes a spatial pattern of radar rainfall and adds it directly to the ok estimate another difference between cm and ked radar can be observed from the hourly interpolation performance the rmse values of cm are relatively constant over all network density scenarios whereas ked radar causes a much higher decline of interpolation quality when fewer stations are used this behaviour might also be explained by the difference in the implementation of radar data the network density scenarios with few stations are not able to capture the skew and non gaussian spatial distribution of short time rainfall sums the more direct use of radar information cm can therefore achieve a better performance than the estimation based on a linear combination of neighbouring points in which radar is only used to determine the weights ked in contrast to the findings of goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 the interpolation performance of cm was not better than that of ok for daily data however it could be confirmed that ked using radar outperforms ok and cm table 5 contains the rmse bias and rvar interpolation performance for all interpolation methods and temporal resolutions the criteria are averaged over all network densities available for the corresponding temporal resolution since the bias criterion is given in mm the values are increasing with an increase of accumulation time for low temporal resolutions the application of geostatistical techniques produces a lower bias than using simple methods for hourly and daily rainfall accumulations the bias of radar based methods is somewhat higher compared to no radar data use ok shows a lower preservation of the observed variance in comparison to ked using the dem for low temporal resolutions and in comparison to ked and especially cm incorporating radar data for high temporal resolutions the smoothing effect of ok is also stronger than the one of invd since 12 neighbouring stations are used to calculate the rainfall estimates invd uses only four adjacent rain gauges the closest in each quadrant starting from the location of the estimate in general nn preserves the variance very well but delivers the worst interpolation performance according to the other criteria 5 2 2 temperature for mean temperature all available time steps were used in the performance evaluation the problem where many time steps have zero rainfall recordings does not occur with temperature recordings many studies reported that an estimation of temperature could benefit from taking into account the site specific altitude as such the dem was used within the temperature interpolation as well furthermore gridded information of relative humidity was used as an additional variable the evaluations in fig 5 shows that nn performs worse than ok for all temporal resolutions and network densities the decrease in performance compared to ok ranges from 13 to 50 invd performs only slightly worse than ok for most combinations of temporal resolution and station density i e the maximum decrease of interpolation performance is around 6 for monthly values there is an improvement of approx 5 when 24 stations are used the cross validation results of ked using the elevation and ked using interpolated grids of relative humidity are shown in fig 5 the humidity grids were interpolated using ok ked achieves a good interpolation performance for both secondary variables the estimation quality of mean temperature improves by almost 30 for hourly data to almost 70 for annual averages when the dem is used in the case using relative humidity as the additional information the improvement ranges from 8 to 23 generally the effect of network density on the interpolation performance is hardly visible in the plots i e there is no significant decrease when the network density is reduced from 37 to 17 stations the interpolation depends strongly on the temporal resolution however for some interpolation techniques there is no clear behaviour i e the interpolation performance does not always increase with decreasing temporal resolution as it happens for rainfall ked using elevation as additional information displays by far the best interpolation performance and delivers a continuous improvement of rmse with decreasing temporal resolution great improvements are especially seen at the annual and monthly time scale table 6 contains the bias rmse and rvar interpolation performance of mean temperature the abbreviations from table 2 are used if the respective climate variable was used as additional information in ked the bias of the geostatistical techniques is in general lower than the bias of nn and invd ok always delivers the best interpolation performance in terms of this criterion however ok also creates due to the rather high number of neighbouring stations taken into account a very smooth surface of the interpolated variable this is indicated by the lowest preservation of variance expressed by the rvar criterion invd and the two ked implementations achieve a similar interpolation performance according to this measure nn generates a higher variance than the one present in the observed values it is assumed that this is caused by the weather station located on the brocken the highest peak of the harz mountains this station has by far the highest altitude 1141 m with two neighbouring stations having elevations of around 600 m or less in the case of nn cross validation the temperature observation at the brocken station is taken as the estimate for both adjacent stations with a significantly lower altitude while only the temperature observation of one of the lower altitude stations is used as the estimate for the brocken location due to the smoothing effect or the additional information taken into account this phenomenon is not as severe as for the other interpolation techniques 5 2 3 relative humidity due to the relationship of temperature to dew point it is expected that the use of temperature information could help for the interpolation of relative humidity moreover the dem interpolated grids of precipitation as well as the number of wet 5 min time steps computed from radar were all taken into account for the evaluations ok was applied for the interpolation of rainfall grids since no interpolation method using either radar or the dem could achieve a consistent improvement of interpolation performance for all temporal resolutions and network densities the preparation of the temperature grids was carried out using ked since the incorporation of the dem improves the interpolation performance considerably as previously stated fig 6 illustrates the rmse cross validation results wherein the performance criteria were computed for all time steps of each temporal resolution and then averaged in order to determine the mean interpolation performance as for temperature all available time steps were used for the performance evaluation since there are no time steps with only zero recordings for all stations the evaluations show that nn and invd perform worse than ok for almost all temporal resolutions and network densities the nn interpolation performance is around 22 to 40 worse and there is a particular decline for the network density scenario consisting of 37 stations invd performs up to 8 worse than ok there is only a minor improvement of approx 3 for annual data when 37 stations are used the dem and interpolated grids of temperature and rainfall were used as additional information moreover the number of 5 min time steps with rainfall was computed from each radar grid point for each time step for all temporal resolutions and incorporated in ked as well for relative humidity the interpolation performance of ked using elevation improves only for some combinations of station density and temporal resolution in comparison to ok the maximum improvement approx 15 illustrated by the green colour shading occurs for annual data using 17 stations the decline in interpolation performance observed for some combinations of station density and temporal resolution reaches a maximum of 5 ked using ok interpolated rainfall data can improve the interpolation performance only at the annual time scale an improvement of 18 to 25 in comparison to ok is achieved for annual data while the interpolation performance declines by around 1 to 17 for the other temporal resolutions ked using temperature grids delivers a consistent improvement of interpolation performance for all temporal resolutions and station density scenarios the improvement ranges from 9 to 20 the estimation could not be improved by using the number of rainy time steps as an additional information in ked besides the additional information displayed in fig 6 sunshine duration and wind velocity were used in combination with ked the incorporation of both additional variables could not improve the rmse interpolation performance in comparison to ok either table a1 supplementary material contains the bias rmse and rvar interpolation performance for relative humidity it is also seen here that the simple interpolation methods nn and invd generate a higher bias than the geostatistical approaches ok again causes the highest reduction of variance while ked using temperature grids achieves a good variance preservation 5 2 4 cloud coverage sunshine duration and wind speed several additional information were tested for the interpolation of cloud coverage sunshine duration and wind velocity none of the variables could improve the performance in comparison to ok and thus figs 7 9 contain only the results obtained for nn and invd for all the variables the simple nn technique performs significantly worse than ok for cloud coverage and sunshine duration the decline of interpolation accuracy ranges from approx 21 to 36 while nn performs around 39 to 60 worse for wind speed invd performs slightly worse than ok for sunshine duration as well as cloud coverage the maximum decline of interpolation performance is approx 11 for cloud coverage and approx 5 for sunshine duration in the case of wind speed the interpolation performance is reduced around 29 to 42 here it seems implausible that the network density scenario based on 17 stations has a better interpolation performance than the scenario using 24 stations this irregular behaviour is explained by the cross validation setup of this study in combination with the high exposure of the weather station situated on the brocken mountain the performance evaluation was conducted for ten realisations of each station density scenario while the stations were selected randomly for the realisations of each scenario the brocken station is considered in all ten realisations of the 24 stations scenario and only in seven realisations of the scenario using 17 stations a significantly higher interpolation error for this particular station causes a reduction of interpolation performance for the concerned realisations and affects the corresponding average bias rmse and rvar interpolation performances are shown in tables a2 a4 supplementary material geostatistical interpolation techniques deliver a lower bias than nn and invd in most cases for cloud coverage and sunshine duration the smoothing effect of ok causes a strong reduction of the spatial variance while only nn can preserve it in its entirety for wind data nn and invd cause an overestimation of the spatial variance it is assumed that this phenomenon is also caused by the exposed location of the brocken station the observed value of this gauge is used as an estimate for two neighbouring stations in the same way as it was the case in the cross validation of temperature data 5 3 comparison among all climate variables the comparison of interpolation performance among climate variables is carried out for the best interpolation methods found in section 5 2 the results are shown in the upper panel of fig 10 the panel at the bottom contains the coefficient of variation that was computed for each time step of the different meteorological observations and their temporal resolutions the rmse performance criterion is used to compare the interpolation performance among the different climate variables this comparison approach is considered valid since the rmse is standardised with the mean of the observations for each climate variable it is carried out despite the fact that there is a natural upper limit of the observation range of sunshine duration cloud coverage and relative humidity in case of the hourly time scale the interpolation of precipitation generates the worst result with an rmse of approx 1 0 a good interpolation performance was achieved for relative humidity and mean temperature i e the rmse is lower than 0 1 for both wind speed cloud coverage and sunshine duration have a medium interpolation performance the interpolation performance of precipitation sunshine duration and cloud coverage improves significantly when examined at longer time periods for mean temperature as well as relative humidity there is a less significant improvement in contrast to all other variables the estimation of wind speed does not improve appreciably when longer time periods are interpolated on the weekly time scale the interpolation of wind speed is already slightly worse than the interpolation of precipitation in terms of annual performance wind speed interpolation gives by far the worst result it is assumed that wind is in general strongly affected by local conditions in particular by the topography that can cause either shielding or amplification effects depending on wind direction relative humidity has the lowest interpolation error for all temporal resolutions whereas the error of the mean temperature interpolation is slightly higher the boxes in the bottom panel of fig 10 contain the coefficients of variation that were computed for each time step of the corresponding climate variable and temporal resolution outlier time steps are removed to enable a better illustration of the spatial variability for rainfall the cv was only computed for time steps that have an observation mean value higher than or equal to 1 0 mm it is clear that the interpolation performance is strongly linked to the spatial variability of each climate variable moreover variance decreases significantly with a decrease of temporal resolution in general it is clear that the spatial interpolation of fine temporal resolution rainfall data is the most challenging task rainfall observations with high temporal resolution have a high spatial variability and the expected interpolation error is therefore much higher the interpolation error of humidity and temperature is in general the lowest in particular for temperature interpolation the dem offers reliable additional information that can improve the cross validation result 5 4 influence of station selection this section contains information about the effect of the random selection of stations on the interpolation performance in order to find out whether the location of the measurement is important the rmse cross validation performance obtained for the ten realisations of each density scenario using 17 stations is displayed in box plots the results of each meteorological variable are presented in a separate figure for all temporal resolutions the scenario of 17 stations is available for all climate information and therefore allows a thorough comparison among all meteorological information fig 11 contains the box plots obtained for the interpolation of hourly to annual rainfall sums while only selected methods are displayed for each temporal resolution nn and ok are always shown these simple univariate techniques are used as a standard of comparison to the best multivariate approach nn represents the simplest possible basic interpolation technique while ok is the most basic univariate geostatistical interpolation method cm is displayed for hourly data since it has shown the best interpolation performance for all other temporal resolutions ked which uses both elevation and radar data is shown as the third method there is a significant variation in interpolation performance among the random station selections for each temporal resolution and interpolation method nn generates a higher variation compared to the geostatistical methods ok and ked generate a similar variation in the error for daily and weekly data in particular one specific realisation causes a high rmse for the daily weekly monthly and annual time scale it is marked as an outlier for all methods and is explained by the high elevation and the corresponding high amounts of orographic precipitation of the gauge situated on the brocken mountain only one scenario contained this station since the random selection was drawn from 200 stations in total the variation of temperature interpolation performance is shown in fig 12 the ked method presented here used the dem as the additional information the variation in ked interpolation performance is significantly lower than the variation in nn and ok interpolation performance nn causes the highest variation while ok generates a medium range of interpolation performances the distribution of nn and ok interpolation performance appears to be skewed to the right i e a relatively good interpolation performance is achieved for most realisations of each temporal resolution while some realisations have significantly higher errors nn and ok do not consider elevation and therefore it is assumed that the weather station on the brocken mountain which is not considered in all realisations causes this behaviour fig a1 supplementary material shows the variation in interpolation performance of relative humidity it is clearly seen that nn creates the highest variation while the cross validation of geostatistical techniques in particular ked using temperature were able to provide a relatively robust assessment of interpolation quality a specific reason for the outlier caused by ked for hourly data could not be identified the results for cloud coverage are shown in fig a2 supplementary material the variation is relatively low compared to the meteorological observations shown before nevertheless the application of ok leads to a slightly lower spread of interpolation performances the range of sunshine duration interpolation performance is shown in fig a3 supplementary material the variations seem to be even lower than those obtained for cloud coverage it is assumed that the limited number of available stations additionally contributes to the low variation random selections were drawn from 25 stations only again ok causes a marginally lower variation of interpolation performance among the ten realisations compared to nn the distribution of wind speed interpolation performance seen in fig a4 supplementary material is highly skewed for all interpolation methods and temporal resolutions a relatively poor performance is reached for most realisations while some random selections which did not take into account the brocken station achieve a much better interpolation quality the range of interpolation performance is by far the highest when compared to other meteorological observations it is assumed that wind velocity is strongly affected by the local topographic conditions realisations that contain only locations with similar local topography therefore achieve the best interpolation performance a spatial interpolation using the entire set of available stations does not necessarily yield an optimal interpolation quality 6 summary and conclusions this study investigated the performance of different interpolation techniques for various climate variables observed by weather stations simple interpolation techniques nn invd and more sophisticated geostatistical approaches ok ked cm were taken into account for each climate variable different additional information based on topography other measurements and other factors were used within the multivariate interpolation techniques cross validation experiments based on different temporal resolutions and station density scenarios were implemented in order to determine the interpolation performance for each variable the main findings and conclusions can be summarised as follows 1 ked using radar as the additional information can improve the interpolation performance of rainfall in comparison to ok particularly for fine temporal resolutions of 1 h and 1 day in the case of low station density ked may perform worse than ok for high temporal resolutions ked incorporating the dem is especially helpful for long accumulation times but cannot achieve an improvement for high temporal resolutions cm delivers the best performance for hourly data but performs worse than ok and ked for temporal resolutions of 1 day or lower 2 ked using the dem performs significantly better than ok for temperature data for all temporal resolutions and station densities 3 ked using temperature grids delivered the best interpolation performance for relative humidity all combinations of station density and temporal resolution could be improved compared to ok the incorporation of precipitation grids could only achieve an improvement at the annual time scale 4 no useful additional information was found for the interpolation of cloud coverage sunshine duration or wind data the application of ok resulted in the best interpolation performance for all station densities and temporal resolutions 5 the simple approaches nn and invd cannot reach the interpolation performance of ok for most climate variables only for precipitation invd performs similarly well as ok if a very dense station network is available 6 the influence of the random station selection on the interpolation performance varies strongly on the climate variable that is interpolated in particular for wind speed a strong impact of the station selection was observed 7 moreover the interpolation performance depends generally on temporal resolution station density and the specific spatial variability of the climate information the influences of temporal resolution and spatial variability appear to be higher than the influence of station density 8 precipitation with a high temporal resolution shows the highest spatial variability and thus the worst interpolation performance for all meteorological variables except wind speed the spatial variability decreases with decreasing temporal resolution the best estimation accuracy is achieved for relative humidity and temperature all results were obtained from the interpolation of continuous time series i e the analysis of single events or short time step sequences might lead to different findings in particular when radar is taken into account for rainfall interpolation the study area is characterised by rather few topographic elevations for wind data in particular it is assumed that the interpolation performance might decrease even further if a more mountainous area is investigated the interpolation performance of temperature and relative humidity seem to be rather robust due to the consideration of the dem and the low spatial variability conflict of interest none

8532,study region region in lower saxony north germany covered by the measuring range of the weather radar device located near hanover approx 50 000 m2 study focus this study investigates the performance of various spatial interpolation techniques for climate variables meteorological observations are usually recorded as site specific point information by weather stations and estimation accuracy for unobserved locations depends generally on station density temporal resolution spatial variation of the variable and choice of interpolation method this work aims to evaluate the influence of these factors on interpolation performance of different climate variables a cross validation analysis was performed for precipitation temperature humidity cloud coverage sunshine duration and wind speed observations hourly to yearly temporal resolutions and different additional information were considered new hydrological insights geostatistical techniques provide a better performance for all climate variables compared to simple methods radar data improves the estimation of rainfall with hourly temporal resolution while topography is useful for weekly to yearly values and temperature in general no helpful information was found for cloudiness sunshine duration and wind speed while interpolation of humidity benefitted from additional temperature data the influences of temporal resolution spatial variability and additional information appear to be stronger than station density effects high spatial variability of hourly precipitation causes the highest error followed by wind speed cloud coverage and sunshine duration lowest errors occur for temperature and humidity keywords climate data geostatistics kriging interpolation 1 introduction climate or weather information more generally is usually recorded as site specific point information by meteorological stations however the modelling of many processes in hydrology or environmental science requires areal input data or in many cases data for unobserved locations is needed spatial interpolation techniques are a reliable approach in order to estimate climate information for unobserved locations from nearby measurements many different techniques have been proposed for various climate information while the estimation performance depends not only on the selected interpolation method but also on other factors like station network configuration temporal data resolution spatial variability of the variable and whether a useful additional information can be incorporated into the interpolation procedure first investigations towards the issue of rainfall interpolation were carried out by thiessen 1911 who used polygons drawn around the locations of rain gauges on a station network map in order to obtain an estimation of rainfall based on the nearest neighbouring station shepard 1968 proposed a technique wherein the estimate is computed as a weighted average of adjacent rain gauges the impact of each station is defined according to the inverse of its distance from the location to be estimated geostatistical methods like kriging allow the consideration of the spatial correlation of adjacent observations for the estimation of unknown locations several studies reported that ordinary kriging can outperform simpler approaches dirks et al 1998 phillips et al 1992 tabios and salas 1985 moreover methods based on spline fitting have been applied hutchinson 1998a the fitting of three variate splines even allows for the incorporation of elevation data hutchinson 1998b the consideration of elevation as additional information resulted in a significant improvement of interpolation performance at certain time scales annual or mean annual precipitation was predicted using regression daly et al 1994 nalder and wein 1998 and geostatistics hevesi et al 1992a b lloyd 2005 martínez cob 1996 a study by goovaerts 2000 reported that the incorporation of elevation in various kriging methods can outperform linear regression as well as univariate interpolation for the estimation of monthly and annual rainfall quantitative precipitation estimates from weather radar was proven to be useful additional information in the interpolation of short term rainfall however radar data tends to be strongly biased seo et al 1999 and is prone to a variety of different measuring errors for instance a variation in the relationship between reflected energy and rainfall intensity changes in precipitation particles before reaching the ground anomalous beam propagation attenuation and clutter haberlandt 2007 as well as verworn and haberlandt 2011 applied kriging with external drift in addition to indicator kriging with external drift for hourly data and achieved an improvement compared with univariate techniques cokriging was applied by krajewski 1987 and provided slightly better estimation compared to using rain gauges only a further technique to combine radar and rain gauge data is the so called conditional merging approach reported by ehret 2003 according to sinclair and pegram 2005 it can efficiently reduce bias and error variance of quantitative precipitation estimates goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 compared different merging algorithms using daily rainfall data and preferred geostatistical techniques over univariate rain gauge interpolation and radar data adjustment techniques like mean field bias correction smith and krajewski 1991 overall kriging with external drift performed best berndt et al 2014 reported that conditional merging outperforms kriging with external drift and indicator kriging with external drift for temporal resolutions from 10 min to 360 min spline fitting price et al 2000 as well as regression based approaches nalder and wein 1998 taking into account the elevation were also applied for the estimation of air temperature and provided a better estimation quality than simple methods other techniques are based on a linear lapse rate dodson and marks 1997 stahl et al 2006 compared different approaches based on lapse rates and spatial interpolation they found that a combination of computing a regression based lapse rate and inverse distance weighting performed best hudson and wackernagel 1994 applied kriging with external drift for january averages of temperature and concluded that the incorporation of topography results in a substantial improvement of interpolation performance compared to univariate interpolation of station data other climate variables such as wind speed humidity and sunshine duration are less often studied regarding spatial interpolation issues however interpolation is often performed if exhaustive data sets are generated for a certain region jeffrey et al 2001 li et al 2014 most of the previous work focused in improving the interpolation performance for one specific temporal resolution of a specific climate variable a comparison of interpolation performances for different climate variables is difficult to find in the literature only some studies compare the interpolation performance among different station densities goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 krajewski 1987 nanding et al 2015 yoon et al 2012 and even fewer among different time scales bárdossy and pegram 2013 dirks et al 1998 although network density is considered to have a strong impact on the estimation accuracy additionally the spatial variability of certain climate information depends significantly on the accumulation time a combined evaluation of all influencing factors in order to provide a guidance for the choice of interpolation method depending on study area climate variable network configuration temporal resolution and intended data use is not available this paper aims at evaluating the different impacts on the interpolation performance for a region in north germany geostatistical techniques as well as simple methods are considered in the cross validation experiments that were performed here for observations of precipitation temperature relative humidity cloud coverage sunshine duration and wind speed different station network density scenarios as well as temporal data resolutions ranging from 1 h to 1 year were taken into account the paper is organised as follows chapter 2 contains a brief description of all interpolation techniques geostatistical approaches were considered since they are widely applied in hydrology and environmental science simpler techniques specifically nearest neighbour and inverse distance weighting are included as a standard for comparison chapter 3 describes the study region as well as data and their pre processing the cross validation strategy considering different network densities and the performance assessment of spatial estimation are presented in ch 4 all results of the analysis are shown and discussed in ch 5 while the main findings and conclusions are summarised in ch 6 2 interpolation methods 2 1 simple interpolation techniques the nearest neighbour interpolation technique nn also known as the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 is a basic interpolation approach that is often used for the spatial interpolation of rainfall data it can be easily applied for the interpolation of other meteorological variables as well each location to be estimated within the regarded domain is simply assigned with the closest available observation inverse distance weighting shepard 1968 is able to account for a simple spatial dependency in the interpolation of point observations it does not require an a priori investigation of spatial variability for the regarded variable in contrast to the more sophisticated geostatistical approaches the estimation of each unknown location is calculated according to 1 z u 0 i 1 4 λ i z u i the estimate z at location u 0 is calculated as a linear combination of the closest four measurements one station is taken into account for each quadrant based on u 0 northeast southeast southwest northwest the weights λ i are calculated according to the inverse of the squared distance of the corresponding station from u 0 2 λ i 1 d u 0 u i 2 i 1 4 1 d u 0 u i 2 with d u 0 u i representing the distance between the locations u 0 and u i 2 2 geostatistical approaches this section gives a short summary of the main concepts and basic assumptions used in geostatistical interpolation methods for further reading regarding the mathematical as well as statistical background the reader is referred to geostatistical textbooks for instance goovaerts 1997 and isaaks and srivastava 1990 all computations shown in this section were performed using the geostatistical software library gslib by deutsch and journel 1992 2 2 1 variogram estimation all geostatistical interpolation techniques need information about the spatial persistence of the variable prior to performing any estimations for unknown locations the investigation is carried out by calculating the empirical variogram and fitting a theoretical model in order to achieve this the difference in point pair data values is investigated depending on their spatial distance 3 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z u i z u j 2 with γ h being the variogram value of the distance class h n h representing the number of available point pairs belonging to h as well as z u i and z u j being measured values of the variable at the locations u i and u j separated approximately by h this spatial dependency measure is widely applied in geostatistics due to reasons of simplification the semivariogram is referred to as variogram henceforth theoretically a variogram model needs to be fitted for each time step of the variable that is interpolated however previous research by verworn and haberlandt 2011 showed that the choice of variogram has only a minor impact on the performance when continuous time series are interpolated they found that the use of event specific averaged variograms delivers a similar interpolation performance compared to using an individual variogram for each time step due to this average variograms were used here as well a standardisation with the spatial variance was carried out for each time step prior to averaging 4 γ avg h 1 n i 1 n γ i h v ar z t in this equation n is the number of time steps γ i h the variogram value for distance class h and of time step i and var z t is the variance of observations z t for time step t the exponential variogram model was used for all climate variables 5 γ h c 0 c 1 exp h a where a is the range c the partial sill and c 0 the nugget effect the r package nlme pinheiro et al 2016 was used for obtaining all parameters by an automatic fitting procedure a least squares approach was used while the same weight was assigned to each distance class 2 2 2 ordinary kriging ordinary kriging ok is the most common and most frequently applied interpolation technique in geostatistics it is classified as a univariate approach i e it only allows for the consideration of one data source and no additional information can be taken into account an important assumption is that the expected value of the underlying random function is equal within the entire domain the ok estimate is generally unbiased and calculated as follows z u 0 i 1 n λ i z u i where λ i is the weight of each of the n adjacent observations taken into account the weights are obtained by solving the kriging system 6 j 1 n λ j γ u i u j μ λ γ u i u 0 for i 1 n j 1 n λ j 1 here μ is a lagrange multiplier 2 2 3 kriging with external drift kriging with external drift ked allows the incorporation of one or more additional variables that are used as background information for the interpolation of the primary variable ked assumes that the expected value of the random function is linearly related with m additional variables y k u k 1 m 7 e z u y 1 u y 2 u y m u b 0 k 1 m b k y k u where b 0 b 1 b m are unknown constants the same estimator as for ok is used for computing the ked estimates however the kriging system for determining the weights is changed as follows 8 j 1 n λ j γ u i u j μ 0 k 1 m μ k y k u i λ γ u i u 0 for i 1 n j 1 n λ j 1 j 1 n λ j y u j y u where n is he number of neighbours m is the number of additional variables y k and μ k are the m 1 lagrange multipliers theoretically the variogram for ked should be estimated from the residuals z u m u however this is usually not a simple procedure since neither the residuals nor the trend m u is known a priori as it was also performed by haberlandt 2007 the experimental variograms for ked were inferred by a simplified approach i e using only the observations z u delrieu et al 2014 compared three different variograms for the merging of rain gauge and radar data using ked they found that the use of rainfall variograms as they are also required for ok results in a similar interpolation performance like the use of residual variograms obtained by applying the method of velasco forero et al 2009 only a pure nugget effect variogram resulted in a significant worsening of interpolation performance the ked procedure is applied for each time step independently when time series are interpolated the coefficients b 0 b 1 b m of eq 7 will thus vary in space and time which allows the consideration of a space time variable relationship between the primary variable and any additional information 2 2 4 conditional merging conditional merging cm is a specific approach for merging radar and rain gauge data it was first described by ehret 2003 and later adapted for simulated rainfall fields by sinclair and pegram 2005 according to berndt et al 2014 it outperformed other techniques for the interpolation of 10 min to 360 min rainfall accumulations the cm estimate is computed according to the following stepwise procedure 1 rain gauge data point information and gridded radar data are available 2 rain gauge observations are interpolated by ok onto the radar grid 3 radar pixel information are extracted for all rain gauge locations 4 pixel information at gauge locations are interpolated by ok onto the radar grid 5 the deviation between interpolated radar pixel information step 4 and the original radar field step 1 is computed at each grid point 6 the deviation grid step 5 is added to the interpolated rain gauge field from step 2 3 study region and data 3 1 study region and observation networks the study region is located within the 128 km range of the radar station hanover in lower saxony north germany fig 1 shows the location of the study area it is identical to the measuring range of the radar device located in hanover with an area of approx 50 000 m2 and covers a large area of the german federal state lower saxony as well as the entire federal city state of bremen moreover small areas of neighbouring federal states are included the northern part of the study area can be characterised as entirely flat being located in the north german plain the harz mountains are found towards the southeast of the study area and have a maximum elevation of 1141 m a s l according to the digital elevation model of the german federal agency for cartography and geodesy bkg which has been used in this study table 1 contains minima and maxima of long term averages for all meteorological variables considered in this study the ranges of the variables were determined from the daily station data provided by the german weather service deutscher wetterdienst dwd for each station the long term average temperature relative humidity sunshine duration wind speed cloudiness or the annual sums rainfall were computed minimum as well as maximum value within the study area are reported the dwd operates different nation wide station networks i e point related weather information is recorded at various locations the time period from 2008 to 2013 was used for the cross validation investigations of this study see section 4 this time span provided a relative constant number of stations for all meteorological variables except for the cloud coverage recordings the analysis of cloud coverage was conducted using a shorter investigation period i e the years 2009 2010 and 2011 the data of those stations which do not cover the complete study period were not taken into account however stations with time series that contained missing values for single time steps were considered in the evaluations table 2 contains a summary of all climate variables with the respective number of stations all data was obtained from the climate data center of the dwd the observation networks are presented in fig 2 a different number of stations is available for each meteorological variable 3 2 data pre processing daily rainfall observations were converted to longer time scales by accumulation to weekly monthly and annual rainfall sums the daily observations of other climate variables were averaged for the same time scales these long term accumulations and averages were used together with the hourly recordings for the cross validation analyses radar data of the c band instrument at hanover were provided as raw reflectivities with an azimuth resolution of 1 and a time discretisation of 5 min dx product of the dwd the pre processing is only briefly summarised here the same procedure as in berndt et al 2014 was applied a clutter correction was performed and the radar reflectivities were converted to rainfall intensities using a constant z r relationship according to 9 z a r b where z is the reflectivity in mm6m 3 and r the rainfall intensity in mm h the parameters were set to a 256 and b 1 42 according to the standard dwd relationship riedl 1986 seltmann 1997 thereafter a transformation from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates was performed all non clutter observation points were interpolated on a 1 km 1 km grid by using inverse distance weighting the gridded rainfall intensities in mm h obtained by application of the z r relationship were converted into the corresponding 5 min rainfall depths and a spatio temporal smoothing filter was applied in the same way as in berndt et al 2014 in the last step the smoothed 5 min radar grids were accumulated to all required temporal resolutions 4 cross validation strategy the interpolation performance was assessed by applying leave one out cross validation this method is based on a simple principle a successive estimation of all sampled locations is performed by using all other stations while always excluding the sample value at the regarded location 4 1 network density scenarios and temporal resolutions the cross validation experiments were performed for a wide range of network densities and temporal resolutions the time scales considered here are based on the temporal resolution of the observed data however coarser temporal resolutions were analysed as well in order to obtain a comparison of interpolation performance among different time scales the network density scenarios were defined according to the number of available stations for the investigation period cross validation using scenarios containing the same number of stations for instance 17 and 24 allows a comparison of interpolation performance among all climate variables table 3 contains an overview about all network density scenarios taken into account for each network density scenario the stations were selected randomly from the total available number of time series for each climate variable due to the variability of available stations among the climate variables the network density scenarios could not be defined in a way so that the exact same stations are used for each meteorological information in order to achieve a better comparability of interpolation performance among different climate information the cross validation analysis was based on ten realisations of each network density scenario i e the performance evaluation was carried out for ten different random subsamples that were drawn from the entire set of stations for each realisation the random selection of stations is designed in a way that the 17 stations of the lowest network density scenario are present in all other network scenarios as well the computation of the performance criteria see section 4 2 only takes into account observed and estimated values at these 17 locations however depending on the network density scenario more stations might have been used for calculating the estimates this slightly modified cross validation procedure allows the comparison of interpolation performances for different density scenarios using a different number of stations for calculating the interpolation performance of each network density scenario i e the entire number of stations in the scenario leads to a variation in the validation sample and impairs the comparability among the density scenarios 4 2 performance assessment the following performance measures were used to compare the estimations z and observations z for the n locations the simple bias criterion 10 bias 1 n i 1 n z u i z u i the root mean square normalised with the average of the observations 11 rmse 1 z 1 n i 1 n z u i z u i 2 and the rvar coefficient which indicates the preservation of variance of observed information 12 rvar var z u i var z u i 5 analyses and results 5 1 variogram inference fig 3 shows all theoretical variogram models that were inferred for this study using always all available stations for each climate variable see table 2 the variogram models are grouped by climate variable and the variograms for different temporal resolutions are correspondingly shown in the same panel all parameters of the exponential model are shown in table 4 an identical automatic fitting procedure was used for all variograms see section 2 2 1 a maximum value of 1 5 was used as the upper limit of the partial sill c in order to allow a stable fitting for precipitation only time steps with an average of 0 1 mm or higher were taken into account for the calculation of empirical variograms this ensures that time steps with no rainfall are omitted there is a general decrease of the nugget c0 with increasing time step in addition the results show a relationship between time scale and variogram range the lower the temporal resolution of the data the lower the effective range aeff of the variogram model the range obtained for the annual temporal resolution is particularly low this surprising behaviour might be caused by the automatic fitting procedure that has a strong impact on the resulting nugget parameter moreover the exponential variogram model is highly adjustable for low distance classes and accordingly the third data point distance 30 km γ 0 96 is affecting the shape of the model in a substantial manner in the case of mean annual temperature the fitting of the theoretical model is clear and simple for the hourly and daily time scale however the spatial persistence of monthly and annual data is not as obvious although there is a general increase of variogram value with increasing distance the variogram points scatter heavily around the theoretical model it can be concluded that the spatial persistence of annual mean temperature is lower than the spatial persistence of temperature averages for shorter periods the corresponding range parameter also indicates a stronger spatial dependency for short aggregation periods in contrast to rainfall there is no clear influence of the temporal resolution on the nugget effect c0 the lower parameter values of the partial sill c for monthly and annual data might result from the automatic fitting in combination with the indistinctive behaviour of the experimental variogram a clear spatial persistence is present in the recordings of relative humidity however the variograms tend to have relatively high nugget values in particular for the temporal resolution of 1 h the variogram obtained for hourly data has a higher range aeff compared to the variograms for other temporal resolutions it appears that the mean slope of the variogram is increasing with increasing time interval i e the annual humidity has a steeper incline of variogram value than the hourly humidity due to the high number of missing cloudiness values usually occurring at night a threshold of available cloud coverage recordings was established in order to filter out time steps with too few observations twelve non missing recordings had to be available for a time step to be taken into account like with temperature the spatial persistence is more obvious and clearer for higher temporal resolutions the variogram parameters obtained for the hourly temporal resolution differ significantly from the parameters for other time scales the nugget effect c0 and the range aeff are significantly lower however only the variogram point obtained for the shortest distance class causes this behaviour it might be explained by the different number of stations for hourly data and the implication that less point pairs are available due to this when comparing the variogram parameters from daily to annual temporal resolution it is noticed that there is a decrease in range and nugget effect for sunshine duration a threshold for the mean of the observations of 0 1 min and 0 1 h was established for the hourly and all other temporal resolutions respectively the idea was to leave out the time steps with no sunshine at all in order to compute a more accurate variogram the night time steps that are entirely without sun are removed hence by this constraint the spatial persistence of sunshine duration is clear and distinct for rather high temporal resolutions in the case of larger time scales in particular for the annual scale there are higher deviations of the experimental points from the theoretical model the decrease of spatial persistence with decreasing temporal resolution appears to be less strong compared to other climate variables a relatively high nugget effect c0 is seen for a temporal resolution of 1 h daily weekly and monthly average sunshine durations show low nugget values while the nugget value obtained for the annual time scale is slightly higher a lower interpolation quality of hourly sunshine duration is expected due to this in the case of wind speed the experimental variograms show an unclear behaviour for lower temporal resolutions and a decent spatial persistence for hourly data among all meteorological observations wind speed shows the weakest relationship between distance and similarity of recorded values for weekly monthly and annual data an objective manual fitting of the theoretical model was not possible since no clear behaviour is seen the cross validation of wind speed is carried out using the obtained variogram parameters regardless of the poor fitting result 5 2 interpolation performance a separate analysis of interpolation performance was performed for each climate variable nn invd ok and ked using different additional information were considered in the evaluations cm the specific merging technique for rain gauge and radar data is only present in the evaluations for precipitation in general the cross validation analysis was performed for ten realisations of each station density scenario and the performance criteria were averaged different additional information was used as a background variable in ked and the cross validation result is only shown for selected additional information in the following figures however all numerical cross validation results are shown in corresponding tables i e also the additional information that could not improve the interpolation performance in comparison to ok is presented the numerical values of all performance criteria are averaged over all network density scenarios for each temporal resolution 5 2 1 precipitation the cross validation results of precipitation are shown in fig 4 the performance criteria were computed for all time steps of each temporal resolution however only the average performance calculated from all time steps with a mean station rainfall higher than 1 0 mm is shown radar data was used successfully in several studies and is therefore taken into account here as one of the additional information being used in ked and cm due to errors in radar data and the absence of a thorough attenuation correction it is expected that the benefit of incorporating radar information might be restricted to certain accumulation times moreover a digital elevation model dem was taken into account as it can aid spatial interpolation the rmse performance is plotted on the vertical axis while the horizontal axes contain the information about temporal resolution and station density in addition the surface colour illustrates the relative improvement of interpolation quality with respect to ok there is a general decrease of interpolation performance with increasing temporal resolution and network density nn performs worse than ok for all combinations of temporal resolution and network density the relative difference to ok ranges from 17 1h to 35 1a the decline in interpolation quality is less strong for the network density of 200 stations invd performs similarly to ok i e for most network density scenarios and temporal resolutions the interpolation performance is around 1 to 5 however for the 200 stations scenario and for the hourly temporal resolution of the scenarios with 90 and 70 stations invd performs slightly better than ok using the dem as the only additional information in ked can improve the interpolation performance especially at the annual time scale whereas the rmse of ked is around 12 to 30 lower than the rmse of ok the improvement of monthly interpolation performance is somewhat weaker it ranges from approximately 5 to 12 on the weekly time scale there is only a minor benefit of using the dem while on the daily time scale the interpolation performance of ked is already slightly lower than those of ok for most network densities only for the scenario using 200 stations and the scenario using 90 stations is a minimal improvement seen in the case of hourly data the ked interpolation performance is approx 3 lower the results of ked based on radar data are different for the annual temporal resolution there is only a significant improvement of interpolation performance for the scenario consisting of 200 stations the other annual network densities show either a minor decrease or increase of interpolation performance the monthly and weekly time scales show each a slight improvement of around 5 for all network densities except for 200 stations here an improvement of around 12 is achieved the daily temporal resolution is improved by approx 6 17 stations to approx 12 200 stations in the case of hourly data the maximum benefit of using ked with radar can be quantified to 13 in comparison with ok however there is a strong decrease in interpolation performance of approx 10 for the network density of 17 stations ked using the additional information of both dem and radar results in an improvement of interpolation performance compared to ok for almost all combinations of temporal resolutions and network density scenarios only for a low station density together with hourly data it performs worse than ok ked using both additional information behaves for low temporal resolutions like ked using the elevation only for high temporal resolutions it is similar to ked using radar only however the performance of ked radar dem with an hourly temporal resolution is somewhat lower than the corresponding interpolation performance of ked radar cm performs best at fine temporal resolutions the hourly rmse values are approx 13 to 14 lower than those of ok also for low station densities an improvement in comparison to ok can be achieved cm and ok deliver a relatively similar interpolation performance for the daily temporal resolution i e for some station densities cm performs slightly worse in contrast to ked radar cm performs worse than ok at the weekly monthly and annual time scale only for 90 and 200 stations there is a slightly better interpolation quality of cm it is assumed that this different behaviour of cm in comparison to ked results from the more direct use of radar data implemented in the cm method ked uses the radar images in combination with station data to obtain the weights required for calculating the rainfall estimate based on adjacent station recordings in contrast cm computes a spatial pattern of radar rainfall and adds it directly to the ok estimate another difference between cm and ked radar can be observed from the hourly interpolation performance the rmse values of cm are relatively constant over all network density scenarios whereas ked radar causes a much higher decline of interpolation quality when fewer stations are used this behaviour might also be explained by the difference in the implementation of radar data the network density scenarios with few stations are not able to capture the skew and non gaussian spatial distribution of short time rainfall sums the more direct use of radar information cm can therefore achieve a better performance than the estimation based on a linear combination of neighbouring points in which radar is only used to determine the weights ked in contrast to the findings of goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 the interpolation performance of cm was not better than that of ok for daily data however it could be confirmed that ked using radar outperforms ok and cm table 5 contains the rmse bias and rvar interpolation performance for all interpolation methods and temporal resolutions the criteria are averaged over all network densities available for the corresponding temporal resolution since the bias criterion is given in mm the values are increasing with an increase of accumulation time for low temporal resolutions the application of geostatistical techniques produces a lower bias than using simple methods for hourly and daily rainfall accumulations the bias of radar based methods is somewhat higher compared to no radar data use ok shows a lower preservation of the observed variance in comparison to ked using the dem for low temporal resolutions and in comparison to ked and especially cm incorporating radar data for high temporal resolutions the smoothing effect of ok is also stronger than the one of invd since 12 neighbouring stations are used to calculate the rainfall estimates invd uses only four adjacent rain gauges the closest in each quadrant starting from the location of the estimate in general nn preserves the variance very well but delivers the worst interpolation performance according to the other criteria 5 2 2 temperature for mean temperature all available time steps were used in the performance evaluation the problem where many time steps have zero rainfall recordings does not occur with temperature recordings many studies reported that an estimation of temperature could benefit from taking into account the site specific altitude as such the dem was used within the temperature interpolation as well furthermore gridded information of relative humidity was used as an additional variable the evaluations in fig 5 shows that nn performs worse than ok for all temporal resolutions and network densities the decrease in performance compared to ok ranges from 13 to 50 invd performs only slightly worse than ok for most combinations of temporal resolution and station density i e the maximum decrease of interpolation performance is around 6 for monthly values there is an improvement of approx 5 when 24 stations are used the cross validation results of ked using the elevation and ked using interpolated grids of relative humidity are shown in fig 5 the humidity grids were interpolated using ok ked achieves a good interpolation performance for both secondary variables the estimation quality of mean temperature improves by almost 30 for hourly data to almost 70 for annual averages when the dem is used in the case using relative humidity as the additional information the improvement ranges from 8 to 23 generally the effect of network density on the interpolation performance is hardly visible in the plots i e there is no significant decrease when the network density is reduced from 37 to 17 stations the interpolation depends strongly on the temporal resolution however for some interpolation techniques there is no clear behaviour i e the interpolation performance does not always increase with decreasing temporal resolution as it happens for rainfall ked using elevation as additional information displays by far the best interpolation performance and delivers a continuous improvement of rmse with decreasing temporal resolution great improvements are especially seen at the annual and monthly time scale table 6 contains the bias rmse and rvar interpolation performance of mean temperature the abbreviations from table 2 are used if the respective climate variable was used as additional information in ked the bias of the geostatistical techniques is in general lower than the bias of nn and invd ok always delivers the best interpolation performance in terms of this criterion however ok also creates due to the rather high number of neighbouring stations taken into account a very smooth surface of the interpolated variable this is indicated by the lowest preservation of variance expressed by the rvar criterion invd and the two ked implementations achieve a similar interpolation performance according to this measure nn generates a higher variance than the one present in the observed values it is assumed that this is caused by the weather station located on the brocken the highest peak of the harz mountains this station has by far the highest altitude 1141 m with two neighbouring stations having elevations of around 600 m or less in the case of nn cross validation the temperature observation at the brocken station is taken as the estimate for both adjacent stations with a significantly lower altitude while only the temperature observation of one of the lower altitude stations is used as the estimate for the brocken location due to the smoothing effect or the additional information taken into account this phenomenon is not as severe as for the other interpolation techniques 5 2 3 relative humidity due to the relationship of temperature to dew point it is expected that the use of temperature information could help for the interpolation of relative humidity moreover the dem interpolated grids of precipitation as well as the number of wet 5 min time steps computed from radar were all taken into account for the evaluations ok was applied for the interpolation of rainfall grids since no interpolation method using either radar or the dem could achieve a consistent improvement of interpolation performance for all temporal resolutions and network densities the preparation of the temperature grids was carried out using ked since the incorporation of the dem improves the interpolation performance considerably as previously stated fig 6 illustrates the rmse cross validation results wherein the performance criteria were computed for all time steps of each temporal resolution and then averaged in order to determine the mean interpolation performance as for temperature all available time steps were used for the performance evaluation since there are no time steps with only zero recordings for all stations the evaluations show that nn and invd perform worse than ok for almost all temporal resolutions and network densities the nn interpolation performance is around 22 to 40 worse and there is a particular decline for the network density scenario consisting of 37 stations invd performs up to 8 worse than ok there is only a minor improvement of approx 3 for annual data when 37 stations are used the dem and interpolated grids of temperature and rainfall were used as additional information moreover the number of 5 min time steps with rainfall was computed from each radar grid point for each time step for all temporal resolutions and incorporated in ked as well for relative humidity the interpolation performance of ked using elevation improves only for some combinations of station density and temporal resolution in comparison to ok the maximum improvement approx 15 illustrated by the green colour shading occurs for annual data using 17 stations the decline in interpolation performance observed for some combinations of station density and temporal resolution reaches a maximum of 5 ked using ok interpolated rainfall data can improve the interpolation performance only at the annual time scale an improvement of 18 to 25 in comparison to ok is achieved for annual data while the interpolation performance declines by around 1 to 17 for the other temporal resolutions ked using temperature grids delivers a consistent improvement of interpolation performance for all temporal resolutions and station density scenarios the improvement ranges from 9 to 20 the estimation could not be improved by using the number of rainy time steps as an additional information in ked besides the additional information displayed in fig 6 sunshine duration and wind velocity were used in combination with ked the incorporation of both additional variables could not improve the rmse interpolation performance in comparison to ok either table a1 supplementary material contains the bias rmse and rvar interpolation performance for relative humidity it is also seen here that the simple interpolation methods nn and invd generate a higher bias than the geostatistical approaches ok again causes the highest reduction of variance while ked using temperature grids achieves a good variance preservation 5 2 4 cloud coverage sunshine duration and wind speed several additional information were tested for the interpolation of cloud coverage sunshine duration and wind velocity none of the variables could improve the performance in comparison to ok and thus figs 7 9 contain only the results obtained for nn and invd for all the variables the simple nn technique performs significantly worse than ok for cloud coverage and sunshine duration the decline of interpolation accuracy ranges from approx 21 to 36 while nn performs around 39 to 60 worse for wind speed invd performs slightly worse than ok for sunshine duration as well as cloud coverage the maximum decline of interpolation performance is approx 11 for cloud coverage and approx 5 for sunshine duration in the case of wind speed the interpolation performance is reduced around 29 to 42 here it seems implausible that the network density scenario based on 17 stations has a better interpolation performance than the scenario using 24 stations this irregular behaviour is explained by the cross validation setup of this study in combination with the high exposure of the weather station situated on the brocken mountain the performance evaluation was conducted for ten realisations of each station density scenario while the stations were selected randomly for the realisations of each scenario the brocken station is considered in all ten realisations of the 24 stations scenario and only in seven realisations of the scenario using 17 stations a significantly higher interpolation error for this particular station causes a reduction of interpolation performance for the concerned realisations and affects the corresponding average bias rmse and rvar interpolation performances are shown in tables a2 a4 supplementary material geostatistical interpolation techniques deliver a lower bias than nn and invd in most cases for cloud coverage and sunshine duration the smoothing effect of ok causes a strong reduction of the spatial variance while only nn can preserve it in its entirety for wind data nn and invd cause an overestimation of the spatial variance it is assumed that this phenomenon is also caused by the exposed location of the brocken station the observed value of this gauge is used as an estimate for two neighbouring stations in the same way as it was the case in the cross validation of temperature data 5 3 comparison among all climate variables the comparison of interpolation performance among climate variables is carried out for the best interpolation methods found in section 5 2 the results are shown in the upper panel of fig 10 the panel at the bottom contains the coefficient of variation that was computed for each time step of the different meteorological observations and their temporal resolutions the rmse performance criterion is used to compare the interpolation performance among the different climate variables this comparison approach is considered valid since the rmse is standardised with the mean of the observations for each climate variable it is carried out despite the fact that there is a natural upper limit of the observation range of sunshine duration cloud coverage and relative humidity in case of the hourly time scale the interpolation of precipitation generates the worst result with an rmse of approx 1 0 a good interpolation performance was achieved for relative humidity and mean temperature i e the rmse is lower than 0 1 for both wind speed cloud coverage and sunshine duration have a medium interpolation performance the interpolation performance of precipitation sunshine duration and cloud coverage improves significantly when examined at longer time periods for mean temperature as well as relative humidity there is a less significant improvement in contrast to all other variables the estimation of wind speed does not improve appreciably when longer time periods are interpolated on the weekly time scale the interpolation of wind speed is already slightly worse than the interpolation of precipitation in terms of annual performance wind speed interpolation gives by far the worst result it is assumed that wind is in general strongly affected by local conditions in particular by the topography that can cause either shielding or amplification effects depending on wind direction relative humidity has the lowest interpolation error for all temporal resolutions whereas the error of the mean temperature interpolation is slightly higher the boxes in the bottom panel of fig 10 contain the coefficients of variation that were computed for each time step of the corresponding climate variable and temporal resolution outlier time steps are removed to enable a better illustration of the spatial variability for rainfall the cv was only computed for time steps that have an observation mean value higher than or equal to 1 0 mm it is clear that the interpolation performance is strongly linked to the spatial variability of each climate variable moreover variance decreases significantly with a decrease of temporal resolution in general it is clear that the spatial interpolation of fine temporal resolution rainfall data is the most challenging task rainfall observations with high temporal resolution have a high spatial variability and the expected interpolation error is therefore much higher the interpolation error of humidity and temperature is in general the lowest in particular for temperature interpolation the dem offers reliable additional information that can improve the cross validation result 5 4 influence of station selection this section contains information about the effect of the random selection of stations on the interpolation performance in order to find out whether the location of the measurement is important the rmse cross validation performance obtained for the ten realisations of each density scenario using 17 stations is displayed in box plots the results of each meteorological variable are presented in a separate figure for all temporal resolutions the scenario of 17 stations is available for all climate information and therefore allows a thorough comparison among all meteorological information fig 11 contains the box plots obtained for the interpolation of hourly to annual rainfall sums while only selected methods are displayed for each temporal resolution nn and ok are always shown these simple univariate techniques are used as a standard of comparison to the best multivariate approach nn represents the simplest possible basic interpolation technique while ok is the most basic univariate geostatistical interpolation method cm is displayed for hourly data since it has shown the best interpolation performance for all other temporal resolutions ked which uses both elevation and radar data is shown as the third method there is a significant variation in interpolation performance among the random station selections for each temporal resolution and interpolation method nn generates a higher variation compared to the geostatistical methods ok and ked generate a similar variation in the error for daily and weekly data in particular one specific realisation causes a high rmse for the daily weekly monthly and annual time scale it is marked as an outlier for all methods and is explained by the high elevation and the corresponding high amounts of orographic precipitation of the gauge situated on the brocken mountain only one scenario contained this station since the random selection was drawn from 200 stations in total the variation of temperature interpolation performance is shown in fig 12 the ked method presented here used the dem as the additional information the variation in ked interpolation performance is significantly lower than the variation in nn and ok interpolation performance nn causes the highest variation while ok generates a medium range of interpolation performances the distribution of nn and ok interpolation performance appears to be skewed to the right i e a relatively good interpolation performance is achieved for most realisations of each temporal resolution while some realisations have significantly higher errors nn and ok do not consider elevation and therefore it is assumed that the weather station on the brocken mountain which is not considered in all realisations causes this behaviour fig a1 supplementary material shows the variation in interpolation performance of relative humidity it is clearly seen that nn creates the highest variation while the cross validation of geostatistical techniques in particular ked using temperature were able to provide a relatively robust assessment of interpolation quality a specific reason for the outlier caused by ked for hourly data could not be identified the results for cloud coverage are shown in fig a2 supplementary material the variation is relatively low compared to the meteorological observations shown before nevertheless the application of ok leads to a slightly lower spread of interpolation performances the range of sunshine duration interpolation performance is shown in fig a3 supplementary material the variations seem to be even lower than those obtained for cloud coverage it is assumed that the limited number of available stations additionally contributes to the low variation random selections were drawn from 25 stations only again ok causes a marginally lower variation of interpolation performance among the ten realisations compared to nn the distribution of wind speed interpolation performance seen in fig a4 supplementary material is highly skewed for all interpolation methods and temporal resolutions a relatively poor performance is reached for most realisations while some random selections which did not take into account the brocken station achieve a much better interpolation quality the range of interpolation performance is by far the highest when compared to other meteorological observations it is assumed that wind velocity is strongly affected by the local topographic conditions realisations that contain only locations with similar local topography therefore achieve the best interpolation performance a spatial interpolation using the entire set of available stations does not necessarily yield an optimal interpolation quality 6 summary and conclusions this study investigated the performance of different interpolation techniques for various climate variables observed by weather stations simple interpolation techniques nn invd and more sophisticated geostatistical approaches ok ked cm were taken into account for each climate variable different additional information based on topography other measurements and other factors were used within the multivariate interpolation techniques cross validation experiments based on different temporal resolutions and station density scenarios were implemented in order to determine the interpolation performance for each variable the main findings and conclusions can be summarised as follows 1 ked using radar as the additional information can improve the interpolation performance of rainfall in comparison to ok particularly for fine temporal resolutions of 1 h and 1 day in the case of low station density ked may perform worse than ok for high temporal resolutions ked incorporating the dem is especially helpful for long accumulation times but cannot achieve an improvement for high temporal resolutions cm delivers the best performance for hourly data but performs worse than ok and ked for temporal resolutions of 1 day or lower 2 ked using the dem performs significantly better than ok for temperature data for all temporal resolutions and station densities 3 ked using temperature grids delivered the best interpolation performance for relative humidity all combinations of station density and temporal resolution could be improved compared to ok the incorporation of precipitation grids could only achieve an improvement at the annual time scale 4 no useful additional information was found for the interpolation of cloud coverage sunshine duration or wind data the application of ok resulted in the best interpolation performance for all station densities and temporal resolutions 5 the simple approaches nn and invd cannot reach the interpolation performance of ok for most climate variables only for precipitation invd performs similarly well as ok if a very dense station network is available 6 the influence of the random station selection on the interpolation performance varies strongly on the climate variable that is interpolated in particular for wind speed a strong impact of the station selection was observed 7 moreover the interpolation performance depends generally on temporal resolution station density and the specific spatial variability of the climate information the influences of temporal resolution and spatial variability appear to be higher than the influence of station density 8 precipitation with a high temporal resolution shows the highest spatial variability and thus the worst interpolation performance for all meteorological variables except wind speed the spatial variability decreases with decreasing temporal resolution the best estimation accuracy is achieved for relative humidity and temperature all results were obtained from the interpolation of continuous time series i e the analysis of single events or short time step sequences might lead to different findings in particular when radar is taken into account for rainfall interpolation the study area is characterised by rather few topographic elevations for wind data in particular it is assumed that the interpolation performance might decrease even further if a more mountainous area is investigated the interpolation performance of temperature and relative humidity seem to be rather robust due to the consideration of the dem and the low spatial variability conflict of interest none

8533,study region the warnow river basin an agriculturally dominated lowland watershed in north eastern germany with a considerable extent of artificial drainage study focus we analyzed a 21 year data set 1990 2010 of dissolved reactive drp and total phosphorus tp concentrations in surface waters to evaluate trends and seasonality of phosphorus p concentrations and pathways of p losses from soils new hydrological insights for the region phosphorus concentrations were moderately spatially variable over the investigation period and mean drp and tp concentrations ranged from 57 to 132 mg l 1 and 114 to 184 μg l 1 respectively the mean annual drp and tp loads ranged from 0 04 0 01 to 0 15 0 05 and 0 12 0 05 to 0 27 0 06 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively we detected significant negative temporal trends of p concentrations and loads in the decade 1990 2000 in the 21st century the tp concentrations and loads tend to increase moderately the results underline the importance of baseflow for drp export and storm flow events for tp export and emphasize the importance of artificial drainage systems modifying the hydrological regime of soils and surface waters alike the p export rates during storm events and the proportion of particulate phosphorus in artificial drainage systems should be monitored at a higher temporal resolution to obtain a comprehensive database necessary for developing management strategies to reduce p loads in agricultural used landscapes keywords catchment hydrology dissolved reactive phosphorus total phosphorus artificial drainage monitoring sub basin scale 1 introduction eutrophication of surface waters is still a major environmental concern worldwide and losses of phosphorus p from arable land being a major contributor sharpley et al 2015 the enrichment of p in surface waters generally leads to an increased growth rate of algae and inferential consumption of oxygen carpenter 2005 the reduction of point and non point sources of p is therefore a priority for future land use daniel et al 1998 the european water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec commits european union member states to achieve a good qualitative status of all surface water bodies current recommendations for a good qualitative status are concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and total phosphorus tp below 100 and 150 μg l 1 respectively länderarbeitsgemeinschaft wasser 1998 by the year 2000 the year the water framework directive became law numerous german rivers and streams did not fulfill these requirements although eutrophication is a general concern in europe the baltic sea is in particular threatened by eutrophication through its geographical situation the watershed of the baltic sea is about 1 745 000 km2 which is approximately four times larger than the baltic sea itself stålnacke et al 2015 in germany the p input to water bodies was 23 000 t a 1 in 2012 2014 and decreased by more than 72 compared to 1983 1987 mainly due to improved waste water treatment uba 2017 with the reduction of point source loads in recent decades nonpoint pathways have become dominant sources of phosphorus today the proportion of diffuse to point sources of phosphorus loading is 65 to 35 kunkel et al 2017 generally agriculture is the major source of p input into water bodies gentry et al 2007 a successful cultivation of crops as well as the preservation of soil fertility is however depending on a sustainable nutrient management including the use of mineral and organic fertilizers cordell et al 2009 it is usually assumed that the agronomic soil status affects the phosphorus losses from land to water primarily in form of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp mcdowell et al 2001 or by fast transport processes such as surface runoff shallow interflow and macropore flow schärer et al 2007 kronvang et al 2007 found increasing agricultural shares of the p losses to surface waters in 35 catchments 30 km2 in the nordic baltic region of europe but no relationship with the short term p surplus on agricultural land the annual p loss was greatest in the catchments characterized by soil erosion and high proportion of surface run off today there is increasing evidence that particle facilitated p transport through the soil profile and the release of p from the sediment to surface water bodies may be an important contributor to the eutrophication of rivers and streams outram et al 2014 king et al 2015 tile drainage is a common practice in agriculture to decrease soil moisture and improve aeration especially in lowland catchments it shortens the residence time of water in the soil and therefore forms an important pathway for solutes to surface water bodies kladivko et al 1999 the impact of surface runoff to riverine p concentrations may be negligible in lowland catchments however single storm events can advance the p transport from the soil to surface water via artificial drainage king et al 2017 tiemeyer et al 2009 determined low p concentrations in tile drainage water in german lowland catchments but highlighted the relevance of preferential flow pathways along earthworm burrows and root channels zimmer et al 2016 observed excessive yellow brown ochre flocs in the drain water after storm events containing high p amounts as formed by fungal mycelia with precipitated fe and mn hydr oxides at the surface nausch et al 2017 who examined concentrations fractions and association of p with other elements in a lowland watershed in north eastern germany found increasing total phosphorus concentrations in the succession tile drain outlet adjacent ditch and brook and further downstream stations as a result of elevated dissolved reactive phosphorus particulate reactive and organic phosphorus variable concentrations and losses of tp and drp over different winter seasons with elevated concentrations during intensive snowmelt events were observed in the same watershed tiemeyer et al 2009 danz et al 2013 likewise highlighted that a small number of rainfall and snowmelt runoff events accounted for the majority of the total event loading our understanding of the tile drainage pathway in the context of p export needs to be further explored sharpley et al 2015 for a better understanding of the interactions between agriculture and water quality on the basin and sub basin

observations of p concentrations and possibly other nutrients e g nitrogen and contaminants e g heavy metals are needed to better understand the spatial and temporal variability of the p concentrations and loads in rivers because of the general lack of long term data for north eastern germany the main drivers of p transport from land to surface waters are not well understood the aim of this study was to analyze the temporal and spatial variability of p concentrations and p loads in the surface water bodies of an agricultural lowland watershed in north eastern germany with a considerable extent of artificial drainage over the period 1990 2010 we wanted to test the capability of water quality data with bi to four weekly temporal resolution a resolution that is common in governmental monitoring programs to uncover intra and inter annual variability and long term trends the 20 year data set allowed to assess the impact of the political regime shift that took place in the former soviet union hemisphere in the early 1990ies on environmental quality parameters the dataset was therefore subdivided in the period 1990 1999 and 2000 2010 furthermore we intended to detect the regional distribution of p pathways to surface waters using multiple linear regression and non linear regression models 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the warnow river basin 3028 km2 is located in the federal state of mecklenburg west pomerania in north eastern germany fig 1 and consists of nine sub basins table 1 the climate is influenced by the atlantic ocean with a mean annual

warnow river gauge station rostock strongly influence the streamflow measurements at this point sub basin upper warnow 2 2 data collection the study is based on a set of daily streamflow and bi to four weekly phosphorus concentration data of dissolved reactive drp and total phosphorus tp provided by the state department of environment nature conservation and geology of mecklenburg west pomerania lung mv the data set originates from 141 gauging stations within the warnow river basin we reduced the data set to nine gauge stations located at the outlets of the 9 delineated sub basins for the period 1990 2010 the onset and the temporal resolution of the concentration measurements varied depending on the gauging station and the tributary river system table 2 the total number of water samples for the study period 1990 2010 was 3674 and 2948 for drp and tp respectively the sampling frequency was consistently higher for drp and the measurements of tp did not start before 1993

tile drainage maps lung mv 2010 the artificial drainage map was provided by the lung mv mehl and hoffmann 2010 the areas possibly affected by tile drainage were determined by a probability approach based on land use soil type slope and other characteristics digital maps of extent and condition of artificial drainage systems as obtained from historical analogous engineering maps are limited for eastern germany the delineation of the watershed was achieved using the spatial analyst extension for esri arcgis 10 3 additional input data comprised the streaming network and a digital elevation model with a resolution of 5 5 m lverma mv 2008 the sub basins were delineated by the position of the measurement stations for streamflow and p concentrations 2 3 statistical analyses as presented by baker et al 2004 and used for phosphorus modeling by ulén et al 2016 we calculated the richard baker flashiness index r b flashiness index for each year 1990 2010 by using the following equation 1 r b i n d e x i 1 n q i q i 1 i 1 n q i where q is the streamflow at a given time step the flashiness index reflects frequency and rapidity of short term changes in streamflow in a defined period of time we used a simple baseflow segmentation to subdivide streamflow data into a fast and slow component presuming that the fast streamflow signal is generated by tile drainage streamflow the baseflow component of the streamflow data was calculated according to nathan and mcmahon 1990 2 q d i α q d i 1 β 1 α q r i q where qd is the quick flow part of the stream flow which is subject to qd 0 for the time i in days qr is the total flow base flow quick flow and α and β are flow coefficients we employed mann kendall seasonal trend tests hirsch et al 1982 a trend test for time series with significant seasonal variation to determine long term trends from monthly medians of drp und tp concentrations furthermore we used mann kendall trend tests to test the annual p loads for temporal trends not taking seasonality into account non linear models were used for the characterization of relationships between streamflow weekly means and long term means of drp and tp concentrations models with three or less model parameters were selected which yielded the best model fit r2 the analysis was performed using the tablecurve 2d software package systat software inc 2002 models of the form y a b x2 for drp concentrations and y 1 a bx cx2 and y a bx simple linear model for tp concentrations were chosen annual loads of drp and tp were calculated by a bootstrapping approach we calculated the integral for the p concentration curves for each year this estimation was repeated 100 times by randomly leaving two measurements out the mean of the individual estimations per year was taken as the annual p load we fitted simple polynomial models of the form y ax2 bx c to the p load streamflow relationships a stepwise multiple linear regression approach was employed to model the annual drp and tp loads and detect dominant leaching pathways of drp and tp parameters used for the regression analysis were precipitation streamflow base flow peak flow and r b flashiness index per year and the number of days on which precipitation exceeded 0 10 15 and 20 mm respectively the non linear models of p concentrations and the linear regression models of p loads were evaluated by the coefficient of determination of measured and predicted values of p concentrations and annual p loads respectively prior linear and non linear modelling we smoothed the hydrograph at the watershed outlet with a 10 day moving average to minimize the effects of the dam and weir all statistical analyses were conducted employing the statistical software package r r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 dynamics and trends

concentrations of drp and tp range between 2 and 1458 μg l 1 and 13 and 2040 μg l 1 respectively the mean concentrations of drp and tp were in the same order of magnitude across all sub basins with 60 μg l 1 drp and 136 μg l 1 tp respectively solely the zarnow sub basin showed higher mean concentrations of drp and tp of 132 μg l 1 and 184 μg l 1 respectively the mean annual r b flashiness index of streamflow varied strongly across all sub basins p 0 001 mann whitney u test table 3 and over time 1990 2010 fig 2 a the inter annual variability of the flashiness is large with coefficients of variation ranging from 0 16 nebel sub basin to 0 25 mildenitz sub basin the mean annual r b flashiness index of the sub basins fig 2b was significantly correlated to the portion of artificially drained area of the sub basins p 0 001 r2 0 93 linear regression model over the investigation period 1990 2010 the concentrations of drp and tp showed significant negative temporal trends for eight of the nine observed sub basins fig 2c according to the mann kendall seasonal trend test solely the upper warnow sub basin did not show a significant downward or upward trend for both drp and tp fig 2d and e calculating the temporal trends by annual medians of p concentrations we obtain significant negative temporal trends for seven sub basins only the middle warnow and the upper warnow sub basins showed no negative trend for drp and the beke and the upper warnow sub basins for tp the observed temporal trends changed in the 21st century the seasonal mann kendall trend tests for the 2000 2010 data set showed no significant trends for eight of the sub basins for the drp concentrations table 4 interestingly the temporal trends for the tp concentrations changed to significant upward trends in six of the sub basins interestingly the temporal trends for the tp concentrations changed to significant upward trends in six sub basins the concentrations of tp increased from 5 7 to 22 1 lower warnow sub basin catchment outlet increases calculated by the slope of the linear trend line the mean tp concentration of these six sub basins showing positive temporal trends is 13 5 μg on the contrary the annual medians of drp and tp concentrations for the 2000 2010 period showed no significant trends in eight sub basins drp concentrations exhibited a strong seasonal pattern independent from the year and the sub basin fig 3 the highest concentrations of drp were recorded in summer and autumn weeks 25 45 whereas the concentrations in winter and spring were the lowest weeks 46 24 the patterns of tp were ambiguous with discontinuous regional peaks over time generally the differences of seasonal minima and maxima were lower for tp than for drp except the zarnow and mildenitz sub basins we fitted non linear models in the form of y a b x2 to long term weekly means of streamflow and drp and tp concentrations although the quality of the model fits varied strongly among the nine sub basins the patterns were similar for all monitoring stations with a marked decrease of drp concentrations with increasing streamflow fig 4 the model optimization for streamflow and tp concentrations revealed a satisfactory strength of the relationships for most of the sub basins only for the koesterbeck the zarnow and the beke sub basins a reciprocal quadratic y 1 a bx cx2 koesterbeck and zarnow and a linear model y a bx beke gave better optimization results these three sub basins were those with the highest portion of artificial drainage table 1 however there was a marked tendency of increasing concentrations of tp at streamflow events fig 4 the loads of drp and tp varied strongly across all sub basins and resulted in mean annual loads of 30 380 kg drp and 82 026 kg tp at the warnow river basin outlet equaling 0 10 and 0 27 kg ha 1 a 1 drp and tp respectively for the period from 1990 to 1999 table 5 the loads for the period 2000 2010 were 21 266 kg drp and 51 646 kg tp corresponding to 0 07 and 0 17 kg ha 1 a 1 drp and tp respectively linear and non linear models reveled a marked negative relationship between the number of waste water treatment plants in a sub basin and the mean annual loads of drp and tp in the years 2012 and 2013 the portion of tp originating from waste water treatment plants was 26 and 18 respectively which equals a tp load of approximately 9000 kg a 1 thus 74 and 82 of the tp load that was released to the baltic sea originated from diffuse sources earlier data is missing 3 2 modelling annual phosphorus loads the stepwise multiple linear regression of drp and tp loads produced simple linear models with shifting parameters for each sub basin table 6 regression analysis was conducted with the overall data set from 1990 to 2010 and additionally with a truncated data set from 2000 to 2010 the model quality varied clearly during the period 1990 2010 for the drp loads data not shown baseflow was a significant predictor for drp in five sub basins and quickflow in two sub basins while the r b flashiness index was a significant predictor in three sub basins we could not find any predictive driver of drp loads at the river basin outlet lower warnow and the beke sub basin yielding statistically significant relationships between measured and modelled values the tp loads were best predicted by quickflow in five sub basins and by baseflow in four sub basins additionally r b flashiness index was a predictive variable in three sub basins we could not find any predictive driver of tp loads at the beke sub basin the linear models for the period 2000 2010 showed a distinct increase of predictive power all sub basins achieved a satisfactory model quality with coefficients of determination higher than 0 5 for both drp and tp table 6 figs 5 and 6 baseflow had a high predictive power in six sub basins r b flashiness index predicted the annual loads of drp in two sub basins while quickflow and the number of rain days with p 15 mm was predictive in only one sub basin the models derived for tp indicated a higher impact of the fast flow components of streamflow quickflow and r b flashiness index were predictive parameters in five sub basins the number of days with a precipitation higher than 15 mm and baseflow had predictive power in two sub basins we found no predictive variables for the upper warnow sub basin 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of phosphorus concentrations and phosphorus loads the mean drp and tp concentrations for the sub basins ranged from 60 to 132 and 114 to 184 μg l 1 in the period 1990 2010 respectively the länderarbeitsgemeinschaft wasser 1998 a german federal organizational unit for the development and monitoring of water quality standards has set values of lower than 100 μg l 1 drp and 150 μg l 1 tp for a good water quality status of rivers in total 714 of 3674 total measurements and 883 of 2948 total measurements measurements of drp and tp respectively exceeded the target values the mean annual values for drp tp exceeded the target values in 17 41 of 90 cases in the period from 1990 to 2000 and in no 3 from 90 cases in the period from 2000 to 2010 this indicates a large improvement regarding the water quality standards in the warnow river basin the magnitude and the range of observed drp and tp concentrations are in accordance with findings from other agricultural watersheds in europe bowes et al 2015 dąbrowska et al 2016 mellander et al 2015 minaudo et al 2015 the observed concentrations are supported by a comprehensive study of p losses from a multitude of european catchments over several spatial scales 30 km2 to 50 000 km2 drp 10 μg l 1 to 160 μg l 1 tp 40 μg l 1 to 930 μg l 1 kronvang et al 2007 that study also confirmed a large spatial and temporal variability of p fluxes from catchments the concentrations of drp and tp in the warnow river basin vary strongly intra and inter annually significant decreasing trends for drp and tp concentrations and loadings were found in the 1990 s the reasons for these negative temporal trends are various our data reveal that the number of waste water treatment plants may be one cause fig 7 it has been recently estimated that roughly 95 of all inhabitants are connected to a state of the art waste water treatment in germany ott and rechberger 2012 which resulted in a tp fraction originating from waste water treatment plants of 26 and 18 for the years 2012 and 2013 respectively thus 74 and 82 of the tp loads that were released to the baltic sea originated from diffuse sources decreasing p trends might also be related to reduced p inputs per capita in crop production since 1980 europe wide van dijk et al 2016 in germany the p surpluses of agricultural soils were reduced since 1990 and are negative since 2004 bach and frede 1998 the amount of applied mineral p fertilizer and the extent of animal farming decreased significantly in the federal state of mecklenburg west pomerania in the 1990 s after the shift of the political regime kape et al 2014 the p stock of the mineral soils is nowadays in general in an optimal state today according to the local classification system and the given concentration classes low medium optimal high and very high schweder et al 2004 however soils with an optimal soil p content still have a high p leaching potential which is particular prone to mobilization after heavy rainfall events tiemeyer et al 2009 studies in other catchments confirm the observed decrease in p concentrations in surface waters as a consequence of changes in land use and improved waste water treatment ekholm et al 2015 minaudo et al 2015 however there are also watersheds that do not show improvements in water quality despite various mitigation activities stålnacke et al 1998 hence the reasons for upward or downward temporal trends strongly depend on catchment properties and anthropogenic activities the observed recent upward trend in tp concentrations is sub basin specific and spatially differentiated the number of livestock farms in the watershed has increased markedly over the last 15 years the total number of pigs and poultry increased by 19 and 26 respectively between 2000 and 2010 in the federal state of mecklenburg west pomerania statistische berichte 2016 however positive tp trends can likewise be attributed to altering hydrological conditions discharge decreased significantly in all sub basins seasonal mann kendall trend test p 0 001 while the number of rainfall events increased linear regression p 0 01 the increased number of rainfall events may release legacy p from agricultural fields via tile drainage it has been observed that in human dominated watersheds after long accumulation periods with high p inputs the accumulated phosphorus can be mobilized even if the total input declines powers et al 2016 king et al 2017 the factors of mobilization of p in those watersheds are complex and specific the release of p through surface runoff is negligible in lowland watersheds potential pools for p in surface waters are bank erosion in rivers re mobilization of within channel p bowes et al 2014 kronvang et al 2012 loss of p laden sediments through tile drains outram et al 2014 king et al 2015 zimmer et al 2016 losses of p during periods of high ground water tables and ground water temperature flores lópez et al 2013 losses of p from mineralized peatlands as a consequence of drainage behrendt et al 2004 and inflow of p enriched groundwater holman et al 2008 especially after extreme precipitation events the relationship between streamflow and drp and tp concentrations showed high concentrations at low rates of streamflow and reciprocally this is reflected by the observed seasonal patterns with higher p concentrations in summer and confirms results from bowes et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 nausch et al 2017 the observed patterns may be caused by intensive microbial processes during summer with p release from river bed sediments and or the contribution of point source pollution at low flow rates and dilution processes at higher rates the higher tp concentrations at peak flow events may be caused by within channel mobilization of river bed sediments and suspended sediments from drains and soils via preferential flow bowes et al 2014 however in this study an evaluation of event based drp and tp losses in more detail was not possible because of the course sampling scheme bi to four weekly grab sample which often led to missing p data at very strong flow events hot moments of p export because of the low temporal resolution of concentration measurements uncertainty in the estimation of annual p loads has to be taken into account however a long term bi or four weekly sampling scheme seems a solid basis to uncover intra and inter annual p dynamics and long term trends of surface water quality 4 2 modelling annual phosphorus loads the modelling of p losses to rivers requires detailed knowledge of watershed characteristics and underlying processes the multitude of biogeochemical processes regarding p loss often impedes precise and satisfactory modelling collick et al 2015 however simple statistical models may reveal insight to major transport pathways at basin scale the model result for the outlet of the warnow river basin might be impaired by backwater effects caused by a dam and a weir that segregates the freshwater section of the warnow river from its brackish course inflow from the baltic sea the derived p models are probably affected although the hydrograph was smoothened by a 10 day moving average the employed statistical models for the depiction of annual drp and tp loads reflect the characteristics of the investigated sub basins with satisfactory accuracy table 6 after a comprehensive analysis of morphology land use fraction of artificially drained areas a direct linkage of the processes as identified through the statistical models to watershed properties could not be established table 7 in sub basins with a large fraction of artificial drainage baseflow was identified as the main driver of drp loads solute dilution occurs at high flow rates however peak flow events may have been missed by the coarse sampling scheme for the nebel sub basin where the baseflow was found a predictive variable also for tp we assume that the retention potential of lake krakow has smoothened peak flow tp concentrations the r b flashiness index is strongly correlated with increasing frequency and magnitude of storm events baker et al 2004 on a smaller spatial scale 1 km2 the r b flashiness index was used to predict p leaching from different fields of former swine farms in sweden ulén et al 2016 we assume that the r b flashiness index is primarily an expression for increased runoff from tile drains thus hillslopes and artificially drained areas near the watershed outlet may stimulate this relationship if the p retention potential of the river is low however there might be additional processes that play an important role in p leaching independent from morphological or land use aspects important processes in loamy and clay soils are preferential flow and internal erosion through the soil profile to tile drains as observed previously makris et al 2006 williams et al 2016 dye tracer experiments on mineral soils in the zarnow sub basin have shown that colloids can be transported to depths up to 0 7 m following preferential flow pathways koch et al 2016 5 summary and conclusion the analysis of a 21 year dataset of phosphorus concentrations and streamflow from a mid size river basin including nine sub basins revealed that the surface water quality has in general improved over the last decades this effect can most likely be attributed to newly installed waste water treatment plants the better agricultural p management and lower p fertilization rates in the 1990ies slight increases in p concentrations in surface water bodies in the 21st century are probably related to an increased number of live stock farms and the release of legacy p in the catchment p concentrations and loads varied within and between the years for a realistic estimation of annual p loads we emphasize a high frequency sampling strategy during storm events simple linear regression analyses consistently documented the influence of groundwater to the concentration of dissolved reactive phosphorus in brooks and rivers whereas the concentration of total phosphorus is strongly regulated by a fast flow component in lowland catchments with reduced surface runoff quick flow originates basically from the widespread artificial drainage systems further diffuse sources for increased concentrations of p in surface water bodies are p laden soil particles from bank erosion and within channel re mobilization of riverine sediments further studies should investigate the role of internal soil and bank streams and rivers erosion processes and their relation to rainfall runoff intensity conflicts of interest none acknowledgments we are indebted to the stalumm and staluwm for providing discharge and phosphorus

8533,study region the warnow river basin an agriculturally dominated lowland watershed in north eastern germany with a considerable extent of artificial drainage study focus we analyzed a 21 year data set 1990 2010 of dissolved reactive drp and total phosphorus tp concentrations in surface waters to evaluate trends and seasonality of phosphorus p concentrations and pathways of p losses from soils new hydrological insights for the region phosphorus concentrations were moderately spatially variable over the investigation period and mean drp and tp concentrations ranged from 57 to 132 mg l 1 and 114 to 184 μg l 1 respectively the mean annual drp and tp loads ranged from 0 04 0 01 to 0 15 0 05 and 0 12 0 05 to 0 27 0 06 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively we detected significant negative temporal trends of p concentrations and loads in the decade 1990 2000 in the 21st century the tp concentrations and loads tend to increase moderately the results underline the importance of baseflow for drp export and storm flow events for tp export and emphasize the importance of artificial drainage systems modifying the hydrological regime of soils and surface waters alike the p export rates during storm events and the proportion of particulate phosphorus in artificial drainage systems should be monitored at a higher temporal resolution to obtain a comprehensive database necessary for developing management strategies to reduce p loads in agricultural used landscapes keywords catchment hydrology dissolved reactive phosphorus total phosphorus artificial drainage monitoring sub basin scale 1 introduction eutrophication of surface waters is still a major environmental concern worldwide and losses of phosphorus p from arable land being a major contributor sharpley et al 2015 the enrichment of p in surface waters generally leads to an increased growth rate of algae and inferential consumption of oxygen carpenter 2005 the reduction of point and non point sources of p is therefore a priority for future land use daniel et al 1998 the european water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec commits european union member states to achieve a good qualitative status of all surface water bodies current recommendations for a good qualitative status are concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and total phosphorus tp below 100 and 150 μg l 1 respectively länderarbeitsgemeinschaft wasser 1998 by the year 2000 the year the water framework directive became law numerous german rivers and streams did not fulfill these requirements although eutrophication is a general concern in europe the baltic sea is in particular threatened by eutrophication through its geographical situation the watershed of the baltic sea is about 1 745 000 km2 which is approximately four times larger than the baltic sea itself stålnacke et al 2015 in germany the p input to water bodies was 23 000 t a 1 in 2012 2014 and decreased by more than 72 compared to 1983 1987 mainly due to improved waste water treatment uba 2017 with the reduction of point source loads in recent decades nonpoint pathways have become dominant sources of phosphorus today the proportion of diffuse to point sources of phosphorus loading is 65 to 35 kunkel et al 2017 generally agriculture is the major source of p input into water bodies gentry et al 2007 a successful cultivation of crops as well as the preservation of soil fertility is however depending on a sustainable nutrient management including the use of mineral and organic fertilizers cordell et al 2009 it is usually assumed that the agronomic soil status affects the phosphorus losses from land to water primarily in form of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp mcdowell et al 2001 or by fast transport processes such as surface runoff shallow interflow and macropore flow schärer et al 2007 kronvang et al 2007 found increasing agricultural shares of the p losses to surface waters in 35 catchments 30 km2 in the nordic baltic region of europe but no relationship with the short term p surplus on agricultural land the annual p loss was greatest in the catchments characterized by soil erosion and high proportion of surface run off today there is increasing evidence that particle facilitated p transport through the soil profile and the release of p from the sediment to surface water bodies may be an important contributor to the eutrophication of rivers and streams outram et al 2014 king et al 2015 tile drainage is a common practice in agriculture to decrease soil moisture and improve aeration especially in lowland catchments it shortens the residence time of water in the soil and therefore forms an important pathway for solutes to surface water bodies kladivko et al 1999 the impact of surface runoff to riverine p concentrations may be negligible in lowland catchments however single storm events can advance the p transport from the soil to surface water via artificial drainage king et al 2017 tiemeyer et al 2009 determined low p concentrations in tile drainage water in german lowland catchments but highlighted the relevance of preferential flow pathways along earthworm burrows and root channels zimmer et al 2016 observed excessive yellow brown ochre flocs in the drain water after storm events containing high p amounts as formed by fungal mycelia with precipitated fe and mn hydr oxides at the surface nausch et al 2017 who examined concentrations fractions and association of p with other elements in a lowland watershed in north eastern germany found increasing total phosphorus concentrations in the succession tile drain outlet adjacent ditch and brook and further downstream stations as a result of elevated dissolved reactive phosphorus particulate reactive and organic phosphorus variable concentrations and losses of tp and drp over different winter seasons with elevated concentrations during intensive snowmelt events were observed in the same watershed tiemeyer et al 2009 danz et al 2013 likewise highlighted that a small number of rainfall and snowmelt runoff events accounted for the majority of the total event loading our understanding of the tile drainage pathway in the context of p export needs to be further explored sharpley et al 2015 for a better understanding of the interactions between agriculture and water quality on the basin and sub basin scale land use data soil drainage tillage crop choice fertilizer management data input timing and hydrological data should be recorded regularly daloğlu et al 2012 most important long term observations of p concentrations and possibly other nutrients e g nitrogen and contaminants e g heavy metals are needed to better understand the spatial and temporal variability of the p concentrations and loads in rivers because of the general lack of long term data for north eastern germany the main drivers of p transport from land to surface waters are not well understood the aim of this study was to analyze the temporal and spatial variability of p concentrations and p loads in the surface water bodies of an agricultural lowland watershed in north eastern germany with a considerable extent of artificial drainage over the period 1990 2010 we wanted to test the capability of water quality data with bi to four weekly temporal resolution a resolution that is common in governmental monitoring programs to uncover intra and inter annual variability and long term trends the 20 year data set allowed to assess the impact of the political regime shift that took place in the former soviet union hemisphere in the early 1990ies on environmental quality parameters the dataset was therefore subdivided in the period 1990 1999 and 2000 2010 furthermore we intended to detect the regional distribution of p pathways to surface waters using multiple linear regression and non linear regression models 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the warnow river basin 3028 km2 is located in the federal state of mecklenburg west pomerania in north eastern germany fig 1 and consists of nine sub basins table 1 the climate is influenced by the atlantic ocean with a mean annual precipitation of 643 mm and a mean annual temperature of 10 4 c 1990 2010 the basin is characterized by gentle slopes with a maximum elevation of 146 m the land use dlr 2003 is dominated by agriculture 71 further uses are forests 22 wetlands 1 open water areas 4 and artificial surfaces 4 the land use distribution changed within the past 20 years by a reduction in arable land and urban sprawl about 42 of the warnow river basin is artificially drained by subsurface drainage systems or drainage ditches approximately 100 waste water treatment plants of varying sizes are located in the watershed fig 1 dominant soil types according to the world reference base wrb classifications fao 1998 are luvisols 43 cambisols 19 stagnosols and gleysols 21 under arable use while grassland and forests are typically situated on degraded histosols 16 fig 1 a comprehensive characterization of land use and soil composition of the warnow river basin is given by koch et al 2013 the warnow river 143 km length discharges into the baltic sea the mean streamflow was 16 7 m3 s 1 in the period from 1990 to 2010 the elevation difference from spring to the mouth is 68 m a weir and a dam at the warnow river gauge station rostock strongly influence the streamflow measurements at this point sub basin upper warnow 2 2 data collection the study is based on a set of daily streamflow and bi to four weekly phosphorus concentration data of dissolved reactive drp and total phosphorus tp provided by the state department of environment nature conservation and geology of mecklenburg west pomerania lung mv the data set originates from 141 gauging stations within the warnow river basin we reduced the data set to nine gauge stations located at the outlets of the 9 delineated sub basins for the period 1990 2010 the onset and the temporal resolution of the concentration measurements varied depending on the gauging station and the tributary river system table 2 the total number of water samples for the study period 1990 2010 was 3674 and 2948 for drp and tp respectively the sampling frequency was consistently higher for drp and the measurements of tp did not start before 1993 in most of the sub basins water levels were recorded on a daily basis by using pressure sensors ott ecolog 500 ott hydromet gmbh kempten germany streamflow was measured by magnetic inductive flow measurement devices ott mf pro ott hydromet gmbh kempten germany once per month to generate daily streamflow data based on seasonal rating curves water sampling was performed manually once a month or biweekly by employees of the environmental agency lung mv all water samples were analyzed for drp and tp without freezing immediately after sample collection drp was determined of the filtered samples 0 45 μm colorimetrically with a flow injection analyzer according to din en iso 2005 tp was determined using unfiltered samples after alkaline digestion colorimetrically ganimede p analysator according to din en iso 2004 meteorological data were provided by the german weather service dwd with daily resolution of precipitation and air temperature for seven stations within the warnow river basin land use data were obtained from the corine land cover clr 2006 with a resolution of 1 100 000 and grouped land use classes of agricultural areas arable land and grassland urban areas forests including heathland wetland and open water area additional data include the number and the coordinates of waste water treatment plants online server government of mecklenburg west pomerania and the tile drainage maps lung mv 2010 the artificial drainage map was provided by the lung mv mehl and hoffmann 2010 the areas possibly affected by tile drainage were determined by a probability approach based on land use soil type slope and other characteristics digital maps of extent and condition of artificial drainage systems as obtained from historical analogous engineering maps are limited for eastern germany the delineation of the watershed was achieved using the spatial analyst extension for esri arcgis 10 3 additional input data comprised the streaming network and a digital elevation model with a resolution of 5 5 m lverma mv 2008 the sub basins were delineated by the position of the measurement stations for streamflow and p concentrations 2 3 statistical analyses as presented by baker et al 2004 and used for phosphorus modeling by ulén et al 2016 we calculated the richard baker flashiness index r b flashiness index for each year 1990 2010 by using the following equation 1 r b i n d e x i 1 n q i q i 1 i 1 n q i where q is the streamflow at a given time step the flashiness index reflects frequency and rapidity of short term changes in streamflow in a defined period of time we used a simple baseflow segmentation to subdivide streamflow data into a fast and slow component presuming that the fast streamflow signal is generated by tile drainage streamflow the baseflow component of the streamflow data was calculated according to nathan and mcmahon 1990 2 q d i α q d i 1 β 1 α q r i q where qd is the quick flow part of the stream flow which is subject to qd 0 for the time i in days qr is the total flow base flow quick flow and α and β are flow coefficients we employed mann kendall seasonal trend tests hirsch et al 1982 a trend test for time series with significant seasonal variation to determine long term trends from monthly medians of drp und tp concentrations furthermore we used mann kendall trend tests to test the annual p loads for temporal trends not taking seasonality into account non linear models were used for the characterization of relationships between streamflow weekly means and long term means of drp and tp concentrations models with three or less model parameters were selected which yielded the best model fit r2 the analysis was performed using the tablecurve 2d software package systat software inc 2002 models of the form y a b x2 for drp concentrations and y 1 a bx cx2 and y a bx simple linear model for tp concentrations were chosen annual loads of drp and tp were calculated by a bootstrapping approach we calculated the integral for the p concentration curves for each year this estimation was repeated 100 times by randomly leaving two measurements out the mean of the individual estimations per year was taken as the annual p load we fitted simple polynomial models of the form y ax2 bx c to the p load streamflow relationships a stepwise multiple linear regression approach was employed to model the annual drp and tp loads and detect dominant leaching pathways of drp and tp parameters used for the regression analysis were precipitation streamflow base flow peak flow and r b flashiness index per year and the number of days on which precipitation exceeded 0 10 15 and 20 mm respectively the non linear models of p concentrations and the linear regression models of p loads were evaluated by the coefficient of determination of measured and predicted values of p concentrations and annual p loads respectively prior linear and non linear modelling we smoothed the hydrograph at the watershed outlet with a 10 day moving average to minimize the effects of the dam and weir all statistical analyses were conducted employing the statistical software package r r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 dynamics and trends of streamflow phosphorus concentrations and phosphorus loads the mean streamflow of the investigated tributaries varied strongly from 0 2 m3 s 1 to 16 7 m3 s 1 table 3 over the period 1990 2010 the concentrations of drp and tp range between 2 and 1458 μg l 1 and 13 and 2040 μg l 1 respectively the mean concentrations of drp and tp were in the same order of magnitude across all sub basins with 60 μg l 1 drp and 136 μg l 1 tp respectively solely the zarnow sub basin showed higher mean concentrations of drp and tp of 132 μg l 1 and 184 μg l 1 respectively the mean annual r b flashiness index of streamflow varied strongly across all sub basins p 0 001 mann whitney u test table 3 and over time 1990 2010 fig 2 a the inter annual variability of the flashiness is large with coefficients of variation ranging from 0 16 nebel sub basin to 0 25 mildenitz sub basin the mean annual r b flashiness index of the sub basins fig 2b was significantly correlated to the portion of artificially drained area of the sub basins p 0 001 r2 0 93 linear regression model over the investigation period 1990 2010 the concentrations of drp and tp showed significant negative temporal trends for eight of the nine observed sub basins fig 2c according to the mann kendall seasonal trend test solely the upper warnow sub basin did not show a significant downward or upward trend for both drp and tp fig 2d and e calculating the temporal trends by annual medians of p concentrations we obtain significant negative temporal trends for seven sub basins only the middle warnow and the upper warnow sub basins showed no negative trend for drp and the beke and the upper warnow sub basins for tp the observed temporal trends changed in the 21st century the seasonal mann kendall trend tests for the 2000 2010 data set showed no significant trends for eight of the sub basins for the drp concentrations table 4 interestingly the temporal trends for the tp concentrations changed to significant upward trends in six of the sub basins interestingly the temporal trends for the tp concentrations changed to significant upward trends in six sub basins the concentrations of tp increased from 5 7 to 22 1 lower warnow sub basin catchment outlet increases calculated by the slope of the linear trend line the mean tp concentration of these six sub basins showing positive temporal trends is 13 5 μg on the contrary the annual medians of drp and tp concentrations for the 2000 2010 period showed no significant trends in eight sub basins drp concentrations exhibited a strong seasonal pattern independent from the year and the sub basin fig 3 the highest concentrations of drp were recorded in summer and autumn weeks 25 45 whereas the concentrations in winter and spring were the lowest weeks 46 24 the patterns of tp were ambiguous with discontinuous regional peaks over time generally the differences of seasonal minima and maxima were lower for tp than for drp except the zarnow and mildenitz sub basins we fitted non linear models in the form of y a b x2 to long term weekly means of streamflow and drp and tp concentrations although the quality of the model fits varied strongly among the nine sub basins the patterns were similar for all monitoring stations with a marked decrease of drp concentrations with increasing streamflow fig 4 the model optimization for streamflow and tp concentrations revealed a satisfactory strength of the relationships for most of the sub basins only for the koesterbeck the zarnow and the beke sub basins a reciprocal quadratic y 1 a bx cx2 koesterbeck and zarnow and a linear model y a bx beke gave better optimization results these three sub basins were those with the highest portion of artificial drainage table 1 however there was a marked tendency of increasing concentrations of tp at streamflow events fig 4 the loads of drp and tp varied strongly across all sub basins and resulted in mean annual loads of 30 380 kg drp and 82 026 kg tp at the warnow river basin outlet equaling 0 10 and 0 27 kg ha 1 a 1 drp and tp respectively for the period from 1990 to 1999 table 5 the loads for the period 2000 2010 were 21 266 kg drp and 51 646 kg tp corresponding to 0 07 and 0 17 kg ha 1 a 1 drp and tp respectively linear and non linear models reveled a marked negative relationship between the number of waste water treatment plants in a sub basin and the mean annual loads of drp and tp in the years 2012 and 2013 the portion of tp originating from waste water treatment plants was 26 and 18 respectively which equals a tp load of approximately 9000 kg a 1 thus 74 and 82 of the tp load that was released to the baltic sea originated from diffuse sources earlier data is missing 3 2 modelling annual phosphorus loads the stepwise multiple linear regression of drp and tp loads produced simple linear models with shifting parameters for each sub basin table 6 regression analysis was conducted with the overall data set from 1990 to 2010 and additionally with a truncated data set from 2000 to 2010 the model quality varied clearly during the period 1990 2010 for the drp loads data not shown baseflow was a significant predictor for drp in five sub basins and quickflow in two sub basins while the r b flashiness index was a significant predictor in three sub basins we could not find any predictive driver of drp loads at the river basin outlet lower warnow and the beke sub basin yielding statistically significant relationships between measured and modelled values the tp loads were best predicted by quickflow in five sub basins and by baseflow in four sub basins additionally r b flashiness index was a predictive variable in three sub basins we could not find any predictive driver of tp loads at the beke sub basin the linear models for the period 2000 2010 showed a distinct increase of predictive power all sub basins achieved a satisfactory model quality with coefficients of determination higher than 0 5 for both drp and tp table 6 figs 5 and 6 baseflow had a high predictive power in six sub basins r b flashiness index predicted the annual loads of drp in two sub basins while quickflow and the number of rain days with p 15 mm was predictive in only one sub basin the models derived for tp indicated a higher impact of the fast flow components of streamflow quickflow and r b flashiness index were predictive parameters in five sub basins the number of days with a precipitation higher than 15 mm and baseflow had predictive power in two sub basins we found no predictive variables for the upper warnow sub basin 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of phosphorus concentrations and phosphorus loads the mean drp and tp concentrations for the sub basins ranged from 60 to 132 and 114 to 184 μg l 1 in the period 1990 2010 respectively the länderarbeitsgemeinschaft wasser 1998 a german federal organizational unit for the development and monitoring of water quality standards has set values of lower than 100 μg l 1 drp and 150 μg l 1 tp for a good water quality status of rivers in total 714 of 3674 total measurements and 883 of 2948 total measurements measurements of drp and tp respectively exceeded the target values the mean annual values for drp tp exceeded the target values in 17 41 of 90 cases in the period from 1990 to 2000 and in no 3 from 90 cases in the period from 2000 to 2010 this indicates a large improvement regarding the water quality standards in the warnow river basin the magnitude and the range of observed drp and tp concentrations are in accordance with findings from other agricultural watersheds in europe bowes et al 2015 dąbrowska et al 2016 mellander et al 2015 minaudo et al 2015 the observed concentrations are supported by a comprehensive study of p losses from a multitude of european catchments over several spatial scales 30 km2 to 50 000 km2 drp 10 μg l 1 to 160 μg l 1 tp 40 μg l 1 to 930 μg l 1 kronvang et al 2007 that study also confirmed a large spatial and temporal variability of p fluxes from catchments the concentrations of drp and tp in the warnow river basin vary strongly intra and inter annually significant decreasing trends for drp and tp concentrations and loadings were found in the 1990 s the reasons for these negative temporal trends are various our data reveal that the number of waste water treatment plants may be one cause fig 7 it has been recently estimated that roughly 95 of all inhabitants are connected to a state of the art waste water treatment in germany ott and rechberger 2012 which resulted in a tp fraction originating from waste water treatment plants of 26 and 18 for the years 2012 and 2013 respectively thus 74 and 82 of the tp loads that were released to the baltic sea originated from diffuse sources decreasing p trends might also be related to reduced p inputs per capita in crop production since 1980 europe wide van dijk et al 2016 in germany the p surpluses of agricultural soils were reduced since 1990 and are negative since 2004 bach and frede 1998 the amount of applied mineral p fertilizer and the extent of animal farming decreased significantly in the federal state of mecklenburg west pomerania in the 1990 s after the shift of the political regime kape et al 2014 the p stock of the mineral soils is nowadays in general in an optimal state today according to the local classification system and the given concentration classes low medium optimal high and very high schweder et al 2004 however soils with an optimal soil p content still have a high p leaching potential which is particular prone to mobilization after heavy rainfall events tiemeyer et al 2009 studies in other catchments confirm the observed decrease in p concentrations in surface waters as a consequence of changes in land use and improved waste water treatment ekholm et al 2015 minaudo et al 2015 however there are also watersheds that do not show improvements in water quality despite various mitigation activities stålnacke et al 1998 hence the reasons for upward or downward temporal trends strongly depend on catchment properties and anthropogenic activities the observed recent upward trend in tp concentrations is sub basin specific and spatially differentiated the number of livestock farms in the watershed has increased markedly over the last 15 years the total number of pigs and poultry increased by 19 and 26 respectively between 2000 and 2010 in the federal state of mecklenburg west pomerania statistische berichte 2016 however positive tp trends can likewise be attributed to altering hydrological conditions discharge decreased significantly in all sub basins seasonal mann kendall trend test p 0 001 while the number of rainfall events increased linear regression p 0 01 the increased number of rainfall events may release legacy p from agricultural fields via tile drainage it has been observed that in human dominated watersheds after long accumulation periods with high p inputs the accumulated phosphorus can be mobilized even if the total input declines powers et al 2016 king et al 2017 the factors of mobilization of p in those watersheds are complex and specific the release of p through surface runoff is negligible in lowland watersheds potential pools for p in surface waters are bank erosion in rivers re mobilization of within channel p bowes et al 2014 kronvang et al 2012 loss of p laden sediments through tile drains outram et al 2014 king et al 2015 zimmer et al 2016 losses of p during periods of high ground water tables and ground water temperature flores lópez et al 2013 losses of p from mineralized peatlands as a consequence of drainage behrendt et al 2004 and inflow of p enriched groundwater holman et al 2008 especially after extreme precipitation events the relationship between streamflow and drp and tp concentrations showed high concentrations at low rates of streamflow and reciprocally this is reflected by the observed seasonal patterns with higher p concentrations in summer and confirms results from bowes et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 nausch et al 2017 the observed patterns may be caused by intensive microbial processes during summer with p release from river bed sediments and or the contribution of point source pollution at low flow rates and dilution processes at higher rates the higher tp concentrations at peak flow events may be caused by within channel mobilization of river bed sediments and suspended sediments from drains and soils via preferential flow bowes et al 2014 however in this study an evaluation of event based drp and tp losses in more detail was not possible because of the course sampling scheme bi to four weekly grab sample which often led to missing p data at very strong flow events hot moments of p export because of the low temporal resolution of concentration measurements uncertainty in the estimation of annual p loads has to be taken into account however a long term bi or four weekly sampling scheme seems a solid basis to uncover intra and inter annual p dynamics and long term trends of surface water quality 4 2 modelling annual phosphorus loads the modelling of p losses to rivers requires detailed knowledge of watershed characteristics and underlying processes the multitude of biogeochemical processes regarding p loss often impedes precise and satisfactory modelling collick et al 2015 however simple statistical models may reveal insight to major transport pathways at basin scale the model result for the outlet of the warnow river basin might be impaired by backwater effects caused by a dam and a weir that segregates the freshwater section of the warnow river from its brackish course inflow from the baltic sea the derived p models are probably affected although the hydrograph was smoothened by a 10 day moving average the employed statistical models for the depiction of annual drp and tp loads reflect the characteristics of the investigated sub basins with satisfactory accuracy table 6 after a comprehensive analysis of morphology land use fraction of artificially drained areas a direct linkage of the processes as identified through the statistical models to watershed properties could not be established table 7 in sub basins with a large fraction of artificial drainage baseflow was identified as the main driver of drp loads solute dilution occurs at high flow rates however peak flow events may have been missed by the coarse sampling scheme for the nebel sub basin where the baseflow was found a predictive variable also for tp we assume that the retention potential of lake krakow has smoothened peak flow tp concentrations the r b flashiness index is strongly correlated with increasing frequency and magnitude of storm events baker et al 2004 on a smaller spatial scale 1 km2 the r b flashiness index was used to predict p leaching from different fields of former swine farms in sweden ulén et al 2016 we assume that the r b flashiness index is primarily an expression for increased runoff from tile drains thus hillslopes and artificially drained areas near the watershed outlet may stimulate this relationship if the p retention potential of the river is low however there might be additional processes that play an important role in p leaching independent from morphological or land use aspects important processes in loamy and clay soils are preferential flow and internal erosion through the soil profile to tile drains as observed previously makris et al 2006 williams et al 2016 dye tracer experiments on mineral soils in the zarnow sub basin have shown that colloids can be transported to depths up to 0 7 m following preferential flow pathways koch et al 2016 5 summary and conclusion the analysis of a 21 year dataset of phosphorus concentrations and streamflow from a mid size river basin including nine sub basins revealed that the surface water quality has in general improved over the last decades this effect can most likely be attributed to newly installed waste water treatment plants the better agricultural p management and lower p fertilization rates in the 1990ies slight increases in p concentrations in surface water bodies in the 21st century are probably related to an increased number of live stock farms and the release of legacy p in the catchment p concentrations and loads varied within and between the years for a realistic estimation of annual p loads we emphasize a high frequency sampling strategy during storm events simple linear regression analyses consistently documented the influence of groundwater to the concentration of dissolved reactive phosphorus in brooks and rivers whereas the concentration of total phosphorus is strongly regulated by a fast flow component in lowland catchments with reduced surface runoff quick flow originates basically from the widespread artificial drainage systems further diffuse sources for increased concentrations of p in surface water bodies are p laden soil particles from bank erosion and within channel re mobilization of riverine sediments further studies should investigate the role of internal soil and bank streams and

8534,the ncrs curve number equation allows calculating the storm runoff from a rainfall event for specific types of land use it was based on an analysis of direct runoff data using baseflow corrected hydrographs and rainfall given this basis the curve number equation can be derived assuming a constant effective rainfall intensity and a cubic reciprocal function as the instantaneous unit hydrograph the instantaneous unit hydrograph and the resulting curve number equation are further generalized by adding a lag time the equation for a curve number related hydrograph is presented allowing to fit this curve number based hydrograph to event data the curve number itself is shown be a function of a catchment response time and the average event rainfall intensity as the catchment response time is linked to the time of concentration the curve number equation and the storage index can be linked to catchment and flow type characteristics first results suggest that including the rainfall intensity

management measures in catchments or other units of water management is generally based on national engineering practices procedures and standards one such engineering handbook for design in watershed management is the hydrology part of the neh developed for use in and based on data from the united states for peak discharge analysis the neh suggests using or offers guidance on a number of steps one of which is converting rainfall to direct runoff using the curve number equation usda nrcs 2004b in a next step the direct runoff now regarded as effective or excess rainfall is converted to a hydrograph for a specific catchment using a unit hydrograph usda nrcs 2007 the unit hydrograph is the catchment response function and converts a unit excess rainfall over a finite period of time to the resulting partial catchment hydrograph an extension of the catchment response function is the instantaneous unit hydrograph it converts a unit excess rainfall which has fallen over an infinitely small period of time to the resulting partial catchment hydrograph summing the individual partial hydrographs over a rainfall event in a number of finite steps using the unit hydrograph yields the catchment hydrograph for that event for the instantaneous unit hydrograph this process of generating and summing an infinite number of partial hydrographs is the so called convolution integral given effective rainfall over time both instantaneous unit hydrographs and unit hydrographs can be applied to generate a catchment hydrograph for a detailed description of the above c f e g brutsaert 2013 or bras 1990 the curve number equation was initially developed analysing catchment scale rainfall runoff events in gauged basins in the continental united states which were analyzed in terms of cumulative event rainfall and the cumulative storm depth or direct runoff using the hydrograph corrected for base flow it is characterized as a spatially lumped event based rainfall runoff response function e g bartlett et al 2016 the equation is parameterized using land use land management and hydrological soil type in lookup tables which is and was paid less attention to in other rainfall runoff lumped models in other locations with different soils different land use types and a different climate its use raises validity issues which is or could be addressed by site specific research some examples korea shin et al 2015 mexico velásquez valle et al 2017 india kadam et al 2012 the starting point of this analysis is the reference version of the curve number equation usda nrcs 2004b 1 q p i a 2 p s i a i f p i a e l s e q 0 which can be rewritten as 2 q p s i a s 2 p s i a i f p i a e l s e q 0 where q the event direct runoff mm p the event rainfall depth mm s the storage index mm ia the initial abstraction mm the basic assumption leading to this equation is presented in usda nrcs 2004b but is also provided by a o mishra and singh 2003 and ritzema 2006 the standard version of the curve number equation reduces the number of parameters to one by setting ia to 0 2s 3 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s i f p 0 2 s e l s e q 0 and the storage index is calculated using an auxiliary function 4 s 254 100 cn 1 where cn 0 100 is the so called curve number which is defined by land use and hydrological soil type the justification of setting ia to 0 2s for practical applications has been extensively analysed asce 2009 and works quoted therein more generally the initial abstraction ia is assumed proportional to s i a λ s currently a value of λ 0 05 is suggested asce 2009 the storage index s is determined from measured data of event rainfall p and associated direct runoff q estimated from discharge measurements the direct runoff rate q consists of combinations of three components direct precipitation on the channel surface flow or overland flow and subsurface flow e g dingman 2008 in overland flow a distinction is made between overland flow due to infiltration excess and overland flow due to saturation excess direct runoff is assumed to dominate the hydrograph up to the point where the hydrograph recession starts and base flow becomes dominant whereas in the development of the curve number equation the method used to determine direct runoff was never published asce 2009 page 46 suggests as an aside that data from the report by dalrymple 1965 presenting rainfall and direct runoff could have been used dalrymple 1965 defines baseflow by extending the trend of flow prior to the flood to the time of the peak and then drawing a line to a point on the recession limb a number of days after the peak with the number depending on the size of the catchment the discharge exceeding the baseflow rate is the direct runoff rate this method of hydrograph separation was presented in earlier textbooks e g linsley et al 1949 and is also presented by dunne and leopold 1978 and dingman 2008 the curve number equation its history the factors which influence the parameters the theoretical basis and the implementation and use in models has been and is being extensively discussed e g ponce and hawkins 1996 mishra and singh 2003 garen and moore 2005 bartlett et al 2016 chin 2021 hoeft 2020 reviews e g verma et al 2017 ormsbee et al 2020 in addition provide an overview over the diversity of research areas and topics the nrcs curve number equation can also be formulated as a soil moisture accounting procedure e g michel et al 2005 in their analysis the initial abstraction is linked to the initial storage conditions at the start of the model calculations in this context direct runoff is regarded as the difference between rainfall and infiltration this has been and is a topic of research a o chin 2017 baiamonte 2019 kirkby and cerdà 2021 early papers are aron et al 1977 hjelmfelt 1980 in their monograph on the curve number equation mishra and singh 2003 dedicate a chapter to the relation between infiltration and direct runoff hoosyar and wang 2016 show that in the case of infiltration excess and a constant rainfall intensity the resulting equation for the cumulative runoff yields the curve number equation for a specific retention curve and holds approximately for other soil types garen and moore 2005 however stress that direct runoff need not only be infiltration excess overland flow and that the difference between rainfall and direct runoff is not only infiltration another possible component of direct runoff is saturation excess overland flow from a source area varying in size e g dingman 2008 which was used by steenhuis et al 1995 to theoretically derive the curve number equation whereas for some catchments it may be justified to focus either on infiltration excess on saturation excess on the kinematic wave equation for overland flow or on soil moisture accounting and infiltration this should not lead to neglecting other mechanisms which may contribute in varying proportions over varying fractions of the catchment area to the catchment scale direct runoff garen and moore 2005 beven 2012 beven 2012 p 206 summarizes research and discussions on the curve number equation by stating that at the small catchment scale and in a simple functional form the curve number equation incorporates some empirical knowledge of fast runoff generation by some combination of different flow mechanisms infiltration excess saturation excess or processes referred to as subsurface stormflow by brutsaert 2013 the question to be addressed is based on the history of the equation sketched above if the curve number equation is or was based on hydrograph data for direct runoff and the instantaneous unit hydrograph is in theory applicable could an instantaneous unit hydrograph not also provide a basis for the curve number equation and if it provides a basis what are consequences is this basis also sufficiently flexible to account for different mechanisms contributing to direct runoff 2 theory effective rainfall intensity and an instantaneous unit hydrograph as described in the introduction the curve number equation allows to calculate cumulative direct runoff as a function of cumulative effective precipitation in a rainfall event cumulative direct runoff is the integral of the difference between the hydrograph and the estimated baseflow the hydrograph i e the direct runoff rate as a function of time is the convolution integral of the effective intensity of the rainfall event and the instantaneous unit hydrograph the instantaneous unit hydrograph describes the transformation of a unit of rainfall to discharge for the limit case of a time interval going to 0 to determine the relation between direct runoff and event precipitation assumptions regarding the effective rainfall intensity and the instantaneous unit hydrograph are then needed 2 1 the effective rainfall intensity to apply the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh its input needs to be defined in terms of effective rainfall rates or effective rainfall intensity effective rainfall intensity is the rainfall intensity corrected for losses for approaches to rainfall losses brutsaert 2013 presents three options a continuous constant loss rate a constant proportional loss rate or an initial loss the combination of these assumptions results in 5a p e t t a p d t 5b p α p p l p p l 0 p p l where pe is the effective event rainfall mm ta is the time effective precipitation starts the event itself starts at t 0 hour t is the duration of the rainfall event hour p is the rainfall intensity mm hour 1 pl is a constant loss over time smaller than p mm hour 1 α is a constant reduction fraction an assumption which would fit the context of the curve number equation is that of a constant intensity with excess rainfall starting after the time required for the initial abstraction i e pe and p differ by a constant offset this would suggest α 1 pl 0 and ta 0 a constant loss rate would require assuming α 1 ta 0 and 0 pl p while a constant reduction fraction corresponds to the case pl 0 ta 0 and 0 α 1 2 2 an instantaneous unit hydrograph to illustrate the basic steps we will start from the instantaneous unit

rainfall intensity the rate of the discharge becomes equal to the direct runoff intensity pe and the system is at steady state the infinite integral with constant unit rainfall intensity is also known as the s hydrograph cf dooge and o kane 2003 p 22 we will assume that direct runoff is generated during the duration of the rainfall event and no other losses occur introducing q the cumulative or total direct runoff mm setting q dq dt and integrating q between t ta and t t time of rainfall duration yields 8 q t p e t p e t a p e k l 1 e k l t t a i f t t a e l s e q 0 t t to transform this

q t p s i a s e p i a s i f p i a e l s e q 0 the rational function and the exponential behave differently so the shape will be different when s is set to s the functions can be scaled setting s to s dividing by s and setting ia to 0 2s and are compared in fig 1 the scaled equations are 14 q s p s 1 2 1 p s 0 8 i f p s 0 2 e l s e q 0 15 q s p s 1 2 e 0 2 p s i f p s 0 2 e l s e q 0 2 3 a curve number equation based on an instantaneous unit hydrograph the close similarity between these two results begs the question whether an instantaneous unit hydrograph exists which after convolution with a constant intensity and a second integration of the rising limb of the hydrograph from time required for initial abstraction to the event duration yields the reference curve number equation assuming a constant effective rainfall intensity pe equal to the observed rainfall intensity p it can be shown that if the product of this constant rainfall intensity p and the instantaneous unit hydrograph h t is given by 16 p t h t p 2 k k t 1 3 where k is equal to 1 t and t is the catchment response time the result is indeed the curve number equation this is shown in the following steps the discharge function for the rising limb is derived using the convolution integral 17 q t a t 2 k p k t τ 1 3 d τ and results in the discharge function 18 q p p 1 k t t a 2 integrating the discharge over the period between the start of runoff ta and the end of the event t then yields the amount of water which becomes direct runoff 19 q t a t q d t p t p t a p k k 2 t t a t a t or 20 q p t p t a p k k 2 t

ia as otherwise there is no direct runoff the iuh of the linear reservoir and that leading to the curve number equation are compared in fig 2 2 4 the direct runoff component of the hydrograph for a constant intensity event the hydrograph behaviour for the direct runoff component could be assumed to be symmetrical in which case the parameters are identical for both the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph the hydrograph can then be described by 22a q p p 1 k t t a 2 t a t t p f 1 k t t p 2 t t p 22b f p p 1 k t p t a 2 and 22c q 0 t t a expressing this equation in terms of s by either substituting k as p s or by substituting p as ks is possible but in the context of parameter estimation not desirable in parameter estimation replacing tp by ta td where td is the length of the rise avoids convergence issues for comparison purposes the equations for the linear reservoir are the following 23a q p p e k l t t a t a t t p f e k l t t p t t p where 23b f p p e k l t p t a and 23c q 0 t t a the parameter p is the effective intensity so rainfall intensity corrected for losses but given the previous assumptions only an initial loss pe and p are equal the scaled hydrographs for the linear reservoir and the curve number reservoir are presented in fig 3 a equation 22a c also allow estimating parameters directly from base flow corrected hydrographs to provide an example we have used base flow corrected hydrograph data diskin and boneh 1975 to fit the hydrograph assuming the same parameter values for the rising branch and for the recession and using eq 22abc the function was fitted to the data using the excel solver to minimize the sum of squared differences for parameters p ta tp and k fig 3b shows the worst and best fit for illustrative purposes 2 5 introducing an additional lag assuming an extra lag in the instantaneous unit hydrograph would reduce the conversion of rainfall to direct runoff in that case the above steps can be repeated starting from the convolution integral of 25 p t h t p 2 k k t l 1 3 where l is an extra lag units of time compared to the original iuh the steps resulting in the lagged curve number equation are presented in annex a for both the linear reservoir and the above iuh the curve number equation can then be shown to be a specific case of the equation defined by 26 q β β p i a 2 s β p i a i f p i a e l s e q 0 where the extra lag is expressed as a parameter β 0 β 1 the parameter β strongly reduces the direct runoff the equation reverts to the reference curve number equation for β 1 2 6 the relation between storage index s the catchment response time 1 k and the time of concentration the instantaneous unit hydrograph at the basis of the curve number equation for a constant rainfall intensity and β 1 is given by 27 h t 2 k k t 1 3 and contains one parameter a characteristic time the catchment response time t 1 k to determine the storage index s requires determining t and multiplying by intensity p the question is whether we can derive a relation between catchment time scales and the catchment response time t and whether the product pt s is constant a central parameter in rainfall runoff analysis is the time of concentration tc defined as the time base of the instantaneous hydrograph bras 1990 p 432 which corresponds to the time at which the entire area considered contributes to the flow at the point of interest as the curve number iuh equation 27 decreases to zero asymptotically the time base would be infinite assuming for practical purposes that the conversion to discharge is negligible if h t 0 01 k it can be shown that for the curve number equation t c 200 3 1 t 4 84 t for the linear reservoir this assumption leads to the relation t c t ln 100 4 60 t cf dingman 2008 box 9 2 equations

concentrated flow and open channel flow along the most distant flow path in the cases in which overland flow is the dominant mechanism and given that the cn method characterizes catchment surface properties rather than channel dimensions the relation between sheet flow parameters and the time of concentration seems especially relevant brutsaert 2013 page 479 eq 12 22 presents an equation for

this equation reduces to the equation of sheet flow above quoted by brutsaert 2013 page 479 eq 12 22 and akan and houghalen 2003 p 101 eq 5 5 t is again in seconds finally brutsaert 2013 p 479 eq 12

here can be multiplied by the intensity p and allow to estimate s the limitation of the current review however is that the dominant flow mechanism is either not specified the equation is empirical is based on partial infiltration excess or on flow in permeable soils the equations so far suggest that s is a function of slope cf also muhammad et al 2020 and a catchment length scale often the main channel length and that based on the approaches presented the product s pt is not a constant the decrease of t with slope leading to a decrease in s and a corresponding increase of cn values with slope is supported though by limited data by sprenger 1978 quoted as table 4 3 in ritzema 2006 more recent by ajmal et al 2020 the dependence of cn on slope using the table in ritzema 2006 is presented in fig 4 a variability due to land use type and soil type is large asce 2009 also quotes results that suggest a decrease of cn with slope when focusing on sheet flow a manning roughness coefficient is required qualitatively matching the values for the manning roughness coefficient for sheet flow with cn values usda nrcs 2010 results in fig 4b which offers some support that s values increase and cn values decrease with manning roughness if rainfall is infiltrating soil physical properties become important as the saturated conductivity increases the catchment response time becomes longer and s increases cn decreases the cn values associated with hydrological soils classes a d qualitatively match this response asce 2009 as shown in fig 4c as to the relation between storage and a length scale water harvesting literature for microcatchments e g sharma 1986 252 to 432 m2 and li et al 2006 5 50 m2 shows that runoff efficiency mm runoff mm rain or the runoff coefficient decreases with area suggesting storage index s increases with area kirkby and cerda 2021 show that threshold storage above which runoff occurs increases as a power function of plot length plot lengths up to 16

ephemeral channels there is currently no tabulated effect of scale on cn or s this cursory overview suggests that the equations for tc and consequently t do not contradict trends in the tabulated cn values but that effect of a specific variable e g slope may be small compared to the effects of other variables hydrology class and land use type 2 7 the relation between storage index s the average event intensity p and the total event rainfall p the effect of rainfall intensity p requires a separate analysis the curve number equation with an additional lag β eq 26 can also be written as re substituting s p k using ia λs and setting p pt 35 q β 2 p t λ p k 2 pt 1 β λ p k i f t λ k e l s e q 0 with the catchment response time expressed as 1 k the equation can also be expressed in terms of t 1 k as 36 q β 2 p t λ t 2 t 1 β λ t i f t λ t e l s e q 0 in this form the equation shows that cumulative direct runoff is a linear function of intensity for rainfall events of equal duration t in the case β t and λ are constants rainfall intensity p is however not only a function of duration t but also of the average recurrence interval tr and is described by an intensity duration frequency function idf p t tr a first analysis of the effect of including intensity in the curve number equation can be based on an empirical idf equation modified from dingman 2008 eq 4 28b 37 p p s r t t s b 1 where b and ts are empirical coefficients the parameter ps r is the extrapolated intensity at duration t 0 for a specific recurrence interval tr it is practical to write the curve number equation in terms of total event rainfall p which can be done by calculating p t tr calculating q p t calculating p as pt and then plotting q as a function of p alternatively for large relative durations the intensity can be approximated as 38 p p s r t t s b in this case the intensity can also be written as a function of the event rainfall 39 p p s r p p s r b 1 b substitution equation 39 in equation 36 results in a curve number equation which includes the dependency of event rainfall on intensity and duration and not yet explicitly formulated the average recurrence interval 40 q β 2 p λ p s r k p p

number equation the results so far depend on the assumption of an intensity which is constant during an event and an initial loss the initial abstraction in addition a third parameter β allowing for an additional lag time in the catchment was introduced two additional parameters b and ps r were necessary to include the effect of the relation between intensity duration and event rainfall the re interpretation of the curve number equation and the added parameter will affect the shape of the function q p to analyze deviations from the standard curve number equation asce 2009 calculate cn values for each data pair and plot these as a function of rainfall p the central equation in this approach is the following 43 s 5 p 2 q 4 q 2 5 p q where s is calculated for all data pairs p q cn is calculated using 44 cn 100 1 s 254 this equation is found solving the standard curve number for s and selecting the negative root if the data pairs exactly match the standard curve number equation the result will be described by the equation 45 cn 100 1 5 p 254 q 0 c n q 0 this procedure defines a check for possible bias in terms of the parameter of interest cn whereas in residual analysis one would expect residuals with zero mean and no discernable trend when plotted as a function of the independent variable in this analysis once runoff occurs q 0 one would expect the calculated cn values to be distributed with a constant mean the fitted cn with randomly distributed errors with zero mean again when plotted against the independent variable p to give an example we have plotted the result for a cn value of 70 for the standard curve number and that for a modified standard with a λ of 0 05 and for a λ of 0 35 as a function of rainfall p the results cf fig 5 show a systematic change in calculated cn values which in this case is explained by a value of λ other than 0 2 when analysing measured data using a cn p plot the result could then suggest changing the value of λ to remove bias the question is whether these cn p bias plots are sufficiently different for the different parameters i e p β ps r b and λ to pinpoint a likely cause 2 8 analysis of the additional parameters in terms of bias in the cn p plot the above describes a method to analyze differences between the standard curve number equation and measured data or the results from a modified version of the equation such as equation 42 the effect of the 4 parameters β λ b and ps r is illustrated by the rainfall runoff plot q p and the bias plot cn p both for multiple values of the parameter and a given cn value cn 50 which determines ss r whereas the parameters β and λ have a reference value for which the equation reverts to the standard curve number equation β 1 0 β 1 and λ 0 2 0 λ 1 the reference value for b is 0 0 b 1 in which case ps r has no effect the effect of ps r is therefore analyzed for b 0 5 and the effect of b is analyzed for ps r λss r the results are presented in fig 6 a h when the cn p plots are calculated using real data they could provide a first idea which parameter or parameters in the equation cause the mismatch analyzing rainfall runoff data in terms of cn p plots i e the bias of the standard curve number equation with respect to the data asce 2009 distinguishes three different types of responses in catchments over the available rainfall range complacent standard and violent complacent catchments are best described by a linear relation between direct runoff and rainfall standard catchments show cn values decreasing with rainfall in a way that suggests an asymptotic cn value whereas violent catchments show cn values asymptotically increasing with rainfall in a way that suggests a constant value for large rainfall amounts examples of the three types are given by hawkins 1993 and asce 2009 whereas tedela et al 2012 presents examples for standard behaviour in that context the bias due to ps r and b and to some extent λ 0 2 could be classified as violent whereas β 1 and λ 0 2 could be classified as either standard or complacent 2 9 bias analysis including the effect of the average recurrence interval the previous analysis using eq 42 did not include the effect of the average recurrence interval intensity duration frequency information is often published by national services for the united states e g intensity duration frequency data have been or are being published and updated by nws 2022 to illustrate the effect of including the recurrence interval on the calculated runoff the idf tabulated values for coweeta coweeta experimental station nc nws 2022 were retrieved using the standard curve number equation and the full range of the idf direct runoff was calculated for a specific curve number minimizing a sum of squares criterion using the solver add in of microsoft excel equation 36 was fitted to the data to estimate t and λ β was set to 1 the associated cn value was calculated using equation 43 45 for each q p pair the cn values were also calculated using independently sorted rainfall and direct runoff so called frequency matching or rank re ordered data e g tedela et al 2012 or hawkins 1993 examples of the q p and cn p plots are presented in fig 7 a d for eq 36 fitted to cn 50 and to cn 75 λ 0 2 comparing the cn p plots for the rank ordered data show that the behaviour of direct runoff changes the result for cn 75 would be characterized as violent whereas the result for cn 50 would be characterized as standard interestingly the fitted values of λ are 0 for both cases 2 10 effect of a varying intensity within an event a simplifying assumption leading to the above results is that of a constant effective intensity during the rainfall event to check the effect of this assumption we assumed a linearly increasing or decreasing intensity with a total rainfall equal to p after evaluating the convolution integral and integrating the hydrograph over the event duration the bias in the function cn p was analysed the two intensity functions are 46a p 1 2 p t 2 t 46b p 2 2 p t 2 p t 2 t the convolution integrals are 47a q 1 t a t 2 p t 2 τ 2 p s 2 p t τ s 3 d τ 47b q 2 t a t 2 p t 2 p t 2 τ 2 p s 2 p t τ s 3 d τ where we have now formulated the instantaneous unit hydrograph in terms of the mean intensity for the first case after integrating twice the cumulative discharge up to the peak discharge at time t is 48a q 1 p 1 i a 2 p 2 2 s 2 s 2 p i a s i a p 2 s 2 p l n p s i a s the second case is a combination of the curve number hydrograph with an intensity 2p 2p t from which the cumulative discharge q1 is then subtracted 48b q 2 2 p 2 i a 2 s 2 s 2 s p i a q 1 using the example of cn 70 with rainfall between 0 and 350 mm in steps of 10 mm 36 pairs the first case an intensity increasing with time leads to slightly lower curve numbers 68 2 whereas the second case decreasing intensity leads to slightly higher curve numbers 72 2 fig 8 shows the cn p plot and the q p plot for both cases 3 discussion we set out to investigate a possible link between an instantaneous unit hydrograph and the curve number equation this is shown to be possible and convolution of an instantaneous unit hydrograph with a constant intensity and a further integration over the event duration results in an analogue of the curve number equation as the example of the linear reservoir shows the assumption of a constant intensity was tested and showed that the resulting equation is not very sensitive to linear variation of the within event intensity to retain simplicity a one parameter instantaneous unit hydrograph would be preferable but not essential adding an additional parameter a lag time l resulted in a curve number equation which for the same storage index has much lower discharge as shown in an analysis of the behaviour of the equation for different parameter values this additional parameter allows for so called complacent behaviour another possible two parameter iuh model is a series of n linear reservoirs with time constant k with a gamma probability density function as the iuh the nash model bras 1990 p 446 the convolution of the gamma probability function with a constant intensity would yield a cumulative gamma distribution describing the direct runoff rate for the rising limb the definite integral of the cumulative gamma distribution would then become the nash analogue of the curve number equation from the point of presenting concise and simple formulations this is not an attractive perspective starting from the relation between q and p a function with an oblique asymptote could allow to derive the q p and the iuh function first derivative rising limb of the hydrograph second derivative the instantaneous unit hydrograph for a constant intensity which could serve to describe rainfall runoff behaviour a generalization of the curve number equation as the ratio of two rational functions where the numerator is exactly a power 1 larger than the denominator would meet this requirement another function with a linear asymptote is the expolinear equation presented as an alternative for the curve number equation by paz pellat 2009 referring to goudriaan and van laar 2012 an interesting consequence of the presented equations is that both fitting a hydrograph to an event and fitting a curve number equation to a series of events is possible using the same parameters comparisons between the series based parameter values and the event based parameters but also changes from event to event could provide insight in causes of parameter variability such as the variation in vegetation cover seasonal variation in curve numbers was analysed by e g d asaro et al 2018 a strong point of the curve number equation ponce and hawkins 1996 is that it captures the effect of land use changes and interventions in a single parameter the storage index s it was possible to keep the equation in a one to two parameter form assuming the initial abstraction ia to a constant λ times the storage index s the presented theoretical basis suggests to rethink catchment land use changes and interventions in terms of the catchment response time t instead of in terms of the storage index s based on the equations for t reviewed so far s as the product pt is not constant but using t theoretically links different site factors to s the initial abstraction now as λpt is retained other parameters added those of the idf function are catchment independent the idf function used in the presented analysis is empirical but allows to illustrate effect of including rainfall duration the use of tabulated values for the idf reflects another level of available information and shows the effect of adding recurrence time as a variable this analysis could be extended by using continuous idf functions an idf function based on a statistical distribution the gev distribution was proposed by koutsoyiannis 2004 and used by e g overeem et al 2010 it has been parameterized at a global scale by courty et al 2019 using these idf functions would allow a more general analysis than the one presented here in terms of including intensity or event duration in the curve number equation jain et al 2006 conclude that including a power function dependency of ia on rainfall and a power function correction of the rainfall for the event duration improves the performance compared to the standard curve number equation the effect could have been similar to the inclusion of intensity in the theory presented here but further mathematical analysis is needed to show to which extent the outcome of the equations corresponds also an analysis of the equation performance based on available rainfall runoff data has not been executed in this paper two interesting observations can be made on the basis of the detailed idf table retrieved for coweeta including the local idf function in combination with the catchment response time eq 34 gives rise to both standard and violent behaviour in addition for both examples presented here λ is estimated to be 0 an extensive analysis estimating the value of λ quoted in asce 2009 supports a value of λ 0 05 smaller than the standard value of 0 2 it would be interesting to see if a similar extended analysis using the rainfall intensity and duration would support a value for λ of 0 effectively eliminating the parameter for practical analyses and in addition to the local idf function values for β λ and t would still be required whereas the literature offers empirical and theoretical support for the calculation of t the results neither offer theoretical support regarding the value of the initial abstraction nor do they provide an approach for the time lag l which may also be affected by land use change based on the instantaneous unit hydrograph the initial abstraction ia arises from the assumption of a period ta between the start of the rainfall event and the start of direct runoff in which there is no direct runoff a question not addressed here is how available equations for the time of concentration and consequently t notably those based on the kinematic wave equation including infiltration rate rainfall intensity and moisture content would affect runoff and whether this also sheds light on the initial abstraction and the introduction of an additional lag the parameter β in catchments showing complacent behaviour at this point this has to remain a speculative consequence of this analysis if the proposed theory is supported by further analysis an application oriented question is whether tabulated values for the storage index s can be converted to the catchment response time t given the suggested dependence of s on rainfall intensity duration and recurrence interval minimally the rainfall dataset used to estimate s would be required for any reanalysis if this dataset is not or no longer available estimating t becomes speculative and the procedure difficult to generalize as there seem to be several dataset selection criteria on the basis of which s is determined this is discussed by asce 2009 p 45 ff who distinguish datasets based on annual peak flows and extended datasets based on multiple yearly events as an example tedela et al 2012 uses both annual flood maxima and partial rainfall series to determine curve numbers from a different perspective this topic was analyzed by stewart et al 2012 who compared storage index values s estimated using different rainfall datasets and different methods to handbook values differences could not or no longer be explained the shift from daily total rainfall measured once every day to using a tipping bucket may have been a watershed moment 4 conclusion given the objective it was shown that starting from an instantaneous unit hydrograph and assuming a constant intensity during the event allows to derive the curve number equation the storage index s in the curve number equation is then shown to be a combination of rainfall intensity p and the catchment response time 1 k a cursory review does not contradict the possibility that factors quantifying the catchment response time a o slope soil type a catchment length scale and a manning roughness coefficient for sheet flow similarly affect values of s the instantaneous unit hydrograph allows to derive a hydrograph which can be directly fitted to the direct component of a runoff event introducing an additional lag in the instantaneous unit hydrograph reduces direct runoff reduces direct runoff as a function of event rainfall furthermore the use of a generalized curve number equation rewritten in terms of intensity and duration allows to describe catchment behaviour characterized as complacent standard and violent for which the standard curve number equation shows systematic bias to check the effect of varying intensity within an event alternative equations are derived and analyzed assuming a linear decrease or increase in the intensity during the event the effect of this modification on the cn value is not large 2 units difference between the cn values at a cn of 70 however a linear increase or decrease of intensity within an rainfall event could be too mild for specific climates in which case more complex additional analyses could be required funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or

including a lag in the iuh is equivalent to multiplying the original cumulative direct runoff by a fraction which depends on the catchment response time 1 k and the additional lag l assuming an extra lag in the reciprocal cubic instantaneous unit hydrograph cf eq 16 would also reduce the conversion of rainfall to runoff this can be achieved by increasing the time coordinate so a8 h t 2 k k t l 1 3

8534,the ncrs curve number equation allows calculating the storm runoff from a rainfall event for specific types of land use it was based on an analysis of direct runoff data using baseflow corrected hydrographs and rainfall given this basis the curve number equation can be derived assuming a constant effective rainfall intensity and a cubic reciprocal function as the instantaneous unit hydrograph the instantaneous unit hydrograph and the resulting curve number equation are further generalized by adding a lag time the equation for a curve number related hydrograph is presented allowing to fit this curve number based hydrograph to event data the curve number itself is shown be a function of a catchment response time and the average event rainfall intensity as the catchment response time is linked to the time of concentration the curve number equation and the storage index can be linked to catchment and flow type characteristics first results suggest that including the rainfall intensity

management measures in catchments or other units of water management is generally based on national engineering practices procedures and standards one such engineering handbook for design in watershed management is the hydrology part of the neh developed for use in and based on data from the united states for peak discharge analysis the neh suggests using or offers guidance on a number of steps one of which is converting rainfall to direct runoff using the curve number equation usda nrcs 2004b in a next step the direct runoff now regarded as effective or excess rainfall is converted to a hydrograph for a specific catchment using a unit hydrograph usda nrcs 2007 the unit hydrograph is the catchment response function and converts a unit excess rainfall over a finite period of time to the resulting partial catchment hydrograph an extension of the catchment response function is the instantaneous unit hydrograph it converts a unit excess rainfall which has fallen over an infinitely small period of time to the resulting partial catchment hydrograph summing the individual partial hydrographs over a rainfall event in a number of finite steps using the unit hydrograph yields the catchment hydrograph for that event for the instantaneous unit hydrograph this process of generating and summing an infinite number of partial hydrographs is the so called convolution integral given effective rainfall over time both instantaneous unit hydrographs and unit hydrographs can be applied to generate a catchment hydrograph for a detailed description of the above c f e g brutsaert 2013

ia the initial abstraction mm the basic assumption leading to this equation is presented in usda nrcs 2004b but is also provided by a o mishra and singh 2003 and ritzema 2006 the standard version of the curve number equation reduces the number of parameters to one by setting ia to 0 2s 3 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s i f p 0 2 s e l s e q 0 and the storage index is calculated using an auxiliary function 4 s 254 100 cn 1 where cn 0 100 is the so called curve number which is defined by land use and hydrological soil type the justification of setting ia to 0 2s for practical applications has been extensively analysed asce 2009 and works quoted therein more generally the initial abstraction ia is assumed proportional to s i a λ s currently a value of λ 0 05 is suggested asce 2009 the storage index s is determined from measured data of event rainfall p and associated direct runoff q estimated from discharge measurements the direct runoff rate q consists of combinations of three components direct precipitation on the channel surface flow or overland flow and subsurface flow e g dingman 2008 in overland flow a distinction is made between overland flow due to infiltration excess and overland flow due to saturation excess direct runoff is assumed to dominate the hydrograph up to the point where the hydrograph recession starts and base flow becomes dominant whereas in the development of the curve number equation the method used to determine direct runoff was never published asce 2009 page 46 suggests as an aside that data from the report by dalrymple 1965 presenting rainfall and direct runoff could have been used dalrymple 1965 defines baseflow by extending the trend of flow prior to the flood to the time of the peak and then drawing a line to a point on the recession limb a number of days after the peak with the number depending on the size of the catchment the discharge exceeding the baseflow rate is the direct runoff rate this method of hydrograph separation was presented in earlier textbooks e g linsley et al 1949 and is also presented by dunne and leopold 1978 and dingman 2008 the curve number equation its history the factors which influence the parameters the theoretical basis and the implementation and use in models has been and is being extensively discussed e g ponce and hawkins 1996 mishra and singh 2003 garen and moore 2005 bartlett

be formulated as a soil moisture accounting procedure e g michel et al 2005 in their analysis the initial abstraction is linked to the initial storage conditions at the start of the model calculations in this context direct runoff is regarded as the difference between rainfall and infiltration this has been and is a topic of research a o chin 2017 baiamonte 2019 kirkby and cerdà 2021 early papers are aron et al 1977 hjelmfelt 1980 in their monograph on the curve number equation mishra and singh 2003 dedicate a chapter to the relation between infiltration and direct runoff hoosyar and wang 2016 show that in the case of infiltration excess and a constant rainfall intensity the resulting equation for the cumulative runoff yields the curve number equation for a specific retention curve and holds approximately for other soil types garen and moore 2005 however stress that direct runoff need not only be infiltration excess overland flow and that the difference between rainfall and direct runoff is not only infiltration another possible component of direct runoff is saturation excess overland flow from a source area varying in size e g dingman 2008 which was used by steenhuis et al 1995 to theoretically derive the curve number equation whereas for some catchments it may be justified to focus either on infiltration excess on saturation excess on the kinematic wave equation for overland flow or on soil moisture accounting and infiltration this should not lead to neglecting other mechanisms which may contribute in varying proportions over varying fractions of the catchment area to the catchment scale direct runoff garen and moore 2005 beven 2012 beven 2012 p 206 summarizes research and discussions on the curve number equation by stating that at the small catchment scale and in a simple functional form the curve number equation incorporates some empirical knowledge of fast runoff generation by some combination of different flow mechanisms infiltration excess saturation excess or processes referred to as subsurface stormflow by brutsaert 2013 the question to be addressed is based on the history of the equation sketched above if the curve number equation is or was based on hydrograph data for direct runoff and the instantaneous unit hydrograph is in theory applicable could an instantaneous unit hydrograph not also provide a basis for the curve number equation and if it provides a basis what are consequences is this basis also sufficiently flexible to account for different mechanisms contributing to direct runoff 2 theory effective rainfall intensity and an instantaneous unit hydrograph as described in the introduction the curve number equation allows to calculate cumulative direct runoff as a function of cumulative effective precipitation in a rainfall event cumulative direct runoff is the integral of the difference between the hydrograph and the estimated baseflow the hydrograph i e the direct runoff rate as a function of time is the convolution integral of the effective intensity of the rainfall event and the instantaneous unit hydrograph the instantaneous unit hydrograph describes the transformation of a unit of rainfall to discharge for the limit case of a time interval going to 0 to determine the relation between direct runoff and event precipitation assumptions regarding the effective rainfall intensity and the instantaneous unit hydrograph are then needed 2 1 the effective rainfall intensity to apply the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh its input needs to be defined in terms of effective rainfall rates or effective rainfall intensity effective rainfall intensity is the rainfall intensity corrected for losses for approaches to rainfall losses brutsaert 2013 presents three options a continuous constant loss rate a constant proportional loss rate or an initial loss the combination of these assumptions results in 5a p e t t a p d t 5b p α p p l p p l 0 p p l where pe is the effective event rainfall mm ta is the time effective precipitation starts the event itself starts at t 0 hour t is the duration of the rainfall event hour p is the rainfall intensity mm hour 1 pl is a constant loss over time smaller than p mm hour 1 α is a constant reduction fraction an assumption which would fit the context of the curve number equation is that of a constant intensity with excess rainfall starting after the time required for the initial abstraction i e pe and p differ by a constant offset this would suggest α 1 pl 0 and ta 0 a constant loss rate would require assuming α 1 ta 0 and 0 pl p while a constant reduction fraction corresponds to the case pl 0 ta 0 and 0 α 1 2 2 an instantaneous unit hydrograph to illustrate the basic steps we will start from the instantaneous unit hydrograph for the linear reservoir e g bras 1990 p 443 eq 9 89 also dingman 2008 p 453 eq 9 52 defined as 6 h t k l e k l t h in 1 t the parameter kl 1 t is the inverse of the catchment response time

rainfall intensity the rate of the discharge becomes equal to the direct runoff intensity pe and the system is at steady state the infinite integral with constant unit rainfall intensity is also known as the s hydrograph cf dooge and o kane 2003 p 22 we will assume that direct runoff is generated during the duration of the rainfall event and no other losses occur introducing q the cumulative or

q t p s i a s e p i a s i f p i a e l s e q 0 the rational function and the exponential behave differently so the shape will be different when s is set to s the functions can be scaled setting s to s

number equation based on an instantaneous unit hydrograph the close similarity between these two results begs the question whether an instantaneous unit hydrograph exists which after convolution with a constant intensity and a second integration of the rising limb of the hydrograph from time required for initial abstraction to the event duration yields the reference curve number equation assuming a constant effective rainfall intensity pe equal to the observed rainfall intensity p it can be shown that if the product of this constant rainfall intensity p and the instantaneous unit hydrograph h t is given by 16 p t h t p 2 k k t 1 3 where k is equal to 1 t and t is the catchment response time the result is indeed the curve number equation this is shown in the following steps the discharge function for the rising limb is derived using the convolution integral 17 q t a t 2 k p k t τ 1 3 d τ and results in the discharge function 18 q p p 1 k t t a 2 integrating the discharge over the

ia as otherwise there is no direct runoff the iuh of the linear reservoir and that leading to the curve number equation are compared in fig 2 2 4 the direct runoff component of the hydrograph for a constant intensity event the hydrograph behaviour for the direct runoff component could be assumed to be symmetrical in which case the parameters are identical for both the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph the hydrograph can then be described by 22a q p p 1 k t t a 2 t a t t p f 1 k t t p 2 t t p 22b f p p 1 k t p t a 2 and 22c q 0 t t a expressing this equation in terms of s by either substituting k as p s or by substituting p as ks is possible but in the context of parameter estimation not desirable in parameter estimation replacing tp by ta td where td is the length of the rise avoids convergence issues for comparison purposes the equations for the linear reservoir are the following 23a q p p e k l t t a t a t t p f e k l t t p t t p where 23b f p p e k l t p t a and 23c q 0 t t a the parameter p is the effective intensity so rainfall intensity corrected for losses but given the previous assumptions only an initial loss pe and p are equal the scaled hydrographs for the linear reservoir and the curve number reservoir are presented in fig 3 a equation 22a c also allow estimating parameters directly from base flow corrected hydrographs to provide an example we have used base flow corrected hydrograph data diskin and boneh 1975 to fit the hydrograph assuming the same parameter values for the rising branch and for the recession and using eq 22abc the function was fitted to the data using the excel solver to minimize the sum of squared differences for parameters p ta tp and k fig 3b shows the worst and best fit for illustrative purposes 2 5 introducing an additional lag assuming an extra lag in the instantaneous unit hydrograph would reduce the conversion of rainfall to direct runoff in that case the above steps can be repeated starting from the convolution integral of 25 p t h t p 2 k k t l 1 3 where l is an extra lag units of time compared to the original iuh the steps resulting in the lagged curve number equation are presented in annex a for both the linear reservoir and the above iuh the curve number equation can then be shown to be a specific case of the equation defined by 26 q β β p i a 2 s β p i a i f p i a e l s e q 0 where the extra lag is expressed as a parameter β 0 β 1 the parameter β strongly reduces the direct runoff the equation reverts to the reference curve number equation for β 1 2 6 the relation between storage index s the catchment response time 1 k and the time of concentration the instantaneous unit hydrograph at the basis of the curve number equation for a constant rainfall intensity and β 1 is given by 27 h t 2 k k t 1 3 and contains one parameter a characteristic time the catchment response time t 1 k to determine the storage index s requires determining t and multiplying by intensity p the question is whether we can derive a relation between catchment time scales and the catchment response time t and whether the product pt s is constant a central parameter in rainfall runoff analysis is the time of concentration tc defined as the time base of the instantaneous hydrograph bras 1990 p 432 which corresponds to the time at which the entire area considered contributes to the flow at the point of interest as the curve number iuh equation 27 decreases to zero asymptotically the time base would be infinite assuming for practical purposes that the conversion to discharge is negligible if h t 0 01 k it can be shown that for the curve number equation t c 200 3 1 t 4 84 t for the linear reservoir this assumption leads to the relation t c t ln 100 4 60 t cf dingman 2008 box 9 2 equations

0 58 area between 0 1 and 1412 ha the usda nrcs 2010 focusing on travel times for overland flow suggests calculating the time of concentration as the sum of travel times for sheet flow shallow concentrated flow and open channel flow along the most distant flow path in the cases in which overland flow is the dominant mechanism and given that the cn method characterizes catchment surface properties rather than channel dimensions the relation between sheet flow parameters and the time of concentration seems especially relevant brutsaert 2013 page 479 eq 12 22 presents an equation for

this equation reduces to the equation of sheet flow above quoted by brutsaert 2013 page 479 eq 12 22 and akan and houghalen 2003 p 101 eq 5 5 t is again in seconds finally brutsaert 2013 p 479 eq 12 23 also presents an equation for the time of concentration for subsurface flow on hillslopes with permeable soils this allows to calculate the catchment response time in this situation as 34 t 1 9 t c θ e l 9 k e s i n α where l is the hillslope length m α is the hillslope slope θe is the storage coefficient ke is the effective conductivity m s 1 and t is in seconds the six equations for t selected here can be multiplied by the intensity p and allow to estimate s the limitation of the current review however is that the dominant flow mechanism is either not specified the equation is empirical is based on partial infiltration excess or on flow in permeable soils the equations so far suggest that s is a function of slope cf also muhammad et al 2020 and a catchment length scale often the main channel length and that based on the approaches presented the product s pt is not a constant the decrease of t with slope leading to a decrease in s and a corresponding increase of cn values with slope is supported though by limited data by sprenger 1978 quoted as table 4 3 in ritzema 2006 more recent by ajmal et al 2020 the dependence of cn on slope using the table in ritzema 2006 is presented in fig 4 a variability due to land use type and soil type is large asce 2009 also quotes results that suggest a decrease of cn with slope when focusing on sheet flow a manning roughness coefficient is required qualitatively matching the values for the manning roughness coefficient for sheet flow with cn values usda nrcs 2010 results in fig 4b which offers some support that s values increase and cn values decrease with manning roughness if rainfall is infiltrating soil physical properties become important as the saturated conductivity increases the catchment response time becomes longer and s increases cn decreases the cn values associated with hydrological soils classes a d qualitatively match this response asce 2009 as shown in fig 4c as to the relation between storage and a length scale water harvesting literature for microcatchments e g sharma 1986 252 to 432 m2 and li et al 2006 5 50 m2 shows that runoff efficiency mm runoff mm rain or the runoff coefficient decreases with area suggesting storage index s increases with area kirkby and cerda 2021 show that threshold storage above which runoff occurs increases as a power function of plot length plot lengths up to 16 m for larger areas up to 800 ha the study by simanton et al 1996 showed a linear decrease in cn with area increase of s attributed to the decrease of area averaged rainfall with area and losses in ephemeral channels there is currently no tabulated effect of scale on cn or s this cursory overview suggests that the equations for tc and consequently t do not contradict trends in the tabulated cn values but that effect of a specific variable e g slope may be small compared to the effects of other variables hydrology class and land use type 2 7 the relation between storage index s the average event intensity p and the total event rainfall p the effect of rainfall intensity p requires a separate analysis the curve number equation with an additional lag β eq 26 can also be written as re substituting s p k using ia λs and setting p pt 35 q β 2 p t λ p k 2 pt 1 β λ p k i f t λ k e l s e q 0 with the catchment response time expressed as 1 k the equation can also be expressed in terms of t 1 k as 36 q β 2 p t λ t 2 t 1 β λ t i f t λ t e l s e q 0 in this form the equation shows that cumulative direct runoff is a linear function of intensity for rainfall events of equal duration t in the case β t and λ are constants rainfall intensity p is however not only a function of duration t but also of the average recurrence interval tr and is described by an intensity duration frequency function idf p t tr a first analysis of the effect of including intensity in the curve number equation can be based on an empirical idf equation modified from dingman 2008 eq 4 28b 37 p p s r t t s b 1 where b and ts are empirical coefficients the parameter ps r is the extrapolated intensity at duration t 0 for a specific recurrence interval tr it is practical to write the curve number equation in terms of total event rainfall p which can be done by calculating p t tr calculating q p t calculating p as pt and then plotting q as a function of p alternatively for large relative durations the intensity can be approximated as 38 p p s r t t s b in this case the intensity can also be written as a function of the event rainfall 39 p p s r p p s r b 1 b substitution equation 39 in equation 36 results in a curve number equation which includes the dependency of event rainfall on intensity and duration and not yet explicitly formulated the average recurrence interval 40 q β 2 p λ p s r k p p

p λ s s r p p s r b 1 b 2 p 1 β λ s s r p p s r b 1 b i f p λ s s r p p s r b 1 b e l s e q 0 this equation will be used to analyze the effects of the different parameters on the shape of the curve number equation the results so far depend on the assumption of an intensity which is constant during an event and an initial loss the initial abstraction in addition a third parameter β allowing for an additional lag time in the catchment was introduced two additional parameters b and ps r were necessary to include the effect of the relation between intensity duration and event rainfall the re interpretation of the curve number equation and the added parameter will affect the shape of the function q p to analyze deviations from the standard curve number equation asce 2009 calculate cn values for each data pair and plot these as a function of rainfall p the central equation in this approach is the following 43 s 5 p 2 q 4 q 2 5 p q where s is calculated for all data pairs p q cn is calculated using 44 cn 100 1 s 254 this equation is found solving the standard curve number for s and selecting the negative root if the data pairs exactly match the standard curve number equation the result will be described by the equation 45 cn 100 1 5 p 254 q 0 c n q 0 this procedure defines a check for possible bias in terms of the parameter of interest cn whereas in residual analysis one would expect residuals with zero mean and no discernable trend when plotted as a function of the independent variable in this analysis once runoff occurs q 0 one would expect the calculated cn values to be distributed with a constant mean the fitted cn with randomly distributed errors with zero mean again when plotted against the independent variable p to give an example we have plotted the result for a cn value of 70 for the standard curve number and that for a modified standard with a λ of 0 05 and for a λ of 0 35 as a function of rainfall p the results cf fig 5 show a systematic change in calculated cn values which in this case is explained by a value of λ other than 0 2 when analysing measured data using a cn p plot the result could then suggest changing the value of λ to remove bias the question is whether these cn p bias plots are sufficiently different for the different parameters i e p β ps r b and λ to pinpoint a likely cause 2 8 analysis of the additional parameters in terms of bias in the cn p plot the above describes a method to analyze differences between the standard curve number equation and measured data or the results from a modified version of the equation such as equation 42 the effect of the 4 parameters β λ b and ps r is illustrated by the rainfall runoff plot q p and the bias plot cn p both for multiple values of the parameter and a given cn value cn 50 which determines ss r whereas the parameters β and λ have a reference value for which the equation reverts to the standard curve number equation β 1 0 β 1 and λ 0 2 0 λ 1 the reference value for b is 0 0 b 1 in which case ps r has no effect the effect of ps r is therefore analyzed for b 0 5 and the effect of b is analyzed for ps r λss r the results are presented in fig 6 a h when the cn p plots are calculated using real data they could provide a first idea which parameter or parameters in the equation cause the mismatch analyzing rainfall runoff data in terms of cn p plots i e the bias of the standard curve number equation with respect to the data asce 2009 distinguishes three different types of responses in catchments over the available rainfall range complacent standard and violent complacent catchments are best described by a linear relation between direct runoff and rainfall standard catchments show cn values decreasing with rainfall in a way that suggests an asymptotic cn value whereas violent catchments show cn values asymptotically increasing with rainfall in a way that suggests a constant value for large rainfall amounts examples of the three types are given by hawkins 1993 and asce 2009 whereas tedela et al 2012 presents examples for standard behaviour in that context the bias due to ps r and b and to some extent λ 0 2 could be classified as violent whereas β 1 and λ 0 2 could be classified as either standard or complacent 2 9 bias analysis including the effect of the average recurrence interval the previous analysis using eq 42 did not include the effect of the average recurrence interval intensity duration frequency information is often published by national services for the united states e g intensity duration frequency data have been or are being published and updated by nws 2022 to illustrate the effect of including the recurrence interval on the calculated runoff the idf tabulated values for coweeta coweeta experimental station nc nws 2022 were retrieved using the standard curve number equation and the full range of the idf direct runoff was calculated for a specific curve number minimizing a sum of squares criterion using the solver add in of microsoft excel equation 36 was fitted to the data to estimate t and λ β was set to 1 the associated cn value was calculated using equation 43 45 for each q p pair the cn values were also calculated using independently sorted rainfall and direct runoff so called frequency matching or rank re ordered data e g tedela et al 2012 or hawkins 1993 examples of the q p and cn p plots are presented in fig 7 a d for eq 36 fitted to cn 50 and to cn 75 λ 0 2 comparing the cn p plots for the rank ordered data show that the behaviour of direct runoff changes the result for cn 75 would be characterized as violent whereas the result for cn 50 would be characterized as standard interestingly the fitted values of λ are 0 for both cases 2 10 effect of a varying intensity within an event a simplifying assumption leading to the above results is that of a constant effective intensity during the rainfall event to check the effect of this assumption we assumed a linearly increasing or decreasing intensity with a total rainfall equal to p after evaluating the convolution integral and integrating the hydrograph over the event duration the bias in the function cn p was analysed the two intensity functions are 46a p 1 2 p t 2 t 46b p 2 2 p t 2 p t 2 t the convolution integrals are 47a q 1 t a t 2 p t 2 τ 2 p s 2 p t τ s 3 d τ 47b q 2 t a t 2 p t 2 p t 2 τ 2 p s 2 p t τ s 3 d τ

to slightly lower curve numbers 68 2 whereas the second case decreasing intensity leads to slightly higher curve numbers 72 2 fig 8 shows the cn p plot and the q p plot for both cases 3 discussion we set out to investigate a possible link between an instantaneous unit hydrograph and the curve number equation this is shown to be possible and convolution of an instantaneous unit hydrograph with a constant intensity and a further integration over the event duration results in an analogue of the curve number equation as the example of the linear reservoir shows the assumption of a constant intensity was tested and showed that the resulting equation is not very sensitive to linear variation of the within event intensity to retain simplicity a one parameter instantaneous unit hydrograph would be preferable but not essential adding an additional parameter a lag time l resulted in a curve number equation which for the same storage index has much lower discharge as shown in an analysis of the behaviour of the equation for different parameter values this additional parameter allows for so called complacent behaviour another possible two parameter iuh model is a series of n linear reservoirs with time constant k with a gamma probability density function as the iuh the nash model bras 1990 p 446 the convolution of the gamma probability function with a constant intensity would yield a cumulative gamma distribution describing the direct runoff rate for the rising limb the definite integral of the cumulative gamma distribution would then become the nash analogue of the curve number equation from the point of presenting concise and simple formulations this is not an attractive perspective starting from the relation between q and p a function with an oblique asymptote could allow to derive the q p and the iuh function first derivative rising limb of the hydrograph second derivative the instantaneous unit hydrograph for a constant intensity which could serve to describe rainfall runoff behaviour a generalization of the curve number equation as the ratio of two rational functions where the numerator is exactly a power 1 larger than the denominator would meet this requirement another function with a linear asymptote is the expolinear equation presented as an alternative for the curve number equation by paz pellat 2009 referring to goudriaan and van laar 2012 an interesting consequence of the presented equations is that both fitting a hydrograph to an event and fitting a curve number equation to a series of events is possible using the same parameters comparisons between the series based parameter values and the event based parameters but also changes from event to event could provide insight in causes of parameter variability such as the variation in vegetation cover seasonal variation in curve numbers was analysed by e g d asaro et al 2018 a strong point of the curve number equation ponce and hawkins 1996 is that it captures the effect of land use changes and interventions in a single parameter the storage index s it was possible to keep the equation in a one to two parameter form assuming the initial abstraction ia to a constant λ times the storage index s the presented theoretical basis suggests to rethink catchment land use changes and interventions in terms of the catchment response time t instead of in terms of the storage index s based on the equations for t reviewed so far s as the product pt is not constant but using t theoretically links different site factors to s the initial abstraction now as λpt is retained other parameters added those of the idf function are catchment independent the idf function used in the presented analysis is empirical but allows to illustrate effect of including rainfall duration the use of tabulated values for the idf reflects another level of available information and shows the effect of adding recurrence time as a variable this analysis could be extended by using continuous idf functions an idf function based on a statistical distribution the gev distribution was proposed by koutsoyiannis 2004 and used by e g overeem et al 2010 it has been parameterized at a global scale by courty et al 2019 using these idf functions would allow a more general analysis than the one presented here in terms of including intensity or event duration in the curve number equation jain et al 2006 conclude that including a power function dependency of ia on rainfall and a power function correction of the rainfall for the event duration improves the performance compared to the standard curve number equation the effect could have been similar to the inclusion of intensity in the theory presented here but further mathematical analysis is needed to show to which extent the outcome of the equations corresponds also an analysis of the equation performance based on available rainfall runoff data has not been executed in this paper two interesting observations can be made on the basis of the detailed idf table retrieved for coweeta including the local idf function in combination with the catchment response time eq 34 gives rise to both standard and violent behaviour in addition for both examples presented here λ is estimated to be 0 an extensive analysis estimating the value of λ quoted in asce 2009 supports a value of λ 0 05 smaller than the standard value of 0 2 it would be interesting to see if a similar extended analysis using the rainfall intensity and duration would support a value for λ of 0 effectively eliminating the parameter for practical analyses and in addition to the local idf function values for β λ and t would still be required whereas the literature offers empirical and theoretical support for the calculation of t the results neither offer theoretical support regarding the value of the initial abstraction nor do they provide an approach for the time lag l which may also be affected by land use change based on the instantaneous unit hydrograph the initial abstraction ia arises from the assumption of a period ta between the start of the rainfall event and the start of direct runoff in which there is no direct runoff a question not addressed here is how available equations for the time of concentration and consequently t notably those based on the kinematic wave equation including infiltration rate rainfall intensity and moisture content would affect runoff and whether this also sheds light on the initial abstraction and the introduction of an additional lag the parameter β in catchments showing complacent behaviour at this point this has to remain a speculative consequence of this analysis if the proposed theory is supported by further analysis an application oriented question is whether tabulated values for the storage index s can be converted to the catchment response time t given the suggested dependence of s on rainfall intensity duration and recurrence interval minimally the rainfall dataset used to estimate s would be required for any reanalysis if this dataset is not or no longer available estimating t becomes speculative and the procedure difficult to generalize as there seem to be several dataset selection criteria on the basis of which s is determined this is discussed by asce 2009 p 45 ff who distinguish datasets based on annual peak flows and extended datasets based on multiple yearly events as an example tedela et al 2012 uses both annual flood maxima and partial rainfall series to determine curve numbers from a different perspective this topic was analyzed by stewart et al 2012 who compared storage index values s estimated using different rainfall datasets and different methods to handbook values differences could not or no longer be explained the shift from daily total rainfall measured once every day to using a tipping bucket may have been a watershed moment 4 conclusion given the objective it was shown that starting from an instantaneous unit hydrograph and assuming a constant intensity during the event allows to derive the curve number equation the storage index s in the curve number equation is then shown to be a combination of rainfall intensity p and the catchment response time 1 k a cursory review does not contradict the possibility that factors quantifying the catchment response time a o slope soil type a catchment length scale and a manning roughness coefficient for sheet flow similarly affect values of s the instantaneous unit hydrograph allows to derive a hydrograph which can be directly fitted to the direct component of a runoff event introducing an additional lag in the instantaneous unit hydrograph reduces direct runoff reduces direct runoff as a function of event rainfall furthermore the use of a generalized curve number equation rewritten in terms of intensity and duration allows to describe catchment behaviour characterized as complacent standard and violent for which the standard curve number equation shows systematic bias to check the effect of varying intensity within an event alternative equations are derived and analyzed assuming a linear decrease or increase in the intensity during the event the effect of this modification on the cn value is not large 2 units difference between the cn values at a cn of 70 however a linear increase or decrease of intensity within an rainfall event could be too mild for specific climates in which case more complex additional analyses could be required funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or

acknowledgement none annex a the combination of a linear channel and a linear reservoir is described by an instantaneous hydrograph modified from the linear reservoir as a1 h t k e k t l where l units of time is the lag due to a linear channel compared to the linear reservoir zero lag the higher the lag the less water is converted to direct runoff to calculate the direct runoff rate the convolution integral with a constant intensity but an initial abstraction time ta is written as a2 q t a t p k e k t τ l d τ this integral results in a3 q p e k l p e k t t a l integrating the direct runoff rate over the duration of the rainfall and the start of the runoff yields the cumulative direct runoff a4 q t a t p e k l p e k t t a l d t which results in a5 q p e k l t p k e k t t a l t a t evaluating this equation a6 q p e k l t p k e k t t a l p e k l t a p k e k l which is the equation for the linear reservoir with an extra exponential term after some rewriting using p pt ia pta and setting p k to s results in a7 q e k l p e k l i a s e k l 1 e p i a s for l 0 this is just the equation derived for the linear reservoir increasing the lag decreases the total cumulative runoff in conclusion including a lag in the iuh is equivalent to multiplying the original cumulative direct runoff by a fraction which depends on the catchment response time 1 k and the additional lag l assuming an extra lag in the reciprocal cubic instantaneous unit hydrograph cf eq 16 would also reduce the conversion of rainfall to runoff this can be achieved by increasing the time coordinate so a8 h t 2 k k t l 1 3 which can also be written as a9 h t 2 k k t b 3 where b is 1 kl the convolution integral to derive the direct runoff rate is a10 q t a t 2 p k k t τ b 3 d τ which results in the equation for the direct runoff rate a11 q p b 2 p b k t t a 2 the next step is the integration of the discharge over the duration of the event to derive the cumulative event runoff a12 q t a t p b 2 p b k t t a 2 d t which is a13 q p b 2 t p k 1 b k t t a t a t evaluating the integration boundaries results in a14 q p b 2 t p b 2 t a p k 1 b k t t a p bk substituting p pt ia pta and s p k a15 q p b 2 i a b 2 s s bs p i a s b which can be rewritten as a16 q 1 b 2 p i a 2 bs p i a and in a more regular pattern a17 q 1 b p i a b 2 s p i a b introducing β 1 b 1 1 k l yields a18 q β β p i a 2 s β p i a the result differs from that of the linear reservoir in that the effective rainfall p ia is also reduced by the factor β note b should be larger than one in order to have direct runoff smaller than p ia we see b
