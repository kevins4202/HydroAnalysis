9940,stable and sustainable grain production is an important guarantee for national security economic development and social stability water and land are essential resources in irrigated agricultural systems there is intricate relationship in water land and food nexus with large uncertainties involved therein sustainable agricultural development requires effective and coordinated management of the water food land nexus this paper developed a robust optimization model to optimize the allocation of limited resources and maximize irrigation water productivity in water food land nexus system the proposed optimization model fully considers the system uncertainties to assist decision makers in developing more effective water and land resource allocation plans the model is demonstrated to solve a real world nexus management problem in the yangtze river basin the results show that the robust optimization method can solve the uncertainty disturbance and meet the target requirements thus verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the model in water food land nexus system the model could be applied to similar river basins that have limited resources keywords water food land nexus robust optimization resource allocation irrigation water productivity 1 introduction water land and food resources are the basis for human survival social stability and economic development in recent years population increases and continued economic development are significant challenges especially because of the expected 50 increase in the demand for food and the 30 increase in the demand for clean water by 2030 which is predicted to further exacerbate water shortages yang et al 2016 it has been estimated that agricultural production will need to be 60 higher than in 2007 and the associated irrigation water withdrawals would need to commensurately increase alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 the over exploitation of agricultural resources the excessive use of agricultural inputs the over extraction of groundwater brauman et al 2013 hashemy et al 2018 kumar et al 2012 and the internal and external sources of agricultural pollution have become increasingly prominent problems all of which significantly challenge sustainable agricultural development li et al 2017 cultivation land waste intensified resource constraints and restricted water and land resources have become major challenges and the conflicts between adequate supplies of major agricultural products and resource constraints have become increasingly acute kang et al 2017 mosleh et al 2017 faced with global resource shortages it has become necessary to take measures to effectively allocate resources agriculture uses the largest proportion of water of all sectors however as the agricultural water use efficiency is low for example irrigation water use efficiency many countries in the middle east and north africa reveals that the average of applied water efficiency is about 51 varies from 24 7 to 55 7 hassani et al 2019 yaltaghian khiabani et al 2020 lee and jung 2018 the world resources institute pointed out that strengthening the management of land and water resources can effectively expand food production globally agricultural water consumption accounts for 70 of total water consumption and it consumes more than any other sector in sub saharan africa s 300 million hectares of major farmland as long as 25 of land and water management methods are improved food production can be increased by 22 million tons https www wri org cn at the same time the spatial difference of irrigation efficiency makes the development unbalanced for example li et al 2020 observed a trend of high coefficients in the north and low coefficients in the south among the provinces shandong liaoning xinjiang tianjin had the highest coefficients guangdong and qinghai had the lowest coefficients specific efforts are needed to improve agricultural water productivity seckler 1996 jury and vaux 2005 unesco 2009 fao 2012 worldbank 2013 for example brauman et al 2013 examined global water productivity changes and found that crop water productivity was far below optimal levels and rani 2019 analyzed india s haryana state 49 year and fund that water productivity needed improvement irrigation water productivity is a kind of water productivity which only takes into account the consumption of irrigation water however while various efficiency definitions have been suggested for agricultural water use bluemling et al 2007 there are various comprehension of water productivity because of the mobility uncertainty and other natural characteristics of water resources young 2005 and the differing foci of the related academic disciplines such as hydrology hydrogeology civil and irrigation engineering agronomy crop physiology and economics scheierling et al 2016 hsiao et al 2007 jensen 2007 in this paper for clarification water productivity in agriculture and landscape irrigation may be generically defined as the ratio between the actual crop yield achieved and the water use expressed in kg m3 pereira et al 2012 in the same way irrigation water productivity is defined as the ratio between the actual crop yield achieved and the irrigation water use expressed in kg m3 too there are intricate relationships between the water the land and food production and therefore there are also many complex factors that need to be considered when seeking to systematically optimize resource allocation however previous research has tended to take water as the only important input rather than taking an overall system perspective that also includes the land resources used for agricultural production therefore to integrate the multiple system sectors and resource management to optimize resource allocation taking a nexus approach could be more effective the multiple causal relationships between water and food production have been a major international research focus for example mortada et al 2018 developed an agricultural policy optimization framework to optimize water and food security under nutrition and resource constraints and achieve a sustainable water food nexus and ren et al 2018 analyzed the virtual water and virtual land flows associated with food imports and exports between beijing tianjin hebei and the possibility of mitigating water shortages using a land water food nexus therefore the water food nexus method has been shown to be effective for quantitatively studying regional nexus relationships however most previous studies have tended to combine field and watershed level issues have only focused on a single input water or have used a multi factor approach without resolving the watershed issues to solve multiple input and basin level problems it is necessary to systematically and rationally allocate the water and land resources across the whole basin the water food land wfl nexus is a complicated system ren et al 2021 provided an integrated analysis of the effects of china s soybean import on its water use land use change crop production and n application of land water food environment nexus across different regions klümper and theesfeld 2017 based on a farm household survey empirical analysis of 306 farmers addressed the gap that the land water food nexus has limited response to the governance interface between the input resources however the wfl nexus system is a complex and dynamic system which is influenced by many factors such as nature humanity and economy there are many uncertainties in the system zeng et al 2019 for which most studies have adopted fuzzy programming maqsood et al 2005 li et al 2009 2019 chen et al 2020 sun et al 2019 developed a possibilistic flexible chance constrained programming pfcp method to address multiple uncertainties and improve irrigation efficiency however for these methods to be effective it is necessary to know the probability distributions of the parameters the data for which are not always available robust optimization methods bertsimas and sim 2004 compared with stochastic programming and fuzzy programming it does not require the distribution of uncertain parameters and the fuzzy membership function of uncertain parameters moreover the constraint condition of robust optimization is strictly established that is as long as the uncertain parameter belongs to the uncertain set the solution obtained can satisfy the constraint condition morankar et al 2013 used a robust optimization approach to apply uncertain data to an agricultural system and proposed a linear programming model to maximize the total gross margin for the delivery of water over a planning horizon to agricultural areas in an irrigation network these are why they have been widely applied and developed in fields such as natural science engineering technology and economic management to handle uncertainties therefore robust optimization has been found to be a very effective method for solving uncertainties given these previous successes to solve the uncertainties mitigate the resource crisis and improve resource utilization efficiency this paper employed a robust optimization model to optimize the resource allocation in the wfl system there are more specific objectives of the study as follows 1 based on the wfl nexus system the distribution of the water and land resources in the yangtze river basin are optimized 2 the resources allocation and utilization improved 3 the irrigation water productivity in the wfl basin nexus system maximized the main contributions and novelty of this paper are 1 this paper developed a water land food nexus optimization model for irrigated agriculture multiple important resources are input to the nexus system to improve overall basin irrigation water productivity 2 the water food land nexus robust optimization method can be superior to the conventional optimization approaches dealing with uncertainties it can handle decision making problems when knowing the set of uncertain parameters without the probability distribution when the parameters change in a given set it can still ensure that the optimization scheme is feasible so that the model has a certain robustness 2 problem statement water is a natural resource which is becoming scarcer and scarcer worldbank 2016 worldhealthorganization 2013 it has been found that when a country uses more than 20 of its total water resources there is greater likelihood of a water crisis according to china water resources bulletin 2019 in 2019 total water consumption in china was 6 0212 105mcm or 20 73 of total water resources 2 9041 106 mcm therefore china is on the cusp of a water resources crisis the agricultural sector is generally allocated a greater quantity of water for example 48 04 of the total water was allocated to the agricultural sector in 2018 in china industrial domestic and ecological supplementary water consumption accounted for 34 9 15 8 1 3 respectively of the total water consumption owing to extensive use of irrigation china is able to feed 21 of world population with only 6 of world freshwater resource and 9 of arable land kang et al 2016 however because of the low water resource utilization there is a significant waste of these resources specifically the yangtze river basin irrigation coefficient is the range of 0 43 0 61 there is a gap compared to 0 8 0 9 in developed countries luo et al 2019 http www gov cn jrzg 2011 05 05 content 1858377 htm irrigation water productivity increased only from 0 2 to 0 5 kg m3during the period of 1950 1980 while after 1980 it increased rapidly from 0 8 kg m3 in early 1990s to 1 1 kg m3 in late 1990s and reached 1 58 kg m3 in 2013 kang et al 2016 although the irrigation water productivity of the country shows a trend of growth but the efficiency is not good and there are great differences among different regions therefore to achieve sustainable river basin development the water food land nexus needs to be applied to manage the total available resources conventional inexact optimization models tend to take maximized system beneﬁt or minimized system cost as the objective function when assessing optimal resource allocation patterns and it always fails to take into account the risks of uncertainty the cost target often makes the decision maker cannot consider the problem from the whole point of view often only pay attention to the cost or benefit resulting in the waste of resources however in water stressed regions water use eﬃciency is more encouraged than single beneﬁt maximum or cost eﬀective objectives sun et al 2020 therefore when there are limited resources the maximization of the resource utilization efficiency should be the key objective while water land and food could be seen to be independent in reality they are inseparable as the production of food is closely entwined with water resource consumption and land resource use as shown in fig 1 the water and land resources are essential to crop growth with crops being used as part of virtual water trading because of the multiple intricate water resource land and food relationships and the need to balance supply and demand there are many factors to consider when seeking to systematically optimize resource allocation therefore the wfl nexus approach provides a transition to sustainability as it sees the system as a whole and manages the resources as a whole to optimize the efficient allocation of the limited resources as the resources and their relationships are not fixed in the water food land nexus system there are many uncertainties such as the uncertainties arising from the subsystem interactions and the subjective judgments of the experts and shareholders si et al 2019 which are generally unclear which means the parameters and coefficients are highly uncertain in the wfl nexus optimization model and there is fuzziness in the decision making process for example because surface water availability is sensitive to natural and geographic conditions and technological choices it is difficult to obtain certain data which increases the difficulties in solving the model therefore as shown in fig 1 this paper adopts a robust optimization method to deal with the model uncertainties when the uncertain parameters change in a certain set each optimization problem solution is controllable and feasible for any implementation of these parameters given the following assumptions 1 the surface water resource availability in the basin is a random variable in the symmetric interval 2 in the research area only three crops rice corn and wheat are considered 3 during the study period the irrigation levels remain constant and the irrigation quota per unit area was known and was the same in each sub region 4 agricultural irrigation water use is equal to the agricultural sector distribution in the yangtze river basin and 5 total water demand in each sub region is fully satisfied by the

for real systems bertsimas et al 2004 bertsimas and sim 2003 proposed a linear robust formulation that could withstand parameter and data uncertainty without excessively affecting the objective function that could be easily extended to discrete optimization therefore based on bertsimas and sim bertsimas and sim 2004 following model was developed 3 2 objective function maximum irrigation water productivity crop irrigation water productivity is defined here as the grain production per cubic meter of irrigation water which was determined by dividing the total grain production in the watershed by the total available irrigation water the food production is equal to yield per unit area multiplied by planting area 3 1 m a x f i i c c f p i c i 1 i w a i 3 2 f p i c i i c c y i c s i

agriculture equals the total water availability minus the ecological domestic and industry water use the total water availability is divided into surface water availability and groundwater availability with the surface water availability having high uncertainty due to natural factors and human activity therefore based on the uncertain set form in bertsimas and sim bertsimas and sim 2004 the surface water availability in this study is expressed as a polyhedral uncertainty set which is linear structure and easy to control the uncertainty and expressed as 3 4 w a i w e i w i i w l i s w

j n represents the index of uncertain variables in constraint i in this study the uncertainty is the amount of surface water available demand so j 1 to adjust the conservatism of the model γ robustness coefficient is introduced bertsimas and sim in other words it is unlikely that all the uncertainties will encounter the worst case simultaneously for a constraint thus the level of conservatism in the model can be controlled by adjusting γ i bertsimas and thiele 2006 3 food security to guarantee food security the food grain production in each sub area should satisfy the food grain requirements associated with the population which is expressed as 3 7 i i c c s i c y i c f d p o i c 4 for each crop in the different sub areas and for each crop type in all sub areas the lower

8 million km2 or 18 75 of china the yangtze river basin catchment area passes through 19 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions qinghai tibet yunnan sichuan chongqing guizhou gansu hubei hunan jiangxi shanxi henan guangxi guangdong anhui and jiangsu zhejiang fujian and finally enters the east china sea in shanghai the basin has more than 24 6 million hectares of land or 1 4 of the country s total arable land the agricultural production value accounts for 40 of the country s total agricultural output value the grain output also accounts for 40 of country s total and rice production accounts for 70 of the country s total rice production population increases and economic development have led to an increase in the demand for various resources and to meet this demand the cultivated land area in the yangtze river basin has increased from 64 089 million ha in 2007 67 3911 million ha in 2016 and the irrigated area has increased from 29 9432 million ha in 2007 34 2643 million ha in 2016 in 2019 the total water supply was 2 0645 105 mcm the increase in resource demand has expanded resource exploitation and led to resource shortages and environmental degradation however the unreasonable allocation of resources has made it impossible to make full use of the resources with the resulting conflicts between sections and different regions intensifying the main crops in the yangtze river basin catchment area are rice corn soybeans vegetables and melons with grain crops having occupied more than 80 of the total crop area in the past five years therefore rice wheat and corn were chosen as the focus food products in this study as these crops account for over 90 of the total grain output in terms of tonnage with the planting area accounting for 82 of the arable grain land crop selection has been an important farmer strategy used to adapt to climate change resource availability and the socio economic drivers water supply and food production security requires the sustainable equitable allocation of water and land resources under uncertainty and the ability to generate sufficient economic benefits therefore the wfl model was applied to the yangtze river basin to resolve these problems 4 2 data collection and analysis data related to water resources and agriculture are obtained from governmental reports statistical yearbooks related literatures expert surveys and websites in detail the data of water resource as shown in table a1 are collected from the yangtze river water resources bulletin 11 18 and the yangtze river statistical yearbook 11 18 among them the nominal value s w i and disturbance s w ˆ i are the mean value and the nominal difference of the available water in the yangtze river basin in recent 5 years agricultural data table a2 table a3 include land resource data grain yield per unit area irrigation water per unit area 0 06239 108 m3 1000ha and irrigation ratio 60 which are derived from the yangtze river basin statistical yearbook and the yangtze river water resources bulletin the population is collected from the national bureau of statistics http www stats gov cn which is 828772200 per capita food demand 36 0 kg p is collected from research reports called national medium and longterm plan for food security all input data are shown in appendix 1 5 results and discussion this article examined the yangtze river basin as a real case with a consideration of the influence of the uncertainties a single objective robust optimization method was adopted to form the wfl nexus system s optimization mode to maximize the irrigation water productivity ensure a reasonable resource allocation plan for the entire basin and improve overall resource utilization efficiency to adjust the conservatism of the model γ robustness coefficient is introduced in order to fully consider the volatility caused by uncertainty and test the robustness of the model γ values of 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 were respectively used to represent the discussion of different cases of uncertainty the larger the value of γ the greater the degree of uncertainty to be considered when γ 0 the uncertainty is completely ignored and this is the deterministic case when γ 1 the uncertainty is completely considered and the result is too conservative therefore γ is set at 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively to represent the distribution results under the scenarios of low uncertainty ordinary uncertainty high uncertainty and higher uncertainty for discussion and analysis 5 1 irrigation water productivity from the wfl nexus system optimization model a series of related plans were developed to efficiently utilize the limited water and land resources and maximize the grain output per unit of water resource fig 3 shows the irrigation water productivity changes under the different robustness coefficients with 1 664 kg m3 1 658 kg m3 1 652 kg m3 1 645 kg m3 and 1 637 kg m3 corresponding to the respective γ values of 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 in 2013 the average irrigation water productivity is 1 58 kg m3 in china li et al 2020 therefore based on this result the wfl nexus system optimization model significantly improved irrigation water productivity taking γ 0 as the baseline the rate of change in the objective value under the different γ values was 0 30 γ 0 2 0 69 γ 0 4 1 11 γ 0 6 and 1 54 γ 0 8 for this study the resource allocation plan at γ 0 4 could be selected because when γ 0 4 both the system uncertainty is accounted for and the problems associated with over conservative results avoided the irrigation water productivity obtained was significantly higher than the average water productivity of 1 58 kg m3 experienced in 2013 however this is only a reference and whether a decision maker would choose this option would depend on their preferences and the practical situation 5 2 resource allocation results to verify the effectiveness of the robustness coefficient in the resource allocation model in adjusting for the conservativism the optimal allocation results for the corresponding resources under different γ values were analyzed when the value of γ was 0 all uncertain variables were determinate and taken as nominal values and under these determinate conditions because of the total resource limits the quantitative spatial distribution states of the water resources in the sub regions were presented according to the model as shown in fig 4 the water allocations to shanghai jiangsu zhejiang anhui jiangxi henan hubei hunan guangxi chongqing sichuan guangzhou yunnan shaanxi gansu qinghai fujian guangdong and tibet were respectively 2 687 103 mcm 1 1932 104 mcm 2 947 103 mcm 9 325 103 mcm 1 8244 104 mcm 1 330 103 mcm 1 7951 104 mcm 2 2050 104 mcm 1 067 103 mcm 3 247 103 mcm 1 6807 104 mcm 4 208 103 mcm 3 085 103 mcm 2 249 103 mcm 1 25 102 mcm 15mcm 96 mcm 19 mcm and 78 mcm as can be seen the spatial water resource distribution was uneven which was because priority was given to efficiency that is the differentiated water resource allocations were based on the specific natural conditions in each region to maximize the resource utilization in each sub region and realize a virtuous circle for the water resources management for example hunan was allocated the most available water because it has 3 788 million hectares of arable land or about 3 1 of the total arable land in china and qianhai was allocated the least available water as it has a high altitude plateau continental climate that is not suitable for growing rice and its arable land area only accounts for 0 76 of the province s land area therefore compared with the other provinces there is less water consumption in the agriculture sector the above results were obtained under deterministic conditions when uncertain factors were introduced into the model based on the conservatism degree a different value for γ was used to adjust the uncertainty risk the water resource allocation plan was then studied under the following scenarios γ 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 as shown in fig 5 from which it can be seen that changing the robustness coefficient was effective in regulating the resource allocation as the value of γ increased the available water resources in the 19 sub regions had a downward trend for example the water available for agriculture in shanghai dropped by around 25 from 2 687 103mcm γ 0 to 2 016 103mcm γ 0 8 which was the largest decline in the 19 sub regions followed by gansu qinghai jiangsu tibet guizhou guangdong sichuan chongqing henan zhejiang yunnan guangxi anhui jiangxi fujian hubei hunan and shaanxi with shaanxi s share of agricultural water falling from 2 249 103mcm γ 0 to 2 222 103mcm γ 0 8 a fall of only 1 as shown in fig 6 the total agricultural water resource allocation decreased with the increase in γ at γ 0 the total water resource allocated to agricultural irrigation was 1 17461 106mcm but when γ increased the total water resource allocation gradually decreased to 1 15909 106mcm γ 0 2 1 14357 106mcm γ 0 4 1 12804 106mcm γ 0 6 and 1 11252 106mcm γ 0 8 this was because as the value of γ increased the probability of a worst case for the uncertain factors in the constraints increased when we consider the higher the uncertainty risk the more conservative the model will be in the uncertain constraints when high uncertainty is considered the fluctuation range of surface water availability is large in order to meet the hard constraint requirements under the condition that the water consumption of other parts is fixed the water consumption of the agricultural sector is reduced to meet the hard constraint of the upper limit of water resources to maximize irrigation water productivity under limited water resource conditions the total water allocated to the agricultural sector reduces to ensure the validity of the model the uncertainties caused by the available surface water fluctuations were examined in order to verify the effectiveness of the model we take the yangtze river basin as an example for analysis and bring the basin data into the model for calculation to get the optimization results in order to verify the robustness of the model the robustness coefficient is introduced to adjust the degree of conservatism and the corresponding optimal solutions are obtained by considering different uncertainty degrees the value of the robustness coefficient γ fig 7 shows the spatial differences in the water resource allocations in the different regions under medium conservative levels γ 0 4 with the dark to light colors indicating more to less water distribution as can be seen there were obvious differences in the spatial water distribution this paper focus on the allocation of agricultural irrigation water so the allocation of water resources will be affected by the area of cultivated land in the area with large area of cultivated land more water resources will be allocated correspondingly in order to meet the demand of minimum agricultural water consumption conversely areas with less irrigation get correspondingly less water at the same time in addition to the area of cultivated land the planting pattern of crops will also greatly affect the allocation of water resources areas suitable for rice cultivation will increase the allocation of water to meet growing conditions for rice while for maize and wheat it will decrease the allocation of water relative to less water intensive crops therefore due to the geographical conditions and climatic conditions and so on the cultivated area and planting pattern will be different so the distribution of water resources also has obvious spatial differences this is a reasonable outcome from the model following the specific natural conditions in each region the water resources were allocated to maximize the resource utilization in each sub region based on differentiated fairness to realize a virtuous circle for water resource management fig 8 shows the results for the land resource allocation scheme it can be seen that the rice planting areas had a greater advantage than the wheat and corn planting areas in most sub regions it can be seen from fig 9 that the rice planting area accounted for about 55 of the total cultivated land area in the basin with the wheat and corn planting areas accounting for about 25 and 20 as most of the yangtze river basin is located in a subtropical monsoon area the climate is warm and humid with four distinct seasons high annual accumulated temperatures long crop growth periods rain and heat in many areas in the same season and excellent light heat water and soil conditions for agricultural production all of which are suitable for rice growth the yangtze river basin agriculture economy produces 75 of the country s grain and 90 of its cash crops from 40 of the country s arable land therefore the economic benefit of rice is higher than wheat and corn which means that planting rice over a large area is beneficial to increasing grain production efficiency and the basin s economic benefits taking γ 0 4 as an analysis example because of the size of the yangtze river basin as shown in fig 8 there are a small number of areas not suitable for rice cultivation for example shaanxi gansu and tibet have less rice cultivation areas than the other two crops and qinghai has no rice planting areas because of the climatic conditions and geographical locations in these provinces they do not have suitable rice planting conditions therefore the crop planting areas should be optimally allocated based on local conditions as shown in fig 9 when the γ value increased the area under rice decreased from 56 74 γ 0 to 54 33 γ 0 8 and the area under wheat and corn slightly increased this was because compared with wheat and corn rice is a highly water intensive crop therefore as the available water decreases to ensure total food security in the watershed the area under rice reduces and the area under the other two crops correspondingly increases 5 3 discussion the developed wfl nexus system robust optimization model supported the management of water and land for irrigated agriculture with the interrelationships among the main components of water food land nexus being quantified by an optimization model based on optimal results the irrigation water productivity is about 1 637 1 663 kg m3 which was a 3 61 5 25 increase compared to 2013 and proved that the water food land nexus robust optimization model is effective under ideal situations the total water allocated to the agricultural sector was 1 11252 106mcm 1 17461 106 mcm with different γ 0 0 8 which was a slight increase from the previous allocation in 2019 the higher the degree of uncertainty risk is considered the more conservative the results become the results show that with increasing uncertainty the total amount of water allocated decreases and so does the total planting area in the basin in order to ensure food security the corresponding crop planting patterns have also changed to adapt to the decrease of water and land resources water intensive crops such as rice have reduced their acreage while wheat and maize have increased their acreage this study attempted to develop an integrated optimization model to manage the water food land nexus in irrigated agriculture which was capable of addressing complex interrelationships among water food and land components from a holistic perspective and the following goals were achieved 1 based on the identified wfl nexus system the distribution of the water and land resources in the yangtze river basin are optimized 2 the resources allocation and utilization improved 3 the irrigation water productivity in the wfl basin nexus system maximized generally the framework of robust optimization model for wfl nexus was portable and can be applied to most regions when 1 the resources availability e g water and land resources was limited and it was necessary to reallocate the limited resources in a sustainable way to improve the water use efficiency of irrigation and 2 the main limiting factors water availability in this study were highly uncertain the model provided the basic objectives and constraints in addressing the above problems further analysis of results of the model contributed to real applications and policy implications for example the changing trends of resources allocations and objective function values under different robustness coefficient can help decision makers gain insight into when water supply can maximize the effectiveness for this study the resource allocation plan at γ 0 4 could be selected because both the system uncertainty is accounted for and the problems associated with over conservative results is avoided therefore with the continuous growth of population and rapid social development resources are increasingly in short supply efficient use of resources is the key to sustainable development the government should strengthen the effective control of land and water resources so as to achieve systematic resource allocation optimization results show that there are necessary resource trade offs between the land water and food with different crops being planted in different sub areas to improve resource utilization efficiency and maximize irrigation water productivity these results provide policymakers with a greater number of resource allocation plans based on the actual development needs for example decision makers can choose a suitable allocation plan based on their uncertainty level preferences and the data results in this paper 6 conclusion the novelties of this paper are 1 this paper developed a water land food nexus optimization model for irrigated agriculture multiple important resources are input to the nexus system to improve overall basin irrigation water productivity 2 the water food land nexus robust optimization method can be superior to the conventional optimization approaches dealing with uncertainties it can handle decision making problems when knowing the set of uncertain parameters without the probability distribution when the parameters change in a given set it can still ensure that the optimization scheme is feasible so that the model has a certain robustness the aim of the model is to optimally allocate limited water and land resources to different crops to obtain optimal irrigation water productivity the framework for the model is uncertain decision model with robust optimization and dual change theory was used to solve the model the model is capable of 1 simultaneously addressing interactions among water food and land subsystems in an irrigated agricultural system 2 improve the efficiency of limited resources and provide resource allocation plans for decision makers the model was applied to the yangtze river basin with the objective function being to maximize irrigation water productivity and with limited resources being the main constraint the complicated relationships between the water food and land resources in the yangtze river basin were quantified to develop reasonable resource allocation plans under uncertainty to prove the feasibility of the method and provide valuable data support for decision makers therefore this resource allocation method could be applied to other river basins to mitigate water scarcity food crises and other issues that can hinder agriculture development however this study focused on the management of water land and food in an irrigated agricultural system therefore the environment factors based on the irrigation energy consumption was negligible further studies are desired to extend the developed model to a grander scale considering more complex correlations between water food and land and considering more forms of uncertainties to enhance its practicability and applicability declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9940,stable and sustainable grain production is an important guarantee for national security economic development and social stability water and land are essential resources in irrigated agricultural systems there is intricate relationship in water land and food nexus with large uncertainties involved therein sustainable agricultural development requires effective and coordinated management of the water food land nexus this paper developed a robust optimization model to optimize the allocation of limited resources and maximize irrigation water productivity in water food land nexus system the proposed optimization model fully considers the system uncertainties to assist decision makers in developing more effective water and land resource allocation plans the model is demonstrated to solve a real world nexus management problem in the yangtze river basin the results show that the robust optimization method can solve the uncertainty disturbance and meet the target requirements thus verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the model in water food land nexus system the model could be applied to similar river basins that have limited resources keywords water food land nexus robust optimization resource allocation irrigation water productivity 1 introduction water land and food resources are the basis for human survival social stability and economic development in recent years population increases and continued economic development are significant challenges especially because of the expected 50 increase in the demand for food and the 30 increase in the demand for clean water by 2030 which is predicted to further exacerbate water shortages yang et al 2016 it has been estimated that agricultural production will need to be 60 higher than in 2007 and the associated irrigation water withdrawals would need to commensurately increase alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 the over exploitation of agricultural resources the excessive use of agricultural inputs the over extraction of groundwater brauman et al 2013 hashemy et al 2018 kumar et al 2012 and the internal and external sources of agricultural pollution have become increasingly prominent problems all of which significantly challenge sustainable agricultural development li et al 2017 cultivation land waste intensified resource constraints and restricted water and land resources have become major challenges and the conflicts between adequate supplies of major agricultural products and resource constraints have become increasingly acute kang et al 2017 mosleh et al 2017 faced with global resource shortages it has become necessary to take measures to effectively allocate resources agriculture uses the largest proportion of water of all sectors however as the agricultural water use efficiency is low for example irrigation water use efficiency many countries in the middle east and north africa reveals that the average of applied water efficiency is about 51 varies from 24 7 to 55 7 hassani et al 2019 yaltaghian khiabani et al 2020 lee and jung 2018 the world resources institute pointed out that strengthening the management of land and water resources can effectively expand food production globally agricultural water consumption accounts for 70 of total water consumption and it consumes more than any other sector in sub saharan africa s 300 million hectares of major farmland as long as 25 of land and water management methods are improved food production can be increased by 22 million tons https www wri org cn at the same time the spatial difference of irrigation efficiency makes the development unbalanced for example li et al 2020 observed a trend of high coefficients in the north and low coefficients in the south among the provinces shandong liaoning xinjiang tianjin had the highest coefficients guangdong and qinghai had the lowest coefficients specific efforts are needed to improve agricultural water productivity seckler 1996 jury and vaux 2005 unesco 2009 fao 2012 worldbank 2013 for example brauman et al 2013 examined global water productivity changes and found that crop water productivity was far below optimal levels and rani 2019 analyzed india s haryana state 49 year and fund that water productivity needed improvement irrigation water productivity is a kind of water productivity which only takes into account the consumption of irrigation water however while various efficiency definitions have been suggested for agricultural water use bluemling et al 2007 there are various comprehension of water productivity because of the mobility uncertainty and other natural characteristics of water resources young 2005 and the differing foci of the related academic disciplines such as hydrology hydrogeology civil and irrigation engineering agronomy crop physiology and economics scheierling et al 2016 hsiao et al 2007 jensen 2007 in this paper for clarification water productivity in agriculture and landscape irrigation may be generically defined as the ratio between the actual crop yield achieved and the water use expressed in kg m3 pereira et al 2012 in the same way irrigation water productivity is defined as the ratio between the actual crop yield achieved and the irrigation water use expressed in kg m3 too there are intricate relationships between the water the land and food production and therefore there are also many complex factors that need to be considered when seeking to systematically optimize resource allocation however previous research has tended to take water as the only important input rather than taking an overall system perspective that also includes the land resources used for agricultural production therefore to integrate the multiple system sectors and resource management to optimize resource allocation taking a nexus approach could be more effective the multiple causal relationships between water and food production have been a major international research focus for example mortada et al 2018 developed an agricultural policy optimization framework to optimize water and food security under nutrition and resource constraints and achieve a sustainable water food nexus and ren et al 2018 analyzed the virtual water and virtual land flows associated with food imports and exports between beijing tianjin hebei and the possibility of mitigating water shortages using a land water food nexus therefore the water food nexus method has been shown to be effective for quantitatively studying regional nexus relationships however most previous studies have tended to combine field and watershed level issues have only focused on a single input water or have used a multi factor approach without resolving the watershed issues to solve multiple input and basin level problems it is necessary to systematically and rationally allocate the water and land resources across the whole basin the water food land wfl nexus is a complicated system ren et al 2021 provided an integrated analysis of the effects of china s soybean import on its water use land use change crop production and n application of land water food environment nexus across different regions klümper and theesfeld 2017 based on a farm household survey empirical analysis of 306 farmers addressed the gap that the land water food nexus has limited response to the governance interface between the input resources however the wfl nexus system is a complex and dynamic system which is influenced by many factors such as nature humanity and economy there are many uncertainties in the system zeng et al 2019 for which most studies have adopted fuzzy programming maqsood et al 2005 li et al 2009 2019 chen et al 2020 sun et al 2019 developed a possibilistic flexible chance constrained programming pfcp method to address multiple uncertainties and improve irrigation efficiency however for these methods to be effective it is necessary to know the probability distributions of the parameters the data for which are not always available robust optimization methods bertsimas and sim 2004 compared with stochastic programming and fuzzy programming it does not require the distribution of uncertain parameters and the fuzzy membership function of uncertain parameters moreover the constraint condition of robust optimization is strictly established that is as long as the uncertain parameter belongs to the uncertain set the solution obtained can satisfy the constraint condition morankar et al 2013 used a robust optimization approach to apply uncertain data to an agricultural system and proposed a linear programming model to maximize the total gross margin for the delivery of water over a planning horizon to agricultural areas in an irrigation network these are why they have been widely applied and developed in fields such as natural science engineering technology and economic management to handle uncertainties therefore robust optimization has been found to be a very effective method for solving uncertainties given these previous successes to solve the uncertainties mitigate the resource crisis and improve resource utilization efficiency this paper employed a robust optimization model to optimize the resource allocation in the wfl system there are more specific objectives of the study as follows 1 based on the wfl nexus system the distribution of the water and land resources in the yangtze river basin are optimized 2 the resources allocation and utilization improved 3 the irrigation water productivity in the wfl basin nexus system maximized the main contributions and novelty of this paper are 1 this paper developed a water land food nexus optimization model for irrigated agriculture multiple important resources are input to the nexus system to improve overall basin irrigation water productivity 2 the water food land nexus robust optimization method can be superior to the conventional optimization approaches dealing with uncertainties it can handle decision making problems when knowing the set of uncertain parameters without the probability distribution when the parameters change in a given set it can still ensure that the optimization scheme is feasible so that the model has a certain robustness 2 problem statement water is a natural resource which is becoming scarcer and scarcer worldbank 2016 worldhealthorganization 2013 it has been found that when a country uses more than 20 of its total water resources there is greater likelihood of a water crisis according to china water resources bulletin 2019 in 2019 total water consumption in china was 6 0212 105mcm or 20 73 of total water resources 2 9041 106 mcm therefore china is on the cusp of a water resources crisis the agricultural sector is generally allocated a greater quantity of water for example 48 04 of the total water was allocated to the agricultural sector in 2018 in china industrial domestic and ecological supplementary water consumption accounted for 34 9 15 8 1 3 respectively of the total water consumption owing to extensive use of irrigation china is able to feed 21 of world population with only 6 of world freshwater resource and 9 of arable land kang et al 2016 however because of the low water resource utilization there is a significant waste of these resources specifically the yangtze river basin irrigation coefficient is the range of 0 43 0 61 there is a gap compared to 0 8 0 9 in developed countries luo et al 2019 http www gov cn jrzg 2011 05 05 content 1858377 htm irrigation water productivity increased only from 0 2 to 0 5 kg m3during the period of 1950 1980 while after 1980 it increased rapidly from 0 8 kg m3 in early 1990s to 1 1 kg m3 in late 1990s and reached 1 58 kg m3 in 2013 kang et al 2016 although the irrigation water productivity of the country shows a trend of growth but the efficiency is not good and there are great differences among different regions therefore to achieve sustainable river basin development the water food land nexus needs to be applied to manage the total available resources conventional inexact optimization models tend to take maximized system beneﬁt or minimized system cost as the objective function when assessing optimal resource allocation patterns and it always fails to take into account the risks of uncertainty the cost target often makes the decision maker cannot consider the problem from the whole point of view often only pay attention to the cost or benefit resulting in the waste of resources however in water stressed regions water use eﬃciency is more encouraged than single beneﬁt maximum or cost eﬀective objectives sun et al 2020 therefore when there are limited resources the maximization of the resource utilization efficiency should be the key objective while water land and food could be seen to be independent in reality they are inseparable as the production of food is closely entwined with water resource consumption and land resource use as shown in fig 1 the water and land resources are essential to crop growth with crops being used as part of virtual water trading because of the multiple intricate water resource land and food relationships and the need to balance supply and demand there are many factors to consider when seeking to systematically optimize resource allocation therefore the wfl nexus approach provides a transition to sustainability as it sees the system as a whole and manages the resources as a whole to optimize the efficient allocation of the limited resources as the resources and their relationships are not fixed in the water food land nexus system there are many uncertainties such as the uncertainties arising from the subsystem interactions and the subjective judgments of the experts and shareholders si et al 2019 which are generally unclear which means the parameters and coefficients are highly uncertain in the wfl nexus optimization model and there is fuzziness in the decision making process for example because surface water availability is sensitive to natural and geographic conditions and technological choices it is difficult to obtain certain data which increases the difficulties in solving the model therefore as shown in fig 1 this paper adopts a robust optimization method to deal with the model uncertainties when the uncertain parameters change in a certain set each optimization problem solution is controllable and feasible for any implementation of these parameters given the following assumptions 1 the surface water resource availability in the basin is a random variable in the symmetric interval 2 in the research area only three crops rice corn and wheat are considered 3 during the study period the irrigation levels remain constant and the irrigation quota per unit area was known and was the same in each sub region 4 agricultural irrigation water use is equal to the agricultural sector distribution in the yangtze river basin and 5 total water demand in each sub region is fully satisfied by the

form of optimization which was consequently expanded by ben tal and nemirovski 1998 1999 ben tal et al 2006 introduced a higher degree of nonlinearity conic quadratic problem into the nominal problem for real systems bertsimas et al 2004 bertsimas and sim 2003 proposed a linear robust formulation that could withstand parameter and data uncertainty without excessively affecting the objective function that could be easily extended to discrete optimization therefore based on bertsimas and sim bertsimas and sim 2004 following model was developed 3 2 objective function maximum irrigation water productivity crop irrigation water productivity is defined here as the grain production per cubic meter of irrigation water which was determined by dividing the total grain production in the watershed by the total available irrigation water the food production is equal to yield per unit area multiplied by planting area 3 1 m a x f i i c c f p i c i 1 i w a i 3 2 f p i c i i c c y i c s i

agriculture equals the total water availability minus the ecological domestic and industry water use the total water availability is divided into surface water availability and groundwater availability with the surface water availability having high uncertainty due to natural factors and human activity therefore based on the uncertain set form in bertsimas and sim bertsimas and sim 2004 the surface water availability in this study is expressed as a polyhedral uncertainty set which is linear structure and easy to control the uncertainty and expressed as 3 4 w a i w e i w i i w l i s w

j n represents the index of uncertain variables in constraint i in this study the uncertainty is the amount of surface water available demand so j 1 to adjust the conservatism of the model γ robustness coefficient is introduced bertsimas and sim in other words it is unlikely that all the uncertainties will encounter the worst case simultaneously for a constraint thus the level of conservatism in the model can be controlled by adjusting γ i bertsimas and thiele 2006 3 food security to guarantee food security the food grain production in each sub area should satisfy the food grain requirements associated with the population which is expressed as 3 7 i i c c s i c y i c f d p o i c 4 for each crop in the different sub areas and for each crop type in all sub areas the lower and upper irrigation area limits should be considered to consider the food requirements and the prevailing crop production practices this constraint can be expressed as 3 8 s i c min s i c s i c max i

8 million km2 or 18 75 of china the yangtze river basin catchment area passes through 19 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions qinghai tibet yunnan sichuan chongqing guizhou gansu hubei hunan jiangxi shanxi henan guangxi guangdong anhui and jiangsu zhejiang fujian and finally enters the east china sea in shanghai the basin has more than 24 6 million hectares of land or 1 4 of the country s total arable land the agricultural production value accounts for 40 of the country s total agricultural output value the grain output also accounts for 40 of country s total and rice production accounts for 70 of the country s total rice production population increases and economic development have led to an increase in the demand for various resources and to meet this demand the cultivated land area in the yangtze river basin has increased from 64 089 million ha in 2007 67 3911 million ha in 2016 and the irrigated area has increased from 29 9432 million ha in 2007 34 2643 million ha in 2016 in 2019 the total water supply was 2 0645 105 mcm the increase in resource demand has expanded resource exploitation and led to resource shortages and environmental degradation however the unreasonable allocation of resources has made it impossible to make full use of the resources with the resulting conflicts between sections and different regions intensifying the main crops in the yangtze river basin catchment area are rice corn soybeans vegetables and melons with grain crops having occupied more than 80 of the total crop area in the past five years therefore rice wheat and corn were chosen as the focus food products in this study as these crops account for over 90 of the total grain output in terms of tonnage with the planting area accounting for 82 of the arable grain land crop selection has been an important farmer strategy used to adapt to climate change resource availability and the socio economic drivers water supply and food production security requires the sustainable equitable allocation of water and land resources under uncertainty and the ability to generate sufficient economic benefits therefore the wfl model was applied to the yangtze river basin to resolve these problems 4 2 data collection and analysis data related to water resources and agriculture are obtained from governmental reports statistical yearbooks related literatures expert surveys and websites in detail the data of water resource as shown in table a1 are collected from the yangtze river water resources bulletin 11 18 and the yangtze river statistical yearbook 11 18 among them the nominal value s w i and disturbance s w ˆ i are the mean value and the nominal difference of the available water in the yangtze river basin in recent 5 years agricultural data table a2 table a3 include land resource data grain yield per unit area irrigation water per unit area 0 06239 108 m3 1000ha and irrigation ratio 60 which are derived from the yangtze river basin statistical yearbook and the yangtze river water resources bulletin the population is collected from the national bureau of statistics http www stats gov cn which is 828772200 per capita food demand 36 0 kg p is collected from research reports called national medium and longterm plan for food security all input data are shown in appendix 1 5 results and discussion this article examined the yangtze river basin as a real case with a consideration of the influence of the uncertainties a single objective robust optimization method was adopted to form the wfl nexus system s optimization mode to maximize the irrigation water productivity ensure a reasonable resource allocation plan for the entire basin and improve overall resource utilization efficiency to adjust the conservatism of the model γ robustness coefficient is introduced in order to fully consider the volatility caused by uncertainty and test the robustness of the model γ values of 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 were respectively used to represent the discussion of different cases of uncertainty the larger the value of γ the greater the degree of uncertainty to be considered when γ 0 the uncertainty is completely ignored and this is the deterministic case when γ 1 the uncertainty is completely considered and the result is too conservative therefore γ is set at 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively to represent the distribution results under the scenarios of low uncertainty ordinary uncertainty high uncertainty and higher uncertainty for discussion and analysis 5 1 irrigation water productivity from the wfl nexus system optimization model a series of related plans were developed to efficiently utilize the limited water and land resources and maximize the grain output per unit of water resource fig 3 shows the irrigation water productivity changes under the different robustness coefficients with 1 664 kg m3 1 658 kg m3 1 652 kg m3 1 645 kg m3 and 1 637 kg m3 corresponding to the respective γ values of 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 in 2013 the average irrigation water productivity is 1 58 kg m3 in china li et al 2020 therefore based on this result the wfl nexus system optimization model significantly improved irrigation water productivity taking γ 0 as the baseline the rate of change in the objective value under the different γ values was 0 30 γ 0 2 0 69 γ 0 4 1 11 γ 0 6 and 1 54 γ 0 8 for this study the resource allocation plan at γ 0 4 could be selected because when γ 0 4 both the system uncertainty is accounted for and the problems associated with over conservative results avoided the irrigation water productivity obtained was significantly higher than the average water productivity of 1 58 kg m3 experienced in 2013 however this is only a reference and whether a decision maker would choose this option would depend on their preferences and the practical situation 5 2 resource allocation results to verify the effectiveness of the robustness coefficient in the resource allocation model in adjusting for the conservativism the optimal allocation results for the corresponding resources under different γ values were analyzed when the value of γ was 0 all uncertain variables were determinate and taken as nominal values and under these determinate conditions because of the total resource limits the quantitative spatial distribution states of the water resources in the sub regions were presented according to the model as shown in fig 4 the water allocations to shanghai jiangsu zhejiang anhui jiangxi henan hubei hunan guangxi chongqing sichuan guangzhou yunnan shaanxi gansu qinghai fujian guangdong and tibet were respectively 2 687 103 mcm 1 1932 104 mcm 2 947 103 mcm 9 325 103 mcm 1 8244 104 mcm 1 330 103 mcm 1 7951 104 mcm 2 2050 104 mcm 1 067 103 mcm 3 247 103 mcm 1 6807 104 mcm 4 208 103 mcm 3 085 103 mcm 2 249 103 mcm 1 25 102 mcm 15mcm 96 mcm 19 mcm and 78 mcm as can be seen the spatial water resource distribution was uneven which was because priority was given to efficiency that is the differentiated water resource allocations were based on the specific natural conditions in each region to maximize the resource utilization in each sub region and realize a virtuous circle for the water resources management for example hunan was allocated the most available water because it has 3 788 million hectares of arable land or about 3 1 of the total arable land in china and qianhai was allocated the least available water as it has a high altitude plateau continental climate that is not suitable for growing rice and its arable land area only accounts for 0 76 of the province s land area therefore compared with the other provinces there is less water consumption in the agriculture sector the above results were obtained under deterministic conditions when uncertain factors were introduced into the model based on the conservatism degree a different value for γ was used to adjust the uncertainty risk the water resource allocation plan was then studied under the following scenarios γ 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 as shown in fig 5 from which it can be seen that changing the robustness coefficient was effective in regulating the resource allocation as the value of γ increased the available water resources in the 19 sub regions had a downward trend for example the water available for agriculture in shanghai dropped by around 25 from 2 687 103mcm γ 0 to 2 016 103mcm γ 0 8 which was the largest decline in the 19 sub regions followed by gansu qinghai jiangsu tibet guizhou guangdong sichuan chongqing henan zhejiang yunnan guangxi anhui jiangxi fujian hubei hunan and shaanxi with shaanxi s share of agricultural water falling from 2 249 103mcm γ 0 to 2 222 103mcm γ 0 8 a fall of only 1 as shown in fig 6 the total agricultural water resource allocation decreased with the increase in γ at γ 0 the total water resource allocated to agricultural irrigation was 1 17461 106mcm but when γ increased the total water resource allocation gradually decreased to 1 15909 106mcm γ 0 2 1 14357 106mcm γ 0 4 1 12804 106mcm γ 0 6 and 1 11252 106mcm γ 0 8 this was because as the value of γ increased the probability of a worst case for the uncertain factors in the constraints increased when we consider the higher the uncertainty risk the more conservative the model will be in the uncertain constraints when high uncertainty is considered the fluctuation range of surface water availability is large in order to meet the hard constraint requirements under the condition that the water consumption of other parts is fixed the water consumption of the agricultural sector is reduced to meet the hard constraint of the upper limit of water resources to maximize irrigation water productivity under limited water resource conditions the total water allocated to the agricultural sector reduces to ensure the validity of the model the uncertainties caused by the available surface water fluctuations were examined in order to verify the effectiveness of the model we take the yangtze river basin as an example for analysis and bring the basin data into the model for calculation to get the optimization results in order to verify the robustness of the model the robustness coefficient is introduced to adjust the degree of conservatism and the corresponding optimal solutions are obtained by considering different uncertainty degrees the value of the robustness coefficient γ fig 7 shows the spatial differences in the water resource allocations in the different regions under medium conservative levels γ 0 4 with the dark to light colors indicating more to less water distribution as can be seen there were obvious differences in the spatial water distribution this paper focus on the allocation of agricultural irrigation water so the allocation of water resources will be affected by the area of cultivated land in the area with large area of cultivated land more water resources will be allocated correspondingly in order to meet the demand of minimum agricultural water consumption conversely areas with less irrigation get correspondingly less water at the same time in addition to the area of cultivated land the planting pattern of crops will also greatly affect the allocation of water resources areas suitable for rice cultivation will increase the allocation of water to meet growing conditions for rice while for maize and wheat it will decrease the allocation of water relative to less water intensive crops therefore due to the geographical conditions and climatic conditions and so on the cultivated area and planting pattern will be different so the distribution of water resources also has obvious spatial differences this is a reasonable outcome from the model following the specific natural conditions in each region the water resources were allocated to maximize the resource utilization in each sub region based on differentiated fairness to realize a virtuous circle for water resource management fig 8 shows the results for the land resource allocation scheme it can be seen that the rice planting areas had a greater advantage than the wheat and corn planting areas in most sub regions it can be seen from fig 9 that the rice planting area accounted for about 55 of the total cultivated land area in the basin with the wheat and corn planting areas accounting for about 25 and 20 as most of the yangtze river basin is located in a subtropical monsoon area the climate is warm and humid with four distinct seasons high annual accumulated temperatures long crop growth periods rain and heat in many areas in the same season and excellent light heat water and soil conditions for agricultural production all of which are suitable for rice growth the yangtze river basin agriculture economy produces 75 of the country s grain and 90 of its cash crops from 40 of the country s arable land therefore the economic benefit of rice is higher than wheat and corn which means that planting rice over a large area is beneficial to increasing grain production efficiency and the basin s economic benefits taking γ 0 4 as an analysis example because of the size of the yangtze river basin as shown in fig 8 there are a small number of areas not suitable for rice cultivation for example shaanxi gansu and tibet have less rice cultivation areas than the other two crops and qinghai has no rice planting areas because of the climatic conditions and geographical locations in these provinces they do not have suitable rice planting conditions therefore the crop planting areas should be optimally allocated based on local conditions as shown in fig 9 when the γ value increased the area under rice decreased from 56 74 γ 0 to 54 33 γ 0 8 and the area under wheat and corn slightly increased this was because compared with wheat and corn rice is a highly water intensive crop therefore as the available water decreases to ensure total food security in the watershed the area under rice reduces and the area under the other two crops correspondingly increases 5 3 discussion the developed wfl nexus system robust optimization model supported the management of water and land for irrigated agriculture with the interrelationships among the main components of water food land nexus being quantified by an optimization model based on optimal results the irrigation water productivity is about 1 637 1 663 kg m3 which was a 3 61 5 25 increase compared to 2013 and proved that the water food land nexus robust optimization model is effective under ideal situations the total water allocated to the agricultural sector was 1 11252 106mcm 1 17461 106 mcm with different γ 0 0 8 which was a slight increase from the previous allocation in 2019 the higher the degree of uncertainty risk is considered the more conservative the results become the results show that with increasing uncertainty the total amount of water allocated decreases and so does the total planting area in the basin in order to ensure food security the corresponding crop planting patterns have also changed to adapt to the decrease of water and land resources water intensive crops such as rice have reduced their acreage while wheat and maize have increased their acreage this study attempted to develop an integrated optimization model to manage the water food land nexus in irrigated agriculture which was capable of addressing complex interrelationships among water food and land components from a holistic perspective and the following goals were achieved 1 based on the identified wfl nexus system the distribution of the water and land resources in the yangtze river basin are optimized 2 the resources allocation and utilization improved 3 the irrigation water productivity in the wfl basin nexus system maximized generally the framework of robust optimization model for wfl nexus was portable and can be applied to most regions when 1 the resources availability e g water and land resources was limited and it was necessary to reallocate the limited resources in a sustainable way to improve the water use efficiency of irrigation and 2 the main limiting factors water availability in this study were highly uncertain the model provided the basic objectives and constraints in addressing the above problems further analysis of results of the model contributed to real applications and policy implications for example the changing trends of resources allocations and objective function values under different robustness coefficient can help decision makers gain insight into when water supply can maximize the effectiveness for this study the resource allocation plan at γ 0 4 could be selected because both the system uncertainty is accounted for and the problems associated with over conservative results is avoided therefore with the continuous growth of population and rapid social development resources are increasingly in short supply efficient use of resources is the key to sustainable development the government should strengthen the effective control of land and water resources so as to achieve systematic resource allocation optimization results show that there are necessary resource trade offs between the land water and food with different crops being planted in different sub areas to improve resource utilization efficiency and maximize irrigation water productivity these results provide policymakers with a greater number of resource allocation plans based on the actual development needs for example decision makers can choose a suitable allocation plan based on their uncertainty level preferences and the data results in this paper 6 conclusion the novelties of this paper are 1 this paper developed a water land food nexus optimization model for irrigated agriculture multiple important resources are input to the nexus system to improve overall basin irrigation water productivity 2 the water food land nexus robust optimization method can be superior to the conventional optimization approaches dealing with uncertainties it can handle decision making problems when knowing the set of uncertain parameters without the probability distribution when the parameters change in a given set it can still ensure that the optimization scheme is feasible so that the model has a certain robustness the aim of the model is to optimally allocate limited water and land resources to different crops to obtain optimal irrigation water productivity the framework for the model is uncertain decision model with robust optimization and dual change theory was used to solve the model the model is capable of 1 simultaneously addressing interactions among water food and land subsystems in an irrigated agricultural system 2 improve the efficiency of limited resources and provide resource allocation plans for decision makers the model was applied to the yangtze river basin with the objective function being to maximize irrigation water productivity and with limited resources being the main constraint the complicated relationships between the water food and land resources in the yangtze river basin were quantified to develop reasonable resource allocation plans under uncertainty to prove the feasibility of the method and provide valuable data support for decision makers therefore this resource allocation method could be applied to other river basins to mitigate water scarcity food crises and other issues that can hinder agriculture development however this study focused on the management of water land and food in an irrigated agricultural system therefore the environment factors based on the irrigation energy consumption was negligible further studies are desired to extend the developed model to a grander scale considering more complex correlations between water food and land and considering more forms of uncertainties to enhance its practicability and applicability declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9941,soil salinization is widespread and it hinders agricultural development in the loess hilly region of china in this study we determined the dynamic distribution of the soil salinity ss as well as its effects on maize zea mays l after rainstorm events in two land types produced by excavation and sediment deposition four treatments were tested comprising sediment deposited farmland without plastic mulch s1 and with plastic mulch s2 and excavated farmland without plastic mulch e1 and with plastic mulch e2 the results showed that the dynamic distribution of the ss exhibited similar characteristics included leaching rapid accumulation and relatively stability in the 0 40 cm soil layer after rainstorm events a turning point where the leaching and accumulation of ss reached a balance in the 0 40 cm layer occurred on about the 4th day under the no plastic mulch treatments and on the 6th day under the plastic mulch treatments the ss reached a relatively stable condition in the whole soil layer on the 12th day rainstorm events increased the accumulated ss by 0 36 0 08 0 44 and 0 20 g kg 1 under e1 e2 s1 and s2 respectively during the year plastic mulch treatments decreased the average accumulated ss by 66 7 and the average ss by 22 by reducing water infiltration and soil evaporation the average ss and accumulated ss in sediment deposited farmland were 8 9 and 47 6 higher respectively than those in excavated farmland because of the lower depth of the groundwater influence zone and more abundant capillary pores in the sediment deposited farmland the average ss in the whole soil layer followed the order of s1 0 72 g kg 1 e1 0 62 g kg 1 e2 0 53 g kg 1 s2 0 52 g kg 1 p 0 05 and these levels did not limit maize growth however the two land types without plastic mulch would be transformed into severe saline alkali land after 10 years therefore we conclude that e2 is the optimal treatment for this region because it resulted in the lowest accumulated ss our results are important for understanding the ss dynamics and controlling soil salinization after rainstorm events keywords maize plastic mulch rainstorm event soil salinity 1 introduction soil salinization is a global problem that can decrease the quality of cultivated land reduce grain production and even degrade land and threaten the security of ecosystems butcher et al 2016 gorji et al 2020 rengasamy 2006 climate and groundwater are considered to be the main causes of soil salinization litalien and zeeb 2020 yang et al 2020 rainstorm events often cause flood disasters under conditions with high evaporation large amounts of soil salinity ss will precipitate on the soil surface velmurugan et al 2016 in addition high groundwater levels can exacerbate the accumulation of ss due to the ss returning to the surface soil jin et al 2019 therefore it is important to understand the ss distribution process in areas with rainstorms and high groundwater levels in order to control soil salinization the loess hilly and gully region of china has a long drought period high evaporation and frequent rainstorm events tang et al 2018 many studies have shown that irrigation has a leaching effect on the salt in soil thereby effectively controlling the accumulation of salt in the surface layer however the return of ss is inevitable as the time after irrigation increases dong et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 thus ss leaching and accumulation processes occur after irrigation the salt will be controlled in the deeper soil when the leaching effect is strong whereas the salt will accumulate in the surface soil when the cumulative effect is strong which both depend on the amount of irrigation quantity and the irrigation time interval shimizu et al 2014 wang et al 2016b however rain fed agriculture is the main method employed in this area fan et al 2019 the ss also undergoes leaching and accumulation as the time increases after rainstorm events due to the short duration of rainstorms the leaching process may be completed in a short time but the accumulation of ss may be greater with a longer drought period and high evaporation therefore we suggest that rainstorm events will increase the accumulation of ss in the surface soil soil salinization in the loess hilly region of china mainly occurs in gully farmland which includes sediment deposited and excavated land types jin et al 2019 these two land types are important for gully management because they can expand the cultivated land area promote agricultural production and protect the ecological environment chen et al 2015 2019 jin et al showed that groundwater is the main cause of salinization this area contains 320 000 ha of sediment deposited farmland and 33 780 ha of excavated farmland chen et al 2015 jin et al 2012 the sediment deposited farmland soil is derived from cultivated land and the surface soil on slopes and the soil nutrient content is high with an abundance of capillary pores li et al 2019 xu et al 2018 excavated farmland is formed by excavating the soil from slopes and filling the gullies with several meters of soil in a short period of time to form large areas of cultivated land but the soil nutrient contents are low and capillary pores are lacking chen et al 2015 thus the soil properties are very different for these two land types many studies have shown that the structure and properties of soil have significant effects on soil hydrological processes and water is the carrier of ss therefore the structure and properties of soil strongly influence the ss distribution wang et al 2016a maize zea mays l is a major grain crop that requires 500 800 mm of water during the growth period gao et al 2018 oker et al 2018 however the annual precipitation of 200 500 mm in the loess hilly region of china cannot meet the needs for maize growth therefore plastic mulch is applied widely in this area fan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b 2019a 2019b studies have shown that mulching can improve the soil moisture crop yield and water use efficiency as well as effectively inhibiting the accumulation of ss dong et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a bezborodov et al 2010 showed that the average increase in the surface ss was 20 under nonmulching treatments compared with mulching treatments in addition zhang et al 2018a 2018b found that compared with plain cropping plastic mulch increased the surface soil moisture by 33 1 and the yield by 30 4 104 7 and decreased ss by 73 7 moreover many studies have shown that most crops are sensitive to ss and high salt contents can severely inhibit crop growth and reduce yields akça et al 2020 allbed et al 2014 therefore it is important to implement appropriate measures for reducing ss the area of gully farmland in the loess hilly region of china affected by salinization has reached 30 and it is still expanding and thus there is an urgent need to control and prevent further soil salinization the main factors associated with soil salinization in this area are frequent rainstorm events high groundwater levels and strong evaporation however previous studies of the ss process have failed to adequately consider the effects of rainstorm events and the processes involved in addition the influence of plastic mulch application on the ss migration process needs to be further clarified therefore in the present study we aimed 1 to clarify the dynamic distribution of ss after rainstorm events 2 to analyze the effects of different treatments on ss and 3 to determine the effect of ss on maize growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the experimental site is located in nangou village yanan city shaanxi province north china 40 14 11 n to 42 27 42 n 75 33 16 e to 80 59 7 e this site is in the typical loess hilly region where the altitude varies from 921 to 1730 m with mean annual precipitation of 505 3 mm mean annual temperature of 8 6 c me an annual total sunshine duration of 2395 6 h mean annual total radiation of 493 kj cm 2 mean annual potential evaporation of 1463 mm and a shallow groundwater level jin et al 2019 the detailed soil properties are listed in table 1 according to the international classification standard for soil textures the soil textures in the excavated farmland were classified as loamy clay and clay loam in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers respectively and as sandy clay loam in the sediment deposited farmland the bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks determined for the excavated farmland soil were 0 99 g cm 3 and 120 2 10 3 ml min 1 respectively and 1 36 g cm 3 and 31 7 10 3 ml min 1 for the sediment deposited farmland soil the soils were light saline alkali for both land types jin et al 2019 2 2 rainstorm events and reference crop evapotranspiration et0 according to the classification of rainfall levels issued by the national meteorological administration rainfall events with 30 0 mm within 12 h were assigned to the rainstorm level in this study the first rainstorm 34 6 mm within 12 h second rainstorm 41 2 mm within 12 h and third rainstorm 61 mm within 12 h occurred on august 12 2018 june 5 2019 and august 3 2019 respectively as shown in fig 1 a previous study showed that rainfall data can be fitted using the pearson three type curve method thus our rainfall data were analyzed with this method fig 2 the number of rainfall events in this region during 20 years from 1999 to 2018 http data cma cn china meteorological data service center was 372 where the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 99 the coefficient of variation was 0 85 and the cumulative frequency rainstorm 30 00 mm within 12 h was 15 1 therefore the cumulative frequencies of the first rainstorm second rainstorm and third rainstorm were 11 4 7 6 and 2 4 respectively the rainfall events in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 3 there were 28 rainfall events in both years with four rainstorms these results are in agreement with the theoretical expectation 28 15 1 4 2 of about four rainstorm events per year meteorological data including the hourly temperature relative humidity precipitation atmospheric pressure 2 m wind speed on the ground and solar radiation were monitored by an automatic meteorological station frt x06a fuotong technology beijing co ltd china installed at the experimental field site et0 was calculated using the penman monteith method fao 56 allen et al 1998 the et0 values during the three rainstorms considered are shown in fig 1 the total et0s values in the sampling period after the first rainstorm second rainstorm and third rainstorm were 50 5 mm 79 6 mm and 84 0 mm respectively 2 3 depth of the groundwater influence zone in order to investigate the depth of the groundwater influence zone in the sediment deposited and excavated farmland this zone was detected at each sampling stage after the three rainstorms a soil auger 4 cm in diameter was used to drill soil cores during the soil core drilling process when a soil core was obviously water saturated this soil layer was considered to have reached the groundwater influence zone and the depth from the soil surface down to this layer was recorded jin et al 2019 the depths of the groundwater influence zones are shown in fig 4 depth of the groundwater influence zone rose after rainstorm events then decreased and maintained stable after day 12 jin et al 2019 showed that the ss in the groundwater in this area was 450 mg l 1 which is relatively low compared with severe saline alkali soil areas 2 4 experimental design and field management the experiment tested four treatments sediment deposited farmland without plastic mulch s1 and with plastic mulch s2 and excavated farmland without plastic mulch e1 and with plastic mulch e2 each plot covered an area of 96 m2 with a length of 10 m and width of 9 6 m each plot contained eight rows with a distance of 1 2 m between each row maize planting pattern was shown in fig 5 the ridge was 20 cm height with 50 cm width in the top and 30 cm width in the bottom under all treatments transparent plastic mulch was manually applied to cover the ridge areas the furrows were not mulched to allow rainfall infiltration the covered projecting area under the plastic mulch treatment was 75 of the total da feng no 26 seeds were sown on the ridges manually at a depth of 5 cm in double rows on april 25 2018 and april 27 2019 therefore the planting pattern comprised wide rows furrow of 70 cm and narrow rows ridge of 50 cm fig 5 and the planting density was 55 550 plants per ha identical standard field management methods were employed for the four treatments where 262 kg p ha 1 diammonium phosphate and 100 kg n ha 1 urea were applied as the base fertilizer on april 23 2018 lambers and barrow 2020 urea was applied evenly on june 22 2018 sulfonyl urea herbicides were sprayed on april 28 2018 after the emergence of maize seedlings to reduce the impact of weeds 2 5 sampling and measurement soil samples were collected before a rainstorm control and on the 1st 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th 12th and 14th days after rainstorms six replicates were collected for every soil sample the samples were obtained with a soil auger diameter of 4 cm and a retractable extended drill stem from the center of the ridge to a depth of 80 cm at 40 cm interval each sample was collected 10 cm away from the previous sample and the hole was filled the soil samples were dried in an oven to a constant weight at 105 c until constant weight to determine the soil moisture content the soil soluble salinity was determined using the gravimetric method bao 2005 the soil electric conductivity ec was determined using an ec meter dds 307a shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china where the soil samples were first air dried passed through a 1 mm sieve and mixed uniformly bao 2005 wang et al 2012 next the samples were dissolved in distilled water in a sealed plastic bottle at a ratio of 1 5 shaken for 30 min allowed to settle and measured two times with an ec meter to determine the relationship between the soil soluble salinity and ec we randomly selected 40 soil samples from sediment deposited and excavated farmland fig 5 the fitted equations are as follows excavated farmland 1 s 0 0042 ec 0 1032 r 2 0 88 p 0 01 sediment deposited farmland 2 s 0 0038 ec 0 0721 r 2 0 95 p 0 01 we then converted the ec values into the soil soluble salinity content 2 6 statistical analysis the average soil moisture and salinity values were calculated using excel analysis of variance anova was conducted and significant difference among treatments was tested with the least significant difference test at p 0 05 data were analyzed using the spss software package spss 23 inc chicago il usa graphs were prepared with origin pro 8 0 electronic arts inc usa 3 results 3 1 dynamic distribution of ss the dynamic distributions of ss after the three rainstorm events are shown in fig 6 the dynamic distribution of ss exhibited similar characteristic under all treatments with leaching rapid accumulation and stable condition extremely slow ss accumulation stages before rainstorm events the average ss in the 0 40 cm layer followed the order of s1 1 26 g kg 1 e1 1 13 g kg 1 e2 0 83 g kg 1 s2 0 75 g kg 1 but there were little differences in the 40 80 cm layer after rainstorm events the ss losses were highest in the 0 40 cm layer on the first day with an average ss loss of 0 27 g kg 1 while the ss accumulation was highest in the 40 80 cm layer with an average ss accumulation of 0 22 g kg 1 the average ss losses in the 0 40 cm layer were 0 16 g kg 1 and 0 37 g kg 1 under the ridges with and without plastic mulch treatment on the first day respectively and the average ss accumulation amounts in the 40 80 cm layer were 0 20 g kg 1 and 0 23 g kg 1 a turning point occurred where ss leaching and accumulation reached a balance in the 0 40 cm layer on the 4th day under the ridges without plastic treatment and on the 6th day under the plastic mulch treatment whereas the turning point occurred on about the 4th day in the 40 80 cm layer under all treatments except for the first rainstorm with a short monitoring time ss was relatively stable in the whole layer on the 12th day for the second and third rainstorm events the ss accumulation amounts were calculated for the second and third rainstorm events because ss was relatively stable for these rainstorm events on the 12th day in the whole layer table 2 the average ss accumulation amount in the 0 40 cm layer was 0 09 g kg 1 higher than that in the 40 80 layer for the second rainstorm event whereas the average ss accumulation amount in the 40 80 cm layer was 0 07 g kg 1 higher than that in the 0 40 cm layer for the third rainstorm event this difference mainly occurred because the precipitation amount was higher in the third rainstorm event and thus the leaching was greater the plastic mulch treatments reduced the ss accumulation amount by 66 7 compared with the no plastic mulch treatments the ss accumulation amount was 47 6 higher in the sediment deposited farmland than the excavated farmland the average ss accumulation amounts were 0 09 0 02 0 11 and 0 05 g kg 1 under e1 e2 s1 and s2 per rainstorm respectively and 0 36 0 08 0 44 and 0 20 g kg 1 per year 3 2 effects of different treatments on ss the ss concentrations in the 0 80 cm layer after the three rainstorm events under the four treatments are shown in fig 7 the average ss and standard deviation in the 0 40 cm layer were 0 69 g kg 1 and 0 24 g kg 1 respectively and 0 50 g kg 1 and 0 11 g kg 1 in the 40 80 cm layer the average ss concentrations in the whole layer in all rainstorm events followed the order of s1 0 72 g kg 1 e1 0 62 g kg 1 e2 0 53 g kg 1 s2 0 52 g kg 1 p 0 05 the plastic mulch treatments reduced the average ss by 22 compared with the no plastic mulch treatments the average ss was 8 9 higher in the sediment deposited farmland than the excavated farmland the anova results based on the land types treatments and ss concentrations in the different layers are shown in table 3 plastic mulch had a significant effect on ss in all layers p 0 01 whereas the land types only had a significant effect on ss in the 40 80 cm layer p 0 01 3 3 effects of ss on maize growth indexes the anova results based on the land types treatments and spring maize growth indexes are shown in table 4 the land type had a significant effect on all of the spring maize growth indexes p 0 01 plastic mulch had significant effects on the stem diameter and aboveground biomass p 0 01 the correlations between the average ss and spring maize growth indexes in different rainstorm events are shown in fig 8 there were no significant correlations between the average ss and maize growth indexes in all rainstorm events thereby indicating that maize growth was not limited by ss fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 distribution of ss after rainstorm events the dynamic ss distribution was similar under all treatments with leaching rapid accumulation and relatively stable condition stages in the 0 40 cm layer the important turning point when the leaching and accumulation reached a balance occurred on about the 4th day under the without plastic mulch treatment fig 6 before the turning point the water containing ss moved into the deeper soil layer due to the large amount of water deposited in the surface soil layer after rainstorm events and thus the leaching effect was strong velmurugan et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 showed that 33 6 mm of precipitation could move to a soil depth of 1 4 m in the study area therefore the ss may have been leached into the deep soil layer in all three rainstorm events after the turning point the water in the surface soil was consumed due to the high et0 fig 1 as a consequence the groundwater containing ss moved into the surface soil layer via the capillary pores and thus the ss accumulation effect was strong cao et al 2020 dong et al 2018 pang et al 2010 ss was relatively stable in the whole layer on the 12th day we found that depth of the groundwater influence zone maintained stable after 12th day fig 4 which might limit water recharge to the surface soil thereby reducing the salt accumulation content as the water moved to the surface soil zhao et al 2016 showed that ss increased slowly from the 9th day after rainfall which is similar to our results this trend can mainly be explained by crystallized ss blocking the capillary pores so much of the groundwater could not move into the surface soil layer thereby reducing the accumulation of ss as also shown by wen et al 2020 4 2 effects of different treatments on ss plastic mulch decreased the accumulation of ss and delayed the ss accumulation time figs 6 and 7 table 3 plastic mulch mainly affected the distribution of water to indirectly affect the ss accumulation these results can be explained by the following reasons i plastic mulch reduced the ss losses due to leaching by decreasing the water infiltration rate rainstorms often last for a very short time in the study area tang et al 2018 in our study the projecting area covered by plastic mulch accounted for 75 of the total surface area which greatly reduced the water infiltration area during a rainstorm the high rainfall intensity was greater than the water infiltration rate and thus water gathered in the furrows and even overflowed from the ridges of the field cheng et al 2013 reported that plastic mulch could reduce the water infiltration amount by 20 compared with a no plastic mulch treatment ii plastic mulch reduced the accumulation of ss by decreasing the soil evaporation rate the high et0 resulted in the consumption of large amounts of surface soil water after rainstorm events fig 1 the plastic mulch coverage of 75 greatly reduced the water available for consumption in the surface soil layer to decrease the capacity of groundwater for carrying ss into the surface layer hu et al 2019 showed that plastic mulch reduced non productive soil evaporation and the average soil water storage increased by 2 5 in the 0 200 cm soil layer thereby agreeing with our results the average ss and accumulated ss were 8 9 and 47 6 higher respectively in the sediment deposited farmland than the excavated farmland fig 7 and table 3 these results can be explained by the following reasons i the land types differed in the sediment deposited and excavated farmland where the former comprised surface soil from the cultivated land and slope with high ss jin et al 2012 whereas the excavated farmland soil came from the deeper loess and the ss content was relatively low jin et al 2019 ii the depth of the groundwater influence zone was higher for the sediment deposited farmland compared with the excavated farmland the average depth of the groundwater influence zone was 1 5 m in the sediment deposited farmland but 3 2 m in the excavated farmland in all of the rainstorm events dong et al 2018 reported that a high groundwater level led to more ss accumulating in the soil layer iii capillary pores were more abundant in the sediment deposited farmland compared with the excavated farmland the sediment deposited farmland soil comprised sediment deposited over many years and the soil texture was uniform with abundant capillary pores bai et al 2020 by contrast the excavated farmland soil was prepared by uneven mechanical compaction and the spatial variations in the soil properties were great chen et al 2015 2019 with few capillary pores the presence of abundant capillary pores can facilitate the movement of groundwater to the surface kohfahl et al 2008 telahigue et al 2020 4 3 effect of ss on maize maize growth indexes can be used to indicate the yield because good growth may lead to a high yield faloye et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a luo et al 2017 showed that low salinity 1 00 g kg 1 was beneficial for improving the yield and quality whereas high salinity 2 4 g kg 1 reduced the yield and degraded the quality in our study the average ss was 0 47 0 93 g kg 1 in the 0 40 cm layer fig 7 moreover there were no significant correlations between the average ss and maize growth indexes in all of rainstorm events and thus maize growth was not limited by ss the average accumulated ss amounts were 0 36 0 08 0 44 and 0 20 g kg 1 per year under e1 e2 s1 and s2 respectively we estimated that the excavated farmland soil would be transformed into light saline alkali soil about three years later jin et al 2019 also showed that excavated farmland could be changed into light saline alkali land after four years based on field sampling thereby agreeing with our estimate thus without further intervention the soil in the two land types will be transformed into severe saline alkali soil after 10 years without plastic mulching which will reduce the grain productivity and even lead to land degradation akça et al 2020 gorji et al 2020 litalien and zeeb 2020 overall our results indicate that e2 was the most suitable treatment for the loess hilly region because the ss accumulation was lowest and it could significantly reduce the risk of soil salinization 5 conclusion in the present study we examined the dynamic distributions of ss after rainstorm events in the loess hilly region of china and their effects on maize growth our main results are summarized as follows the dynamic ss distribution was similar under all treatments with leaching rapid accumulation and relatively stable stages over time in the 0 40 cm layer applying plastic mulch decreased the accumulation of ss and delayed the ss accumulation time the average ss and accumulated ss were 8 9 and 47 6 higher respectively in sediment deposited farmland than excavated farmland at present maize growth was not limited by ss however rainstorm events increased the accumulation of ss under all treatments with average amounts of 0 36 0 08 0 44 and 0 20 g kg 1 per year under e1 e2 s1 and s2 respectively as a consequence we estimated that the soils in the two land types will be transformed into severe saline alkali soil after 10 years without plastic mulch therefore e2 is recommended for the loess hilly region because the accumulated ss was lowest our results are important for preventing and controlling soil salinization

9941,soil salinization is widespread and it hinders agricultural development in the loess hilly region of china in this study we determined the dynamic distribution of the soil salinity ss as well as its effects on maize zea mays l after rainstorm events in two land types produced by excavation and sediment deposition four treatments were tested comprising sediment deposited farmland without plastic mulch s1 and with plastic mulch s2 and excavated farmland without plastic mulch e1 and with plastic mulch e2 the results showed that the dynamic distribution of the ss exhibited similar characteristics included leaching rapid accumulation and relatively stability in the 0 40 cm soil layer after rainstorm events a turning point where the leaching and accumulation of ss reached a balance in the 0 40 cm layer occurred on about the 4th day under the no plastic mulch treatments and on the 6th day under the plastic mulch treatments the ss reached a relatively stable condition in the whole soil layer on the 12th day rainstorm events increased the accumulated ss by 0 36 0 08 0 44 and 0 20 g kg 1 under e1 e2 s1 and s2 respectively during the year plastic mulch treatments decreased the average accumulated ss by 66 7 and the average ss by 22 by reducing water infiltration and soil evaporation the average ss and accumulated ss in sediment deposited farmland were 8 9 and 47 6 higher respectively than those in excavated farmland because of the lower depth of the groundwater influence zone and more abundant capillary pores in the sediment deposited farmland the average ss in the whole soil layer followed the order of s1 0 72 g kg 1 e1 0 62 g kg 1 e2 0 53 g kg 1 s2 0 52 g kg 1 p 0 05 and these levels did not limit maize growth however the two land types without plastic mulch would be transformed into severe saline alkali land after 10 years therefore we conclude that e2 is the optimal treatment for this region because it resulted in the lowest accumulated ss our results are important for understanding the ss dynamics and controlling soil salinization after rainstorm events keywords maize plastic mulch rainstorm event soil salinity 1 introduction soil salinization is a global problem that can decrease the quality of cultivated land reduce grain production and even degrade land and threaten the security of ecosystems butcher et al 2016 gorji et al 2020 rengasamy 2006 climate and groundwater are considered to be the main causes of soil salinization litalien and zeeb 2020 yang et al 2020 rainstorm events often cause flood disasters under conditions with high evaporation large amounts of soil salinity ss will precipitate on the soil surface velmurugan et al 2016 in addition high groundwater levels can exacerbate the accumulation of ss due to the ss returning to the surface soil jin et al 2019 therefore it is important to understand the ss distribution process in areas with rainstorms and high groundwater levels in order to control soil salinization the loess hilly and gully region of china has a long drought period high evaporation and frequent rainstorm events tang et al 2018 many studies have shown that irrigation has a leaching effect on the salt in soil thereby effectively controlling the accumulation of salt in the surface layer however the return of ss is inevitable as the time after irrigation increases dong et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 thus ss leaching and accumulation processes occur after irrigation the salt will be controlled in the deeper soil when the leaching effect is strong whereas the salt will accumulate in the surface soil when the cumulative effect is strong which both depend on the amount of irrigation quantity and the irrigation time interval shimizu et al 2014 wang et al 2016b however rain fed agriculture is the main method employed in this area fan et al 2019 the ss also undergoes leaching and accumulation as the time increases after rainstorm events due to the short duration of rainstorms the leaching process may be completed in a short time but the accumulation of ss may be greater with a longer drought period and high evaporation therefore we suggest that rainstorm events will increase the accumulation of ss in the surface soil soil salinization in the loess hilly region of china mainly occurs in gully farmland which includes sediment deposited and excavated land types jin et al 2019 these two land types are important for gully management because they can expand the cultivated land area promote agricultural production and protect the ecological environment chen et al 2015 2019 jin et al showed that groundwater is the main cause of salinization this area contains 320 000 ha of sediment deposited farmland and 33 780 ha of excavated farmland chen et al 2015 jin et al 2012 the sediment deposited farmland soil is derived from cultivated land and the surface soil on slopes and the soil nutrient content is high with an abundance of capillary pores li et al 2019 xu et al 2018 excavated farmland is formed by excavating the soil from slopes and filling the gullies with several meters of soil in a short period of time to form large areas of cultivated land but the soil nutrient contents are low and capillary pores are lacking chen et al 2015 thus the soil properties are very different for these two land types many studies have shown that the structure and properties of soil have significant effects on soil hydrological processes and water is the carrier of ss therefore the structure and properties of soil strongly influence the ss distribution wang et al 2016a maize zea mays l is a major grain crop that requires 500 800 mm of water during the growth period gao et al 2018 oker et al 2018 however the annual precipitation of 200 500 mm in the loess hilly region of china cannot meet the needs for maize growth therefore plastic mulch is applied widely in this area fan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b 2019a 2019b studies have shown that mulching can improve the soil moisture crop yield and water use efficiency as well as effectively inhibiting the accumulation of ss dong et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a bezborodov et al 2010 showed that the average increase in the surface ss was 20 under nonmulching treatments compared with mulching treatments in addition zhang et al 2018a 2018b found that compared with plain cropping plastic mulch increased the surface soil moisture by 33 1 and the yield by 30 4 104 7 and decreased ss by 73 7 moreover many studies have shown that most crops are sensitive to ss and high salt contents can severely inhibit crop growth and reduce yields akça et al 2020 allbed et al 2014 therefore it is important to implement appropriate measures for reducing ss the area of gully farmland in the loess hilly region of china affected by salinization has reached 30 and it is still expanding and thus there is an urgent need to control and prevent further soil salinization the main factors associated with soil salinization in this area are frequent rainstorm events high groundwater levels and strong evaporation however previous studies of the ss process have failed to adequately consider the effects of rainstorm events and the processes involved in addition the influence of plastic mulch application on the ss migration process needs to be further clarified therefore in the present study we aimed 1 to clarify the dynamic distribution of ss after rainstorm events 2 to analyze the effects of different treatments on ss and 3 to determine the effect of ss on maize growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the experimental site is located in nangou village yanan city shaanxi province north china 40 14 11 n to 42 27 42 n 75 33 16 e to 80 59 7 e this site is in the typical loess hilly region where the altitude varies from 921 to 1730 m with mean annual precipitation of 505 3 mm mean annual temperature of 8 6 c me an annual total sunshine duration of 2395 6 h mean annual total radiation of 493 kj cm 2 mean annual potential evaporation of 1463 mm and a shallow groundwater level jin et al 2019 the detailed soil properties are listed in table 1 according to the international classification standard for soil textures the soil textures in the excavated farmland were classified as loamy clay and clay loam in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers respectively and as sandy clay loam in the sediment deposited farmland the bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks determined for the excavated farmland soil were 0 99 g cm 3 and 120 2 10 3 ml min 1 respectively and 1 36 g cm 3 and 31 7 10 3 ml min 1 for the sediment deposited farmland soil the soils were light saline alkali for both land types jin et al 2019 2 2 rainstorm events and reference crop evapotranspiration et0 according to the classification of rainfall levels issued by the national meteorological administration rainfall events with 30 0 mm within 12 h were assigned to the rainstorm level in this study the first rainstorm 34 6 mm within 12 h second rainstorm 41 2 mm within 12 h and third rainstorm 61 mm within 12 h occurred on august 12 2018 june 5 2019 and august 3 2019 respectively as shown in fig 1 a previous study showed that rainfall data can be fitted using the pearson three type curve method thus our rainfall data were analyzed with this method fig 2 the number of rainfall events in this region during 20 years from 1999 to 2018 http data cma cn china meteorological data service center was 372 where the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 99 the coefficient of variation was 0 85 and the cumulative frequency rainstorm 30 00 mm within 12 h was 15 1 therefore the cumulative frequencies of the first rainstorm second rainstorm and third rainstorm were 11 4 7 6 and 2 4 respectively the rainfall events in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 3 there were 28 rainfall events in both years with four rainstorms these results are in agreement with the theoretical expectation 28 15 1 4 2 of about four rainstorm events per year meteorological data including the hourly temperature relative humidity precipitation atmospheric pressure 2 m wind speed on the ground and solar radiation were monitored by an automatic meteorological station frt x06a fuotong technology beijing co ltd china installed at the experimental field site et0 was calculated using the penman monteith method fao 56 allen et al 1998 the et0 values during the three rainstorms considered are shown in fig 1 the total et0s values in the sampling period after the first rainstorm second rainstorm and third rainstorm were 50 5 mm 79 6 mm and 84 0 mm respectively 2 3 depth of the groundwater influence zone in order to investigate the depth of the groundwater influence zone in the sediment deposited and excavated farmland this zone was detected at each sampling stage after the three rainstorms a soil auger 4 cm in diameter was used to drill soil cores during the soil core drilling process when a soil core was obviously water saturated this soil layer was considered to have reached the groundwater influence zone and the depth from the soil surface down to this layer was recorded jin et al 2019 the depths of the groundwater influence zones are shown in fig 4 depth of the groundwater influence zone rose after rainstorm events then decreased and maintained stable after day 12 jin et al 2019 showed that the ss in the groundwater in this area was 450 mg l 1 which is relatively low compared with severe saline alkali soil areas 2 4 experimental design and field management the experiment tested four treatments sediment deposited farmland without plastic mulch s1 and with plastic mulch s2 and excavated farmland without plastic mulch e1 and with plastic mulch e2 each plot covered an area of 96 m2 with a length of 10 m and width of 9 6 m each plot contained eight rows with a distance of 1 2 m between each row maize planting pattern was shown in fig 5 the ridge was 20 cm height with 50 cm width in the top and 30 cm width in the bottom under all treatments transparent plastic mulch was manually applied to cover the ridge areas the furrows were not mulched to allow rainfall infiltration the covered projecting area under the plastic mulch treatment was 75 of the total da feng no 26 seeds were sown on the ridges manually at a depth of 5 cm in double rows on april 25 2018 and april 27 2019 therefore the planting pattern comprised wide rows furrow of 70 cm and narrow rows ridge of 50 cm fig 5 and the planting density was 55 550 plants per ha identical standard field management methods were employed for the four treatments where 262 kg p ha 1 diammonium phosphate and 100 kg n ha 1 urea were applied as the base fertilizer on april 23 2018 lambers and barrow 2020 urea was applied evenly on june 22 2018 sulfonyl urea herbicides were sprayed on april 28 2018 after the emergence of maize seedlings to reduce the impact of weeds 2 5 sampling and measurement soil samples were collected before a rainstorm control and on the 1st 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th 12th and 14th days after rainstorms six replicates were collected for every soil sample the samples were obtained with a soil auger diameter of 4 cm and a retractable extended drill stem from the center of the ridge to a depth of 80 cm at 40 cm interval each sample was collected 10 cm away from the previous sample and the hole was filled the soil samples were dried in an oven to a constant weight at 105 c until constant weight to determine the soil moisture content the soil soluble salinity was determined using the gravimetric method bao 2005 the soil electric conductivity ec was determined using an ec meter dds 307a shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china where the soil samples were first air dried passed through a 1 mm sieve and mixed uniformly bao 2005 wang et al 2012 next the samples were dissolved in distilled water in a sealed plastic bottle at a ratio of 1 5 shaken for 30 min allowed to settle and measured two times with an ec meter to determine the relationship between the soil soluble salinity and ec we randomly selected 40 soil samples from sediment deposited and excavated farmland fig 5 the fitted equations are as follows excavated farmland 1 s 0 0042 ec 0 1032 r 2 0 88 p 0 01 sediment deposited farmland 2 s 0 0038 ec 0 0721 r 2 0 95 p 0 01 we then converted the ec values into the soil soluble salinity content 2 6 statistical analysis the average soil moisture and salinity values were calculated using excel analysis of variance anova was conducted and significant difference among treatments was tested with the least significant difference test at p 0 05 data were analyzed using the spss software package spss 23 inc chicago il usa graphs were prepared with origin pro 8 0 electronic arts inc usa 3 results 3 1 dynamic distribution of ss the dynamic distributions of ss after the three rainstorm events are shown in fig 6 the dynamic distribution of ss exhibited similar characteristic under all treatments with leaching rapid accumulation and stable condition extremely slow ss accumulation stages before rainstorm events the average ss in the 0 40 cm layer followed the order of s1 1 26 g kg 1 e1 1 13 g kg 1 e2 0 83 g kg 1 s2 0 75 g kg 1 but there were little differences in the 40 80 cm layer after rainstorm events the ss losses were highest in the 0 40 cm layer on the first day with an average ss loss of 0 27 g kg 1 while the ss accumulation was highest in the 40 80 cm layer with an average ss accumulation of 0 22 g kg 1 the average ss losses in the 0 40 cm layer were 0 16 g kg 1 and 0 37 g kg 1 under the ridges with and without plastic mulch treatment on the first day respectively and the average ss accumulation amounts in the 40 80 cm layer were 0 20 g kg 1 and 0 23 g kg 1 a turning point occurred where ss leaching and accumulation reached a balance in the 0 40 cm layer on the 4th day under the ridges without plastic treatment and on the 6th day under the plastic mulch treatment whereas the turning point occurred on about the 4th day in the 40 80 cm layer under all treatments except for the first rainstorm with a short monitoring time ss was relatively stable in the whole layer on the 12th day for the second and third rainstorm events the ss accumulation amounts were calculated for the second and third rainstorm events because ss was relatively stable for these rainstorm events on the 12th day in the whole layer table 2 the average ss accumulation amount in the 0 40 cm layer was 0 09 g kg 1 higher than that in the 40 80 layer for the second rainstorm event whereas the average ss accumulation amount in the 40 80 cm layer was 0 07 g kg 1 higher than that in the 0 40 cm layer for the third rainstorm event this difference mainly occurred because the precipitation amount was higher in the third rainstorm event and thus the leaching was greater the plastic mulch treatments reduced the ss accumulation amount by 66 7 compared with the no plastic mulch treatments the ss accumulation amount was 47 6 higher in the sediment deposited farmland than the excavated farmland the average ss accumulation amounts were 0 09 0 02 0 11 and 0 05 g kg 1 under e1 e2 s1 and s2 per rainstorm respectively and 0 36 0 08 0 44 and 0 20 g kg 1 per year 3 2 effects of different treatments on ss the ss concentrations in the 0 80 cm layer after the three rainstorm events under the four treatments are shown in fig 7 the average ss and standard deviation in the 0 40 cm layer were 0 69 g kg 1 and 0 24 g kg 1 respectively and 0 50 g kg 1 and 0 11 g kg 1 in the 40 80 cm layer the average ss concentrations in the whole layer in all rainstorm events followed the order of s1 0 72 g kg 1 e1 0 62 g kg 1 e2 0 53 g kg 1 s2 0 52 g kg 1 p 0 05 the plastic mulch treatments reduced the average ss by 22 compared with the no plastic mulch treatments the average ss was 8 9 higher in the sediment deposited farmland than the excavated farmland the anova results based on the land types treatments and ss concentrations in the different layers are shown in table 3 plastic mulch had a significant effect on ss in all layers p 0 01 whereas the land types only had a significant effect on ss in the 40 80 cm layer p 0 01 3 3 effects of ss on maize growth indexes the anova results based on the land types treatments and spring maize growth indexes are shown in table 4 the land type had a significant effect on all of the spring maize growth indexes p 0 01 plastic mulch had significant effects on the stem diameter and aboveground biomass p 0 01 the correlations between the average ss and spring maize growth indexes in different rainstorm events are shown in fig 8 there were no significant correlations between the average ss and maize growth indexes in all rainstorm events thereby indicating that maize growth was not limited by ss fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 distribution of ss after rainstorm events the dynamic ss distribution was similar under all treatments with leaching rapid accumulation and relatively stable condition stages in the 0 40 cm layer the important turning point when the leaching and accumulation reached a balance occurred on about the 4th day under the without plastic mulch treatment fig 6 before the turning point the water containing ss moved into the deeper soil layer due to the large amount of water deposited in the surface soil layer after rainstorm events and thus the leaching effect was strong velmurugan et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 showed that 33 6 mm of precipitation could move to a soil depth of 1 4 m in the study area therefore the ss may have been leached into the deep soil layer in all three rainstorm events after the turning point the water in the surface soil was consumed due to the high et0 fig 1 as a consequence the groundwater containing ss moved into the surface soil layer via the capillary pores and thus the ss accumulation effect was strong cao et al 2020 dong et al 2018 pang et al 2010 ss was relatively stable in the whole layer on the 12th day we found that depth of the groundwater influence zone maintained stable after 12th day fig 4 which might limit water recharge to the surface soil thereby reducing the salt accumulation content as the water moved to the surface soil zhao et al 2016 showed that ss increased slowly from the 9th day after rainfall which is similar to our results this trend can mainly be explained by crystallized ss blocking the capillary pores so much of the groundwater could not move into the surface soil layer thereby reducing the accumulation of ss as also shown by wen et al 2020 4 2 effects of different treatments on ss plastic mulch decreased the accumulation of ss and delayed the ss accumulation time figs 6 and 7 table 3 plastic mulch mainly affected the distribution of water to indirectly affect the ss accumulation these results can be explained by the following reasons i plastic mulch reduced the ss losses due to leaching by decreasing the water infiltration rate rainstorms often last for a very short time in the study area tang et al 2018 in our study the projecting area covered by plastic mulch accounted for 75 of the total surface area which greatly reduced the water infiltration area during a rainstorm the high rainfall intensity was greater than the water infiltration rate and thus water gathered in the furrows and even overflowed from the ridges of the field cheng et al 2013 reported that plastic mulch could reduce the water infiltration amount by 20 compared with a no plastic mulch treatment ii plastic mulch reduced the accumulation of ss by decreasing the soil evaporation rate the high et0 resulted in the consumption of large amounts of surface soil water after rainstorm events fig 1 the plastic mulch coverage of 75 greatly reduced the water available for consumption in the surface soil layer to decrease the capacity of groundwater for carrying ss into the surface layer hu et al 2019 showed that plastic mulch reduced non productive soil evaporation and the average soil water storage increased by 2 5 in the 0 200 cm soil layer thereby agreeing with our results the average ss and accumulated ss were 8 9 and 47 6 higher respectively in the sediment deposited farmland than the excavated farmland fig 7 and table 3 these results can be explained by the following reasons i the land types differed in the sediment deposited and excavated farmland where the former comprised surface soil from the cultivated land and slope with high ss jin et al 2012 whereas the excavated farmland soil came from the deeper loess and the ss content was relatively low jin et al 2019 ii the depth of the groundwater influence zone was higher for the sediment deposited farmland compared with the excavated farmland the average depth of the groundwater influence zone was 1 5 m in the sediment deposited farmland but 3 2 m in the excavated farmland in all of the rainstorm events dong et al 2018 reported that a high groundwater level led to more ss accumulating in the soil layer iii capillary pores were more abundant in the sediment deposited farmland compared with the excavated farmland the sediment deposited farmland soil comprised sediment deposited over many years and the soil texture was uniform with abundant capillary pores bai et al 2020 by contrast the excavated farmland soil was prepared by uneven mechanical compaction and the spatial variations in the soil properties were great chen et al 2015 2019 with few capillary pores the presence of abundant capillary pores can facilitate the movement of groundwater to the surface kohfahl et al 2008 telahigue et al 2020 4 3 effect of ss on maize maize growth indexes can be used to indicate the yield because good growth may lead to a high yield faloye et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a luo et al 2017 showed that low salinity 1 00 g kg 1 was beneficial for improving the yield and quality whereas high salinity 2 4 g kg 1 reduced the yield and degraded the quality in our study the average ss was 0 47 0 93 g kg 1 in the 0 40 cm layer fig 7 moreover there were no significant correlations between the average ss and maize growth indexes in all of rainstorm events and thus maize growth was not limited by ss the average accumulated ss amounts were 0 36 0 08 0 44 and 0 20 g kg 1 per year under e1 e2 s1 and s2 respectively we estimated that the excavated farmland soil would be transformed into light saline alkali soil about three years later jin et al 2019 also showed that excavated farmland could be changed into light saline alkali land after four years based on field sampling thereby agreeing with our estimate thus without further intervention the soil in the two land types will be transformed into severe saline alkali soil after 10 years without plastic mulching which will reduce the grain productivity and even lead to land degradation akça et al 2020 gorji et al 2020 litalien and zeeb 2020 overall our results indicate that e2 was the most suitable treatment for the loess hilly region because the ss accumulation was lowest and it could significantly reduce the risk of soil salinization 5 conclusion in the present study we examined the dynamic distributions of ss after rainstorm events in the loess hilly region of china and their effects on maize growth our main results are summarized as follows the dynamic ss distribution was similar under all treatments with leaching rapid accumulation and relatively stable stages over time in the 0 40 cm layer applying plastic mulch decreased the accumulation of ss and delayed the ss accumulation time the average ss and accumulated ss were 8 9 and 47 6 higher respectively in sediment deposited farmland than excavated farmland at present maize growth was not limited by ss however rainstorm events increased the accumulation of ss under all treatments with average amounts of 0 36 0 08 0 44 and 0 20 g kg 1 per year under e1 e2 s1 and s2 respectively as a consequence we estimated that the soils in the two land types will be transformed into severe saline alkali soil after 10 years without plastic mulch therefore e2 is recommended for the loess hilly region because the accumulated ss was lowest our results are important for preventing and controlling soil salinization

irrigation water productivity 1 introduction freshwater resources are acutely scarce to agriculture especially in arid and semi arid regions kumar et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 although water saving irrigation and high efficient water use have been introduced to reduce water use they are far from fulfilling the increasing demand of water for the expansion of agricultural production su and chang 2019 to overcome freshwater scarcity and maintain agricultural sustainability salty water are being taken into consideration for irrigation by the adoption of new crop and water management strategies ayars and schoneman 2006 pérez pérez et al 2016 rhoades 1984 according to statistics there are 17 countries globally using salty water for irrigation including china jiang et al 2021 egypt amer 2010 italy cucci et al 2019 and so on fig 1 salty water is the water with an electrical conductivity eci greater than 0 6 ds m 1 paranychianakis and chartzoulakis 2005 the available underground brackish water resources in china are approximately 20 billion m3 of which the exploitable amount is 13 billion m 3 which has great utilization potential liu and fu 2004 exploitation of salty water irrigation can largely alleviate the shortage of water resources in agricultural systems however the use of salty irrigation also brings many negative problems such as the buildup of salts in the soil baath et al 2017 2020 and the plant stress resulting from the increased osmotic potential which consequently adversely affects crop growth and yield beltrano et al 2013 sheng et al 2011 singh et al 2014 therefore the knowledge of crop responses to irrigation water salinity is essential in evaluating the application feasibility of broad scale salty water irrigation until now salty water has been widely studied to investigate whether it can be used as an alternative to freshwater resources for irrigation yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 baath et al 2020 cucci et al 2019 huang et

respectively compared to fully fresh water irrigation zhang et al 2019 investigated the effects of irrigation water salinity on salt leaching of a perennial flower in silt and sandy loam soils and concluded that better salt leaching effect occurred in sandy loam soils crop yield wp and iwp responses to salty water irrigation also vary among climate conditions and irrigation methods malash et al

irrigation under various crops soil and climate conditions based on a large database such a quantitative analysis is essential for the determination of the optimal conditions for applying salty water irrigation to reduce its adverse effects 2 methods 2 1 data collection data used in this meta analysis were collected from papers published between 1980 and 2021 in google scholar science direct and baidu scholar after searching we finally collected 120 publications with 1151 comparisons across 17 countries that included brackish or saline water or salt stress or salinity or electrical conductivity maize or corn wheat tomato cotton and pepper in the title abstract or keywords the distribution of the experimental sites is displayed in fig 1 several criteria were used to extract and

be the same as that of fresh water irrigation 5 papers reported original data no reviews 6 the experimental design was arranged in a randomized block design with at least two replicates 7 yield was

appendix a and b respectively many factors should be considered in making management strategies such as crop type local climate soil type salinity level and water management practices bustan et al 2004 shannon and grieve 1999 therefore the subgroups collected in this meta analysis included crop type soil property soil texture bulk density and ph irrigation method salinity level and mean annual precipitation the crops included wheat maize tomato cotton and pepper soil texture was classified into three groups i fine soils including clay silt clay and sandy clay ii medium soils including clay loam silty clay loam silt and silt loam iii coarse soils including sandy loam sandy clay loam and loamy sand soil survey staff 2014 soil ph was divided into two categories 7 and 7 soil bulk density was classified as lower bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 irrigation method was grouped into two categories drip and furrow irrigation salinity level was divided into two groups brackish water eci 3 0 ds m 1 and saline water eci 3 0 15 7 ds m 1 according to the generalized climate classification regions were divided according to mean annual precipitation map as arid

different response variables crop yield wp and iwp was response ratio lnrr hedges et al 1999 1 ln r r ln x e ln x c where x e and x c were the mean of crop yield wp and iwp under brackish or saline water and fresh water treatment respectively the variance of lnrr v was calculated by the following formula luo et al 2006 2 v s e 2 n e x e 2 s c n c x c 2 where n e and n c were the sample sizes of brackish or saline and fresh water respectively s e and s c represented the standard deviation for all variables of the brackish or saline water and fresh water respectively besides in order to produce the greatest precision the weighted mean response ratio lnrr was used luo et al 2006 3 ln r r i 1 k w i ln r r i 1 k w i where k was the study number w i w i 1 v 5 was the weight of the effect

percentage changes r r 1 100 8 based on the comparisons between brackish or saline water and fresh water the meta analysis was conducted in stata se 15 1 the frequency distribution of the effect sizes was produced in originpro 8 5 originlab corporation massachusetts usa 2 3 publication bias in the meta analysis the total heterogeneity of effect size was reciprocal of the residual sum of the within group heterogeneity and between group heterogeneity which was consistent with random effect analysis in addition the values of i2 variation in rr attributable to heterogeneity were widely recognized relatively robust and reliable heterogeneity test method hardy and thompson 1998 the results of crop yield wp and iwp from the stata se 15 1 software showed that there were heterogeneity between the individual studies i2 50 higgins et al 2003 thus a random effect model was used in this meta analysis the existence of reporting bias may affect the results of the meta analysis where publication bias had the largest impact rosenberg 2005 egger in the metabias command was statistical methods used to judge whether there was a publication bias peters et al 2006 besides rosenthal s fail safe number nf was also calculated to determine the size of publication bias the results were considered robust when rosenthal s fail safe numbers were larger than 5 n 10 n is the sample size of effect size in addition the larger rosenthal s fail safe numbers the smaller the publication bias and the more robust the meta analysis result rosenberg 2005 rosenthal s fail safe numbers of crop yield wp and iwp were 2 522 671 151 049 and 21 127 respectively which were significantly higher than nf 5 782 10 5 199 10 and 5 170 10 respectively although egger s value of these three indicators all showed that these funnel plots were asymmetrical p 0 000 0 05 the trim and fill analysis of crop yield and iwp indicated that there was no missing study there were sixty seven estimated missing studies of wp but the result of contour enhanced funnel plots demonstrated that the missing studies distributed in a statistically significant zone p 5 the result indicated that the asymmetry of the funnel plot may be caused by other reasons rather than publication bias ahmed et al 2011 overall the outcomes of testing publication bias showed that there was no publication bias 3 results 3 1 overview of crop yield and water productivity as affected by irrigation water salinity although crop yield wp and iwp all highly varied due to the differences of geographic and climate conditions the data were all roughly normally distributed fig 2 in general crop yield wp and iwp were significantly decreased by salty water irrigation compared to fresh water irrigation with lnrr of 17 3 95 ci 17 6 to 17 0 12 4 95 ci 13 2 to 11 7 and 10 8 95 ci 11 8 to 9 8 across 782 199 and 170 comparisons respectively compared with brackish water irrigation eci 3 0 ds m 1 saline water irrigation eci 3 0 15 7 ds m 1 caused larger reductions of crop yield wp and iwp apart from wp the differences of the percentage decreases of crop yield and iwp between these two irrigation salinities were significant fig 3 3 2 factors influencing crop yield and water productivity 3 2 1 crop yield and water productivity as affected by crop type the effects of salty water irrigation on crop yield and water productivity varied among crop types salty water irrigation generally had negative effects and significantly decreased crop yield and water productivity regardless of crop types apart from tomato brackish water irrigation significantly decreased yield and water productivity of the other four crops and there was no significant difference among these four crop types however as for saline water irrigation the smallest reductions of crop yield and wp were observed in cotton followed by wheat maize tomato and pepper with regard to iwp saline water irrigation performed better in tomato maize and wheat and there was no significant difference among them the percentage decrease of iwp was largest in pepper fig 4 3 2 2 crop yield and water productivity as affected by soil properties salty water irrigation mostly decreased crop yield and water productivity regardless of soil texture the percentage decreases of crop yield under saline water irrigation were significantly higher than those under brackish water irrigation brackish water irrigation decreased crop yield least in coarse soils 8 1 while the largest percentage decrease was found in fine soils 21 0 the yield of crops irrigated with saline water were decreased least in medium soils 16 0 and the differences among these three soil textures were significant when irrigated with brackish water soil texture had no significant effect on wp saline water irrigation did not cause significantly decrease in wp in fine soils 4 7 95 ci 3 4 to 13 4 compared to fresh water irrigation while wp were significantly decreased by 10 9 in medium soils 95 ci 11 9 to 9 9 and by 17 7 in coarse soils 95 ci 19 0 to 16 5 there were significant differences in iwp among these three soil textures with the percentage increase in coarse soils 0 7 95 ci 0 5 0 8 followed by medium soils 6 1 95 ci 8 2 to 4 1 and fine soils 19 3 95 ci 23 6 to 14 7 iwp was significantly increased by 23 5 95 ci 15 2 32 3 in medium soils while there were significant decreases in the other two soil textures under brackish water irrigation however this result should be further verified due to the small sample n 7 under the same soil bulk density the differences of the percentage decreases in crop yield between brackish water and saline water irrigation were not significant nonetheless the percentage decreases in crop yield were significantly larger in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 regardless of the salinity of irrigation water at the same irrigation water salinity no significant differences in wp and iwp were found between the two bulk densities but both were significantly lower than those under fresh water irrigation except for iwp in soils with higher bulk density the percentage decrease in wp under saline water irrigation was larger in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 12 0 while iwp showed a smaller percentage increase in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 0 7 however the differences of wp and iwp between these two soil bulk densities under brackish water irrigation were not significant indicating that soil bulk density was not the main factor affecting wp and iwp the percentage decrease in crop yield irrigated with brackish water increased with the increase of soil ph however as for saline water irrigation the result was opposite likewise wp decreased with the increase of soil ph at the same soil ph the percentage decreases in crop yield wp and iwp increased with the increase of the salinity of irrigation water fig 4 3 2 3 crop yield and water productivity as affected by irrigation method the effects of the salinity of irrigation water on crop yield and water productivity were also affected by irrigation methods when irrigated with brackish water furrow irrigation had a significantly larger effect on crop yield 19 2 95 ci 19 7 to 18 7 than drip irrigation 8 5 95 ci 9 5 to 7 5 but there was no significant difference when irrigated with saline water at the same irrigation water salinity level wp response was generally negative under drip irrigation and furrow irrigation and iwp was relatively higher under drip irrigation than furrow irrigation however there was no significant difference between the irrigation methods fig 4 3 2 4 crop yield and water productivity as affected by mean annual precipitation the responses of crop yield and water productivity to irrigation water salinity varied among mean annual precipitation map the percentage changes of crop yield to salty water irrigation were consistently negative regardless of map and were smallest in semi humid regions map 400 800 mm under saline water 10 9 and brackish water irrigation 1 7 besides brackish water irrigation in semi humid regions map 400 800 mm did not cause significantly negative effect on crop yield brackish water irrigation obtained higher crop yield than saline water irrigation except for map 200 400 mm regardless of map with regards to arid region map 200 mm and semi arid region map 200 400 mm there was no significant difference in crop yield and wp between brackish and saline water irrigation with regards to wp saline water irrigation caused similar percentage decreases in wp in arid regions map 200 mm 5 1 and semi humid region map 400 800 mm 5 2 apart from semi arid regions map 200 400 mm the percentage changes in iwp irrigated with saline water were not significantly different from those under fresh water irrigation fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 general effect of salty water irrigation on crop yield and water productivity generally our meta analysis demonstrated that salty water irrigation decreased crop yield wp and iwp by 17 3 12 4 and 10 8 respectively fig 3 this was largely because salty water irrigation resulted in the accumulation of salt ions in the soil zhu et al 2021 declined the uptake of k and ca2 ions tester and davenport 2003 and water channel activity aktas et al 2006 cabañero et al 2004 ultimately leading to a reduction in crop yield and water productivity our results also confirmed that compared with brackish water irrigation eci 3 0 ds m 1 saline water irrigation eci 3 0 15 7 ds m 1 caused larger reductions of crop yield wp and iwp fig 3 the higher the soil salinity the severer the osmotic pressure in the root environment karlberg et al 2007 which decreases the availability of water to plants yang et al 2020 sameni and morshedi 2000 and its movement to reproductive organs such as fruits and finally decreases crop yield li et al 2004 mavrogianopoulos et al 2002 reina sánchez et al 2005 specifically the adaptability of irrigation with salty water is decided by crop salt tolerance limit soil property irrigation method and rainfall intensity irshad et al 2009 su 2006 4 2 crop type effects on crop yield and water productivity crop yield and water productivity varied among crop types as expected cotton performed best under saline water irrigation followed by wheat maize tomato and pepper fig 4a similar results have been reported by previous studies chen and yu 1996 maas and hoffman 1977 katerji et al 2003 peralta et al 2005 possibly due to absorbing a large amount of salt ions and synthesizing some small molecular organic compounds under salt stress increase the solution concentration in cotton vacuoles and reduce cell water potential yang et al 2007 besides salt tolerance thresholds of various crops vary widely in different growth and evolutionary environments läuchli and grattan 2007 maas 1986 zhang et al 2010 when exceeding the threshold salt affected crops show severe decreases in growth and disturbances in membrane permeability water channel activity stomatal conductance photosynthesis and ion balance aktas et al 2006 cabañero et al 2004 and thus causes significant decrease in crop yield qureshi and ahmad 2004 for brackish water irrigation it did not cause the significant difference of the percentage decreases in crop yield wp and iwp among these five crops except for tomato fig 4 previous studies have revealed that there are many factors influencing the resistance of crops to salts such as irrigation amount hanson et al 2006 frequency el hendawy et al 2010 wang and wang 2006 and the temperature in the root zone adebooye et al 2010 kensaku et al 2008 different crops have special production conditions and field managements and these factors may offset the adverse effects of the lower soil salt content to some degree 4 3 soil properties effect on crop yield and water productivity for soil texture larger percentage decreases of crop yield and iwp under salty water irrigation were found in fine soils compared to medium and coarse soils fig 4a and c this result was presumably because fine soils reduced root respiration oxygen diffusion rate and caused a reduction in water and mineral uptake drew 1990 du et al 2018 meanwhile na brought by salty water can also cause the shrinkage of soil particles dispersion and expansion of colloidal particles resulting in the reduction of soil voids affecting soil permeability and the growth of crop roots xi et al 2002 cuartero and fernândez munäoz 1999 zhang et al 2010 also demonstrated that the sandy soil was more suitable than the clay soil for salty water irrigation at the same irrigation water salinity crop yield and wp performed better in soils with lower bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 than those with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 fig 4a and b higher soil bulk density increased soil compaction districted root growth and decreased water and nutrition uptake wolkowski and lowery 2008 4 4 irrigation method effects on crop yield and water productivity an appropriate irrigation method is also a key to the application of salty water irrigation hamdy 1993 at the same irrigation water salinity crop yield and water productivity under drip irrigation were higher than that those under furrow irrigation fig 4 this result was supported by the findings of abdelgawad et al 2005 malash et al 2007 and ünlü et al 2011 likely due to the following reasons firstly different irrigation methods had different characteristics of soil water and salt transport wei et al 2021 the high frequency leaching effect of drip irrigation caused the salt to accumulate near the wetting front forming a desalination zone near the emitter while maintaining a high soil matrix potential thereby creating a good moisture environment for crop growth zhang et al 2010 secondly furrow irrigation might results in excessive accumulation of water in some locations leading to hypoxia or anoxia to some degree all of which significantly inhibited the root respiration and water and nutrient transport yu et al 2020 furthermore drip irrigation had also been revealed to potentially enhance the use of saline water rajak et al 2006 decrease dangers of soil degradation and salinization karlberg and penning de vries 2004 water productivity under drip irrigation was higher than that under furrow irrigation fig 4b and c largely because drip irrigation compared with furrow irrigation could accurately bring water and nutrients to the crop roots which can not only improve water and nutrient use efficiency but also decrease the water leakage for deep percolation che et al 2021 wang 2013 piri and naserin 2020 4 5 mean annual precipitation effects on crop yield and water productivity percentage changes of crop yield and water productivity varied with mean annual precipitation map which indicated that map was closely associated with crop yield and water productivity under salty water irrigation our results indicated that comprehensively considering crop yield and water productivity semi humid regions map 400 800 mm were more beneficial to the application of saline water irrigation fig 4 this result was mainly due to that more precipitation led to more salt leaching and high humidity which reduced salt return caused by environmental evapotranspiration thereby enhancing the tolerance to salinity helal and mengel 1981 meiri et al 1982 besides more precipitation could fill up the lack of water absorption by the root system caused by the excessive accumulation of salt in soils and meet the water demand of plant growth nonetheless the percentage decreases of crop yields and water productivity did not decrease with the increase in map fig 4 probably due to the inappropriate time and intensity of precipitation liu et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 although we analyzed data collected from a wide range of environments and management practices worldwide to better understand the effects of salty water irrigation for optimum management and long term productivity there are still some limitations in this meta analysis other agronomic practices that might also affect the response of crop yield wp and iwp to salty water irrigation such as mulching pang et al 2010 yang et al 2020 timing and duration bustan et al 2005 irrigation amount che et al 2021 initial soil salinity patell et al 2001 were not taken into consideration due to the insufficient data hence future analysis should be conducted to consider these factors in this analysis there were many irrigation methods but not every irrigation method was analyzed because data on some irrigation methods were collected from only one publication or the irrigation method in the paper was surface irrigation and the specific irrigation method was uncertain therefore we only investigated the responses of drip and furrow irrigation to brackish or saline water irrigation 5 conclusions our analyses indicated that on average salty water irrigation significantly decreased crop yield 17 3 wp 12 4 and iwp 10 8 compared to fresh water irrigation compared with brackish water irrigation eci 3 0 ds m 1 saline water irrigation eci 3 0 15 7 ds m 1 caused larger reductions of crop yield wp and iwp simultaneously the effects of salty water irrigation on crop yield wp and iwp varied among crop types soil properties irrigation methods and mean annual precipitation cotton performed best under saline water irrigation followed by wheat maize tomato and pepper nonetheless brackish water irrigation did not cause significant differences in crop yield and wp among these five crops brackish water irrigation performed best in medium soils and the percentage changes in crop yield wp and iwp were 10 1 13 2 and 23 5 respectively decreased soil bulk density and increased soil ph contributed to the increase of crop yield regardless of irrigation water salinity the difference of wp between the two soil bulk densities was not significant farmers in semi humid regions map 400 800 mm and applying drip irrigation were more possible to obtain higher crop yield under salty water irrigation the percentage changes in wp and iwp of salty water irrigation were smaller under drip irrigation than those under furrow irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9942,due to the declining availability of freshwater resources to agricultural systems especially in arid and semi arid regions marginal quality water resources e g brackish or saline water are getting more attention for irrigation for optimal management and long term productivity the knowledge on responses of crop yield water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp to salty water irrigation under different crop types soil properties irrigation management practices and climate environments is needed here a global meta analysis of 1151 comparisons from 120 publications was adopted to systematically analyze the responses of crop yield wp and iwp to salty water irrigation overall salty water irrigation significantly decreased crop yield 17 3 wp 12 4 and iwp 10 8 compared to fresh water irrigation compared with brackish water irrigation irrigation water electrical conductivity eci 3 0 ds m 1 saline water irrigation eci 3 0 15 7 ds m 1 caused larger reductions of crop yield wp and iwp cotton performed best under saline water irrigation eci 3 0 15 7 ds m 1 followed by wheat maize tomato and pepper brackish water irrigation eci 3 0 ds m 1 did not cause significant differences in the percentage decreases of crop yield and wp among the five crops brackish water irrigation performed best in the medium soil and the percentage changes of crop yield wp and iwp were 10 1 13 2 and 23 5 respectively decreased soil bulk density and increased soil ph significantly increased crop yield regardless of irrigation water salinity farmers in semi humid regions map 400 800 mm and applying drip irrigation were more possible to obtain higher crop yield under salty water irrigation the percentage changes of wp and iwp of salty water irrigation were smaller under drip irrigation than those under furrow irrigation these results can help to optimize salty water irrigation management practices keywords brackish water saline water crop yield water productivity irrigation water productivity 1 introduction freshwater resources are acutely scarce to agriculture especially in arid and semi arid regions kumar et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 although water saving irrigation and high efficient water use have been introduced to reduce water use they are far from fulfilling the increasing demand of water for the expansion of agricultural production su and chang 2019 to overcome freshwater scarcity and maintain agricultural sustainability salty water are being taken into consideration for irrigation by the adoption of new crop and water management strategies ayars and schoneman 2006 pérez pérez et al 2016 rhoades 1984 according to statistics there are 17 countries globally using salty water for irrigation including china jiang et al 2021 egypt amer 2010 italy cucci et al 2019 and so on fig 1 salty water is the water with an electrical conductivity eci greater than 0 6 ds m 1 paranychianakis and chartzoulakis 2005 the available underground brackish water resources in china are approximately 20 billion m3 of which the exploitable amount is 13 billion m 3 which has great utilization potential liu and fu 2004 exploitation of salty water irrigation can largely alleviate the shortage of water resources in agricultural systems however the use of salty irrigation also brings many negative problems such as the buildup of salts in the soil baath et al 2017 2020 and the plant stress resulting from the increased osmotic potential which consequently adversely affects crop growth and yield beltrano et al 2013 sheng et al 2011 singh et al 2014 therefore the knowledge of crop responses to irrigation water salinity is essential in evaluating the application feasibility of broad scale salty water irrigation until now salty water has been widely studied to investigate whether it can be used as an alternative to freshwater resources for irrigation yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 baath et al 2020 cucci et al 2019 huang et al 2019 the effect of salty water irrigation on crop yield water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp are different as evidenced by the results reported by previous publications hamdy et al 2005 applied supplemental salty water irrigation to wheat and barley at the flowering and seed formation stages and found that the average yield reduction was 21 and 25 in barley and wheat respectively compared to fully fresh water irrigation zhang et al 2019 investigated the effects of irrigation water salinity on salt leaching of a perennial flower in silt and sandy loam soils and concluded that better salt leaching effect occurred in sandy loam soils crop yield wp and iwp responses to salty water irrigation also vary among climate conditions and irrigation methods malash et al 2008 feng et al 2015 min et al 2014 although many studies have reported the effects of salty water irrigation on crop yield wp and iwp none has simultaneously compiled the responses of crop yield wp

different response variables crop yield wp and iwp was response ratio lnrr hedges et al 1999 1 ln r r ln x e ln x c where x e and x c were the mean of crop yield wp and iwp under brackish or saline water and fresh water treatment respectively the variance of lnrr v was calculated by the following formula luo et al 2006 2 v s e 2 n e x e 2 s c n c x c 2 where n e and n c were the sample sizes of brackish or saline and fresh water respectively s e and s c represented the standard deviation for all variables of the brackish or saline water and fresh water respectively besides in order to produce the greatest precision the weighted mean response ratio lnrr was used luo et al 2006 3 ln r r i 1 k w i ln r r i 1 k w i where k was the study number w i w i 1 v 5 was the weight of the effect

group heterogeneity and between group heterogeneity which was consistent with random effect analysis in addition the values of i2 variation in rr attributable to heterogeneity were widely recognized relatively robust and reliable heterogeneity test method hardy and thompson 1998 the results of crop yield wp and iwp from the stata se 15 1 software showed that there were heterogeneity between the individual studies i2 50 higgins et al 2003 thus a random effect model was used in this meta analysis the existence of reporting bias may affect the results of the meta analysis where publication bias had the largest impact rosenberg 2005 egger in the metabias command was statistical methods used to judge whether there was a publication bias peters et al 2006 besides rosenthal s fail safe number nf was also calculated to determine the size of publication bias the results were considered robust when rosenthal s fail safe numbers were larger than 5 n 10 n is the sample size of effect size in addition the larger rosenthal s fail safe numbers the smaller the publication bias and the more robust the meta analysis result rosenberg 2005 rosenthal s fail safe numbers of crop yield wp and iwp were 2 522 671 151 049 and 21 127 respectively which were significantly higher than nf 5 782 10 5 199 10 and 5 170 10 respectively although egger s value of these three indicators all showed that these funnel plots were asymmetrical p 0 000 0 05 the trim and fill analysis of crop yield and iwp indicated that there was no missing study there were sixty seven estimated missing studies of wp but the result of contour enhanced funnel plots demonstrated that the missing studies distributed in a statistically significant zone p 5 the result indicated that the asymmetry of the funnel plot may be caused by other reasons rather than publication bias ahmed et al 2011 overall the outcomes of testing publication bias showed that there was no publication bias 3 results 3 1 overview of crop yield and water productivity as affected by irrigation water salinity although crop yield wp and iwp all highly varied due to the differences of geographic and climate conditions the data were all roughly normally distributed fig 2 in general crop yield wp and iwp were significantly decreased by salty water irrigation compared to fresh water irrigation with lnrr of 17 3 95 ci 17 6 to 17 0 12 4 95 ci 13 2 to 11 7 and 10 8 95 ci 11 8 to 9 8 across 782 199 and 170 comparisons respectively compared with brackish water irrigation eci 3 0 ds m 1 saline water irrigation eci 3 0 15 7 ds m 1 caused larger reductions of crop yield wp and iwp apart from wp the differences of the percentage decreases of crop yield and iwp between these two irrigation salinities were significant fig 3 3 2 factors influencing crop yield and water productivity 3 2 1 crop yield and water productivity as affected by crop type the effects of salty water irrigation on crop yield and water productivity varied among crop types salty water irrigation generally had negative effects and significantly decreased crop yield and water productivity regardless of crop types apart from tomato brackish water irrigation significantly decreased yield and water productivity of the other four crops and there was no significant difference among these four crop types however as for saline water irrigation the smallest reductions of crop yield and wp were observed in cotton followed by wheat maize tomato and pepper with regard to iwp saline water irrigation performed better in tomato maize and wheat and there was no significant difference among them the percentage decrease of iwp was largest in pepper fig 4 3 2 2 crop yield and water productivity as affected by soil properties salty water irrigation mostly decreased crop yield and water productivity regardless of soil texture the percentage decreases of crop yield under saline water irrigation were significantly higher than those under brackish water irrigation brackish water irrigation decreased crop yield least in coarse soils 8 1 while the largest percentage decrease was found in fine soils 21 0 the yield of crops irrigated with saline water were decreased least in medium soils 16 0 and the differences among these three soil textures were significant when irrigated with brackish water soil texture had no significant effect on wp saline water irrigation did not cause significantly decrease in wp in fine soils 4 7 95 ci 3 4 to 13 4 compared to fresh water irrigation while wp were significantly decreased by 10 9 in medium soils 95 ci 11 9 to 9 9 and by 17 7 in coarse soils 95 ci 19 0 to 16 5 there were significant differences in iwp among these three soil textures with the percentage increase in coarse soils 0 7 95 ci 0 5 0 8 followed by medium soils 6 1 95 ci 8 2 to 4 1 and fine soils 19 3 95 ci 23 6 to 14 7 iwp was significantly increased by 23 5 95 ci 15 2 32 3 in medium soils while there were significant decreases in the other two soil textures under brackish water irrigation however this result should be further verified due to the small sample n 7 under the same soil bulk density the differences of the percentage decreases in crop yield between brackish water and saline water irrigation were not significant nonetheless the percentage decreases in crop yield were significantly larger in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 regardless of the salinity of irrigation water at the same irrigation water salinity no significant differences in wp and iwp were found between the two bulk densities but both were significantly lower than those under fresh water irrigation except for iwp in soils with higher bulk density the percentage decrease in wp under saline water irrigation was larger in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 12 0 while iwp showed a smaller percentage increase in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 0 7 however the differences of wp and iwp between these two soil bulk densities under brackish water irrigation were not significant indicating that soil bulk density was not the main factor affecting wp and iwp the percentage decrease in crop yield irrigated with brackish water increased with the increase of soil ph however as for saline water irrigation the result was opposite likewise wp decreased with the increase of soil ph at the same soil ph the percentage decreases in crop yield wp and iwp increased with the increase of the salinity of irrigation water fig 4 3 2 3 crop yield and water productivity as affected by irrigation method the effects of the salinity of irrigation water on crop yield and water productivity were also affected by irrigation methods when irrigated with brackish water furrow irrigation had a significantly larger effect on crop yield 19 2 95 ci 19 7 to 18 7 than drip irrigation 8 5 95 ci 9 5 to 7 5 but there was no significant difference when irrigated with saline water at the same irrigation water salinity level wp response was generally negative under drip irrigation and furrow irrigation and iwp was relatively higher under drip irrigation than furrow irrigation however there was no significant difference between the irrigation methods fig 4 3 2 4 crop yield and water productivity as affected by mean annual precipitation the responses of crop yield and water productivity to irrigation water salinity varied among mean annual precipitation map the percentage changes of crop yield to salty water irrigation were consistently negative regardless of map and were smallest in semi humid regions map 400 800 mm under saline water 10 9 and brackish water irrigation 1 7 besides brackish water irrigation in semi humid regions map 400 800 mm did not cause significantly negative effect on crop yield brackish water irrigation obtained higher crop yield than saline water irrigation except for map 200 400 mm regardless of map with regards to arid region map 200 mm and semi arid region map 200 400 mm there was no significant difference in crop yield and wp between brackish and saline water irrigation with regards to wp saline water irrigation caused similar percentage decreases in wp in arid regions map 200 mm 5 1 and semi humid region map 400 800 mm 5 2 apart from semi arid regions map 200 400 mm the percentage changes in iwp irrigated with saline water were not significantly different from those under fresh water irrigation fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 general effect of salty water irrigation on crop yield and water productivity generally our meta analysis demonstrated that salty water irrigation decreased crop yield wp and iwp by 17 3 12 4 and 10 8 respectively fig 3 this was largely because salty water irrigation resulted in the accumulation of salt ions in the soil zhu et al 2021 declined the uptake of k and ca2 ions tester and davenport 2003 and water channel activity aktas et al 2006 cabañero et al 2004 ultimately leading to a reduction in crop yield and water productivity our results also confirmed that compared with brackish water irrigation eci 3 0 ds m 1 saline water irrigation eci 3 0 15 7 ds m 1 caused larger reductions of crop yield wp and iwp fig 3 the higher the soil salinity the severer the osmotic pressure in the root environment karlberg et al 2007 which decreases the availability of water to plants yang et al 2020 sameni and morshedi 2000 and its movement to reproductive organs such as fruits and finally decreases crop yield li et al 2004 mavrogianopoulos et al 2002 reina sánchez et al 2005 specifically the adaptability of irrigation with salty water is decided by crop salt tolerance limit soil property irrigation method and rainfall intensity irshad et al 2009 su 2006 4 2 crop type effects on crop yield and water productivity crop yield and water productivity varied among crop types as expected cotton performed best under saline water irrigation followed by wheat maize tomato and pepper fig 4a similar results have been reported by previous studies chen and yu 1996 maas and hoffman 1977 katerji et al 2003 peralta et al 2005 possibly due to absorbing a large amount of salt ions and synthesizing some small molecular organic compounds under salt stress increase the solution concentration in cotton vacuoles and reduce cell water potential yang et al 2007 besides salt tolerance thresholds of various crops vary widely in different growth and evolutionary environments läuchli and grattan 2007 maas 1986 zhang et al 2010 when exceeding the threshold salt affected crops show severe decreases in growth and disturbances in membrane permeability water channel activity stomatal conductance photosynthesis and ion balance aktas et al 2006 cabañero et al 2004 and thus causes significant decrease in crop yield qureshi and ahmad 2004 for brackish water irrigation it did not cause the significant difference of the percentage decreases in crop yield wp and iwp among these five crops except for tomato fig 4 previous studies have revealed that there are many factors influencing the resistance of crops to salts such as irrigation amount hanson et al 2006 frequency el hendawy et al 2010 wang and wang 2006 and the temperature in the root zone adebooye et al 2010 kensaku et al 2008 different crops have special production conditions and field managements and these factors may offset the adverse effects of the lower soil salt content to some degree 4 3 soil properties effect on crop yield and water productivity for soil texture larger percentage decreases of crop yield and iwp under salty water irrigation were found in fine soils compared to medium and coarse soils fig 4a and c this result was presumably because fine soils reduced root respiration oxygen diffusion rate and caused a reduction in water and mineral uptake drew 1990 du et al 2018 meanwhile na brought by salty water can also cause the shrinkage of soil particles dispersion and expansion of colloidal particles resulting in the reduction of soil voids affecting soil permeability and the growth of crop roots xi et al 2002 cuartero and fernândez munäoz 1999 zhang et al 2010 also demonstrated that the sandy soil was more suitable than the clay soil for salty water irrigation at the same irrigation water salinity crop yield and wp performed better in soils with lower bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 than those with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 fig 4a and b higher soil bulk density increased soil compaction districted root growth and decreased water and nutrition uptake wolkowski and lowery 2008 4 4 irrigation method effects on crop yield and water productivity an appropriate irrigation method is also a key to the application of salty water irrigation hamdy 1993 at the same irrigation water salinity crop yield and water productivity under drip irrigation were higher than that those under furrow irrigation fig 4 this result was supported by the findings of abdelgawad et al 2005 malash et al 2007 and ünlü et al 2011 likely due to the following reasons firstly different irrigation methods had different characteristics of soil water and salt transport wei et al 2021 the high frequency leaching effect of drip irrigation caused the salt to accumulate near the wetting front forming a desalination zone near the emitter while maintaining a high soil matrix potential thereby creating a good moisture environment for crop growth zhang et al 2010 secondly furrow irrigation might results in excessive accumulation of water in some locations leading to hypoxia or anoxia to some degree all of which significantly inhibited the root respiration and water and nutrient transport yu et al 2020 furthermore drip irrigation had also been revealed to potentially enhance the use of saline water rajak et al 2006 decrease dangers of soil degradation and salinization karlberg and penning de vries 2004 water productivity under drip irrigation was higher than that under furrow irrigation fig 4b and c largely because drip irrigation compared with furrow irrigation could accurately bring water and nutrients to the crop roots which can not only improve water and nutrient use efficiency but also decrease the water leakage for deep percolation che et al 2021 wang 2013 piri and naserin 2020 4 5 mean annual precipitation effects on crop yield and water productivity percentage changes of crop yield and water productivity varied with mean annual precipitation map which indicated that map was closely associated with crop yield and water productivity under salty water irrigation our results indicated that comprehensively considering crop yield and water productivity semi humid regions map 400 800 mm were more beneficial to the application of saline water irrigation fig 4 this result was mainly due to that more precipitation led to more salt leaching and high humidity which reduced salt return caused by environmental evapotranspiration thereby enhancing the tolerance to salinity helal and mengel 1981 meiri et al 1982 besides more precipitation could fill up the lack of water absorption by the root system caused by the excessive accumulation of salt in soils and meet the water demand of plant growth nonetheless the percentage decreases of crop yields and water productivity did not decrease with the increase in map fig 4 probably due to the inappropriate time and intensity of precipitation liu et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 although we analyzed data collected from a wide range of environments and management practices worldwide to better understand the effects of salty water irrigation for optimum management and long term productivity there are still some limitations in this meta analysis other agronomic practices that might also affect the response of crop yield wp and iwp to salty water irrigation such as mulching pang et al 2010 yang et al 2020 timing and duration bustan et al 2005 irrigation amount che et al 2021 initial soil salinity patell et al 2001 were not taken into consideration due to the insufficient data hence future analysis should be conducted to consider these factors in this analysis there were many irrigation methods but not every irrigation method was analyzed because data on some irrigation methods were collected from only one publication or the irrigation method in the paper was surface irrigation and the specific irrigation method was uncertain therefore we only investigated the responses of drip and furrow irrigation to brackish or saline water irrigation 5 conclusions our analyses indicated that on average salty water irrigation significantly decreased crop yield 17 3 wp 12 4 and iwp 10 8 compared to fresh water irrigation compared with brackish water irrigation eci 3 0 ds m 1 saline water irrigation eci 3 0 15 7 ds m 1 caused larger reductions of crop yield wp and iwp simultaneously the effects of salty water irrigation on crop yield wp and iwp varied among crop types soil properties irrigation methods and mean annual precipitation cotton performed best under saline water irrigation followed by wheat maize tomato and pepper nonetheless brackish water irrigation did not cause significant differences in crop yield and wp among these five crops brackish water irrigation performed best in medium soils and the percentage changes in crop yield wp and iwp were 10 1 13 2 and 23 5 respectively decreased soil bulk density and increased soil ph contributed to the increase of crop yield regardless of irrigation water salinity the difference of wp between the two soil bulk densities was not significant farmers in semi humid regions map 400 800 mm and applying drip irrigation were more possible to obtain higher crop yield under salty water irrigation the percentage changes in wp and iwp of salty water irrigation were smaller under drip irrigation than those under furrow irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9943,the goal of this study was to check the feasibility of the use of dendrometers to monitor water stress levels in avocado trees persea americana mill cv hass during the period of 2015 2017 this water stress was generated naturally during events of high vapor pressure deficit vpd that normally take place during the israeli spring may and late autumn september it was also generated artificially by considering two irrigation regimes one providing the crop water needs estimated using lysimeter data and one applying 75 of that amount the different water regimes and climatic conditions allowed us to investigate the impact of seasonal atmospheric changes on transpiration t and on the maximum trunk daily shrinkage mds of the trees the mds captured well the differences between the irrigation treatments showing over 100 µm increase at peak summer in response to the treatment providing 75 of the irrigation dose applied to the well watered treatment we found that t increased linearly with the daily average value of vpd up to around 1 3 kpa above which the slope of the linear relationship decreased with the increase in vpd this reduction of t induced moderate changes in mds under high vpd the relationships between mds and vpd and between mds and t depended on the season exhibiting substantially lower mds during the spring and early summer the hysteretic nature of these relationships indicates that mds values are related to tree phenology a vpd of 1 3 kpa corresponds to an mds of 50 µm in the first half of the year flowering and fruit set and to an mds of 150 µm during the second half of the year fruit growth and maturation finally we found that mds was highly correlated with the stem water potential regardless of the irrigation treatment or time of year and is therefore a reliable stress indicator in avocado trees as long as vpd and phenological stage of the tree are considered keywords avocado transpiration irrigation dendrometers maximum daily shrinkage vapor pressure deficit stem water potential 1 introduction avocado persea americana mill is grown nowadays all over the world due to its very high fruit nutritional value schaffer et al 2013 and the water requirements of this crop are under study especially in semiarid and arid areas where irrigation is crucial carr 2013 lahav et al 2013 in israel where avocado cultivation is continuously increasing the typical spring heatwaves coincide with the sensitive period of flowering and fruit set frequently leading to substantial yield loss silber et al 2019 the root system of avocado is relatively shallow and commonly more than 70 of the roots are concentrated in the upper 0 5 m of the soil lahav and whiley 2002 consequently small soil volumes are available for root exploitation and the corresponding buffer capacity of the soil may not be sufficient for meeting crop water and nutrient needs it is thus likely that small and shallow root system could temporarily fail to supply the high demands for water and nutrients during critical stages such as flowering fruit set or seed development occurring during the spring accordingly there is a growing effort to develop reliable stress indicators for avocado trees that will enable more efficient irrigation for this crop under dry conditions water use efficiency can be improved by controlling the soil water status via proper irrigation management accordingly a large body of research focused on relating the soil water potential ψ soil to avocado irrigation scheduling lahav and kalmar 1983 however ψ soil varies much less than the leaf water potential ψ leaf which is affected by highly variable meteorological factors including vpd améglio et al 1999 caldeira et al 2014a 2014b and the plant hydraulic conductance as such it is less suitable as an integrative stress indicator as a result methods based on monitoring the plant water status rather than that of the soil were developed while parameters as leaf ψleaf or stem ψstem water potentials are established as excellent irrigation indicators naor 1998 their measurement is time and labor consuming on the other hand dendrometers could provide reliable and continuous data of the tree water status in various crops and their commercial implementation is increasing de swaef et al 2015 fernández and cuevas 2010 in avocado dendrometers studies date back to schroeder and wieland 1956 and have become more common in the last decade celedón et al 2012 silber et al 2013 2019 following the development of user friendly sensors fernández and cuevas 2010 ortuño et al 2010 the major parameter derived from trunk diameter variations data for plant response monitoring is the maximum daily shrinkage mds currently before irrigation could be applied solely based on mds there is still a major knowledge gap regarding the relationship between mds values ψstem and avocado transpiration t the feasibility of mds to monitor stress under high vpd is particularly in question due to the stomatal response to high vpd observations and model simulations monteith 1995 pieruschka et al 2010 have shown that plant transpiration increased linearly with vpd at low values but turned out to be quite constant above a certain threshold around 1 0 kpa for the simulation conditions in pieruschka et al 2010 this notion is further supported by many studies that showed stomatal closure of plants under high vpd even under well watered conditions e g yong et al 1997 such stomatal regulation is likely to reduce the sensitivity of mds to high vpd in the present study we studied the potential ability of dendrometers to monitor the impact of water regime and atmospheric demand on avocado trees in the field trees grown in well watered conditions in lysimeters provided tree transpiration estimates t that were used as reference for establishing the water amounts doses in the irrigation experiments in the field the tree response was expressed in terms of mds using dendrometers and stem water potential ψstem the study presented herein considers data from three consecutive years between 2015 and 2017 and focuses on the april june sensitive and critical period for the yield and the september october period where the trees are loaded with mature fruits silber et al 2019 under the mediterranean climate both of these periods are characterized by heatwaves and days with high atmospheric demand 2 materials and methods 2 1 the experimental site the study was conducted at the acre experimental station located in the western galilee in israel 32 57 n 35 05 e 10 m above sea level the soil is grumusol containing approximately 50 clay mostly smectite oakes and thorp 1951 data on the soil properties are provided in table 1 the climate is mediterranean with mild wet winters followed by dry hot summers the rainfall season in the region is between october and may with a mean annual precipitation of 580 mm the meteorological conditions in the region during the experimental period were provided by the israeli meteorological station located at the acre experimental station at 200 m from the experimental site the daily values of rainfall solar radiation air temperature humidity and wind speed for the experimental period are computed using the hourly values provided by the meteorological station and are depicted in fig a1 in the appendix the average values over the whole experimental period for air temperature air humidity and solar radiation are 20 0 c 66 7 and 19 4 mj m2 d respectively the average annual maximum temperature is 25 0 c and the average annual minimum temperature is 17 0 c based on the meteorological measurements the vpd values were computed according to the equation vpd e sat 1 rh 100 where e sat is the saturation vapor pressure for the corresponding air temperature and rh the relative humidity the daily reference evapotranspiration was estimated following the penman monteith equation et pm allen et al 1998 the daily values are depicted in fig 1 a b for 2015 2017 the annual cycle of the mean daily vpd values fig 1a fluctuates between 0 2 kpa in winter and 1 5 kpa in the summer accordingly the mean daily et pm values fig 1b fluctuate between 1 mm d in winter and 6 5 mm d in the summer the spring period highlighted in grey is characterized by exceptional days with high vpd values up to 3 5 kpa and corresponding high et pm values up to 10 mm d flowering and fruit set occur during the spring and could be affected by these days with extreme atmospheric conditions 2 2 the experimental design the experiment was conducted on 10 years old hass avocado trees grafted on degania 117 a west indian avocado rootstock and grown a in six 1 m3 above ground plastic containers lysimeters in 2015 and 2016 b in the field between 2015 and 2017 the density of the trees in the lysimeters was similar to that in the field 4 m between trees in the row 6 m between rows to ensure a similar exposition to solar radiation perlite was chosen as the growth medium in the lysimeters because of its low air entry suction and good drainage qualities the irrigation system in the lysimeters consisted of a loop of 13 2 3 l h pressure compensated drippers netafim inc israel installed around each trunk a high frequency pulsed irrigation 10 20 min every 30 min was applied using an irrigation controller to establish quasi steady state conditions inducing a constant water content into the perlite a leaching fraction above 0 4 ratio of drainage and irrigation amounts was applied to maintain the electrical conductivity of the draining solution below 1 5 ds m and prevent salt stress the lysimeters were covered with a black plastic sheet to prevent soil surface evaporation dry leaves covered the plastic sheet and protected it from heating due to direct solar radiation the gravitational drainage from the six lysimeters was collected in 0 1 m3 containers that were placed on a weight recording scale bh200 shekel electronic scales israel the weight of the collected drainage volume was recorded every 10 min a practically constant daily drainage rate was measured allowing to assume that the mean daily soil water content was constant in the lysimeters consequently the daily transpiration of each tree t was calculated as the difference between the applied irrigation volume and the cumulative drainage volume for each day the dynamics of the measured mean drainage for the 6 lysimeters during daylight is illustrated in fig a2 upper plot for one day in 2016 july 15th indicating a low variability in the drainage rates from each lysimeter error bars and a practically constant drainage rate during most of the day the corresponding estimated mean transpiration for that day is also illustrated in fig a2 lower plot the tree size leaf area index and fruit yield of the lysimeter grown trees were very close to those of the well irrigated trees grown in the field mean tree height between 3 5 and 4 0 m mean yield of 65 kg tree therefore the estimated t of the trees grown in the lysimeters provided a good approximation to the reference water demand for the irrigation of the trees in the field experiment assuming that evaporation from the drip irrigated field is very low drip lines under a shadow practically no wind below canopy most of the soil surface is dry and covered by litter kool et al 2014 tree density in the field was 417 trees per hectare the distance between rows was 6 m and that between trees within rows 4 m each experimental plot comprised 18 trees 3 rows with 6 trees per row the external rows were considered as buffer rows the experimental field design comprised four irrigation treatments that are described in detail in silber et al 2019 five experimental plots were allocated to each treatment providing data with five replicates in this study we focused on two irrigation treatments mw and md i mw a well watered treatment where trees were irrigated every two days during the whole year including during winter and spring according to the actual transpiration estimated in the lysimeters ii md a deficit irrigation treatment were 75 of the irrigation dose in the well watered treatment described above mw was applied every two days during the whole year including during winter and spring the irrigation system in the field consisted of two lines of drippers located 20 cm on each side of the trunk 1 6 l h pressure compensated drippers netafim inc israel the distance between drippers was 40 cm corresponding to a water application rate of 1 33 mm h the cumulative irrigation applied in the well watered treatments mw was 811 1020 and 990 mm in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively all the horticultural treatments pruning pest and weeds control were performed uniformly in both treatments according to the recommendations of the israeli extension service noy 2006 more details can be found in silber et al 2018 2019 2 3 measurements linear variable displacement transducer lvdt dendrometers phytech ltd rosh ha ayin israel were installed on the trunk of the six trees in the lysimeters and on five trees for each irrigation treatment in the field data were recorded every 1 min and the corresponding maximum daily shrinkage mds was calculated for each day for each tree by computing the difference between the maximum and the minimum recorded displacement values the dynamics of the measured mean trunk displacement for the six trees grown in the lysimeters during daylight along with the corresponding estimated transpiration for july 15th in 2016 is illustrated in fig a2 lower plot the error bars indicate that the variability between trees was low fig a2 shows that lvdt responds very quickly at the beginning of transpiration in the tree early in the morning the annual dynamics of the mean mds for 2016 in the trees in the field and in the lysimeters are shown in fig a3 to illustrate the impact of the different water regimes and the variability in the measurements between replicates in the study two sub sets of the data of the whole year that are related to the phenological stages of the tree were considered the period of the flowering and fruit set 1 4 30 6 and the period of fruit growth and maturation 1 7 31 10 stem water potential ψ stem of the trees equipped with the dendrometers was measured at midday 13 00 from february to may every week and from june to september every two weeks two shaded shoot ends of 5 7 leaves per tree from the inner part of the canopy were inserted while intact to zip loc plastic bags covered by aluminum foil for 90 min before measurements were taken the leaves were then cut and measured with a pressure chamber pms 1000 pms albany or while still covered with a bag specific attention was given to the data corresponding to the phenological stages of the avocado tree the april june period of flowering and fruit set found to be critical for the yield and the july october period corresponding to fruit growth and maturation the mean measured ψ stem values for the five replicates in the two irrigation treatments during 2016 are depicted in fig a4 along with the reference evaporation the values responded to the high atmospheric demand in the spring and were significantly different between the two treatments during summer and autumn all data were analyzed for the effects of treatments by means of the general linear model procedure of sas sas institute cary nc usa differences among means were tested with the standard least squares mode of anova differences with a probability larger than 95 were considered significant 3 results the calculated mean mds values based on the dendrometers data from the six trees for the well watered mw blue dots and the deficit irrigated md red dots treatments in the field are depicted in fig 2 for the whole period 2015 2017 along with the values corresponding to the lysimeter grown trees in 2016 black dots all the mds values were similar in winter mostly below 100 µm reflecting the effect of rainfall the relatively high soil water content and the low et pm during that period in the summer the values for the mw treatment were close to the ones measured in the lysimeters indicating that the irrigation doses of the mw treatment were appropriate and induced the required well watered conditions in the trees in the field the mds values peak at 200 250 µm at the end of the summer for the well watered mw treatment and at 300 350 µm for the deficit irrigation md treatment considering fig 1 the high vpd days during the spring corresponded to unusually high mds values in the md treatment indicating that the tree in the spring did respond to extreme atmospheric conditions when water was limited 3 1 transpiration of the trees in the lysimeters the mean daily transpiration t of the six trees grown in the lysimeters is estimated for the 2015 2016 period these estimates are depicted in fig 3 following the seasonal cycle in vpd and et pm fig 1 t values were around 2 mm d in winter and gradually increased to peak at the beginning of the summer at 6 7 mm d days with exceptional high t values 8 mm d were observed during spring in 2016 and corresponded to days of high vpd and et pm values around 10 mm d fig 4 a illustrates the correlation between t and vpd during 2015 2016 roughly this relationship seems to be linear for vpd 1 5 kpa however considering the whole range of vpd values including those where vpd 1 5 kpa a power function seems to be more appropriate dashed curve the fitted power relationship t 3 57 vpd 0 75 where t is in mm d indicates that the departure from a linear relationship between t and vpd dotted line increases with the vpd it is therefore interesting to identify more precisely what is the vpd limit above which t stops to be proportional to the vpd this is achieved by considering the r2 of the fitted linear relationship while gradually increasing the vpd range the outcome is depicted in fig 4b the r2 value of the linear fit improves until a vpd of 1 0 kpa remains approximately constant until vpd of 1 3 kpa and then gradually decreases for vpd 1 3 kpa this result indicates that under the experimental conditions processes that reduce the rate of increase of t with the vpd i e stomatal regulation are activated for vpd 1 3 kpa 3 2 the maximum trunk daily shrinkage mds the relationship between mds and vpd corresponding to the lysimeters data of 2016 is depicted in fig 5a the overall trend corresponding to the data of the whole year dotted curve indicates that mds is related roughly to the square root of the vpd mds 96 6vpd 0 47 but the relationship is weak r2 0 28 no clear trend characterizes the relationship between t and mds fig 5b and a hysteretic like behavior can be observed considering the phenological stages of the tree the sub set of the data corresponding to the period of the flowering and fruit set 1 4 30 6 is depicted by grey dots while the one corresponding to the period of fruit growth and maturation 1 7 31 10 is depicted by black dots the result is two distinct mds vpd relationships characterizing each period fig 5c grey and black dashed curves where the mds values in the summer fruit growth are roughly three times greater than the ones corresponding to the spring flowering and fruit set when the relationship between t and mds is considered fig 5d the hysteretic behavior appears to be driven by the phenological stages of the tree in accordance with intrigliolo and castel 2006b and mirás avalos et al 2016 2017 the analysis of the relationship between t and vpd fig 4a b has indicated that a reduction in t occurs at vpd 1 3 kpa this condition corresponds approximately to an mds of 50 µm for the flowering and fruit set period and to an mds of 150 µm for the fruit growth stage 3 3 the stem water potential ψstem in the field experiments fig 6 depicts the resulting relationship between ψ stem and mds a unique significant relationship characterizes the link between ψ stem and mds indicating that it can be considered as a reliable crop characteristic the relationship depicted in fig 6 is based on data collected over all the phenological stages of the crop from february until october during the three consecutive years indicating that it is stable along the year and that it could be considered to characterize the crop under the specific growth conditions this is validated by the data reported by celedón et al 2012 on avocado grown under a wet t0 and a dry t1 water regime that corresponds nicely to the unique relationship of fig 6 the ψ stem value corresponding to the mds value of 50 µm is around 0 4 mpa while the value corresponding to the mds value of 150 µm is around 0 6 mpa capitalizing on the unique ψ stem mds relationship in fig 6 it is possible to estimate the seasonal variability in the tree hydraulic conductivity and to link it to the tree phenology the hydraulic head difference that drives t is mainly represented by ψstem ψsoil fricke 2017 comparatively to ψ stem values the soil water potential values ψsoil in the well watered lysimeters are very low in absolute values therefore the hydraulic head difference could be approximated by ψstem assuming ψsoil 0 using the unique linear ψstem mds relationship in fig 6 the hydraulic head difference can be evaluated in terms of the measured mds by means of the linear relationship between the two ψstem a mds b the ratio between t and the hydraulic head difference represents the tree hydraulic conductivity per unit of length κ which can be approximated by 1 κ 0 001 t 100 ψ stem 0 001 t 100 a mds b with a 0 002 and b 0 263 and where ψstem is expressed in mpa equivalent to 100 m of water t is expressed in mm d and κ expressed in 1 d the result is depicted in fig 7 the hydraulic conductivity of the tree increases steadily and linearly during the flowering and fruit set period peaks in the early summer and then decreases gradually during the late summer and autumn towards the lowest values in winter 4 discussion considering t estimates based on lysimeter data fig 3 it appears that the reduction of t in avocado grown under semiarid conditions begins at vpd 1 3 kpa fig 4 this trend should not come as a surprise considering the known response of the stomata to high vpd in forests and crops yong et al 1997 hochberg et al 2017 this result is in agreement with the simulation outputs of pieruschka et al 2010 relating t reduction to vpd 1 0 kpa the vpd threshold for t reduction identified above corresponds approximately to an mds of 50 µm for the period of flowering and fruit set and to an mds of 150 mm for the fruit growth and maturation period the outcome is a strong hysteretic behavior when mds data are used to provide information on t as a response to tree phenology this means that mds values that are considered independently of the phenological stage of the tree cannot be used to predict estimate transpiration our data support the conclusion by puerto et al 2013 that the use of an mds baseline for tree irrigation as suggested by goldhamer and fereres 2004 for almond should be adapted to the phenological stage of the tree our results in fig 6 present a unique relationship between ψstem and daily mds independent of the irrigation regime or time of season this is the first model in avocado that can predict ψstem based on daily mds the ψ stem value corresponding to the mds value of 50 µm is around 0 40 mpa while the value corresponding to the mds value of 150 µm is around 0 60 mpa fig 6 past avocado studies also reported a substantial reduction of t for ψstem below 0 6 mpa bower et al 1977 chartzoulakis et al 2002 silber et al 2019 reported even lower values around 0 8 mpa in well watered avocado see their fig 6 blue dots these values below 0 6 mpa result from the fact that water regime is not the only factor regulating transpiration silber et al 2013 combining the hysteretic behavior of the t mds relationship and the characteristic relation between ψstem and mds one can expect a hysteretic behavior of the t ψstem relationship based on our results two ψstem thresholds that depend on tree phenology should be considered when referring to t the hysteretic nature of the t mds relationship can be linked to a seasonal increase of the tree hydraulic conductivity during the flowering and fruit set period in the spring followed by a decrease in the summer during the fruit growth and maturation stages fig 7 combining the continuous and easy to obtain data that dendrometers offer with the high correlation of mds ψstem fig 6 suggests that dendrometers could be used as an effective water stress indicator differently from studies in tomatoes and plums that showed that the mds ψstem depended on the plant age phenology intrigliolo and castel 2004 2006a 2006b gallardo et al 2006 the current findings suggest that in avocado the mds ψstem relationship is constant across treatments and time of season the mds ψstem relationship found in this study is even similar to the data collected by celedón et al 2012 implying that the relationship might be generalized for the hass cultivar the unique ψ stem mds relationship clearly indicates that mds could be a reliable indicator for monitoring the water regime in avocado trees and detect water stress events however it has been shown fig 5a b that the relationship between mds and vpd and its impact on t are strongly affected by the phenological stage of the tree therefore our results suggest that in order to better analyze dendrometer data both the phenological and vpd effects should be considered the results show that apart from the tree s water availability mds is also affected by the atmospheric conditions the increase in mds with increasing vpd fig 5a was observed by many previous studies that described a linear regression between the two goldhamer and fereres 2001 fereres and goldhamer 2003 ortuño et al 2010 velez et al 2007 egea et al 2009 our data suggest that the regression is probably logarithmic or of a power type as can be expected from the apparent regulation of t for vpd 1 3 kpa fig 4a b in support of the current findings a vpd of 1 3 kpa is equivalent to an mds of 150 µm or a ψstem of 0 6 mpa through most of the summer which are close to reported threshold values leading to reduced transpiration bower et al 1977 chartzoulakis et al 2002 adato and levinson 1988 ferreyra et al 2014 more importantly regardless of the exact nature of mds response to vpd our results highlight that mds response to vpd is highly dependent on the tree s phenological status fig 5a so what are the potential factors that could impact on the link between the phenological stage of the tree and the mds the most obvious factor is the transpiration which according to darcy s law is related to the gradient between ψ soil and ψ stem along with the seasonal increase of et pm fig 1 the transpiration increased fig 3 leading to more negative ψ stem and higher mds fig 2 having said that transpiration rates alone cannot explain the large seasonal differences in mds or the hysteretic nature of the t mds relationship fig 5b two additional plausible factors that appear in the darcy equation and are likely to present a seasonal pattern namely water viscosity and hydraulic conductivity could be considered the seasonal change in estimated hydraulic conductivity between the winter lows and the summer highs is depicted in fig 7 water viscosity is inversely related to temperature and is expected to decrease considerably between winter and summer e g from 1 14 to 0 89 mpa s when temperatures increase from 15 c to 25 c therefore the increase in water viscosity during the cooling period after summer can partly explain why mds is maintained high through september and october despite the reduction in transpiration however changes of 20 30 in water viscosity due to seasonal change in ambient temperature can only explain a small portion of the range of the changes in hydraulic conductivity fig 7 therefore it seems that hydraulic conductivity is the most probable driver for the observed hysteresis the increase in hydraulic conductivity through spring and early summer can be associated with the cambial activity and the development of new xylem that normally takes place before the fruits become the major sinks silber et al 2019 the reduction in hydraulic conductivity through autumn can be associated with aquaporins regulation under decreased temperatures murai hatano et al 2008 ahamed et al 2012 additionally biological regulators that are involved with leaf aging through summer such as aquaporin translation and secretion of tyloses in the xylem kitin et al 2010 could also act as potential down regulators but the exact mechanism is still vague regardless studies that found a reduction in hydraulic conductivity through summer in several other tree species brodribb and holbrook 2003 sorek et al 2021 reinforce our interpretation of the data and suggest that the hysteresis between mds and vpd through time could be related to the seasonal dynamics of the plant hydraulic conductivity fig 7 in conclusion dendrometers are an effective tool to continuously monitor ψ stem in avocado trees however for translating dendrometer information into tree transpiration monitoring values must be related to the phenological status of the tree declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9943,the goal of this study was to check the feasibility of the use of dendrometers to monitor water stress levels in avocado trees persea americana mill cv hass during the period of 2015 2017 this water stress was generated naturally during events of high vapor pressure deficit vpd that normally take place during the israeli spring may and late autumn september it was also generated artificially by considering two irrigation regimes one providing the crop water needs estimated using lysimeter data and one applying 75 of that amount the different water regimes and climatic conditions allowed us to investigate the impact of seasonal atmospheric changes on transpiration t and on the maximum trunk daily shrinkage mds of the trees the mds captured well the differences between the irrigation treatments showing over 100 µm increase at peak summer in response to the treatment providing 75 of the irrigation dose applied to the well watered treatment we found that t increased linearly with the daily average value of vpd up to around 1 3 kpa above which the slope of the linear relationship decreased with the increase in vpd this reduction of t induced moderate changes in mds under high vpd the relationships between mds and vpd and between mds and t depended on the season exhibiting substantially lower mds during the spring and early summer the hysteretic nature of these relationships indicates that mds values are related to tree phenology a vpd of 1 3 kpa corresponds to an mds of 50 µm in the first half of the year flowering and fruit set and to an mds of 150 µm during the second half of the year fruit growth and maturation finally we found that mds was highly correlated with the stem water potential regardless of the irrigation treatment or time of year and is therefore a reliable stress indicator in avocado trees as long as vpd and phenological stage of the tree are considered keywords avocado transpiration irrigation dendrometers maximum daily shrinkage vapor pressure deficit stem water potential 1 introduction avocado persea americana mill is grown nowadays all over the world due to its very high fruit nutritional value schaffer et al 2013 and the water requirements of this crop are under study especially in semiarid and arid areas where irrigation is crucial carr 2013 lahav et al 2013 in israel where avocado cultivation is continuously increasing the typical spring heatwaves coincide with the sensitive period of flowering and fruit set frequently leading to substantial yield loss silber et al 2019 the root system of avocado is relatively shallow and commonly more than 70 of the roots are concentrated in the upper 0 5 m of the soil lahav and whiley 2002 consequently small soil volumes are available for root exploitation and the corresponding buffer capacity of the soil may not be sufficient for meeting crop water and nutrient needs it is thus likely that small and shallow root system could temporarily fail to supply the high demands for water and nutrients during critical stages such as flowering fruit set or seed development occurring during the spring accordingly there is a growing effort to develop reliable stress indicators for avocado trees that will enable more efficient irrigation for this crop under dry conditions water use efficiency can be improved by controlling the soil water status via proper irrigation management accordingly a large body of research focused on relating the soil water potential ψ soil to avocado irrigation scheduling lahav and kalmar 1983 however ψ soil varies much less than the leaf water potential ψ leaf which is affected by highly variable meteorological factors including vpd améglio et al 1999 caldeira et al 2014a 2014b and the plant hydraulic conductance as such it is less suitable as an integrative stress indicator as a result methods based on monitoring the plant water status rather than that of the soil were developed while parameters as leaf ψleaf or stem ψstem water potentials are established as excellent irrigation indicators naor 1998 their measurement is time and labor consuming on the other hand dendrometers could provide reliable and continuous data of the tree water status in various crops and their commercial implementation is increasing de swaef et al 2015 fernández and cuevas 2010 in avocado dendrometers studies date back to schroeder and wieland 1956 and have become more common in the last decade celedón et al 2012 silber et al 2013 2019 following the development of user friendly sensors fernández and cuevas 2010 ortuño et al 2010 the major parameter derived from trunk diameter variations data for plant response monitoring is the maximum daily shrinkage mds currently before irrigation could be applied solely based on mds there is still a major knowledge gap regarding the relationship between mds values ψstem and avocado transpiration t the feasibility of mds to monitor stress under high vpd is particularly in question due to the stomatal response to high vpd observations and model simulations monteith 1995 pieruschka et al 2010 have shown that plant transpiration increased linearly with vpd at low values but turned out to be quite constant above a certain threshold around 1 0 kpa for the simulation conditions in pieruschka et al 2010 this notion is further supported by many studies that showed stomatal closure of plants under high vpd even under well watered conditions e g yong et al 1997 such stomatal regulation is likely to reduce the sensitivity of mds to high vpd in the present study we studied the potential ability of dendrometers to monitor the impact of water regime and atmospheric demand on avocado trees in the field trees grown in well watered conditions in lysimeters provided tree transpiration estimates t that were used as reference for establishing the water amounts doses in the irrigation experiments in the field the tree response was expressed in terms of mds using dendrometers and stem water potential ψstem the study presented herein considers data from three consecutive years between 2015 and 2017 and focuses on the april june sensitive and critical period for the yield and the september october period where the trees are loaded with mature fruits silber et al 2019 under the mediterranean climate both of these periods are characterized by heatwaves and days with high atmospheric demand 2 materials and methods 2 1 the experimental site the study was conducted at the acre experimental station located in the western galilee in israel 32 57 n 35 05 e 10 m above sea level the soil is grumusol containing approximately 50 clay mostly smectite oakes and thorp 1951 data on the soil properties are provided in table 1 the climate is mediterranean with mild wet winters followed by dry hot summers the rainfall season in the region is between october and may with a mean annual precipitation of 580 mm the meteorological conditions in the region during the experimental period were provided by the israeli meteorological station located at the acre experimental station at 200 m from the experimental site the daily values of rainfall solar radiation air temperature humidity and wind speed for the experimental period are computed using the hourly values provided by the meteorological station and are depicted in fig a1 in the appendix the average values over the whole experimental period for air temperature air humidity and solar radiation are 20 0 c 66 7 and 19 4 mj m2 d respectively the average annual maximum temperature is 25 0 c and the average annual minimum temperature is 17 0 c based on the meteorological measurements the vpd values were computed according to the equation vpd e sat 1 rh 100 where e sat is the saturation vapor pressure for the corresponding air temperature and rh the relative humidity the daily reference evapotranspiration was estimated following the penman monteith equation et pm allen et al 1998 the daily values are depicted in fig 1 a b for 2015 2017 the annual cycle of the mean daily vpd values fig 1a fluctuates between 0 2 kpa in winter and 1 5 kpa in the summer accordingly the mean daily et pm values fig 1b fluctuate between 1 mm d in winter and 6 5 mm d in the summer the spring period highlighted in grey is characterized by exceptional days with high vpd values up to 3 5 kpa and corresponding high et pm values up to 10 mm d flowering and fruit set occur during the spring and could be affected by these days with extreme atmospheric conditions 2 2 the experimental design the experiment was conducted on 10 years old hass avocado trees grafted on degania 117 a west indian avocado rootstock and grown a in six 1 m3 above ground plastic containers lysimeters in 2015 and 2016 b in the field between 2015 and 2017 the density of the trees in the lysimeters was similar to that in the field 4 m between trees in the row 6 m between rows to ensure a similar exposition to solar radiation perlite was chosen as the growth medium in the lysimeters because of its low air entry suction and good drainage qualities the irrigation system in the lysimeters consisted of a loop of 13 2 3 l h pressure compensated drippers netafim inc israel installed around each trunk a high frequency pulsed irrigation 10 20 min every 30 min was applied using an irrigation controller to establish quasi steady state conditions inducing a constant water content into the perlite a leaching fraction above 0 4 ratio of drainage and irrigation amounts was applied to maintain the electrical conductivity of the draining solution below 1 5 ds m and prevent salt stress the lysimeters were covered with a black plastic sheet to prevent soil surface evaporation dry leaves covered the plastic sheet and protected it from heating due to direct solar radiation the gravitational drainage from the six lysimeters was collected in 0 1 m3 containers that were placed on a weight recording scale bh200 shekel electronic scales israel the weight of the collected drainage volume was recorded every 10 min a practically constant daily drainage rate was measured allowing to assume that the mean daily soil water content was constant in the lysimeters consequently the daily transpiration of each tree t was calculated as the difference between the applied irrigation volume and the cumulative drainage volume for each day the dynamics of the measured mean drainage for the 6 lysimeters during daylight is illustrated in fig a2 upper plot for one day in 2016 july 15th indicating a low variability in the drainage rates from each lysimeter error bars and a practically constant drainage rate during most of the day the corresponding estimated mean transpiration for that day is also illustrated in fig a2 lower plot the tree size leaf area index and fruit yield of the lysimeter grown trees were very close to those of the well irrigated trees grown in the field mean tree height between 3 5 and 4 0 m mean yield of 65 kg tree therefore the estimated t of the trees grown in the lysimeters provided a good approximation to the reference water demand for the irrigation of the trees in the field experiment assuming that evaporation from the drip irrigated field is very low drip lines under a shadow practically no wind below canopy most of the soil surface is dry and covered by litter kool et al 2014 tree density in the field was 417 trees per hectare the distance between rows was 6 m and that between trees within rows 4 m each experimental plot comprised 18 trees 3 rows with 6 trees per row the external rows were considered as buffer rows the experimental field design comprised four irrigation treatments that are described in detail in silber et al 2019 five experimental plots were allocated to each treatment providing data with five replicates in this study we focused on two irrigation treatments mw and md i mw a well watered treatment where trees were irrigated every two days during the whole year including during winter and spring according to the actual transpiration estimated in the lysimeters ii md a deficit irrigation treatment were 75 of the irrigation dose in the well watered treatment described above mw was applied every two days during the whole year including during winter and spring the irrigation system in the field consisted of two lines of drippers located 20 cm on each side of the trunk 1 6 l h pressure compensated drippers netafim inc israel the distance between drippers was 40 cm corresponding to a water application rate of 1 33 mm h the cumulative irrigation applied in the well watered treatments mw was 811 1020 and 990 mm in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively all the horticultural treatments pruning pest and weeds control were performed uniformly in both treatments according to the recommendations of the israeli extension service noy 2006 more details can be found in silber et al 2018 2019 2 3 measurements linear variable displacement transducer lvdt dendrometers phytech ltd rosh ha ayin israel were installed on the trunk of the six trees in the lysimeters and on five trees for each irrigation treatment in the field data were recorded every 1 min and the corresponding maximum daily shrinkage mds was calculated for each day for each tree by computing the difference between the maximum and the minimum recorded displacement values the dynamics of the measured mean trunk displacement for the six trees grown in the lysimeters during daylight along with the corresponding estimated transpiration for july 15th in 2016 is illustrated in fig a2 lower plot the error bars indicate that the variability between trees was low fig a2 shows that lvdt responds very quickly at the beginning of transpiration in the tree early in the morning the annual dynamics of the mean mds for 2016 in the trees in the field and in the lysimeters are shown in fig a3 to illustrate the impact of the different water regimes and the variability in the measurements between replicates in the study two sub sets of the data of the whole year that are related to the phenological stages of the tree were considered the period of the flowering and fruit set 1 4 30 6 and the period of fruit growth and maturation 1 7 31 10 stem water potential ψ stem of the trees equipped with the dendrometers was measured at midday 13 00 from february to may every week and from june to september every two weeks two shaded shoot ends of 5 7 leaves per tree from the inner part of the canopy were inserted while intact to zip loc plastic bags covered by aluminum foil for 90 min before measurements were taken the leaves were then cut and measured with a pressure chamber pms 1000 pms albany or while still covered with a bag specific attention was given to the data corresponding to the phenological stages of the avocado tree the april june period of flowering and fruit set found to be critical for the yield and the july october period corresponding to fruit growth and maturation the mean measured ψ stem values for the five replicates in the two irrigation treatments during 2016 are depicted in fig a4 along with the reference evaporation the values responded to the high atmospheric demand in the spring and were significantly different between the two treatments during summer and autumn all data were analyzed for the effects of treatments by means of the general linear model procedure of sas sas institute cary nc usa differences among means were tested with the standard least squares mode of anova differences with a probability larger than 95 were considered significant 3 results the calculated mean mds values based on the dendrometers data from the six trees for the well watered mw blue dots and the deficit irrigated md red dots treatments in the field are depicted in fig 2 for the whole period 2015 2017 along with the values corresponding to the lysimeter grown trees in 2016 black dots all the mds values were similar in winter mostly below 100 µm reflecting the effect of rainfall the relatively high soil water content and the low et pm during that period in the summer the values for the mw treatment were close to the ones measured in the lysimeters indicating that the irrigation doses of the mw treatment were appropriate and induced the required well watered conditions in the trees in the field the mds values peak at 200 250 µm at the end of the summer for the well watered mw treatment and at 300 350 µm for the deficit irrigation md treatment considering fig 1 the high vpd days during the spring corresponded to unusually high mds values in the md treatment indicating that the tree in the spring did respond to extreme atmospheric conditions when water was limited 3 1 transpiration of the trees in the lysimeters the mean daily transpiration t of the six trees grown in the lysimeters is estimated for the 2015 2016 period these estimates are depicted in fig 3 following the seasonal cycle in vpd and et pm fig 1 t values were around 2 mm d in winter and gradually increased to peak at the beginning of the summer at 6 7 mm d days with exceptional high t values 8 mm d were observed during spring in 2016 and corresponded to days of high vpd and et pm values around 10 mm d fig 4 a illustrates the correlation between t and vpd during 2015 2016 roughly this relationship seems to be linear for vpd 1 5 kpa however considering the whole range of vpd values including those where vpd 1 5 kpa a power function seems to be more appropriate dashed curve the fitted power relationship t 3 57 vpd 0 75 where t is in mm d indicates that the departure from a linear relationship between t and vpd dotted line increases with the vpd it is therefore interesting to identify more precisely what is the vpd limit above which t stops to be proportional to the vpd this is achieved by considering the r2 of the fitted linear relationship while gradually increasing the vpd range the outcome is depicted in fig 4b the r2 value of the linear fit improves until a vpd of 1 0 kpa remains approximately constant until vpd of 1 3 kpa and then gradually decreases for vpd 1 3 kpa this result indicates that under the experimental conditions processes that reduce the rate of increase of t with the vpd i e stomatal regulation are activated for vpd 1 3 kpa 3 2 the maximum trunk daily shrinkage mds the relationship between mds and vpd corresponding to the lysimeters data of 2016 is depicted in fig 5a the overall trend corresponding to the data of the whole year dotted curve indicates that mds is related roughly to the square root of the vpd mds 96 6vpd 0 47 but the relationship is weak r2 0 28 no clear trend characterizes the relationship between t and mds fig 5b and a hysteretic like behavior can be observed considering the phenological stages of the tree the sub set of the data corresponding to the period of the flowering and fruit set 1 4 30 6 is depicted by grey dots while the one corresponding to the period of fruit growth and maturation 1 7 31 10 is depicted by black dots the result is two distinct mds vpd relationships characterizing each period fig 5c grey and black dashed curves where the mds values in the summer fruit growth are roughly three times greater than the ones corresponding to the spring flowering and fruit set when the relationship between t and mds is considered fig 5d the hysteretic behavior appears to be driven by the phenological stages of the tree in accordance with intrigliolo and castel 2006b and mirás avalos et al 2016 2017 the analysis of the relationship between t and vpd fig 4a b has indicated that a reduction in t occurs at vpd 1 3 kpa this condition corresponds approximately to an mds of 50 µm for the flowering and fruit set period and to an mds of 150 µm for the fruit growth stage 3 3 the stem water potential ψstem in the field experiments fig 6 depicts the resulting relationship between ψ stem and mds a unique significant relationship characterizes the link between ψ stem and mds indicating that it can be considered as a reliable crop characteristic the relationship depicted in fig 6 is based on data collected over all the phenological stages of the crop from february until october during the three consecutive years indicating that it is stable along the year and that it could be considered to characterize the crop under the specific growth conditions this is validated by the data reported by celedón et al 2012 on avocado grown under a wet t0 and a dry t1 water regime that corresponds nicely to the unique relationship of fig 6 the ψ stem value corresponding to the mds value of 50 µm is around 0 4 mpa while the value corresponding to the mds value of 150 µm is around 0 6 mpa capitalizing on the unique ψ stem mds relationship in fig 6 it is possible to estimate the seasonal variability in the tree hydraulic conductivity and to link it to the tree phenology the hydraulic head difference that drives t is mainly represented by ψstem ψsoil fricke 2017 comparatively to ψ stem values the soil water potential values ψsoil in the well watered lysimeters are very low in absolute values therefore the hydraulic head difference could be approximated by ψstem assuming ψsoil 0 using the unique linear ψstem mds relationship in fig 6 the hydraulic head difference can be evaluated in terms of the measured mds by means of the linear relationship between the two ψstem a mds b the ratio between t and the hydraulic head difference represents the tree hydraulic conductivity per unit of length κ which can be approximated by 1 κ 0 001 t 100 ψ stem 0 001 t 100 a mds b with a 0 002 and b 0 263 and where ψstem is expressed in mpa equivalent to 100 m of water t is expressed in mm d and κ expressed in 1 d the result is depicted in fig 7 the hydraulic conductivity of the tree increases steadily and linearly during the flowering and fruit set period peaks in the early summer and then decreases gradually during the late summer and autumn towards the lowest values in winter 4 discussion considering t estimates based on lysimeter data fig 3 it appears that the reduction of t in avocado grown under semiarid conditions begins at vpd 1 3 kpa fig 4 this trend should not come as a surprise considering the known response of the stomata to high vpd in forests and crops yong et al 1997 hochberg et al 2017 this result is in agreement with the simulation outputs of pieruschka et al 2010 relating t reduction to vpd 1 0 kpa the vpd threshold for t reduction identified above corresponds approximately to an mds of 50 µm for the period of flowering and fruit set and to an mds of 150 mm for the fruit growth and maturation period the outcome is a strong hysteretic behavior when mds data are used to provide information on t as a response to tree phenology this means that mds values that are considered independently of the phenological stage of the tree cannot be used to predict estimate transpiration our data support the conclusion by puerto et al 2013 that the use of an mds baseline for tree irrigation as suggested by goldhamer and fereres 2004 for almond should be adapted to the phenological stage of the tree our results in fig 6 present a unique relationship between ψstem and daily mds independent of the irrigation regime or time of season this is the first model in avocado that can predict ψstem based on daily mds the ψ stem value corresponding to the mds value of 50 µm is around 0 40 mpa while the value corresponding to the mds value of 150 µm is around 0 60 mpa fig 6 past avocado studies also reported a substantial reduction of t for ψstem below 0 6 mpa bower et al 1977 chartzoulakis et al 2002 silber et al 2019 reported even lower values around 0 8 mpa in well watered avocado see their fig 6 blue dots these values below 0 6 mpa result from the fact that water regime is not the only factor regulating transpiration silber et al 2013 combining the hysteretic behavior of the t mds relationship and the characteristic relation between ψstem and mds one can expect a hysteretic behavior of the t ψstem relationship based on our results two ψstem thresholds that depend on tree phenology should be considered when referring to t the hysteretic nature of the t mds relationship can be linked to a seasonal increase of the tree hydraulic conductivity during the flowering and fruit set period in the spring followed by a decrease in the summer during the fruit growth and maturation stages fig 7 combining the continuous and easy to obtain data that dendrometers offer with the high correlation of mds ψstem fig 6 suggests that dendrometers could be used as an effective water stress indicator differently from studies in tomatoes and plums that showed that the mds ψstem depended on the plant age phenology intrigliolo and castel 2004 2006a 2006b gallardo et al 2006 the current findings suggest that in avocado the mds ψstem relationship is constant across treatments and time of season the mds ψstem relationship found in this study is even similar to the data collected by celedón et al 2012 implying that the relationship might be generalized for the hass cultivar the unique ψ stem mds relationship clearly indicates that mds could be a reliable indicator for monitoring the water regime in avocado trees and detect water stress events however it has been shown fig 5a b that the relationship between mds and vpd and its impact on t are strongly affected by the phenological stage of the tree therefore our results suggest that in order to better analyze dendrometer data both the phenological and vpd effects should be considered the results show that apart from the tree s water availability mds is also affected by the atmospheric conditions the increase in mds with increasing vpd fig 5a was observed by many previous studies that described a linear regression between the two goldhamer and fereres 2001 fereres and goldhamer 2003 ortuño et al 2010 velez et al 2007 egea et al 2009 our data suggest that the regression is probably logarithmic or of a power type as can be expected from the apparent regulation of t for vpd 1 3 kpa fig 4a b in support of the current findings a vpd of 1 3 kpa is equivalent to an mds of 150 µm or a ψstem of 0 6 mpa through most of the summer which are close to reported threshold values leading to reduced transpiration bower et al 1977 chartzoulakis et al 2002 adato and levinson 1988 ferreyra et al 2014 more importantly regardless of the exact nature of mds response to vpd our results highlight that mds response to vpd is highly dependent on the tree s phenological status fig 5a so what are the potential factors that could impact on the link between the phenological stage of the tree and the mds the most obvious factor is the transpiration which according to darcy s law is related to the gradient between ψ soil and ψ stem along with the seasonal increase of et pm fig 1 the transpiration increased fig 3 leading to more negative ψ stem and higher mds fig 2 having said that transpiration rates alone cannot explain the large seasonal differences in mds or the hysteretic nature of the t mds relationship fig 5b two additional plausible factors that appear in the darcy equation and are likely to present a seasonal pattern namely water viscosity and hydraulic conductivity could be considered the seasonal change in estimated hydraulic conductivity between the winter lows and the summer highs is depicted in fig 7 water viscosity is inversely related to temperature and is expected to decrease considerably between winter and summer e g from 1 14 to 0 89 mpa s when temperatures increase from 15 c to 25 c therefore the increase in water viscosity during the cooling period after summer can partly explain why mds is maintained high through september and october despite the reduction in transpiration however changes of 20 30 in water viscosity due to seasonal change in ambient temperature can only explain a small portion of the range of the changes in hydraulic conductivity fig 7 therefore it seems that hydraulic conductivity is the most probable driver for the observed hysteresis the increase in hydraulic conductivity through spring and early summer can be associated with the cambial activity and the development of new xylem that normally takes place before the fruits become the major sinks silber et al 2019 the reduction in hydraulic conductivity through autumn can be associated with aquaporins regulation under decreased temperatures murai hatano et al 2008 ahamed et al 2012 additionally biological regulators that are involved with leaf aging through summer such as aquaporin translation and secretion of tyloses in the xylem kitin et al 2010 could also act as potential down regulators but the exact mechanism is still vague regardless studies that found a reduction in hydraulic conductivity through summer in several other tree species brodribb and holbrook 2003 sorek et al 2021 reinforce our interpretation of the data and suggest that the hysteresis between mds and vpd through time could be related to the seasonal dynamics of the plant hydraulic conductivity fig 7 in conclusion dendrometers are an effective tool to continuously monitor ψ stem in avocado trees however for translating dendrometer information into tree transpiration monitoring values must be related to the phenological status of the tree declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9944,improving on field farmers management skills is imperative for an economically and environmentally sustainable irrigated agriculture in semi arid areas where the quality of the irrigation return flow irf is mainly affected by excessive fertilization and surplus irrigation water the swat model is used worldwide for environmental impact assessment however previous versions were unable to simulate appropriately the hydrological processes in irrigated areas the objectives of this study were to assess the change preformed in swat2018 manual irrigation algorithms and to evaluate the impact of the optimum irrigation and nitrogen management practices on crop yield irrigation return flows and nitrate load in del reguero watershed spain after model calibration and validation the

results indicated very good nse 0 83 and pbias 4 7 and satisfactory to very good nse 0 64 and pbias 9 36 performance respectively scenarios assessment showed that combined recommended n fertilization and optimum irrigation were advantageous both for the environment and farmers benefits rather than individual scenarios for reaching maximum reduction in no3 n loads 52 with better net incomes for farmers 27 yield increase and 26 less n fertilizers inputs and irrigation water saving 21 which leads to savings in energy costs on the one hand this study allowed for building a more reliable and

introduction nowadays agriculture faces multiple crucial challenges feeding the growing world population that could reach 9 6 billion by 2050 according to a united nations report un 2019 means doubling the production of crops to supply the world demand this in turn is driving agricultural expansion and intensification along with an increase in water demand and fertilizers application irrigation is essential for crop production to overcome deficiencies in rainfall and to stabilize agricultural production especially in arid and semi arid areas in fact in such irrigated systems water is considered not only as a limited resource but also as a production factor and a relevant economic input dechmi et al 2012 to the contrary as nitrogen n is one of the most limiting nutrients for agricultural production farmers tend to over use this nutrient which has led under the requirement of nitrates directive eu 1991 to the declaration of areas vulnerable to nitrate pollution in the different zones in europe and to the regulation of n fertilizers application in these areas through codes of good agricultural practices irrigated agriculture often induces a water use efficiency below the expected levels wallace 2000 dechmi et al 2003 isidoro et al 2004 lecina et al 2005 malik et al 2019 even with the most efficient irrigation systems losses can become significant when the system is not well designed or managed levidow et al 2014 in the case of sprinkler irrigation water losses are induced by i evaporation and wind drift ewd outside the target area with no benefit to the crop ii deep percolation and in the case of a steep slope iii surface runoff percolation and runoff problems can be reduced by controlling the applied doses according to the soil retention capacity and the infiltration rate previous works presented water application efficiency values ratio of water used by the crop to water delivered to the field within the range 60 90 for sprinkler systems solomon 1988 rogers et al 1997 clemmens 2000 for high temperature low humidity and strong wind conditions a range from 60 to 70 should be used for low temperature high humidity and light wind conditions a range from 80 to 90 should be used however critical information needed to perform an appropriate irrigation scheduling based on real crop evapotranspiration etr is lacking in irrigated systems the considerable investments required for field based studies has led to the development and use of crop and hydrologic models for evaluating different agricultural management strategies however these models require adequate calibration and testing against measured field data to not only validate the model performance but also to reinforce user confidence in the model results and their application in recent years the application of simulation models is increasingly becoming the best alternative to assess crop yield and soil water balance wang et al 2015 cai et al 2009 dechmi et al 2003 water resources management mysiak et al 2005 victoria et al 2005 climate change impact wallace et al 2017 wilby et al 2006 and best management practices bmp performance in reducing water nutrients and other agrichemicals in irrigation return flows briak et al 2019 qiu et al 2019 dechmi and skhiri 2013 models are also used to extrapolate results from short term field trials over periods of many years malik et al 2019 the swat model arnold et al 1998 is one of the most widely used water quality watershed and river basin scale models worldwide regarding agricultural ecosystems most of swat model applications were based on streamflow or and nutrients calibration while the calibration of crop yield not often is taken into account in swat studies however a correct prediction of crop biomass and yield can reduce the uncertainty of hydrological processes and nutrient balance predictions nair et al 2011 wei et al 2018a 2018b provided a short review of swat model applications to manage irrigated watersheds and pointed to the need of additional research to enhance swat s capability in intensively irrigated watersheds in fact some studies reported that the swat irrigation function was unable to represent appropriately the hydrological processes in irrigated areas chen et al 2018 gives a summary of some further studies about the swat model auto irrigation function deficiency chen et al 2017 indicated that although the model provided reasonable estimates for etr the auto irrigation function over irrigated crops as compared to actual practiced irrigation levels in addition marek et al 2017 pointed out that when the soil water content method was used irrigation events were not suspended even after crop harvest consequently chen et al 2018 developed new and representative management allowed depletion mad auto irrigation algorithms wei et al 2018a compared auto irrigation routines with actual applied irrigation depths based on canal diversion data and found that there was no difference in the model results on the other hand uniyal et al 2019 and chen et al 2019 pointed out that the simulated irrigation was higher when irrigation was triggered by soil water deficit than when triggered by plant water stress regarding the manual irrigation function swat2005 version was used for the first time in del reguero watershed drw located in one of the most important intensive irrigated areas in spain dechmi et al 2012 this version did not reproduce correctly the irrigation return flow generated under intensive sprinkler irrigation if the amount of water specified in irrigation operation exceeds the amount of water needed to fill the soil layers up to field capacity the excess water is returned to the source neitsch et al 2005 dechmi et al 2012 and therefore not considered in the daily soil water balance calculation consequently swat2005 version was modified swat irrig for correctly simulating the main hydrological processes in intensively irrigation watersheds dechmi et al 2012 concerning the swat2012 version wei et al 2018a 2018b also provided swat with the necessary enhancements for application in intensively irrigated stream aquifer systems by including irrigation earthen canals seepage into the swat source code the objectives of this study were i to assess the change preformed in swat source code from swat2005 version to swat2018 rev670 in terms of manual irrigation algorithms considering the drw study area already modeled by dechmi et al 2012 and ii to calibrate and validate crop yield daily and monthly streamflow and nitrate load in drw in order to evaluate the impact of both optimum irrigation and recommended n management practices on yield and irrigation return flows water quality 2 methods 2 1 model description the swat model is a public domain time continuous spatially semi distributed physically based model arnold et al 1998 the model operates on a daily time step at river watershed basin scale and integrates all relevant eco hydrological processes including surface and ground water flow vegetation growth and land use water and nutrient management the watershed basin is divided into sub basins which are then further subdivided into areas with unique topographic soil and land use characteristics called hydrologic response units hrus the hrus are the spatial units where the vertical flows of water and nutrients are calculated five different pools of n in soil are simulated two mineral forms of n ammonium and nitrate and three organic forms of n active organic n stable organic associated with humic substances and fresh organic n associated with crop residues the n losses from each hru take place through crop uptake surface runoff lateral flow percolation and erosion the in stream transformation of n is governed by algae growth and decay water temperature biological oxidation rate for conversion of different n species and settling of organic n with sediment further details of the water balance soil erosion and nutrient process equations can be found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 in the swat model interface and in the case of irrigated areas the user can choose to perform the irrigation scheduling either under auto irrigation or under manual options when manual irrigation is chosen the user introduces the actual irrigation scheduling date and irrigation depth of each farmer s irrigation event for each hru via the management operation option of the swat interface the water irrigation sources are five from stream reach reservoir shallow aquifer deep aquifer and outside the watershed unlimited source there are several versions of swat integrated with arcgis arcswat arcswat is an open fortran source code that integrates in total 305 subroutines the main subroutines that control the irrigation performance for the water balance calculation at hru scale are percmain the master soil percolation component autoirr performs the auto irrigation operation irrsub this algorithm performs the irrigation operation when the irrigation source is the shallow or deep aquifer or a source outside the watershed irri rch performs the irrigation operation when the water source is a stream reach irri res performs the irrigation operation when the water source is a reservoir irrigate applies irrigation water to the hru subbassin controls the simulation of the land phase of the hydrologic cycle for example the subbasin subroutine gives instructions to perform the management operation and soil water routine and to compute the effective rainfall evapotranspiration or crop growth 2 2 study area and model input data for basic setup in the present study the swat2018 rev670 in the arcgis version 10 3 environment was applied for building the hydrological model of the drw 1865 ha 41 54 n and 00 06 w using the same data and simulation period considered in dechmi et al 2012 the del reguero stream is a tributary to the alcanadre river located in the left bank of the middle ebro river basin in spain fig 1 the irrigated area of the watershed 1355 ha is an intensively cultivated sprinkler irrigated system in which corn 41 both long and short season varieties alfalfa 15 and winter cereal 19 were the predominant crops during the study period the mainly rainfed crop was barley 19 of the total watershed area the irrigated area is part of the alconadre irrigation district included in the alto aragon irrigation system the largest irrigated area in the middle ebro river valley around 130 000 ha the climate is semi arid with a mean annual precipitation of 391 mm and a mean annual reference evapotranspiration of 1294 mm penman monteith three different types of soils can be found in drw 1 terrace soils which represent 39 of the total area characterized by shallow depth 0 6 m on average presence of a sub surface calcareous horizon and high content of stones 2 shallow alluvial soils 50 of the area mostly stone free and with soil depth varying from 0 6 m to 0 9 m and 3 deep alluvial soils 11 of the area similar to the precedent but with soil depths ranging from 0 9 to 1 2 m a more detailed characterization of the study area can be found in skhiri and dechmi 2012 the nitrate concentrations in the outlet of the watershed were very high 113 mg no3 l 1 in the average for 2008 09 and higher than the european limit for nitrate concentrations in waters intended for human consumption of 50 mg l 1 eu 1998 currently the drw is designated as a nitrate vulnerable zone gobierno de aragón 2019 and therefore it is necessary to establish codes of good agricultural practices in this zone for delineating the basin into sub basins 9 and hrus 239 the same digital elevation model dem of the ebro river basin 20 20 m grid size soil and a land use land cover lulc maps considered in swat2005 version dechmi et al 2012 were used in this study the land use and soil data were obtained from the special crop and soil distribution maps elaborated during the study years through field surveys the daily meteorological records for the study years were obtained from the huerto meteorological station located close to the watershed 41 56 n and 00 08 w the alconadre irrigation district collective irrigation network provided the irrigation management data date and dose of each irrigation event applied in each soil type and crop the farmers management data for each crop tillage operations planting and harvest dates type and amounts of organic and inorganic fertilizers applied dates of fertilizers application and crop yields obtained were also the same as those used by dechmi et al 2012 daily water flow and nitrate concentration at the watershed outlet were measured from january 15th 2008 to december 31st 2009 daily no3 n loads were calculated by multiplying streamflow and nitrate concentration 2 3 swat2018 vs swat2005 both swat20018 and swat2005 source codes of the irrigation related subroutines have been compared to identify the modifications introduced by the model s developer group in the last swat version the subroutines that presented differences between both source code model versions are percmain and irrigate in the percmain subroutine both algorithms presented the following difference swat 2005 version sepday inflpcp swat 2018 version sepday inflpcp aird j pot seep j where sepday corresponds to the micropore percolation from soil layer inflpcp is the amount of precipitation that infiltrates into soil aird j corresponds to the amount of irrigation water applied to the hru and pot seep j refers to infiltration from pot and seep not considered in this study the irrigation dose specified in the irrigation operation was added in the soil percolation depth calculation of swat2018 version this modification is considered correct because irrigation is the most important input variable to the irrigated system and therefore cannot be ignored in the soil water percolation calculation as does the swat2005 version in the irrigate subroutine that applies irrigation water to the hrus the following differences were noted swat 2005 version yy sol st k jj stx volmm volmm yy aird jj aird jj yy swat 2018 version aird jj volmm 1 sq rto where aird is the amount of water applied to the hru on the current day volmm is the depth of irrigation water applied to the hru sol st is the amount of water stored in the soil layer on any given day stx is the amount of water stored in soil layer on the current day and sq rto is the fraction of total applied irrigation that is lost as runoff this subroutine is corrected however only the irrigation fraction lost as runoff is removed from the total irrigation depth applied to each hru when irrigation is targeted and the irrigation application efficiency losses are not considered in the net irrigation depth calculation in addition those irrigation loses could be more important in sprinkler irrigation systems under hot and semi arid climate because of evaporation and wind drift losses so the incorporation of the irrigation application efficiency in the net irrigation dose calculation in each hru is necessary to make the swat model more suitable for intensive irrigation systems watersheds after this analysis modification was incorporated in irrigate and irrsub subroutines to enhance swat application in intensively irrigated systems the packages notepad and msys64 were used to modify and compile the swat source code 2 4 swat calibration and validation the swat2018 improved version was run considering the manual irrigation and water source outside the watershed options for the model calibration and validation in drw as the processes affecting the water and nutrient balance in agricultural watersheds are highly influenced by crop growth evapotranspiration and n uptake the model was run first to calibrate and validate the swat improved version crop model this was followed by daily and monthly streamflow and nitrate load calibration and validation for both evaluation processes simulations were performed from january 1st 2007 to december 31st 2009 the period from january 1st 2007 to january 14th 2008 served as the warm up period while the data from january 15th 2008 to december 31st 2008 were used for the calibration and the remaining data for validation from january 1st 2009 to december 31st 2009 crop yield and streamflow parameters were calibrated manually tables 1 and 2 while the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 of swat cup software abbaspour 2015 was used for automatic no3 n load calibration during the crop yield calibration only the crop parameters included in land cover plant growth swat database were adjusted for the rest of model parameters default values were taken first the seven crop parameters adjusted by dechmi et al 2012 to calibrate crop yields in the study area were considered biomass energy ratio harvest index maximum leaf area index optimum air temperature base temperature maximum root depth and light extinction factor in addition other related crop nutrient uptake parameters were considered in this first step of model calibration to accurately estimate nitrogen loads table 1 for each representative crop in the study area the observed crop yield mg ha 1 was compared with the simulated crop yield parameter yld mg ha 1 in the swat standard output file output std in addition the simulated etr for each crop represented by the parameter et in the standard output file was compared with the etr calculated for the corresponding period by dechmi et al 2012 the calculated etr s were used for a simple comparison with those simulated by swat2018 once crop growth and yield were adequately simulated the streamflow and no3 n load were parameterized considering the variables presented in table 2 in addition to the scs runoff curve number parameter table 1 the parameters choice was based on previous work performed in the same study area for streamflow dechmi et al 2012 and on the sensitivity analysis implemented by changing parameters values one at a time to determine their impact on nitrate load the sensitive parameters with a p value 0 05 after one iteration consisting of 1000 simulations were used for no3 n load calibration table 2 the no3 n load sensitivity analysis was performed for the period from january 15th 2008 to december 31st 2008 using swat cup software swat cup 2012 version 5 1 6 however after obtaining good fit between observed and simulated daily streamflow additional parameters were considered using the swat cup platform to improve the manual streamflow calibration results in this step only the parameters sol awc available water capacity sol k saturated hydraulic conductivity sol bd bulk density and rock rock fragment content of the different soils and layers were considered table 3 the five statistical criteria considered to quantify how well the model matches the target data were 1 the coefficient of determination r2 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 the root mean square error rmse 4 the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and 5 the rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2015 the calibration objectives for streamflow and nitrate load were to maximize nse and r2 and to minimize the absolute value of pbias rmse and rsr based on the guidelines proposed by moriasi and et al 2007 2015 the model performance can be evaluated as satisfactory if nse 0 5 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 for streamflow and no3 n load 2 5 management practices assessment the management practices proposed in this study were those directly related to irrigation and n fertilization it is important that their application does not require significant changes in farmers management practices for a better acceptance and adoption by farmers to this end three scenarios were tested and compared with the simulated current situation current scenario 1 optimum irrigation and current n fertilization scenario i opti 2 optimum n fertilization recommended and current irrigation practices scenario nf opti and 3 combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization scenarios i nf opti the swat model was run for the three hydrological years used in the calibration and validation processes the considered scenarios were determined and applied for the main irrigated and non irrigated crops corn long season corn ls corn short season corn ss barley sunflower long season sun ls sunflower short season sun ss alfalfa and rainfed barley bar ni the i opti scenario consists in using an optimum irrigation scheduling by adjusting irrigation water dose to the crop net irrigation requirement nir daily nir calculated in dechmi et al 2013 for the same year and same crops of the drw are considered in this study to perform the optimum irrigation scheduling to closely represent the actual irrigation the daily nir values were added until the day on which the sum amounted to almost 20 mm at that date the sum of the previous days nir was introduced in swat as an irrigation event regarding nf opti scenario for corn ls as well as corn ss an optimal recommended rate of 250 kg n ha 1 isla et al 2008 was split as 50 kg n ha 1 at pre planting 100 kg ha 1 for the first sidedress vegetative stage v7 8 and 100 kg n ha 1 for the second silking stage r1 in the case of barley n requirements were taken as 148 kg n ha 1 90 kg n ha 1 applied at sowing and the remaining as a sidedress at stem elongation marm 2011 for bar ni a total application of 88 kg n ha 1 was taken as optimal concerning both sunflower varieties the recommended dose in dwr is 105 kg n ha 1 50 at sowing and 50 at vegetative stage v10 marm 2011 finally for alfalfa 30 kg n ha 1 was applied as a unique n input at sowing to favor the establishment in the pre nodulation phase marm 2011 the average current optimum irrigation and n fertilization practices considered are summarized in table 4 the impact of each scenario on water quality at the watershed outlet was determined as percent change of the average annual streamflow discharge and no3 n loads after each considered management practices application in the drw the percent reduction for each scenario was calculated as follows change 100 prebmp postbmp prebmp where prebmp is the swat current scenario outputs and postbmp is the swat output after implementation of the bmp 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat2018 modification the following modifications were included in the swat2018 source code 1 subroutine irrsub change the maximum amount of water applied as an irrigation event in the irrsub subroutine to the depth of irrigation water applied to each hru as specified by the user instead of the amount of water held in the soil profile at field capacity considered in the current version as follows vmm irr amt where vmm is the maximum amount of water to be applied mm and irr amt is the depth of irrigation water applied to each hru mm as specified by the user 2 subroutine irrigate the modification consists in including the irrigation efficiency in the calculation of the irrigation depth applied in each hru as following aird jj volmm 1 sq rto irreff where irreff is the irrigation application efficiency on the other hand it should be adequate that the fraction of total applied irrigation that is lost as runoff which is very difficult to calculate variable sq rto in the source code could be estimated by the same method that swat uses for rainfall runoff in the actual swat2018 interface this variable is directly specified as an input in the irrigation management operation for each irrigation event 3 2 swat irrig2012 calibration and validation 3 2 1 crop model crop yields were calibrated and validated using observed data gathered from field surveys performed in 2008 calibration and 2009 validation fig 2 presents average crop yields simulated under swat irrig and modified swat2018 vs measured yield of alfalfa corn barley irrigated and rainfed and sunflower for the calibration and validation processes results indicate a good adjustment between simulated and observed mean crop yields in drw for both periods also results were generally better than those presented in dechmi et al 2012 using swat irrig this may be due to the additional crop parameters considered in the calibration process table 1 during the calibration period the mean simulated production for alfalfa matched the observed production 14 00 mg ha 1 on average for both calibration and validation periods the variability of the observed alfalfa yield cv 3 was lower than simulated cv 5 for corn the mean simulated production was about 11 88 mg ha 1 vs the observed mean of 11 90 mg ha 1 indicating that swat2018 slightly under estimated corn yield by almost 0 2 however the variability of the observed corn yield was higher than the variability of simulated yields 15 vs 9 respectively swat2018 also slightly under estimated the mean irrigated barley yield by 1 0 6 1 mg ha 1 vs 6 2 mg ha 1 and the simulated yield presented less variability 0 1 than the observed yield 15 on the other hand mean simulated sunflower yield was slightly higher than its mean observed yield on average the swat2018 model over estimated mean sunflower yield by 10 whereas mean rainfed barley yield was over estimated by 0 1 in regard to crop real evapotranspiration fig 3 the mean annual etr values simulated by swat2018 767 659 472 and 640 mm for respectively alfalfa corn barley and sunflower were quite similar to those calculated with the soil water balance on average the error value between simulated and calculated etr ranged from 1 3 to 12 7 the largest difference was observed in alfalfa and non irrigated barley akhavan et al 2010 found that the calibration of crop yield increases the confidence on soil moisture and evapotranspiration presenting similar conclusion samimi et al 2020 indicated that in semi arid irrigated watershed the calibration and validation of crop yield is very important to reach a more reliable representation for the main water budget components rather than only considering streamflow calibration because crop yield represents evapotranspiration as well as nutrient uptake 3 2 2 streamflow initially a trial and error calibration procedure was performed for all the streamflow parameters presented in table 2 due to the relative small size and homogenous conditions of the watershed the same parametric values were adjusted for all hrus and sub basins table 2 fig 4 shows a good agreement between daily observed and simulated data the magnitude of the main discharge peaks was captured satisfactorily except during two dates of the validation period 11 april and 9 august 2009 which clearly affected the goodness of the streamflow estimation this may be because of some spatial variability of rainfall assuming that the precipitation gauging station is located out of the drw that might have a pronounced influence on modeling results during the high precipitation events the measured low flows were simulated correctly except the period from september to december of the validation period where the model clearly overestimated stream flow what will have an impact on nitrate load prediction during this period this visual interpretation of the measured and simulated streamflow evolution is supported by the performance statistics presented in table 5 a study performed by wei et al 2021 also showed lower model accuracy to predict peak flows in an irrigated agricultural system however the accurate simulation of base flow and low flows is more important in our study because these are strongly impacted by irrigation for the calibration and validation periods the coefficient of determination calculated for daily stream discharge was 0 80 and 0 77 respectively according to moriasi et al 2015 the other statistical parameters considered indicate a very good fit of simulated values to the observed data set of the daily stream flow table 5 the negative pbias point to an overestimation of flows in both calibration and validation period table 5 although the model evaluation was good for both data sets daily or monthly stream flow the r2 nse rmse and pbias values during the calibration period were better than for the validation period for both daily streamflow and monthly discharge table 5 in addition for both monthly calibration and validation the performance statistics values without considering rmse for having different units were better than the daily ones table 5 on the other hand the results obtained for monthly stream discharge were quite similar to those presented by dechmi et al 2012 3 2 3 nitrate load the daily and monthly calibration and validation results for nitrate load at the watershed outlet are shown in table 5 and fig 5 the results were not as good as for streamflow a usual behavior frequently reported in the literature bauwe et al 2019 compared with daily measured data the simulations of no3 n load were less accurate for both calibration and validation periods than streamflow results regarding monthly results the statistics for no3 n loads were better than the daily no3 n load predictions for both calibration and validation generally simulated nitrate load followed the trend of observed values fig 5 however it is important to point out that some no3 n peaks were not captured adequately by swat in both calibration and validation processes in addition the model tended to clearly underpredict the monthly no3 n during august and october during the calibration period and to overestimate it from october to december during the validation period this explained the worse results for the validation process nse 0 64 and r2 0 74 compared to calibration nse 0 83 and r2 0 85 however the pbias was positive for calibration and negative for validation and reached very good values for both daily and monthly data sets table 5 the lower accuracy of monthly no3 n loads in the validation period was probably induced in part by the streamflow overprediction observed from september to october fig 6 in addition the use of average mineral n fertilizer amount for each crop and the inaccurate information provided by farmers regarding their manure applications dose and date could increase the uncertainty of the management input data and consequently the model nitrogen balance calculation however the performance of the swat model for describing the nitrate load was considered satisfactory and better than many other recent studies in the literature where the nse was lower than 0 4 for daily nitrate load predictions bauwe et al 2019 dakhlalla and parajuli 2019 yuan and chiang 2015 notably merriam et al 2019 haas et al 2017 and epelde et al 2015 presented similar results 3 3 management practices scenarios 3 3 1 irrigation water and n fertilization analysis for all scenarios and each crop the model was run considering the usual sowing and harvest dates in the study area the current and optimum average seasonal irrigation depth values summarized in table 4 showed that not all crop water requirements were met in the drw during the study years both corn and alfalfa were over irrigated during the growing season while barley and sunflower were under irrigated in average the optimum irrigation water represents 72 55 and 73 of the current seasonal irrigation dose applied for corn ls corn ss and alfalfa respectively this caused a decrease in the number of irrigation events for the remaining crops additional irrigation depth was added to reach their irrigation requirements 33 mm 158 mm and 33 mm for barley sunflower ls and sunflower ss respectively in total 1 67 hm3 amount of irrigation water would be saved not delivered to the system by applying the calculated optimum irrigation dose for all crops in regard to the current n fertilizers cereals are the main n fertilizer users in drw fig 6 as corn accounted for 60 and barley for 30 including both irrigated and rainfed of the total n applied averaging all years considered a total of 331 7 mg n from fertilizers were used in the drw however this total n fertilizer application would decrease by 36 if the optimum n fertilizer is considered in general the highest n input comes from mineral fertilizers that accounts for 83 of the total n fertilization this is so mainly because manure was applied only in 30 of corn barley and sunflower cultivated areas so if the number of local animal farms increases in drw additional risk to the environment will be induced when manure production exceeds the land availability and crop needs nevertheless during the study period the highest manure dose was about 143 n kg ha 1 year 1 which is less than the maximum n limit for manure 170 n kg ha 1 year 1 set out by the european nitrates directive 91 676 eec eu 1991 this limit only applies to areas identified as nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs as it is the case of the drw since 2013 gobierno de aragón 2013a regarding the n fertilizers dose per hectare applied for each crop table 4 only corn ls and alfalfa reached an average dose higher than the limits set out by aragón government gobierno de aragón 2013b in the sprinkler irrigated areas in aragon 380 n kg ha 1 for corn and 30 n kg ha 1 for alfalfa however barley and sunflower ls current doses were lower than the calculated optimum doses considered in this study table 4 3 3 2 irrigation scenarios the implementation of the optimum irrigation scenario had a highly positive impact on crop yield fig 7 results showed a yield increase of 26 5 24 2 and 33 1 for alfalfa corn ls and corn ss respectively this should have a positive impact on farmers benefits for barley and sunflower the additional irrigation water applied to meet crop water needs induced a small yield increases of only 2 4 and 2 7 for barley and sunflower ls respectively fig 7 in another intensively irrigated area in spain malik et al 2020 reported a yield increase only for corn ss 27 and alfalfa 9 when adjusted irrigation dose was applied in this case the authors estimated the optimum irrigation by adjusting the irrigation doses and timing to each considered crop requirement using the dssat model and considering a constant mad of 0 5 compared to the current scenario the optimum irrigation could reduce the annual irrigation return flow by 10 4 the nitrate load by 13 8 and the average no3 n concentration from 25 2 mg l 1 to 24 2 mg l 1 in addition the residual no3 n in soil presented a very slight increase 0 01 in lower kaidu river basin china ba et al 2020 indicated that an increase of furrow irrigation water efficiency can save irrigation water consumption by 4 8 however simulated irrigation management scenarios did not always render promising results for example ahmadzadeh et al 2016 showed that changing the surface irrigation to a pressurized system could increase water productivity up to 15 due to increases in crop yield however pressurized irrigation results in no significant change in total outflow as the drw irrigation system is pressurized the resulted irrigation water saving should lead to energy savings which could present an additional benefit for farmers as well as for the irrigated agriculture sustainability however and in agreement with results presented by malik and dechmi 2019 improving irrigation practices without optimizing n fertilization could lead to high residual n in soil at the end of the growing season susceptible to leaching during the intercrop period if precipitation occurs this could generate a risk in reducing the magnitude of the positive environmental impact of this scenario 3 3 3 nitrogen fertilization scenarios the recommended n fertilization scenario showed a strong environmental impact being better than the optimum irrigation scenario in reducing the no3 n loads and average concentration fig 8 in fact monthly simulated no3 n load under the recommended n fertilization showed a sharp decrease relative to current conditions fig 8 the recommended n fertilizer dose could reduce in average the no3 n load by 45 6 and the average no3 n concentration by 46 1 from 25 2 mg l 1 to 13 6 mg l 1 compared to the current scenario table 6 with similar crop yield for all crops considered fig 7 this showed that crop yield in the drw was more affected by irrigation management than n fertilizer management however if only recommended n fertilization was considered no3 n loads could be reduced 3 8 times more than if only optimum irrigation scenario was considered on average 60 of the total no3 n load was recorded during the irrigation season from march to september in spite of the important reduction in the residual no3 n in the soil at harvest 21 5 compared to the optimum irrigation scenario the remaining residual no3 n in soil is still important and susceptible to leaching during non cultivated period malik et al 2020 showed similar results in another sprinkler irrigated watershed spain however in lower kaidu river basin china ba et al 2020 indicated lower decrease of total n load 14 5 when fertilizers application is reduced by 20 bauwe et al 2019 also indicated that a slight decrease of n fertilization leads to significant reductions in nitrate loadings while crop yields remained on a high level the no3 n loads recorded in the drw outlet from 2015 to 2018 data no presented were higher 61 mg in average than the loads measured during the study period 51 mg in average this increase of the nitrate load during recent years indicates that agricultural practices are becoming more intensive in terms of irrigation and fertilizers use i e increase of double copping area and in situ manure production and use 3 3 4 combined optimum irrigation and n fertilizer scenarios the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilizer scenario was more efficient reducing no3 n load and no3 n concentration than the individual scenarios both variables could be reduced by 51 9 no3 n load and 47 5 no3 n concentration under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilizer scenario compared to the current scenario table 6 the average no3 n concentration decreased from 25 2 mg l 1 111 8 no3 mg l 1 to 13 3 mg l 1 58 7 no3 mg l 1 despite the important reduction in the nitrate concentration in the irf it would remain above the threshold of 50 mg l 1 eu 1991 there was also a significant reduction for the residual no3 n in soil 20 6 and for the irf 10 4 compared to the current scenario in addition crop production was positively impacted mainly for alfalfa 26 5 yield increase corn ls 20 5 and corn ss 34 1 generally the no3 n loads were lowest every month with the combined scenario but in february march may and august of 2008 there were no significant differences between no3 n load between n fertilizers scenario and combined scenario in the no3 n loads fig 8 all the tested scenarios showed differences in their environmental impact and farmers benefits however combined practices were more advantageous for environment and farmers benefits than applying any of the individual practices as they allowed for reaching maximum reduction in no3 n loads with better net incomes for farmers 25 9 less n fertilizers inputs and 27 0 yield increase along with water and energy saving the results of this work are in agreement with the findings of malik et al 2020 this work performed in other sprinkler irrigation systems showed that the combined scenario was the most efficient in terms of no3 n load reduction followed by the recommended n fertilization and the optimum irrigation management testing different best management practices bmps in the drw using the modified swat2005 swat irrig dechmi and skhiri 2013 results showed that the application of combined bmps is the most efficient scenario for reducing phosphorus losses and then improving water quality however cavero et al 2012 indicated that the optimum irrigation was more efficient than n fertilization management in surface irrigation systems where irrigation efficiency was very low finally this best scenario in reducing the no3 load and concentration is still inadequate to comply with the requirement of nitrates directive eu 1991 in the dwr because the no3 concentration remains above the threshold of 50 mg l 1 and therefore additional strategies to control nitrate leaching in dwr such as replacing winter fallow by legumes and non legumes cover crops and or using controlled release fertilizers should be considered 4 conclusions although the current version of swat2018 includes the needed modification to account for irrigation water excess in the soil water balance and water routing calculation the model performs the manual irrigation without taking into account the irrigation application efficiency in the calculation of the net irrigation dose that effectively reaches the soil during an irrigation event as the model interface already allows the user to introduce the irrigation application efficiency value a slight modification was introduced in the source code to correct this model deficiency with this modification the available water in the soil profile which directly affects crop growth water and nutrient loss estimations from each hru could be appropriately modeled after crop yield calibration the swat modified version showed very good performance considering both daily and monthly data sets in describing streamflow and discharge at the outlet of the study watershed in addition the monthly modified swat2018 performance for nitrate load measured at the outlet of the watershed was very good for the calibration period and satisfactory for the validation period the analysis of the temporal streamflow evolution during both calibration and validation processes showed that a good model performance regarding streamflow is one of the conditions for predicting nitrate losses correctly the tested practices showed differences in their environmental impact and farmers benefits results indicated that the combined bmps scenario was the most efficient scenario reducing no3 load 52 ahead of the recommended n fertilization 46 and optimum irrigation 14 although a cost benefit analysis was not carried out in this study it is quite clear that farmers net income will be improved by the important reduction in n fertilizers inputs 26 less n inputs yield increase 27 on average for alfalfa and corn and irrigation water saving 21 that could induce heavy savings in energy costs this work supports previous results evaluated in similar irrigated areas in addition the proposed scenario does not require significant change in farmers management because its application only needs to reduce and adjust irrigation fertilization inputs and therefore can be readily adopted by

9944,improving on field farmers management skills is imperative for an economically and environmentally sustainable irrigated agriculture in semi arid areas where the quality of the irrigation return flow irf is mainly affected by excessive fertilization and surplus irrigation water the swat model is used worldwide for environmental impact assessment however previous versions were unable to simulate appropriately the hydrological processes in irrigated areas the objectives of this study were to assess the change preformed in swat2018 manual irrigation algorithms and to evaluate the impact of the optimum irrigation and nitrogen management practices on crop yield irrigation return flows and nitrate load in del reguero watershed spain after model calibration and validation the irrigation algorithm in the swat2018 source code did not include the irrigation application efficiency in the net irrigation dose calculation which is very important in irrigated systems the streamflow calibration and validation resulting statistics for daily and monthly streamflow indicate a very good model performance nse 0 75 0 87 the monthly no3 n load calibration and validation results indicated very good nse 0 83 and pbias 4 7 and satisfactory to very good nse 0 64 and pbias 9 36 performance respectively scenarios assessment showed that combined recommended n fertilization and optimum irrigation were advantageous both for the environment and farmers benefits rather than individual scenarios for reaching maximum reduction in no3 n loads 52 with better net incomes for farmers 27 yield increase and 26 less n fertilizers inputs and irrigation water saving 21 which leads to savings in energy costs on the one hand this study allowed for building a more reliable and

introduction nowadays agriculture faces multiple crucial challenges feeding the growing world population that could reach 9 6 billion by 2050 according to a united nations report un 2019 means doubling the production of crops to supply the world demand this in turn is driving agricultural expansion and intensification along with an increase in water demand and fertilizers application irrigation is essential for crop production to overcome deficiencies in rainfall and to stabilize agricultural production especially in arid and semi arid areas in fact in such irrigated systems water is considered not only as a limited resource but also as a production factor and a relevant economic input dechmi et al 2012 to the contrary as nitrogen n is one of the most limiting nutrients for agricultural production farmers tend to over use this nutrient which has led under the requirement of nitrates directive eu 1991 to the declaration of areas vulnerable to nitrate pollution in the different zones in europe and to the regulation of n fertilizers application in these areas through codes of good agricultural practices irrigated agriculture often induces a water use efficiency below the expected levels wallace 2000 dechmi et al 2003 isidoro et al 2004 lecina et al 2005 malik et al 2019 even with the most efficient irrigation systems losses can become significant when the system is not well designed or managed levidow et al 2014 in the case of sprinkler irrigation water losses are induced by i evaporation and wind drift ewd outside the target area with no benefit to the crop ii deep percolation and in the case of a steep slope iii surface runoff percolation and runoff problems can be reduced by controlling the applied doses according to the soil retention capacity and the infiltration rate previous works presented water application efficiency values ratio of water used by the crop to water delivered to the field within the range 60 90 for sprinkler systems solomon 1988 rogers et al 1997 clemmens 2000 for high temperature low humidity and strong wind conditions a range from 60 to 70 should be used for low temperature high humidity and light wind conditions a range from 80 to 90 should be used however critical information needed to perform an appropriate irrigation scheduling based on real crop evapotranspiration etr is lacking in irrigated systems the considerable investments required for field based studies has led to the development and use of crop and hydrologic models for evaluating different agricultural management strategies however these models require adequate calibration and testing against measured field data to not only validate the model performance but also to reinforce user confidence in the model results and their application in recent years the application of simulation models is increasingly becoming the best alternative to assess crop yield and soil water balance wang et al 2015 cai et al 2009 dechmi et al 2003 water resources management mysiak et al 2005 victoria et al 2005 climate change impact wallace et al 2017 wilby et al 2006 and best management practices bmp performance in reducing water nutrients and other agrichemicals in irrigation return flows briak et al 2019 qiu et al 2019 dechmi and skhiri 2013 models are also used to extrapolate results from short term field trials over periods of many years malik et al 2019 the swat model arnold et al 1998 is one of the most widely used water quality watershed and river basin scale models worldwide regarding agricultural ecosystems most of swat model applications were based on streamflow or and nutrients calibration while the calibration of crop yield not often is taken into account in swat studies however a correct prediction of crop biomass and yield can reduce the uncertainty of hydrological processes and nutrient balance predictions nair et al 2011 wei et al 2018a 2018b provided a short review of swat model applications to manage irrigated watersheds and pointed to the need of additional research to enhance swat s capability in intensively irrigated watersheds in fact some studies reported that the swat irrigation function was unable to represent appropriately the hydrological processes in irrigated areas chen et al 2018 gives a summary of some further studies about the swat model auto irrigation function deficiency chen et al 2017 indicated that although the model provided reasonable estimates for etr the auto irrigation function over irrigated crops as compared to actual practiced irrigation levels in addition marek et al 2017 pointed out that when the soil water content method was used irrigation events were not suspended even after crop harvest consequently chen et al 2018 developed new and representative management allowed depletion mad auto irrigation algorithms wei et al 2018a compared auto irrigation routines with actual applied irrigation depths based on canal diversion data and found that there was no difference in the model results on the other hand uniyal et al 2019 and chen et al 2019 pointed out that the simulated irrigation was higher when irrigation was triggered by soil water deficit than when triggered by plant water stress regarding the manual irrigation function swat2005 version was used for the first time in del reguero watershed drw located in one of the most important intensive irrigated areas in spain dechmi et al 2012 this version did not reproduce correctly the irrigation return flow generated under intensive sprinkler irrigation if the amount of water specified in irrigation operation exceeds the amount of water needed to fill the soil layers up to field capacity the excess water is returned to the source neitsch et al 2005 dechmi et al 2012 and therefore not considered in the daily soil water balance calculation consequently swat2005 version was modified swat irrig for correctly simulating the main hydrological processes in intensively irrigation watersheds dechmi et al 2012 concerning the swat2012 version wei et al 2018a 2018b also provided swat with the necessary enhancements for application in intensively irrigated stream aquifer systems by including irrigation earthen canals seepage into the swat source code the objectives of this study were i to assess the change preformed in swat source code from swat2005 version to swat2018 rev670 in terms of manual irrigation algorithms considering the drw study area already modeled by dechmi et al 2012 and ii to calibrate and validate crop yield daily and monthly streamflow and nitrate load in drw in order to evaluate the impact of both optimum irrigation and recommended n management practices on yield and irrigation return flows water quality 2 methods 2 1 model description the swat model is a public domain time continuous spatially semi distributed physically based model arnold et al 1998 the model operates on a daily time step at river watershed basin scale and integrates all relevant eco hydrological processes including surface and ground water flow vegetation growth and land use water and nutrient management the watershed basin is divided into sub basins which are then further subdivided into areas with unique topographic soil and land use characteristics called hydrologic response units hrus the hrus are the spatial units where the vertical flows of water and nutrients are calculated five different pools of n in soil are simulated two mineral forms of n ammonium and nitrate and three organic forms of n active organic n stable organic associated with humic substances and fresh organic n associated with crop residues the n losses from each hru take place through crop uptake surface runoff lateral flow percolation and erosion the in stream transformation of n is governed by algae growth and decay water temperature biological oxidation rate for conversion of different n species and settling of organic n with sediment further details of the water balance soil erosion and nutrient process equations can be found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 in the swat model interface and in the case of irrigated areas the user can choose to perform the irrigation scheduling either under auto irrigation or under manual options when manual irrigation is chosen the user introduces the actual irrigation scheduling date and irrigation depth of each farmer s irrigation event for each hru via the management operation option of the swat interface the water irrigation sources are five from stream reach reservoir shallow aquifer deep aquifer and outside the watershed unlimited source there are several versions of swat integrated with arcgis arcswat arcswat is an open fortran source code that integrates in total 305 subroutines the main subroutines that control the irrigation performance for the water balance calculation at hru scale are percmain the master soil percolation component autoirr performs the auto irrigation operation irrsub this algorithm performs the irrigation operation when the irrigation source is the shallow or deep aquifer or a source outside the watershed irri rch performs the irrigation operation when the water source is a stream reach irri res performs the irrigation operation when the water source is a reservoir irrigate applies irrigation water to the hru subbassin controls the simulation of the land phase of the hydrologic cycle for example the subbasin subroutine gives instructions to perform the management operation and soil water routine and to compute the effective rainfall evapotranspiration or crop growth 2 2 study area and model input data for basic setup in the present study the swat2018 rev670 in the arcgis version 10 3 environment was applied for building the hydrological model of the drw 1865 ha 41 54 n and 00 06 w using the same data and simulation period considered in dechmi et al 2012 the del reguero stream is a tributary to the alcanadre river located in the left bank of the middle ebro river basin in spain fig 1 the irrigated area of the watershed 1355 ha is an intensively cultivated sprinkler irrigated system in which corn 41 both long and short season varieties alfalfa 15 and winter cereal 19 were the predominant crops during the study period the mainly rainfed crop was barley 19 of the total watershed area the irrigated area is part of the alconadre irrigation district included in the alto aragon irrigation system the largest irrigated area in the middle ebro river valley around 130 000 ha the climate is semi arid with a mean annual precipitation of 391 mm and a mean annual reference evapotranspiration of 1294 mm penman monteith three different types of soils can be found in drw 1 terrace soils which represent 39 of the total area characterized by shallow depth 0 6 m on average presence of a sub surface calcareous horizon and high content of stones 2 shallow alluvial soils 50 of the area mostly stone free and with soil depth varying from 0 6 m to 0 9 m and 3 deep alluvial soils 11 of the area similar to the precedent but with soil depths ranging from 0 9 to 1 2 m a more detailed characterization of the study area can be found in skhiri and dechmi 2012 the nitrate concentrations in the outlet of the watershed were very high 113 mg no3 l 1 in the average for 2008 09 and higher than the european limit for nitrate concentrations in waters intended for human consumption of 50 mg l 1 eu 1998 currently the drw is designated as a nitrate vulnerable zone gobierno de aragón 2019 and therefore it is necessary to establish codes of good agricultural practices in this zone for delineating the basin into sub basins 9 and hrus 239 the same digital elevation model dem of the ebro river basin 20 20 m grid size soil and a land use land cover lulc maps considered in swat2005 version dechmi et al 2012 were used in this study the land use and soil data were obtained from the special crop and soil distribution maps elaborated during the study years through field surveys the daily meteorological records for the study years were obtained from the huerto meteorological station located close to the watershed 41 56 n and 00 08 w the alconadre irrigation district collective irrigation network provided the irrigation management data date and dose of each irrigation event applied in each soil type and crop the farmers management data for each crop tillage operations planting and harvest dates type and amounts of organic and inorganic fertilizers applied dates of fertilizers application and crop yields obtained were also the same as those used by dechmi et al 2012 daily water flow and nitrate concentration at the watershed outlet were measured from january 15th 2008 to december 31st 2009 daily no3 n loads were calculated by multiplying streamflow and nitrate concentration 2 3 swat2018 vs swat2005 both swat20018 and swat2005 source codes of the irrigation related subroutines have been compared to identify the modifications introduced by the model s developer group in the last swat version the subroutines that presented differences between both source code model versions are percmain and irrigate in the percmain subroutine both algorithms presented the following difference swat 2005 version sepday inflpcp swat 2018 version sepday inflpcp aird j pot seep j where sepday corresponds to the micropore percolation from soil layer inflpcp is the amount of precipitation that infiltrates into soil aird j corresponds to the amount of irrigation water applied to the hru and pot seep j refers to infiltration from pot and seep not considered in this study the irrigation dose specified in the irrigation operation was added in the soil percolation depth calculation of swat2018 version this modification is considered correct because irrigation is the most important input variable to the irrigated system and therefore cannot be ignored in the soil water percolation calculation as does the swat2005 version in the irrigate subroutine that applies irrigation water to the hrus the following differences were noted swat 2005 version yy sol st k jj stx volmm volmm yy aird jj aird jj yy swat 2018 version aird jj volmm 1 sq rto where aird is the amount of water applied to the hru on the current day volmm is the depth of irrigation water applied to the hru sol st is the amount of water stored in the soil layer on any given day stx is the amount of water stored in soil layer on the current day and sq rto is the fraction of total applied irrigation that is lost as runoff this subroutine is corrected however only the irrigation fraction lost as runoff is removed from the total irrigation depth applied to each hru when irrigation is targeted and the irrigation application efficiency losses are not considered in the net irrigation depth calculation in addition those irrigation loses could be more important in sprinkler irrigation systems under hot and semi arid climate because of evaporation and wind drift losses so the incorporation of the irrigation application efficiency in the net irrigation dose calculation in each hru is necessary to make the swat model more suitable for intensive irrigation systems watersheds after this analysis modification was incorporated in irrigate and irrsub subroutines to enhance swat application in intensively irrigated systems the packages notepad and msys64 were used to modify and compile the swat source code 2 4 swat calibration and validation the swat2018 improved version was run considering the manual irrigation and water source outside the watershed options for the model calibration and validation in drw as the processes affecting the water and nutrient balance in agricultural watersheds are highly influenced by crop growth evapotranspiration and n uptake the model was run first to calibrate and validate the swat improved version crop model this was followed by daily and monthly streamflow and nitrate load calibration and validation for both evaluation processes simulations were performed from january 1st 2007 to december 31st 2009 the period from january 1st 2007 to january 14th 2008 served as the warm up period while the data from january 15th 2008 to december 31st 2008 were used for the calibration and the remaining data for validation from january 1st 2009 to december 31st 2009 crop yield and streamflow parameters were calibrated manually tables 1 and 2 while the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 of swat cup software abbaspour 2015 was used for automatic no3 n load calibration during the crop yield calibration only the crop parameters included in land cover plant growth swat database were adjusted for the rest of model parameters default values were taken first the seven crop parameters adjusted by dechmi et al 2012 to calibrate crop yields in the study area were considered biomass energy ratio harvest index maximum leaf area index optimum air temperature base temperature maximum root depth and light extinction factor in addition other related crop nutrient uptake parameters were considered in this first step of model calibration to accurately estimate nitrogen loads table 1 for each representative crop in the study area the observed crop yield mg ha 1 was compared with the simulated crop yield parameter yld mg ha 1 in the swat standard output file output std in addition the simulated etr for each crop represented by the parameter et in the standard output file was compared with the etr calculated for the corresponding period by dechmi et al 2012 the calculated etr s were used for a simple comparison with those simulated by swat2018 once crop growth and yield were adequately simulated the streamflow and no3 n load were parameterized considering the variables presented in table 2 in addition to the scs runoff curve number parameter table 1 the parameters choice was based on previous work performed in the same study area for streamflow dechmi et al 2012 and on the sensitivity analysis implemented by changing parameters values one at a time to determine their impact on nitrate load the sensitive parameters with a p value 0 05 after one iteration consisting of 1000 simulations were used for no3 n load calibration table 2 the no3 n load sensitivity analysis was performed for the period from january 15th 2008 to december 31st 2008 using swat cup software swat cup 2012 version 5 1 6 however after obtaining good fit between observed and simulated daily streamflow additional parameters were considered using the swat cup platform to improve the manual streamflow calibration results in this step only the parameters sol awc available water capacity sol k saturated hydraulic conductivity sol bd bulk density and rock rock fragment content of the different soils and layers were considered table 3 the five statistical criteria considered to quantify how well the model matches the target data were 1 the coefficient of determination r2 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 the root mean square error rmse 4 the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and 5 the rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2015 the calibration objectives for streamflow and nitrate load were to maximize nse and r2 and to minimize the absolute value of pbias rmse and rsr based on the guidelines proposed by moriasi and et al 2007 2015 the model performance can be evaluated as satisfactory if nse 0 5 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 for streamflow and no3 n load 2 5 management practices assessment the management practices proposed in this study were those directly related to irrigation and n fertilization it is important that their application does not require significant changes in farmers management practices for a better acceptance and adoption by farmers to this end three scenarios were tested and compared with the simulated current situation current scenario 1 optimum irrigation and current n fertilization scenario i opti 2 optimum n fertilization recommended and current irrigation practices scenario nf opti and 3 combined optimum irrigation and n fertilization scenarios i nf opti the swat model was run for the three hydrological years used in the calibration and validation processes the considered scenarios were determined and applied for the main irrigated and non irrigated crops corn long season corn ls corn short season corn ss barley sunflower long season sun ls sunflower short season sun ss alfalfa and rainfed barley bar ni the i opti scenario consists in using an optimum irrigation scheduling by adjusting irrigation water dose to the crop net irrigation requirement nir daily nir calculated in dechmi et al 2013 for the same year and same crops of the drw are considered in this study to perform the optimum irrigation scheduling to closely represent the actual irrigation the daily nir values were added until the day on which the sum amounted to almost 20 mm at that date the sum of the previous days nir was introduced in swat as an irrigation event regarding nf opti scenario for corn ls as well as corn ss an optimal recommended rate of 250 kg n ha 1 isla et al 2008 was split as 50 kg n ha 1 at pre planting 100 kg ha 1 for the first sidedress vegetative stage v7 8 and 100 kg n ha 1 for the second silking stage r1 in the case of barley n requirements were taken as 148 kg n ha 1 90 kg n ha 1 applied at sowing and the remaining as a sidedress at stem elongation marm 2011 for bar ni a total application of 88 kg n ha 1 was taken as optimal concerning both sunflower varieties the recommended dose in dwr is 105 kg n ha 1 50 at sowing and 50 at vegetative stage v10 marm 2011 finally for alfalfa 30 kg n ha 1 was applied as a unique n input at sowing to favor the establishment in the pre nodulation phase marm 2011 the average current optimum irrigation and n fertilization practices considered are summarized in table 4 the impact of each scenario on water quality at the watershed outlet was determined as percent change of the average annual streamflow discharge and no3 n loads after each considered management practices application in the drw the percent reduction for each scenario was calculated as follows change 100 prebmp postbmp prebmp where prebmp is the swat current scenario outputs and postbmp is the swat output after implementation of the bmp 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat2018 modification the following modifications were included in the swat2018 source code 1 subroutine irrsub change the maximum amount of water applied as an irrigation event in the irrsub subroutine to the depth of irrigation water applied to each hru as specified by the user instead of the amount of water held in the soil profile at field capacity considered in the current version as follows vmm irr amt where vmm is the maximum amount of water to be applied mm and irr amt is the depth of irrigation water applied to each hru mm as specified by the user 2 subroutine irrigate the modification consists in including the irrigation efficiency in the calculation of the irrigation depth applied in each hru as following aird jj volmm 1 sq rto irreff where irreff is the irrigation application efficiency on the other hand it should be adequate that the fraction of total applied irrigation that is lost as runoff which is very difficult to calculate variable sq rto in the source code could be estimated by the same method that swat uses for rainfall runoff in the actual swat2018 interface this variable is directly specified as an input in the irrigation management operation for each irrigation event 3 2 swat irrig2012 calibration and validation 3 2 1 crop model crop yields were calibrated and validated using observed data gathered from field surveys performed in 2008 calibration and 2009 validation fig 2 presents average crop yields simulated under swat irrig and modified swat2018 vs measured yield of alfalfa corn barley irrigated and rainfed and sunflower for the calibration and validation processes results indicate a good adjustment between simulated and observed mean crop yields in drw for both periods also results were generally better than those presented in dechmi et al 2012 using swat irrig this may be due to the additional crop parameters considered in the calibration process table 1 during the calibration period the mean simulated production for alfalfa matched the observed production 14 00 mg ha 1 on average for both calibration and validation periods the variability of the observed alfalfa yield cv 3 was lower than simulated cv 5 for corn the mean simulated production was about 11 88 mg ha 1 vs the observed mean of 11 90 mg ha 1 indicating that swat2018 slightly under estimated corn yield by almost 0 2 however the variability of the observed corn yield was higher than the variability of simulated yields 15 vs 9 respectively swat2018 also slightly under estimated the mean irrigated barley yield by 1 0 6 1 mg ha 1 vs 6 2 mg ha 1 and the simulated yield presented less variability 0 1 than the observed yield 15 on the other hand mean simulated sunflower yield was slightly higher than its mean observed yield on average the swat2018 model over estimated mean sunflower yield by 10 whereas mean rainfed barley yield was over estimated by 0 1 in regard to crop real evapotranspiration fig 3 the mean annual etr values simulated by swat2018 767 659 472 and 640 mm for respectively alfalfa corn barley and sunflower were quite similar to those calculated with the soil water balance on average the error value between simulated and calculated etr ranged from 1 3 to 12 7 the largest difference was observed in alfalfa and non irrigated barley akhavan et al 2010 found that the calibration of crop yield increases the confidence on soil moisture and evapotranspiration presenting similar conclusion samimi et al 2020 indicated that in semi arid irrigated watershed the calibration and validation of crop yield is very important to reach a more reliable representation for the main water budget components rather than only considering streamflow calibration because crop yield represents evapotranspiration as well as nutrient uptake 3 2 2 streamflow initially a trial and error calibration procedure was performed for all the streamflow parameters presented in table 2 due to the relative small size and homogenous conditions of the watershed the same parametric values were adjusted for all hrus and sub basins table 2 fig 4 shows a good agreement between daily observed and simulated data the magnitude of the main discharge peaks was captured satisfactorily except during two dates of the validation period 11 april and 9 august 2009 which clearly affected the goodness of the streamflow estimation this may be because of some spatial variability of rainfall assuming that the precipitation gauging station is located out of the drw that might have a pronounced influence on modeling results during the high precipitation events the measured low flows were simulated correctly except the period from september to december of the validation period where the model clearly overestimated stream flow what will have an impact on nitrate load prediction during this period this visual interpretation of the measured and simulated streamflow evolution is supported by the performance statistics presented in table 5 a study performed by wei et al 2021 also showed lower model accuracy to predict peak flows in an irrigated agricultural system however the accurate simulation of base flow and low flows is more important in our study because these are strongly impacted by irrigation for the calibration and validation periods the coefficient of determination calculated for daily stream discharge was 0 80 and 0 77 respectively according to moriasi et al 2015 the other statistical parameters considered indicate a very good fit of simulated values to the observed data set of the daily stream flow table 5 the negative pbias point to an overestimation of flows in both calibration and validation period table 5 although the model evaluation was good for both data sets daily or monthly stream flow the r2 nse rmse and pbias values during the calibration period were better than for the validation period for both daily streamflow and monthly discharge table 5 in addition for both monthly calibration and validation the performance statistics values without considering rmse for having different units were better than the daily ones table 5 on the other hand the results obtained for monthly stream discharge were quite similar to those presented by dechmi et al 2012 3 2 3 nitrate load the daily and monthly calibration and validation results for nitrate load at the watershed outlet are shown in table 5 and fig 5 the results were not as good as for streamflow a usual behavior frequently reported in the literature bauwe et al 2019 compared with daily measured data the simulations of no3 n load were less accurate for both calibration and validation periods than streamflow results regarding monthly results the statistics for no3 n loads were better than the daily no3 n load predictions for both calibration and validation generally simulated nitrate load followed the trend of observed values fig 5 however it is important to point out that some no3 n peaks were not captured adequately by swat in both calibration and validation processes in addition the model tended to clearly underpredict the monthly no3 n during august and october during the calibration period and to overestimate it from october to december during the validation period this explained the worse results for the validation process nse 0 64 and r2 0 74 compared to calibration nse 0 83 and r2 0 85 however the pbias was positive for calibration and negative for validation and reached very good values for both daily and monthly data sets table 5 the lower accuracy of monthly no3 n loads in the validation period was probably induced in part by the streamflow overprediction observed from september to october fig 6 in addition the use of average mineral n fertilizer amount for each crop and the inaccurate information provided by farmers regarding their manure applications dose and date could increase the uncertainty of the management input data and consequently the model nitrogen balance calculation however the performance of the swat model for describing the nitrate load was considered satisfactory and better than many other recent studies in the literature where the nse was lower than 0 4 for daily nitrate load predictions bauwe et al 2019 dakhlalla and parajuli 2019 yuan and chiang 2015 notably merriam et al 2019 haas et al 2017 and epelde et al 2015 presented similar results 3 3 management practices scenarios 3 3 1 irrigation water and n fertilization analysis for all scenarios and each crop the model was run considering the usual sowing and harvest dates in the study area the current and optimum average seasonal irrigation depth values summarized in table 4 showed that not all crop water requirements were met in the drw during the study years both corn and alfalfa were over irrigated during the growing season while barley and sunflower were under irrigated in average the optimum irrigation water represents 72 55 and 73 of the current seasonal irrigation dose applied for corn ls corn ss and alfalfa respectively this caused a decrease in the number of irrigation events for the remaining crops additional irrigation depth was added to reach their irrigation requirements 33 mm 158 mm and 33 mm for barley sunflower ls and sunflower ss respectively in total 1 67 hm3 amount of irrigation water would be saved not delivered to the system by applying the calculated optimum irrigation dose for all crops in regard to the current n fertilizers cereals are the main n fertilizer users in drw fig 6 as corn accounted for 60 and barley for 30 including both irrigated and rainfed of the total n applied averaging all years considered a total of 331 7 mg n from fertilizers were used in the drw however this total n fertilizer application would decrease by 36 if the optimum n fertilizer is considered in general the highest n input comes from mineral fertilizers that accounts for 83 of the total n fertilization this is so mainly because manure was applied only in 30 of corn barley and sunflower cultivated areas so if the number of local animal farms increases in drw additional risk to the environment will be induced when manure production exceeds the land availability and crop needs nevertheless during the study period the highest manure dose was about 143 n kg ha 1 year 1 which is less than the maximum n limit for manure 170 n kg ha 1 year 1 set out by the european nitrates directive 91 676 eec eu 1991 this limit only applies to areas identified as nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs as it is the case of the drw since 2013 gobierno de aragón 2013a regarding the n fertilizers dose per hectare applied for each crop table 4 only corn ls and alfalfa reached an average dose higher than the limits set out by aragón government gobierno de aragón 2013b in the sprinkler irrigated areas in aragon 380 n kg ha 1 for corn and 30 n kg ha 1 for alfalfa however barley and sunflower ls current doses were lower than the calculated optimum doses considered in this study table 4 3 3 2 irrigation scenarios the implementation of the optimum irrigation scenario had a highly positive impact on crop yield fig 7 results showed a yield increase of 26 5 24 2 and 33 1 for alfalfa corn ls and corn ss respectively this should have a positive impact on farmers benefits for barley and sunflower the additional irrigation water applied to meet crop water needs induced a small yield increases of only 2 4 and 2 7 for barley and sunflower ls respectively fig 7 in another intensively irrigated area in spain malik et al 2020 reported a yield increase only for corn ss 27 and alfalfa 9 when adjusted irrigation dose was applied in this case the authors estimated the optimum irrigation by adjusting the irrigation doses and timing to each considered crop requirement using the dssat model and considering a constant mad of 0 5 compared to the current scenario the optimum irrigation could reduce the annual irrigation return flow by 10 4 the nitrate load by 13 8 and the average no3 n concentration from 25 2 mg l 1 to 24 2 mg l 1 in addition the residual no3 n in soil presented a very slight increase 0 01 in lower kaidu river basin china ba et al 2020 indicated that an increase of furrow irrigation water efficiency can save irrigation water consumption by 4 8 however simulated irrigation management scenarios did not always render promising results for example ahmadzadeh et al 2016 showed that changing the surface irrigation to a pressurized system could increase water productivity up to 15 due to increases in crop yield however pressurized irrigation results in no significant change in total outflow as the drw irrigation system is pressurized the resulted irrigation water saving should lead to energy savings which could present an additional benefit for farmers as well as for the irrigated agriculture sustainability however and in agreement with results presented by malik and dechmi 2019 improving irrigation practices without optimizing n fertilization could lead to high residual n in soil at the end of the growing season susceptible to leaching during the intercrop period if precipitation occurs this could generate a risk in reducing the magnitude of the positive environmental impact of this scenario 3 3 3 nitrogen fertilization scenarios the recommended n fertilization scenario showed a strong environmental impact being better than the optimum irrigation scenario in reducing the no3 n loads and average concentration fig 8 in fact monthly simulated no3 n load under the recommended n fertilization showed a sharp decrease relative to current conditions fig 8 the recommended n fertilizer dose could reduce in average the no3 n load by 45 6 and the average no3 n concentration by 46 1 from 25 2 mg l 1 to 13 6 mg l 1 compared to the current scenario table 6 with similar crop yield for all crops considered fig 7 this showed that crop yield in the drw was more affected by irrigation management than n fertilizer management however if only recommended n fertilization was considered no3 n loads could be reduced 3 8 times more than if only optimum irrigation scenario was considered on average 60 of the total no3 n load was recorded during the irrigation season from march to september in spite of the important reduction in the residual no3 n in the soil at harvest 21 5 compared to the optimum irrigation scenario the remaining residual no3 n in soil is still important and susceptible to leaching during non cultivated period malik et al 2020 showed similar results in another sprinkler irrigated watershed spain however in lower kaidu river basin china ba et al 2020 indicated lower decrease of total n load 14 5 when fertilizers application is reduced by 20 bauwe et al 2019 also indicated that a slight decrease of n fertilization leads to significant reductions in nitrate loadings while crop yields remained on a high level the no3 n loads recorded in the drw outlet from 2015 to 2018 data no presented were higher 61 mg in average than the loads measured during the study period 51 mg in average this increase of the nitrate load during recent years indicates that agricultural practices are becoming more intensive in terms of irrigation and fertilizers use i e increase of double copping area and in situ manure production and use 3 3 4 combined optimum irrigation and n fertilizer scenarios the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilizer scenario was more efficient reducing no3 n load and no3 n concentration than the individual scenarios both variables could be reduced by 51 9 no3 n load and 47 5 no3 n concentration under the combined optimum irrigation and n fertilizer scenario compared to the current scenario table 6 the average no3 n concentration decreased from 25 2 mg l 1 111 8 no3 mg l 1 to 13 3 mg l 1 58 7 no3 mg l 1 despite the important reduction in the nitrate concentration in the irf it would remain above the threshold of 50 mg l 1 eu 1991 there was also a significant reduction for the residual no3 n in soil 20 6 and for the irf 10 4 compared to the current scenario in addition crop production was positively impacted mainly for alfalfa 26 5 yield increase corn ls 20 5 and corn ss 34 1 generally the no3 n loads were lowest every month with the combined scenario but in february march may and august of 2008 there were no significant differences between no3 n load between n fertilizers scenario and combined scenario in the no3 n loads fig 8 all the tested scenarios showed differences in their environmental impact and farmers benefits however combined practices were more advantageous for environment and farmers benefits than applying any of the individual practices as they allowed for reaching maximum reduction in no3 n loads with better net incomes for farmers 25 9 less n fertilizers inputs and 27 0 yield increase along with water and energy saving the results of this work are in agreement with the findings of malik et al 2020 this work performed in other sprinkler irrigation systems showed that the combined scenario was the most efficient in terms of no3 n load reduction followed by the recommended n fertilization and the optimum irrigation management testing different best management practices bmps in the drw using the modified swat2005 swat irrig dechmi and skhiri 2013 results showed that the application of combined bmps is the most efficient scenario for reducing phosphorus losses and then improving water quality however cavero et al 2012 indicated that the optimum irrigation was more efficient than n fertilization management in surface irrigation systems where irrigation efficiency was very low finally this best scenario in reducing the no3 load and concentration is still inadequate to comply with the requirement of nitrates directive eu 1991 in the dwr because the no3 concentration remains above the threshold of 50 mg l 1 and therefore additional strategies to control nitrate leaching in dwr such as replacing winter fallow by legumes and non legumes cover crops and or using controlled release fertilizers should be considered 4 conclusions although the current version of swat2018 includes the needed modification to account for irrigation water excess in the soil water balance and water routing calculation the model performs the manual irrigation without taking into account the irrigation application efficiency in the calculation of the net irrigation dose that effectively reaches the soil during an irrigation event as the model interface already allows the user to introduce the irrigation application efficiency value a slight modification was introduced in the source code to correct this model deficiency with this modification the available water in the soil profile which directly affects crop growth water and nutrient loss estimations from each hru could be appropriately modeled after crop yield calibration the swat modified version showed very good performance considering both daily and monthly data sets in describing streamflow and discharge at the outlet of the study watershed in addition the monthly modified swat2018 performance for nitrate load measured at the outlet of the watershed was very good for the calibration period and satisfactory for the validation period the analysis of the temporal streamflow evolution during both calibration and validation processes showed that a good model performance regarding streamflow is one of the conditions for predicting nitrate losses correctly the tested practices showed differences in their environmental impact and farmers benefits results indicated that the combined bmps scenario was the most efficient scenario reducing no3 load 52 ahead of the recommended n fertilization 46 and optimum irrigation 14 although a cost benefit analysis was not carried out in this study it is quite clear that farmers net income will be improved by the important reduction in n fertilizers inputs 26 less n inputs yield increase 27 on average for alfalfa and corn and irrigation water saving 21 that could induce heavy savings in energy costs this work supports previous results evaluated in similar irrigated areas in addition the proposed scenario does not require significant change in farmers management because its application only needs to reduce and adjust irrigation fertilization inputs and therefore can be readily adopted by
