14430,in the present study chooka s wastewater treatment was investigated using different combinations of adsorption photocatalytic degradation and membrane filtration process polymeric membranes were fabricated using wet phase inversion method employing polyacrylonitrile pan polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and dimethylformamide dmf as a polymer matrix hydrophilic additive and solvent respectively activated carbon and tio2 nanoparticles were selected as an adsorbent and photocatalyst respectively tio2 nanoparticles were synthesized using the sol gel method and activated carbon was purchased from merck company liquid liquid displacement lldp scanning electron microscope sem and contact angle tests were implemented to characterize the fabricated membranes ft ir and xrd analysis were also used for tio2 nanoparticles characterization the wastewater of iran pulp and paper factory chooka was used as the feed in separation processes in hybrid separation systems 6 different configurations were considered and wastewater compositions were measured to determine the effectiveness of the utilized processes before and after treatment accordingly the mean pore size of the fabricated pan pvp 16 3 membrane obtained from lldp analysis was 9 72 nm sem results also indicated thicker active layer for the pan pvp membrane than that of the neat pan membrane according to the results of the contact angle tests with the increasing of pvp content in the polymer matrix the hydrophilicity of membranes improved it was also found that membrane filtration had the best performance among single stage processes and the best separation performance was achieved when photocatalytic degradation adsorption and membrane filtration were used in series respectively keywords hybrid process membrane filtration photocatalytic degradation adsorption wastewater treatment 1 introduction lack of sufficient water resources and discharging industrial agricultural or domestic wastewater into bodies of water resources emphasize the importance of water and wastewater treatment 1 there are various treatment methods based on the input specifications of the water 2 however they have certain limitations and deficiencies and usually they need advanced treating facilities to eliminate environmental contaminants traditional treatments are not capable to remove toxins pesticides pharmaceutical residues arsenic and herbicides from contaminated water completely 3 6 more advanced techniques such as oxidation with ozone or adsorption with granular activated carbon can be used to remove contaminants efficiently 6 7 however these methods have also certain problems such as saturation of the activated carbon or formation of toxic substances as a result of reactions between water impurities and carbon filters 8 in addition to chemical contaminants viruses and bacteria are also needed to be disinfected therefore water chlorination is applied as a disinfection process however there are certain issues about the carcinogenic effects of the long term implementation of the chlorination process 9 the aforementioned issues resulted in consideration of membrane technology as an alternative for water and wastewater treatment processes 10 among different membrane processes reverse osmosis ro is one of the oldest and most commonly applied processes ro provides drinking water from wastewater or sea water and is capable of removing dissolved minerals by 99 and organic and ingredients and colloidal substances by 97 11 however the membranes sensitivity to biological deposits is considered an important issue traditional pretreatment methods cannot remove biological contaminants such as bacteria and microorganisms these contaminants are harmful to membranes since they deposit on the membrane surface 12 another issue with ro technology is the scaling caused by mineral salts 13 considering the disadvantages of traditional water treatment processes and limitations of single stage membrane filtration e g ro hybrid processes have attracted more attention 10 the researchers showed that the combination of processes minimizes the weaknesses in the processes and also the combined system performance is better than the single one the design of highly efficient hybrid systems with higher separation percent can reduce energy consumption and fewer problems with fouling 2 in recent years several combination strategies have been employed for water purification purposes the series configuration of adsorption and membrane filtration processes have been used to improve the membrane performance and consequently reducing the sediments amount and increasing the membrane s lifetime in 2007 hugues humbert et al utilized the ion exchange and coagulation as pretreatment methods to reduce ultrafiltration membrane fouling and achieved a better selectivity during the separation process 14 chemical oxidation has been one of the most recently used processes for water and wastewater treatment in 2013 zouboulis et al investigated the chemical oxidation process and reported an increased efficiency of the membrane process due to ozonation during water treatment the most important factor in chemical oxidation process is to control the ozone dosage to optimize the operating costs due to additional ozone consumption 15 joanna et al studied the photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes from water under uv irradiation and visible light they used titanium dioxide tio2 as photocatalyst and passed the feed water through a fixed bed containing photocatalyst and then entered the pretreated water to the membrane stage 16 they reported 98 and 68 separations for nano filtration and ultrafiltration processes respectively a summary of other important works undertaken in the field of combining water treatment processes are listed in table 1 in this study the different configurations of a hybrid wastewater treatment process combining three common processes i e adsorption photocatalytic degradation and membrane filtration was investigated in order to obtain the optimum configuration for wastewater treatment of iran pulp and paper factory chooka the main advantage of this hybrid process is the increase of the membrane performance and the achievement to a high efficiency wastewater treatment technique it is necessary to note that the combination of the selected processes was used in a semi continuous mode here and it will be developed as a continuous hybrid process in future works 2 experiments 2 1 materials polyacrylonitrile pan tg 85 c average mw 150 000

ch3cooh and deionized water were also purchased from merck chemical company titanium isopropoxide was used as a titanium source to synthesize tio2 nanoparticles all chemical reagents were used without further purification activated carbon coconut activated charcoal powder from merck company was used for adsorption process 2 2 membrane fabrication pan flat shit nano filtration membranes were fabricated by phase inversion method pan was used as membrane polymer pvp as the additive to increase the hydrophilicity of membrane and dmf as the solvent it is necessary to note that pvp was added to polymer solution to increase membrane hydrophilicity increasing the hydrophilicity increases the membrane flux in aqueous systems and reduces the amount of sedimentation of the contaminants on the membrane surface and membrane fouling in order to reach a nano filtration porosity range flat sheet membrane polymer and additive compositions were fixed at 16 and 3 respectively 22 the polymer solution pan 16 pvp 3 and dmf 81 was stirred for 5 h to obtain a homogeneous polymeric solution and kept stagnant for one day to be degassed the solution was then cast onto a clean glass and then it was immersed into the nonsolvent bath tap water as coagulant without evaporation of the solvent and remained in the coagulation bath for 24 h to complete solvent nonsolvent exchange process finally the fabricated membrane was naturally dried at room temperature 2 3 synthesis of tio2 nanoparticles among different semiconductors tio2 is a predominant semiconductor photocatalyst because of its stability at different reaction conditions non toxicity low cost production and eco friendly nature 23 tio2 nanoparticles were synthesized by sol gel methods 24 in this technique to obtain homogeneous mixture i 4 ml titanium isopropoxide was mixed in 70 ml pure ethanol and the mixture was stirred by an ultrasonic stirrer for 4 h then 3 ml acetic acid was added to 90 ml deionized water to obtain mixture ii after that mixture ii was added to the mixture i dropwise as it was stirring by an ultrasonic stirrer at 50 c for 30 min finally the resulting mixture was put at room temperature to reduce the mixture s temperature and then it was centrifuged next it was washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and dried in an oven at 60 c for 12 h eventually the resulting product was put in a furnace at 300 c for 1 h to achieve tio2 nanoparticles 24 2 4 wastewater analysis some of the remarkable characteristics of the wastewater sample chooka factory effluent were evaluated according to iranian national standard no 1053 25 the measured contents and the applied analyzing techniques are presented in table 2 2 5 photocatalyst nanoparticle analysis structure and phase composition of tio2 was determined by x ray diffraction xrd using philips pw1840 instrument operating at 40 kv and 35 ma using cu ka radiation λ 0 154 nm with the scanning range of 10 80 the crystal size of tio2 was calculated using the scherer equation 26 1 d h k l k λ β cos θ where d h k l is the crystallites average dimension k is the scherrer constant somewhat arbitrary value that falling in 0 87 1 0 range λ

spectrophotometer ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 2 6 membrane analysis lldp method was used to characterizing the pan pvp fabricated membrane water contact angle of neat pan and pan pvp membranes were compared and sem images of pan pvp membrane cross section were obtained 2 6 1 lldp test liquid liquid displacement porosimetry method lldp was used to measure the pore size of the fabricated membrane samples 2 6 1 1 pure distilled water flux calculation in order to calculate the permeate flux for a system with pure distilled water and a 4 bar upstream pressure eq 2 was used as follow 26 2 j v v s t where v is the volume of permeate s is the membrane s active surface area and t is the time to collect permeate in a store with the volume of v it should be noted that permeability tests were performed at ambient temperature 2 6 1 2 porosity and average pore size calculation porosity and mean pore size are the most important factors in determining the membrane performance to separate different contaminants 26 lldp method has been used as a model for morphological analysis of membrane surface to determine average pore size of the fabricated membrane at first a square of 1 cm length from the membrane was cut and weighed on the scale and soaked in the purely distilled water bath for 24 h and weighed again eqs 3 and 4 guerout elford and ferry equation were applied to calculate the average pore radius regarding dry and wet masses of the prepared samples 27 3 p r m w m d ρ w m w m d ρ w m d ρ p 4 r m 2 9 1 75 p r 8 η l q p r s δ p where pr is membrane s porosity mw is the wet

contact angle analysis contact angle analysis was performed on the fabricated polymeric membrane to determine the hydrophilicity of the membrane 28 the test was performed on a neat pan and pan pvp membranes in order to evaluate pvp additive effects on hydrophobicity of membrane data physics oca 15 plus was used to measure the contact angle of neat pan and pan pvp membranes 2 6 3 sem analysis sem images of membrane cross section were obtained using a leo 1450 v p scanning electron microscope to study the morphology of the active layer support layer of neat pan and pan pvp membranes 2 7 wastewater treatment processes as mentioned earlier three different processes were used for wastewater treatment in order to find the optimum hybrid process configuration the performance of each stage was evaluated by analyzing the wastewater compositions before and after each stage the detailed description of the applied processes is given as follows 2 7 1 adsorption as mentioned earlier in this work activated carbon was used as adsorbent because it is an excellent adsorbent with good physical and chemical properties including large surface area high adsorption capacity porous structure negligible environmental toxicity low cost and high purity standards 29 in adsorption process two parameters including the adsorbent amount and contact time should be considered 23 in the present research optimum absorption conditions proposed by el nass et al 2010 were employed 20 2 7 2 photocatalytic degradation the photocatalytic degradation test was performed under uv irradiation in a batch reactor an ultraviolet lamp 400 w eco osram iran was used in photocatalytic degradation test 90 of the radiated power from this uv lamp covered uv a region 315 400 nm and about 10 of its wavelengths were in the uv b region 280 315 nm 30 accordingly 0 07 g of tio2 nanoparticles were added to 100 ml of the wastewater and the resulting suspension was irradiated using a uv lamp for 2 h under magnetic agitation 27 31 2 7 3 membrane filtration permeation and separation properties of nano filtration samples were measured using a cross flow membrane set up a schematic representation of the set up is illustrated in fig 1 feed tank is fed by fresh or pretreated wastewater samples based on the process configuration all experiments were performed at ambient temperature and an upstream pressure of 4 bars membrane flux was measured when the system operated in the steady state condition 2 8 different configurations of processes six different configurations were applied to evaluate the effects of the process arrangement on product properties these configurations are listed in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd and ftir results xrd pattern of the synthesized tio2 in the range of 2θ 10 80 is shown in fig 2 the peaks were indexed as 101 004 200 105 204 116 220 and 215 correspondent to anatase phase of tio2 jcpds 21 1272 32 demonstrating the formation of pure tetragonal anatase phase of tio2 26 31 an average crystal size of about 8 nm was obtained from 101 peaks using the scherrer equation 31 the ftir spectra of tio2 nanoparticles 400 4000 cm 1 is shown in fig 3 the band at 480 cm 1 corresponds to ti o groups confirming the formation of tio2 33 the broadband at 3400 cm 1 is attributed to the hydroxyl group oh stretching vibration and the band at 1600 cm 1 corresponds to the ti oh stretching vibration 33 34 due to adsorption of water 3 2 membrane s characterization 3 2 1 lldp lldp and mean pore size calculation are listed in table 4 it is noteworthy that lldp test was performed on pan pvp membrane by substituting the values of table 4 in eqs 2 3 and 4 following variables were calculated j v 83 76 l m 2 h r p r 0 88 and rm 9 72 nm the calculated average pore radius rm confirmed the applicability of the fabricated pan pvp membrane in nano filtration processes 20 3 2 2 contact angle analysis the results of the contact angle analysis for pure pan polymeric membrane and pan membrane containing 3 wt pvp are depicted in fig 4 as illustrated in fig 4 water contact angle of neat pan membrane 52 was more than pan pvp membrane 44 indicating the higher hydrophilicity of the pan pvp membrane which was in agreement with the previously reported statement by jong seok et al 32 3 2 3 sem images the cross sectional sem images for membrane samples are shown in fig 5 according to fig 5 both membrane samples were asymmetric fig 6 depicts the high magnification cross sectional sem images of neat pan and pan pvp membranes it seems that skin layer of the neat pan membrane about 56 μm was thinner than that of pan pvp about 84 μm this effect could be attributed to the higher total concentration of the pan pvp membrane compared to that of the neat pan membrane 22 3 3 wastewater analysis the results of chooka s wastewater analysis are tabulated in table 5 just components with non zero contents from table 2 are listed components that were more than the standard values detergents tss do cod and bod were considered to be separated by the hybrid process 3 4 single stage separation as mentioned previously 4 parameters of chooka s wastewater bod cod tss and detergents with higher values than the maximum allowed values were considered during separation processes in single or hybrid mode in this section the separation properties of adsorption photocatalytic degradation and membrane filtration processes in single mode were presented the reported data obtained from getting the mean of the experiment results which were repeated three times at least to minimize experimental errors 3 4 1 adsorption the results of wastewater treatment using adsorption process are given in table 6 as shown in table 6 the adsorption process can decrease chemical and biochemical oxygen demand the amount of detergent and total suspended solids in the feed drastically however this process cannot decrease all wastewater parameters to the maximum standard allowance except for detergents the reduction of bod and cod were due to adsorption of organic substances and t microorganisms on the surface of activated carbon particles while the reduction of detergent content was associated with the adsorption of anionic surfactants on the surface of absorbent 28 35 3 4 2 photocatalytic degradation the results of the single stage photocatalytic degradation process are given in table 7 as reported in table 7 cod and bod parameters decreased to 79 and 80 during the photocatalytic degradation process respectively on the other hand the increased amount of cod might be attributed to the adsorption and degradation of organic contaminants by tio2 nanoparticles under ultraviolet irradiation uv irradiation moreover the content of the aerobic microorganisms and some organic materials in wastewater consuming oxygen determined the bod parameter as shown in table 6 80 of these materials were degraded or adsorbed by tio2 nanoparticles under ultraviolet irradiation 36 the acidity of wastewater ph 6 3 resulted in adsorption and degradation of anionic contaminants on tio2 nanoparticles or under uv irradiation respectively adak bandyopadhyay et al 2005 in addition since the ph of wastewater reported in table 3 was in the acidic range ph 6 3 the anionic contaminants in wastewater were adsorbed on tio2 nanoparticles and degraded under uv irradiation this phenomenon made a decrease in the number of detergents in the feed during the photocatalytic degradation process 37 generally total suspended solids tss in wastewater were unsolved distributed materials which could not be absorbed or degraded during the photocatalytic degradation process hence the decrease of tss parameter 11 is ascribed to filtration of the wastewater sample after the photocatalytic degradation process 3 4 3 membrane filtration process the results of wastewater treatment by membrane filtration process are presented in table 8 samples analysis showed that the membrane separation process drastically decreased all contents of contaminants cod bod detergents and tss as mentioned earlier the average pore size of the pan pvp membrane was nearly 10 nm therefore the fabricated membrane can be classified as a nanofiltration membrane this implies that the larger size of contaminants than membrane s mean pore size results in further purification of the wastewater 20 3 4 4 hybrid processes the results of wastewater treatment using hybrid processes with different configurations are given in table 9 it is also necessary to note that all processes in different hybrid arrangements were performed in batch mode under aforementioned operation conditions the comparison of the contaminants removal results between the single stage and hybrid processes revealed the better performance of all hybrid processes this finding can be attributed to synergetic effects of processes in the hybrid system based on the results of table 9 identical separation properties were nearly obtained for all hybrid processes however the first configuration 1 adsorption 2 photocatalytic degradation 3 membrane filtration was ranked the best separation performance among all different configurations which could be interpreted by the reduced fouling on the surface of the membrane due to pre separation processes adsorption and photocatalytic degradation in other words since some organic substances and microorganisms were degraded or adsorbed in earlier photocatalytic degradation and adsorption processes the concentration of the contaminant in wastewater fed to membrane and membrane fouling decreased the mechanism and efficiency of single processes and the best configuration were added in fig 7 3 4 5 membrane flux assessment in different configuration membrane fluxes of all configurations were measured and plotted over a period of time in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 membrane flux in all configurations was decreased as the experiment continued and reached to a constant value after 90 min the steady state membrane flux of hybrid systems configurations 1 6 is presented in table 10 according to table 10 drastic flux reduction occurred when membrane filtration technique was applied at the first stage of the hybrid system configuration configuration 3 and 4 therefore configuration 6 was considered as the best performing configuration for chooka s wastewater treatment 4 conclusion in this research three separation processes i e adsorption photocatalytic degradation and membrane filtration were selected and used for chooka s wastewater treatment in single and hybrid modes flat sheet polymeric membrane pan was fabricated using phase inversion technique and was applied in membrane filtration process the sol gel method was also employed to synthesize tio2 nanoparticles as the photocatalyst in the photocatalytic degradation process besides the adsorption process was carried out using activated carbon applied as purchased as the adsorbent in the adsorption process to characterize separation performance of selected processes chooka s wastewater was analyzed and their measured contaminants compared with standard maximum allowance values it was found that the cod bod detergents and tss values in wastewater were more than maximum allowance standard values and considered to be removed by selected processes single and hybrid modes single mode separation results revealed that membrane operation was more effective than other processes for wastewater treatment investigation of different configurations for the hybrid system also introduced the configuration order of 1 photocatalytic degradation 2 adsorption and 3 membrane filtration as the best system s configuration because of the higher membrane flux and separation percentages acknowledgment the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of university of tehran scienceand technology park for this research under grant number 940302 also

16 3 membrane obtained from lldp analysis was 9 72 nm sem results also indicated thicker active layer for the pan pvp membrane than that of the neat pan membrane according to the results of the contact angle tests with the increasing of pvp content in the polymer matrix the hydrophilicity of membranes improved it was also found that membrane filtration had the best performance among single

pan polymeric membrane and pan membrane containing 3 wt pvp are depicted in fig 4 as illustrated in fig 4 water contact angle of neat pan membrane 52 was more than pan pvp membrane 44 indicating the higher hydrophilicity of the pan pvp membrane which was in agreement with the previously reported statement by jong seok et al 32 3 2 3 sem images the cross sectional sem images for membrane samples are shown in fig 5 according to fig 5 both membrane samples were asymmetric fig 6 depicts the high magnification cross sectional sem images of neat pan and pan pvp membranes it seems that skin layer of the neat pan membrane about 56 μm was thinner than that of pan pvp about 84 μm this effect could be attributed to the higher total concentration of the pan pvp membrane compared to that of the neat pan membrane 22 3 3 wastewater analysis the results of chooka s wastewater analysis are tabulated in table 5 just components with non zero contents from table 2 are listed components that were more than the standard values detergents tss do cod and bod were considered to be separated by the hybrid process 3 4 single stage separation as mentioned previously 4 parameters of chooka s wastewater bod cod tss and detergents with higher values than the maximum allowed values were considered during separation processes in single or hybrid mode in this section the separation properties of adsorption photocatalytic degradation and membrane filtration processes in single mode were presented the reported data obtained from getting the mean of the experiment results which were repeated three times at least to minimize experimental errors 3 4 1 adsorption the results of wastewater treatment using adsorption process are given in table 6 as shown in table 6 the adsorption process can decrease chemical and biochemical oxygen demand the amount of detergent and total suspended solids in the feed drastically however this process cannot decrease all wastewater parameters to the maximum standard allowance except for detergents the reduction of bod and cod were due to adsorption of organic substances and t microorganisms on the surface of activated carbon particles while the reduction of detergent content was associated with the adsorption of anionic surfactants on the surface of absorbent 28 35 3 4 2 photocatalytic degradation the results of the single stage photocatalytic degradation process are given in table 7 as reported in table 7 cod and bod parameters decreased to 79 and 80 during the photocatalytic degradation process respectively on the other hand the increased amount of cod might be attributed to the adsorption and degradation of organic contaminants by tio2 nanoparticles under ultraviolet irradiation uv irradiation moreover the content of the aerobic microorganisms and some organic materials in wastewater consuming oxygen determined the bod parameter as shown in table 6 80 of these materials were degraded or adsorbed by tio2 nanoparticles under ultraviolet irradiation 36 the acidity of wastewater ph 6 3 resulted in adsorption and degradation of anionic contaminants on tio2 nanoparticles or under uv irradiation respectively adak bandyopadhyay et al 2005 in addition since the ph of wastewater reported in table 3 was in the acidic range ph 6 3 the anionic contaminants in wastewater were adsorbed on tio2 nanoparticles and degraded under uv irradiation this phenomenon made a decrease in the number of detergents in the feed during the photocatalytic degradation process 37 generally total suspended solids tss in wastewater were unsolved distributed materials which could not be absorbed or degraded during the photocatalytic degradation process hence the decrease of tss parameter 11 is ascribed to filtration of the wastewater sample after the photocatalytic degradation process 3 4 3 membrane filtration process the results of wastewater treatment by membrane filtration process are presented in table 8 samples analysis showed that the membrane separation process drastically decreased all contents of contaminants cod bod detergents and tss as mentioned earlier the average pore size of the pan pvp membrane was nearly 10 nm therefore the fabricated membrane can be classified as a nanofiltration membrane this implies that the larger size of contaminants than membrane s mean pore size results in further purification of the wastewater 20 3 4 4 hybrid processes the results of wastewater treatment using hybrid processes with different configurations are given in table 9 it is also necessary to note that all processes in different hybrid arrangements were performed in batch mode under aforementioned operation conditions the comparison of the contaminants removal results between the single stage and hybrid processes revealed the better performance of all hybrid processes this finding can be attributed to synergetic effects of processes in the hybrid system based on the results of table 9 identical separation properties were nearly obtained for all hybrid processes however the first configuration 1 adsorption 2 photocatalytic degradation 3 membrane filtration was ranked the best separation performance among all different configurations which could be interpreted by the reduced fouling on the surface of the membrane due to pre separation processes adsorption and photocatalytic degradation in other words since some organic substances and microorganisms were degraded or adsorbed in earlier photocatalytic degradation and adsorption processes the concentration of the contaminant in wastewater fed to membrane and membrane fouling decreased the mechanism and efficiency of single processes and the best configuration were added in fig 7 3 4 5 membrane flux assessment in different configuration membrane fluxes of all configurations were measured and plotted over a period of time in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 membrane flux in all configurations was decreased as the experiment continued and reached to a constant value after 90 min the steady state membrane flux of hybrid systems configurations 1 6 is presented in table 10 according to table 10 drastic flux reduction occurred when membrane filtration technique was applied at the first stage of the hybrid system configuration configuration 3 and 4 therefore configuration 6 was considered as the best performing configuration for chooka s wastewater treatment 4 conclusion in this research three separation processes i e adsorption photocatalytic degradation and membrane filtration were selected and used for chooka s wastewater treatment in single and hybrid modes flat sheet polymeric membrane pan was fabricated using phase inversion technique and was applied in membrane filtration process the sol gel method was also employed to synthesize tio2 nanoparticles as the photocatalyst in the photocatalytic degradation process besides the adsorption process was carried out using activated carbon applied as purchased as the adsorbent in the adsorption process to characterize separation performance of selected processes chooka s wastewater was analyzed and their measured contaminants compared with standard maximum allowance values it was found that the cod bod detergents and tss values in wastewater were more than maximum allowance standard values and considered to be removed by selected processes single and hybrid modes single mode separation results revealed that membrane operation was more effective than other processes for wastewater treatment investigation of different configurations for the hybrid system also introduced the configuration order of 1 photocatalytic degradation 2 adsorption and 3 membrane filtration as the best system s configuration because of the higher membrane flux and separation percentages acknowledgment the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of university of tehran scienceand technology park for this research under grant number 940302 also

14431,with each passing year the global push toward sustainable development continues to challenge and motivate the wastewater industry in this research the treatment performance of a relatively novel biological treatment system a hybrid membrane bioreactor hmbr was compared to a conventional membrane bioreactor mbr for the reclamation of domestic greywater the results indicated that the hmbr was able to achieve removal efficiencies equal to or greater than the mbr which was operated simultaneously for comparison each bioreactor was maintained at an equivalent total biomass concentration throughout experimentation the average removal efficiencies for chemical oxygen demand biochemical oxygen demand total nitrogen total kjeldahl nitrogen ammonia and total phosphorus were 91 97 66 74 93 and 90 with the hmbr and 91 97 58 71 88 and 90 with the mbr respectively these improvements were attributed to the presence of biofilms within the hmbr which enhanced simultaneous nitrification and denitrification processes the hmbr was determined to be the better choice for greywater reclamation with a treatment performance exceeding that of a conventional mbr keywords hybrid membrane bioreactor hmbr greywater reclamation simultaneous nitrification and denitrification biofilm biocarrier 1 introduction the growing level of water stress taking place around the world has greatly increased the need for water conservation practices as a consequence the interest in wastewater reclamation has grown considerably in recent years 1 2 over sixty countries across the globe currently practice some form of wastewater reclamation 3 with significant efforts taking place in the united states china saudi arabia spain and mexico 4 these practices often include greywater reclamation which is the main type of wastewater generated from residential sources since greywater represents up to 50 75 of the total domestic supply 5 6 it presents a significant opportunity for water recovery many treatment options currently exist for greywater reclamation such as artificial wetlands rotating biological contactors sequencing batch reactors and membrane bioreactors mbrs 7 8 a review of these technologies has found mbrs to be both economical and feasible 9 and their compact design and reliable treatment performance make them particularly suitable for greywater reclamation presently most mbr installations are designed to operate aerobically which limits the total amount of nitrogen that can be removed via denitrification even simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd processes may be limited by the size of the flocs which have been reported to be smaller in mbr systems than in conventional activated sludge processes 10 while biological nutrient removal bnr processes can be implemented to improve denitrification the processes are considerably more complex requiring anoxic aerobic zone separation and nitrate recirculation consequently additional space equipment and oversight are required making bnr an impractical choice for many greywater reuse applications an alternative solution is to enhance snd processes within the mbr by incorporating moving bed media directly into the mixed liquor a modification commonly referred to as a hybrid membrane bioreactor hmbr 11 10 12 14 the resulting system thus resembles an integrated fixed film activated sludge process but with a membrane in place of a clarifier for solid liquid separation the media provide a surface for bacteria to attach and form a biofilm these biofilms exhibit similar conditions to those found within the interior of large floc which are characteristically anoxic due to the limited diffusion of dissolved oxygen in moving bed systems improvements in total nitrogen removal have been attributed to the snd processes occurring within the biocarriers 15 17 this may give the hmbr an advantage over conventional mbrs for certain reuse applications such as surface water replenishment or groundwater recharge where the presence of nitrogen in the treated water is undesirable in this research the overall treatment performance of an hmbr was compared to a conventional mbr for the reclamation of domestic greywater the objective was to determine if the inclusion of moving bed media provided any significant benefit to the treatment performance of the hmbr particular interest was given to the removal of nitrogen as the nitrification and denitrification processes were the most likely to be affected by the biofilms to date a comparison of this kind has yet to be conducted in the context of greywater treatment the aim of this research was therefore to advance the knowledge of hmbrs utilized for greywater reclamation and to better understand the impact of combined growth processes on treatment performance advancements in these areas offer practical significance to the implementation of current and future greywater reclamation systems with the hope of enabling more sustainable water management practices 2 experimental methods 2 1 greywater collection the untreated greywater was collected from the bathroom sinks of the university of regina research and innovation centre ric by means of a dual plumbing system installed throughout the building a carbon supplement of dissolved sucrose was added to the collected greywater so that the biochemical oxygen demand bod5 could be maintained at approximately 150 mg l throughout the experiment doing so enabled the results to be more easily compared the characteristics of the untreated greywater are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental setup the impact of biocarrier addition on treatment performance was evaluated by comparing the overall treatment performance of the hmbr to a conventional mbr operated simultaneously under comparable operating conditions the experiments were conducted using two identically shaped bioreactors each operated at a total volume of 36 l one bioreactor included moving bed media and was thus operated as an hmbr while the other contained only activated sludge and was operated as a conventional mbr a schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a mesh screen was used to confine the biocarriers to one half of the hmbr this was done to prevent the biocarriers from contacting the membrane module hollow fibre polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm were used for microfiltration these modules were developed and tested in house 19 bioportz biocarriers were selected as the moving bed media for use in the hmbr a mature biofilm was established over the course of five months prior to testing under the same operating conditions used throughout the study this produced a stable biofilm mass of 896 56 mg vss l of biocarriers the biofilm mass was measured gravimetrically using a drying temperature of 105 c for a minimum of 2 h in order to better understand the impact of the biofilms on treatment performance both bioreactors were operated at a total biomass concentration suspended attached equivalent to approximately 2700 mg l vss the hmbr thus differed from the mbr only in that a portion of the suspended biomass was replaced with the biomass attached to the biocarriers the biomass concentrations within each system are shown in table 2 the bioreactors were operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h a solids retention time srt of 40 d a membrane flux of 3 4 l m2 h and an aeration rate of 0 4 m3 h the temperature ph and dissolved oxygen concentrations were maintained at 18 1 c 7 3 0 2 and 3 1 mg l respectively 2 3 analytical methods untreated wastewater samples were collected from the wastewater inlets located at the back of each bioreactor the treated wastewater samples were collected from the permeate outlets located at the front of each bioreactor these samples were then analyzed directly hach water quality test kits were used for the determination of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrite nitrate and total phosphorus tp total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn was calculated using eq 1 1 t k n t n n o 2 n o 3 mixed liquor suspended solids and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined using the procedures found in the standard methods 20 turbidity was measured using a hach 2100n turbidimeter and ph was measured using an inolab 730 ph meter biochemical oxygen demand was determined using the oxitop c measuring heads and co100 controller dilute mixed liquor was used as the bacteria seed solution all samples were analyzed in triplicate statistical analyses for comparison of the means were done using a matched pair t test for each water quality parameter p values 0 05 were considered to be significant treatment performance was evaluated at hmbr biocarrier filling ratios bfrs of 10 20 30 and 40 with the mbr acting as a control system for comparison untreated and treated greywater samples were analyzed once a week for four weeks at each filling ratio starting at 40 the duration of each phase therefore lasted one month followed by a 2 week acclimation period in which the filling ratio was adjusted for the next phase lower filling ratios were achieved by subtracting biocarriers from the hmbr until the desired volume of biocarriers remained during this time the mlss concentrations were readjusted so that both the hmbr and mbr operated at equivalent total biomass concentrations 3 results and discussion the removal efficiencies of each bioreactor throughout the experiment are shown in table 3 the removal efficiencies of each parameter are discussed in detail in the following sections 3 1 organics removal the removal of organic pollutants was measured in terms of cod and bod5 both bioreactors exhibited equivalent removal efficiencies for each of these parameters throughout experimentation with averages of 92 and 97 for each parameter respectively the removal efficiencies did not appear to be affected by the filling ratio of the hmbr which suggests that the degradation of the organic pollutants was not affected by the type of biomass suspended or attached at the filling ratios examined in this research it is likely that both bioreactors demonstrated comparable performances because the total biomasses within each bioreactor were kept constant and equal to each other throughout experimentation substituting a portion of suspended biomass for biomass attached to the biocarriers did not affect the cod or bod5 removal efficiencies within the hmbr the cod and bod5 concentrations in the treated wastewater are shown in fig 2 the average cod residuals were 16 4 mg cod l and 17 4 mg cod l for the hmbr and mbr while the average bod5 residuals were 4 2 mg bod l for both bioreactors the canadian guidelines for greywater reclamation recommend a median and maximum bod5 of 10 and 20 mg bod l respectively 18 as such both bioreactors were able to produce treated water capable of meeting this guideline 3 2 nitrogen removal the removal of nitrogen was measured in terms of total nitrogen total kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonia with average removal efficiencies of 66 74 and 93 for the hmbr and 58 71 and 88 for the mbr the hmbr exhibited significantly greater tn and ammonia removal efficiencies than the mbr throughout experimentation p 0 0002 for tn and p 0 0017 for ammonia the tn tkn and ammonia concentrations in the treated wastewater are shown in figs 3 and 4 the average tn residuals were 2 18 0 27 mg n l and 2 67 0 34 mg n l for the hmbr and mbr while the average ammonia residuals were 0 225 0 192 mg nh3 n l and 0 374 0 239 mg nh3 n l for the hmbr and mbr respectively the percentage of total nitrogen removed via assimilation was estimated to be 42 based on the rate of nitrogen entering the bioreactors in the wastewater feed and exiting the bioreactors in the form of waste sludge the percentage of total nitrogen retained in the treated water was approximately 34 for the hmbr and 42 for the mbr consequently the percentage of total nitrogen removed via denitrification was estimated to be 24 and 16 for the hmbr and mbr respectively thus despite both bioreactors operating at equivalent total biomass concentrations the hmbr appeared to exhibit a greater degree of total nitrogen removal these improvements were attributed to the presence of the biofilms in the hmbr within the hmbr the retention of sludge on the biocarriers enabled the biofilms to have a higher srt than the suspended biomass the biocarriers thus provided a better environment for nitrifying bacteria 11 which develop more slowly than heterotrophic bacteria consequently the nitrifiers present in the mixed liquor floc were more vulnerable to washout during sludge wasting 21 this may be a problem for conventional mbr systems since all of the nitrifiers are located within the floc the loss of nitrifiers due to washout was thus considered as a possible explanation for the differences in ammonia oxidation observed between the two systems however in this experiment both systems were operated using a long srt of 40 d which virtually eliminated the risk of washout from occurring within either bioreactor therefore the differences in treatment performance were unlikely to be caused by insufficient nitrification in the mbr rather the differences were likely caused by an increase in nitrification in the hmbr due to the substitution of suspended biomass for attached biomass this was supported by the observed ammonia and nitrite concentrations in the hmbr permeate which were significantly lower than the mbr permeate p 0 0004 as shown in fig 4 the average nitrite residuals were 0 044 0 030 mg no 2 n l and 0 081 0 034 mg no 2 n l for the hmbr and mbr respectively a more significant consequence of the biocarriers was their ability to increase the denitrifying capacity of the hmbr denitrification is facilitated by facultative anaerobic bacteria which utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor for this to occur oxygen must be present at very low concentrations within the mbr low oxygen zones were generally limited to the interior regions of the floc as mentioned previously mbr systems are reported to have smaller floc sizes compared to those found in conventional activated sludge processes 10 smaller floc sizes reduce the size of the anoxic zone within the interior of the floc consequently denitrification is reduced within the hmbr additional habitat was available for the denitrifiers within the biofilms where oxygen diffusion is limited 22 23 as a result the hmbr was able to achieve higher levels of denitrification it was anticipated that the treated effluent samples taken from the hmbr would exhibit lower concentrations of nitrate due to the snd processes occurring within the biocarriers the nitrate concentrations in the treated wastewater are shown in fig 5 the average nitrate residuals were 0 547 0 188 mg no 3 n l and 0 819 0 287 mg no 3 n l for the hmbr and mbr respectively the concentrations present in the hmbr permeate were significantly lower than those found in the mbr permeate p 0 0002 the biocarrier filling ratio did not appear to have a strong effect on nitrogen removal throughout experimentation and the two parameters appeared to be uncorrelated it was anticipated that denitrification and by extension total nitrogen removal would increase in proportion to an increase in filling ratio since a larger volume of biocarriers increases the total nitrifying denitrifying capacity of the reactor however this was not observed this may have resulted in part from the low nitrogen concentrations in the influent greywater 3 3 phosphorus removal the removal of phosphorus was measured in terms of total phosphorus both bioreactors exhibited equivalent tp removal efficiencies which averaged 90 throughout experimentation the tp concentrations in the treated wastewater are shown in fig 5 often the tp residual concentrations were below the detection limit in these instances a value equal to the detection limit was used for removal efficiency calculations the average tp residuals were recorded as 0 051 0 001 mg po 4 3 p l for both bioreactors the untreated greywater collected in this experiment contained low concentrations of phosphorus with an average value of 0 499 0 154 mg po 4 3 p l a c n p ratio of 100 5 1 is often used as a benchmark for aerobic wastewater treatment processes 24 the greywater treated in this experiment had an average c n p ratio of 100 4 4 0 4 therefore the microorganisms received less than half of the phosphorus recommended for growth and maintenance the low sludge wastage rate of 0 9 l d provided some compensation for this by reducing the amount of phosphorus leaving the system in the form of waste sludge nevertheless the insufficient amount of phosphorus in the greywater feed created a high demand for phosphorus within the bioreactors as a result tp residuals in the treated water were regularly below the limit of detection causing both bioreactors to exhibit equally high removal efficiencies 4 conclusions this research set out to compare the overall treatment performance of an hmbr to a conventional mbr for greywater reclamation from these experiments the following conclusions were found 1 the hmbr improved total nitrogen and ammonia removal by 8 and 5 on average throughout experimentation 2 these improvements were uncorrelated to the filling ratio and only a small amount of biocarriers bfr 10 were needed to significantly alter the snd processes within the hmbr it is likely that the nutrient poor characteristics of the greywater feed limited the benefits of the biocarriers 3 the hmbr did not improve cod or bod5 removal the total amount of biomass regardless of its form suspended or attached appeared to be the most significant factor affecting cod and bod5 removal at the filling ratios tested in this research these findings suggest that the hmbr greywater treatment system provided better treatment performance than the mbr while both systems were operated under comparable conditions these improvements in treatment performance were attributed to the presence of biofilms within the hmbr acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial contributions of the natural sciences and engineering research council of

significantly lower than the mbr permeate p 0 0004 as shown in fig 4 the average nitrite residuals were 0 044 0 030 mg no 2 n l and 0 081 0 034 mg no 2 n l for the hmbr and mbr respectively a more significant consequence of the biocarriers was their ability to increase the denitrifying capacity of the hmbr denitrification is facilitated by facultative anaerobic bacteria which utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor for this to occur oxygen must be present at very low concentrations within the mbr low oxygen zones were generally limited to the interior regions of the floc as mentioned previously mbr systems are reported to have smaller floc sizes compared to those found in conventional activated sludge processes 10 smaller floc sizes reduce the size of the anoxic zone within the interior of the floc consequently denitrification is reduced within the hmbr additional habitat was available for the denitrifiers within the biofilms where oxygen diffusion is limited 22 23 as a result the hmbr was able to achieve higher levels of denitrification it was anticipated that the treated effluent samples taken from the hmbr would exhibit lower concentrations of nitrate due to the snd processes occurring within the biocarriers the nitrate concentrations in the treated wastewater are shown in fig 5 the average nitrate residuals were 0 547 0 188 mg no 3 n l and 0 819 0 287 mg no 3 n l for the hmbr and mbr respectively the concentrations present in the hmbr permeate were significantly lower than those found in the mbr permeate p 0 0002 the biocarrier filling ratio did not appear to have a strong effect on nitrogen removal throughout experimentation and the two parameters appeared to be uncorrelated it was anticipated that denitrification and by extension total nitrogen removal would increase in proportion to an increase in filling ratio since a larger volume of biocarriers increases the total nitrifying denitrifying capacity of the reactor however this was not observed this may have resulted in part from the low nitrogen concentrations in the influent greywater 3 3 phosphorus removal the removal of phosphorus was measured in terms of total phosphorus both bioreactors exhibited equivalent tp removal efficiencies which averaged 90 throughout experimentation the tp concentrations in the treated wastewater are shown in fig 5 often the tp residual concentrations were below the detection limit in these instances a value equal to the detection limit was used for removal efficiency calculations the average tp residuals were recorded as 0 051 0 001 mg po 4 3 p l for both bioreactors the untreated greywater collected in this experiment contained low concentrations of phosphorus with an average value of 0 499 0 154 mg po 4 3 p l a c n p ratio of 100 5 1 is often used as a benchmark for aerobic wastewater treatment processes 24 the greywater treated in this experiment had an average c n p ratio of 100 4 4 0 4 therefore the microorganisms received less than half of the phosphorus recommended for growth and maintenance the low sludge wastage rate of 0 9 l d provided some compensation for this by reducing the amount of phosphorus leaving the system in the form of waste sludge nevertheless the insufficient amount of phosphorus in the greywater feed created a high demand for phosphorus within the bioreactors as a result tp residuals in the treated water were regularly below the limit of detection causing both bioreactors to exhibit equally high removal efficiencies 4 conclusions this research set out to compare the overall treatment performance of an hmbr to a conventional mbr for greywater reclamation from these experiments the following conclusions were found 1 the hmbr improved total nitrogen and ammonia removal by 8 and 5 on average throughout experimentation 2 these improvements were uncorrelated to the filling ratio and only a small amount of biocarriers bfr 10 were needed to significantly alter the snd processes within the hmbr it is likely that the nutrient poor characteristics of the greywater feed limited the benefits of the biocarriers 3 the hmbr did not improve cod or bod5 removal the total amount of biomass regardless of its form suspended or attached appeared to be the most significant factor affecting cod and bod5 removal at the filling ratios tested in this research these findings suggest that the hmbr greywater treatment system provided better treatment performance than the mbr while both systems were operated under comparable conditions these improvements in treatment performance were attributed to the presence of biofilms within the hmbr acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial contributions of the natural sciences and engineering research council of

14432,wastewater samples were collected from the main hospital s effluent hww influents and effluents of the old wastewater treatment plant owwtp built in 1990 and the new one nwwtp built in 2010 located in doha qatar analytical methods were optimized to determine the concentrations of eight selected antibiotics abs penicillin amoxicillin gentamicin ciprofloxacin tetracycline erythromycin metronidazole and clavulanic acid samples were prepared through automated solid phase extraction spe before analysis using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms with positive ion electrospray among the eight target compounds tested recoveries were obtained in the range of 47 5 98 the highest concentration of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin were detected in the hww at levels of 5 46 μg l and 1 99 μg l respectively in effluents samples collected from both wwtps clavulanic acid was the most prominent compound at concentration of 84 74 μg l the highest concentration of erythromycin 7 20 μg l was detected in the influent sample collected from owwtp amoxicillin penicillin and erythromycin were below the detection limit 0 1 μg l there was a significant statistical correlation between the concentrations of most of the studied antibiotics ciprofloxacin was highly correlated with erythromycin clavulanic acid and metronidazole in all influent samples whereas the concentration of erythromycin was highly correlated with those of amoxicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline and penicillin in all effluent samples no significant difference p 0 05 was found between concentrations of the targeted antibiotics in the nwwtp and owwtp generally both treatment plants showed effective removal rates 99 44 of penicillin and metronidazole however clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin were not removed from the effluent of either plant even though the effluent passed through the ultrafiltration stage in the new wwtp the findings reveal that hww is not the only source of abs in wastewater but direct disposal onto the sewer system could be the major source the study calls for further investigation of additional pharmaceuticals and other emerging contaminants in the wastewater of qatar as well as their metabolites and biodegradation products as well as application of advanced treatment technologies for highest removal rate and safe water reuse options keywords antibiotics hospital wastewater domestic wastewater removal rates lc ms 1 introduction researchers extended their investigations beyond common contaminants such as dioxins pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs to emerging contaminants including endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs like pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps which enter aquatic environments through municipal waste 1 2 3 this approach was coupled with the improvement of sensitive and selective analytical protocols and procedures aiming at lowering the limit of detection of a wide range of xenobiotics in different environmental matrices pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have been quantified in most of the aquatic environments in north america and europe 4 11 there are more than 3000 different substances that are being used in medicine such as analgesics antibiotics hormone contraceptives beta blockers lipid regulators 12 a recent classification of antibiotics was established by gothwal and shashidhar 13 where the mechanism of action is described table 1 during and after therapy humans and animals excrete a combination of metabolized and unmetabolized antibiotics between 30 90 of an administered dose of most antibiotics to human and animals are excreted in the urine as the active substance 14 16 therefore there are multiple transport pathways for a wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals to enter and persist in the environment the human population contributes to the spread of antibiotic residues into the environment either via excretion of pharmaceuticals during the normal course of treatment or by improperly disposing unused medication in toilets 12 thus many bioactive compounds enter the aquatic environment mainly through wastewaters and receiving water without any pretreatment 12 hospitals clinics health care centers pharmaceutical and drug industries and wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered the major sources of antibiotic spread in the environment antibiotics were detected in surface water 3 rivers 17 groundwater 18 drinking water 19 tap water 20 soil 21 sediments 22 wastewater 23 and sewage sludge wwtps have been found to act as a reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria 24 25 a study found that worldwide antibiotic consumption has increased by 30 between 2000 and 2010 26 brazil russia india china and south africa were responsible for more than three quarters of that increase cephalosporins penicillins and fluoroquinolones were among the 16 classes of antibiotics accounted for more than 50 of that increase with consumption rate of 55 27 data on the antibiotic consumption are limited however according to al faham et al 28 and bin abdulhak et al 29 78 and 87 of antibiotics are dispensed without prescription in saudi arabia and syria respectively hospital wastewater hww is constantly discharged into wastewater networks and then into municipal wwtps 30 32 regardless of the fact that these wwtps are not designed to remove ultra trace organic compounds such as ppcps 4 33 34 specific antibiotics such as antineoplasic or diagnostic agents which are only used in hospitals require special sewage treatment process to reduce their emission to the environment 35 36 biological and chemical treatment methods were developed to remove contaminants including pharmaceuticals from wastewater these methods include conventional activated sludge 37 38 membrane bioreactors mbrs 39 43 moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs 44 advanced material nanotechnology advanced oxidation ozone coupled with disinfectants and electrochemistry techniques golovko et al 45 investigated the seasonal changes in the concentrations of 21 pharmaceuticals in wwtp in české budějovice czech republic over a period of 12 months the authors found that the level of most pharmaceuticals was higher during winter hirsch et al 5 determined the concentrations of 18 antibiotics representing four antibiotic classes macrolides sulfonamides penicillins and tetracyclines in german wwtp effluents groundwater and surface waters penicillins were not detected possibly because they are susceptible to hydrolysis in water 46 likewise tetracyclines were not detected because they can potentially precipitate with calcium and other similar cations 5 analytical supported studies on the presence of ppcps and their metabolites in wastewaters of the gulf cooperation council gcc countries are almost absent largely due to social and technical reasons these reasons include lack of policies regulations requiring the investigation measurement and reporting on such contaminants ignorance of wastewater treatment plant operators lack of resources diversity of society structure limited number of qualified analytical labs supported with sufficiently sensitive and selective analytical tools different origins and markets of pharmaceuticals presence of combined sewage systems where medical municipal and industrial wastewater are merged and disposed to treatment plants high consumption of water per capita per day and resulting dilution of wastewater very limited wastewater reuse strategies and action plans advanced wastewater treatment technologies including membranes only recently a study carried out in saudi arabia reported the detection of 12 pharmaceuticals in the influents and effluents of two hospital wastewater treatment plants 46 there is lack of policies and regulations dictating the measurement of contaminants of emerging concern including pcps and antibiotics at the source hospitals and industries additionally no regulation or enforcement tools for hospital pretreatment to assure reduction of antibiotics at the upstream within the regular monitoring and inspection strategies studies on antibiotics behavior within wastewater plants in the region are limited this study was carried out to determine their concentrations in the effluent wastewater of the main hospital of doha hww additionally same antibiotics were determined in influents and effluents of the two main wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the capital doha objectives of the study include optimization of sample preparation and extraction using solid phase extraction spe method followed by a sensitive analytical method of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms to determine the concentrations of main eight antibiotics penicillin amoxicillin gentamicin ciprofloxacin tetracycline erythromycin metronidazole and clavulanic acid highly consumed in qatar the results have been used to evaluate the removal rate of these antibiotics in wwtps for better treated wastewater reuse options in the country 2 methodology 2 1 sampling locations and collection in july and august 2016 five locations were

then stored at 20 c working standard solutions were diluted from the stock solutions for sample analysis and then stored in the refrigerator at 2 8 c an internal standard 13c2 erythromycin was purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories inc andover mi usa the internal standard was chosen for its mass spectrometric response in positive and negative ionization mode its hplc retention times which was in the same range as the target ab compounds and its recovery range in the experimental conditions 2 3 selection of cartridges for solid phase extraction spe for the highest recovery of

from exactive operating manual p n 1288120 revision c the mass ranges for the targeted antibiotics were 172 to 736 m z the sensitivity of the lc ms was optimized based on the previous methods of hirsch et al 48 and lindsey et al 47 the targeted compound concentrations were calculated from 7 point calibration curves from 0 1 to 100 μg l with internal standard quantitation and a calibration curve was established for each reference standard optimization of the chromatographic separation was carried out using three different hplc columns hypersil gold aq hydrophilic interaction liquid

out to validate all analyses the analytical method of the lc ms was validated through the 7 point calibration curves which were established for each certified reference standard the best fitted line of r 2 1 or at least 0 99 was obtained 2 8 statistical analysis data were analyzed using the stata statistical software package statacorp 2011 release 12 college station tx statacorp lp since more than two compounds were tested two way multivariate analysis of variance manova was performed to obtain an overall estimation of the effects of treatment plant type and treatment stages before and after on the concentrations of the target compounds together with the interactions between them bivariate relationships between the target compound concentrations in the wastewater before and after treatment between the two treatment plants owwtp and nwwtp was calculated using pearson s correlation coefficient the removal efficiency of the method used at each treatment plant was calculated using the following formula r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c e c 0 x 100 where c0 initial concentration before treatment of the target compound in the wastewater ce final concentration after treatment of the target compound in the wastewater 3 results and discussion within the optimization processes of the selected cartridges and lcms columns oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridge 60 mg provided higher recoveries for almost all of the compounds tested in this study therefore it was selected for the extraction of antibiotics from wastewater this agrees with several studies 47 49 51 additionally the results of the lcms showed that the hypersil gold c18 column gave the highest chromatographic resolution and narrower chromatographic peak shapes and therefore this column was selected to analyze the wastewater samples table 3 among the eight targeted antibiotics only gentamicin was not recovered through any of the three cartridges this agrees with several studies and observations 52 51 53 which attributed the difficulty in detecting gentamicin a β lactam antibiotic to instability in water table 4 consequently gentamicin results are not presented or discussed further in the present study the results of antibiotics in the samples of hospital wastewater hww are shown in table 5 while the results of the old and new wastewater treatment plants are given in table 6 removal ratios of antibiotics in the old and new wastewater treatment plants are given in table 7 however removal does not necessarily mean complete degradation it could be partly due to degradation and partly due to sorption and volatilization consequently analyses of degradation products are needed based on manova analysis there was no significant difference p 0 05 in terms of removal efficiency between the old wastewater treatment plant owwp and the new wastewater treatment plant nwwp however the treatment methods used in both plants showed a significant effect p 0 05 in reducing the concentrations of most antibiotics in effluent samples indicating the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment alone only removal of antibiotics from the influent wastewater depends on many factors mainly the complexity and chemical properties treatment technologies and processes physical and biochemical conditions removal efficiency is very critical for the end use of the treated wastewater irrigation groundwater aquifer recharge industrial applications etc generally the findings of table 7 reveal that each antibiotic of the selected ones behaves differently regardless of whether obtained from the old or new treatment facilities while penicillin and tetracycline were removed in the amounts 96 and 19 respectively in the owwtp they have not been removed in the nwwtp however some antibiotics showed the same behavior and removal rates for both old and new wwtps such as erythromycin and amoxicillin the study of roberts and thomas 54 showed that removal rates of antibiotics in the wwtps can differ by up to 99 the study found removal efficiency rates for tetracycline of 19 as it is adsorbed to particulate matter while higher removal efficiency rates of 86 were observed for erythromycin which is relatively persistent in the environment 55 clavulanic acid in hww was detected in two groups of the samples while the first and the fourth one showed concentrations lower than the limit of detection 0 1 μg l the range was between 12 and 41 μg l and the difference could be explained by the special season of sampling the second group of sampling occurred in september and october 2015 where thousands of people should be healthy before going to pilgrimage of that year it is important to mention that according to the regulations and visa requirements of the authorities of saudi arabia people go to pilgrimage must be vaccinated for a group of diseases additionally the people consume antibiotics to show their health suitability for pilgrimage mainly against bacterial infections this agrees also with the findings of the owwtp influent for the same antibiotic in that season the highest concentration of clavulanic acid 85 μg l was detected in the influent samples of the owwtp the samples of owwtp were collected in september and october 2015 directly before pilgrimage hajj season where pilgrims might have been treated with clavulanic acid during this period surprisingly although the highest concentration of clavulanic acid in the effluent of the major hospital of the country was 41 μg l it was found that its concentration 85 μg l in the influent of the owwtp was doubled this could be due to other sources not limited to the hospitals and clinics but could be the domestic wastewater in that season where people discard the rest of antibiotics in the toilets and kitchen sinks metronidazole was detected in all hww of ranges of 1 to 5 μg l however its concentration in all collected samples from the influent and effluent of both treatment plants was less than 1 μg l with the exception of the first group of samples where the average concentration in the influent of the owwtp was 3 μg l similarly high level of metronidazole presence in hww samples correlated with the hajj season indicating that its use increased during this season amoxicillin was detected in the first two groups of the hww samples at an average concentration of 0 6 μg l all samples of the treatment plants showed low concentrations of amoxicillin and the removal rate was very high effluents 0 01 μg l regardless the degree of treatment of both owwtp and nwwtp the low concentration of amoxicillin in the samples of october 2015 indicate that this antibiotic might not have been prescribed during that season similarly amoxicillin was also low in all samples of wwtps in catalonia spain amoxicillin was detected in hww at a level of 2 18 μg l and in two wwtps effluent at concentrations of 2 16 and 2 58 μg l this comparison demonstrates that amoxicillin is commonly used and treatment facilities of these two wwtps in catalonia were not able to eliminate it no significant difference was observed in the concentration of ciprofloxacin in all samples of hww on the other hand a recent study of al qarni et al 46 for hww of saudi arabia showed average concentrations of 5 61 μg l while an older comprehensive study by hirsch et al 5 in germany showed a wide range of ciprofloxacin concentrations 3 87 μg l in treated wastewater groundwater and surface water tetracycline was almost absent from the hospital wastewater and it was found in the first sampling campaign with an average of 0 2 μg l surprisingly its average concentration in all influent samples of the two wwtps was 0 2 μg l and the two plants were able to remove it from the final effluent compared to the other antibiotics tetracycline was not detected during hajj season in hww in the study of meritxell et al tetracycline was below the lower limit of detection in all hww and in the three wwtps influent or effluent samples of spain generally penicillin was found with lower concentrations of the hww 0 1 μg l compared to the influent of the wwtps 0 3 μg l the absence of penicillin from the samples could be due to the fact that it is susceptible to hydrolysis however the highest concentration of penicillin 0 7 μg l was detected in the influent samples collected from the nwwtp during the hajj season one composite sample of the hww showed high concentrations of erythromycin where the average was 5 17 μg l and this sample was collected during the hajj season however it was low or even below the instrumental limit of detection for all samples of the two wwtps similarly erythromycin was also not detected in either the influents or effluents of hwwtps in saudi arabia 46 there was a significant correlation between most of the studied antibiotics the results demonstrated that ciprofloxacin was highly correlated with erythromycin clavulanic acid and metronidazole in all influent samples table 8 nevertheless erythromycin was highly correlated with amoxicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline and penicillin in all effluent samples suggesting that these targets were quite stable in the wastewater table 9 based on tables 8 and 9 it can be clearly observed that a significant correlation between tetracycline ciprofloxacin penicillin and erythromycin amoxicillin exists in all samples collected after treatment suggesting that these targets were quite stable in the wastewater table 10 illustrates the presence of a significant correlation between metronidazole and ciprofloxacin in the presence of amoxicillin other antibiotics were also found to be influential such as penicillin was highly correlated with both amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin and erythromycin was correlated with both amoxicillin and penicillin in the influent samples collected from the nwwtp a significant correlation between metronidazole and ciprofloxacin penicillin with clavulanic acid erythromycin with metronidazole ciprofloxacin was also observed in the influent samples collected from the owwtp table 11 the occurrence of metronidazole penicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline erythromycin ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was also correlated in the effluent samples collected from the nwwtp table 12 table 13 shows a significant correlation between clavulanic acid with both metronidazole and ciprofloxacin metronidazole and ciprofloxacin amoxicillin with both penicillin and erythromycin penicillin with erythromycin in the effluent samples collected from the owwtp penicillin and amoxicillin belong to the same antibiotic class i e β lactam hence their interaction is expected in both influent and effluent samples ciprofloxacin has also been found to interact with clavulanic acid metronidazole and amoxicillin in influent wastewater samples 4 conclusions the optimized conditions of the lc ms selected cartridges of the spe and qc qa procedures showed a successful sensitive methodology for the determination of seven antibiotics penicillin amoxicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline erythromycin metronidazole and clavulanic acid in the hospital and municipal wastewater of doha qatar among the seven antibiotics tested metronidazole and ciprofloxacin were the most abundant types especially in the hww at concentrations of 5 46 μg l and 1 99 μg l respectively penicillin was spotted in the influent samples 0 69 μg l collected from the nwwtp while clavulanic acid 84 74 μg l was still present in the effluent of nwwtp in the samples collected from owwtp erythromycin 7 20 μg l and tetracycline 0 2 μg l were the most prominent antibiotics the levels of amoxicillin penicillin and erythromycin were below the detection limit of 0 1 μg l or even not detected in most of the samples collected from hww and both wwtps the statistical analysis shows that there is no significant difference p 0 05 between owwtp and nwwtp and the methods used in both of the wwtps are effective in reducing removing penicillin and metronidazole nwwtp was effective to remove penicillin with percent reduction 99 34 on average furthermore owwtp was effective to remove metronidazole with removal efficiency 90 22 on average clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin were not removed from nwwtp nor from owwtp however existing treatment facilities within these treatment plants are unable to remove all the studied antibiotics new and advanced methods could be used to remove such contaminants including reverse osmosis ro advanced oxidation o3 and h2o2 and or electrochemical treatment the results revealed that concentrations of antibiotics in the influent wastewater are the same as or even higher their concentrations in the effluent water of the main hospital this confirms that the source is not limited to hospitals and clinics but the direct disposal into the sewer system presence of antibiotics in the treated wastewater of qatar is one of the limiting factors for reuse options especially irrigation and groundwater recharge such emerging contaminants call for optimization of the existing treatment processes and introduce further and advanced treatment technologies including advanced oxidation ozonation hydrogen peroxide when removed the huge amounts 800 000 m3 day of treated wastewater can add significant value to the water budget at the country level and improve the quality of harsh arid environment of qatar as well as enhance public perception of using treated wastewater in several applications e g irrigation landscaping district cooling

normal course of treatment or by improperly disposing unused medication in toilets 12 thus many bioactive compounds enter the aquatic environment mainly through wastewaters and receiving water without any pretreatment 12 hospitals clinics health care centers pharmaceutical and drug industries and wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered the major sources of antibiotic spread in the environment antibiotics were detected in surface water 3 rivers 17 groundwater 18 drinking water 19 tap water 20 soil 21 sediments 22 wastewater 23 and sewage sludge wwtps have been found to act as a reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria 24 25 a study found that worldwide antibiotic consumption has increased by 30 between 2000 and 2010 26 brazil russia india china and south africa were responsible for more than three quarters of that increase cephalosporins penicillins and fluoroquinolones were among the 16 classes of antibiotics accounted for more than 50 of that increase with consumption rate of 55 27 data on the antibiotic consumption are limited however according to al faham et al 28 and bin abdulhak et al 29 78 and 87 of antibiotics are dispensed without prescription in saudi arabia and syria respectively hospital wastewater hww is constantly discharged into wastewater networks and then into municipal wwtps 30 32 regardless of the fact that these wwtps are not designed to remove ultra trace organic compounds such as ppcps 4 33 34 specific antibiotics such as antineoplasic or diagnostic agents which are only used in hospitals require special sewage treatment process to reduce their emission to the environment 35 36 biological and chemical treatment methods were developed to remove contaminants including pharmaceuticals from wastewater these methods include conventional activated sludge 37 38 membrane bioreactors mbrs 39 43 moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs 44 advanced material nanotechnology advanced oxidation ozone coupled with disinfectants and electrochemistry techniques golovko et al 45 investigated the seasonal changes in the concentrations of 21 pharmaceuticals in wwtp in české budějovice czech republic over a period of 12 months the authors found that the level of most pharmaceuticals was higher during winter hirsch et al 5 determined the concentrations of 18 antibiotics representing four antibiotic classes macrolides sulfonamides penicillins and tetracyclines in german wwtp effluents groundwater and surface waters penicillins were not detected possibly because they are susceptible to hydrolysis in water 46 likewise tetracyclines were not detected because they can potentially precipitate with calcium and other similar cations 5 analytical supported studies on the presence of ppcps and their metabolites in wastewaters of the gulf cooperation council gcc countries are almost absent largely due to social and technical reasons these reasons include lack of policies regulations requiring the investigation measurement and reporting on such contaminants ignorance of wastewater treatment plant operators lack of resources diversity of society structure limited number of qualified analytical labs supported with sufficiently sensitive and selective analytical tools different origins and markets of pharmaceuticals presence of combined sewage systems where medical municipal and industrial wastewater are merged and disposed to treatment plants high consumption of water per capita per day and resulting dilution of wastewater very limited wastewater reuse strategies and action plans advanced wastewater treatment technologies including membranes only recently a study carried out in saudi arabia reported the detection of 12 pharmaceuticals in the influents and effluents of two hospital wastewater treatment plants 46 there is lack of policies and regulations dictating the measurement of contaminants of emerging concern including pcps and antibiotics at the source hospitals and industries additionally no regulation or enforcement tools for hospital pretreatment to assure reduction of antibiotics at the upstream within the regular monitoring and inspection strategies studies on antibiotics behavior within wastewater plants in the region are limited this study was carried out to determine their concentrations in the effluent wastewater of the main hospital of doha hww additionally same antibiotics were determined in influents and effluents of the two main wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the capital doha objectives of the study include optimization of sample preparation and extraction using solid phase extraction spe method followed by a sensitive analytical method of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms to determine the concentrations of main eight antibiotics penicillin amoxicillin gentamicin ciprofloxacin tetracycline erythromycin metronidazole and clavulanic acid highly consumed in qatar the results have been used to evaluate the removal rate of these antibiotics in wwtps for better treated wastewater reuse options in the country 2 methodology 2 1 sampling locations and collection in july and august 2016 five locations were identified to make a total of 60 grab samples 12 samples from each location the five locations were the manhole of the central hospital wastewater effluent the new wastewater treatment plant nwwtp influent the new wastewater treatment plant effluent the old wastewater treatment plant owwtp influent and the old wastewater treatment plant effluent the nwwtp receives the major part of domestic and hospital wastewater while the owwtp is limited to receive tankers of septic tanks development and research agenda are given to the nwwtp where reverse osmosis ro system and ultra violet uv unit will be added the selection of these five locations was based on the potential sources of antibiotics the efficiency removal of these antibiotics by comparing their concentrations in the influent and effluent of the two main wwtps in doha qatar a brief summary showing the major differences between the two plants is given in table 2 samples were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles immediately

nwwtp is given in fig 1 2 2 chemicals and reagents eight antibiotic standards penicillin amoxicillin gentamicin ciprofloxacin tetracycline erythromycin metronidazole and clavulanic acid were purchased from sigma aldrich llc st louis mo usa antibiotics were selected based on the frequency of prescribed usage of the major hospital located in doha according to the analytical method of hirsch et al 5 1 mg of the powder form of each of the following antibiotics penicillin amoxicillin tetracycline and erythromycin was dissolved in 1 ml 100 methanol similarly 1 mg of ciprofloxacin was dissolved in 1 ml

then stored at 20 c working standard solutions were diluted from the stock solutions for sample analysis and then stored in the refrigerator at 2 8 c an internal standard 13c2 erythromycin was purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories inc andover mi usa the internal standard was chosen for its mass spectrometric response in positive and negative ionization mode its hplc retention times which was in the same range as the target ab compounds and its recovery range in the experimental conditions 2 3 selection of cartridges for solid phase extraction spe for the highest recovery of polar to moderately polar antibiotic compounds three types of cartridges were tested namely thermo scientific dionex solex cartridge 6 ml endcapped c18 1 g thermo scientific pn 074410 oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridge 60 mg and oasis mixed mode cation exchange mcx cartridge 60 mg waters inc milford ma usa preliminary experiments were performed with milli q water six

concentrated to 1 ml using nitrogen gas in thermo scientific reacti vap evaporator at 25 c 2 5 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms with a positive ion electrospray esi using targeted selected ion monitoring t sim was performed the q exactive mass spectrometer sn01757l thermo fisher scientific inc whatham ma usa was connected to lpg

from exactive operating manual p n 1288120 revision c the mass ranges for the targeted antibiotics were 172 to 736 m z the sensitivity of the lc ms was optimized based on the previous methods of hirsch et al 48 and lindsey et al 47 the targeted compound concentrations were calculated from 7 point calibration curves from 0 1 to 100 μg l with internal standard quantitation and a calibration curve was established for each reference standard optimization of the chromatographic separation was carried out using three different hplc columns hypersil gold aq hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic and hypersil gold c18 thermo fisher scientific inc whatham ma usa 2 6 lc conditions analytes were separated using hypersil gold c18 100 x 2 1 mm mobile phase a was 0 1 formic acid

out to validate all analyses the analytical method of the lc ms was validated through the 7 point calibration curves which were established for each certified reference standard the best fitted line of r 2 1 or at least 0 99 was obtained 2 8 statistical analysis data were analyzed using the stata statistical software package statacorp 2011 release 12 college station tx statacorp lp since more than two compounds were tested two way multivariate analysis of variance manova was performed to obtain an overall estimation of the effects of treatment plant type and treatment stages before and after on the concentrations of the target compounds together with the interactions between them bivariate relationships between the target compound concentrations in the wastewater before and after treatment between the two treatment plants owwtp and nwwtp was calculated using pearson s correlation coefficient the removal efficiency of the method used at each treatment plant was calculated using the following formula r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c e c 0 x 100 where c0 initial concentration before treatment of the target compound in the wastewater ce final concentration after treatment of the target compound in the wastewater 3 results and discussion within the optimization processes of the selected cartridges and lcms columns oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridge 60 mg provided higher recoveries for almost all of the compounds tested in this study therefore it was selected for the extraction of antibiotics from wastewater this agrees with several studies 47 49 51 additionally the results of the lcms showed that the hypersil gold c18 column gave the highest chromatographic resolution and narrower chromatographic peak shapes and therefore this column was selected to analyze the wastewater samples table 3 among the eight targeted antibiotics only gentamicin was not recovered through any of the three cartridges this agrees with several studies and observations 52 51 53 which attributed the difficulty in detecting gentamicin a β lactam antibiotic to instability in water table 4 consequently gentamicin results are not presented or discussed further in the present study the results of antibiotics in the samples of hospital wastewater hww are shown in table 5 while the results of the old and new wastewater treatment plants are given in table 6 removal ratios of antibiotics in the old and new wastewater treatment plants are given in table 7 however removal does not necessarily mean complete degradation it could be partly due to degradation and partly due to sorption and volatilization consequently analyses of degradation products are needed based on manova analysis there was no significant difference p 0 05 in terms of removal efficiency between the old wastewater treatment plant owwp and the new wastewater treatment plant nwwp however the treatment methods used in both plants showed a significant effect p 0 05 in reducing the concentrations of most antibiotics in effluent samples indicating the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment alone only removal of antibiotics from the influent wastewater depends on many factors mainly the complexity and chemical properties treatment technologies and processes physical and biochemical conditions removal efficiency is very critical for the end use of the treated wastewater irrigation groundwater aquifer recharge industrial applications etc generally the findings of table 7 reveal that each antibiotic of the selected ones behaves differently regardless of whether obtained from the old or new treatment facilities while penicillin and tetracycline were removed in the amounts 96 and 19 respectively in the owwtp they have not been removed in the nwwtp however some antibiotics showed the same behavior and removal rates for both old and new wwtps such as erythromycin and amoxicillin the study of roberts and thomas 54 showed that removal rates of antibiotics in the wwtps can differ by up to 99 the study found removal efficiency rates for tetracycline of 19 as it is adsorbed to particulate matter while higher removal efficiency rates of 86 were observed for erythromycin which is relatively persistent in the environment 55 clavulanic acid in hww was detected in two groups of the samples while the first and the fourth one showed concentrations lower than the limit of detection 0 1 μg l the range was between 12 and 41 μg l and the difference could be explained by the special season of sampling the second group of sampling occurred in september and october 2015 where thousands of people should be healthy before going to pilgrimage of that year it is important to mention that according to the regulations and visa requirements of the authorities of saudi arabia people go to pilgrimage must be vaccinated for a group of diseases additionally the people consume antibiotics to show their health suitability for pilgrimage mainly against bacterial infections this agrees also with the findings of the owwtp influent for the same antibiotic in that season the highest concentration of clavulanic acid 85 μg l was detected in the influent samples of the owwtp the samples of owwtp were collected in september and october 2015 directly before pilgrimage hajj season where pilgrims might have been treated with clavulanic acid during this period surprisingly although the highest concentration of clavulanic acid in the effluent of the major hospital of the country was 41 μg l it was found that its concentration 85 μg l in the influent of the owwtp was doubled this could be due to other sources not limited to the hospitals and clinics but could be the domestic wastewater in that season where people discard the rest of antibiotics in the toilets and kitchen sinks metronidazole was detected in all hww of ranges of 1 to 5 μg l however its concentration in all collected samples from the influent and effluent of both treatment plants was less than 1 μg l with the exception of the first group of samples where the average concentration in the influent of the owwtp was 3 μg l similarly high level of metronidazole presence in hww samples correlated with the hajj season indicating that its use increased during this season amoxicillin was detected in the first two groups of the hww samples at an average concentration of 0 6 μg l all samples of the treatment plants showed low concentrations of amoxicillin and the removal rate was very high effluents 0 01 μg l regardless the degree of treatment of both owwtp and nwwtp the low concentration of amoxicillin in the samples of october 2015 indicate that this antibiotic might not have been prescribed during that season similarly amoxicillin was also low in all samples of wwtps in catalonia spain amoxicillin was detected in hww at a level of 2 18 μg l and in two wwtps effluent at concentrations of 2 16 and 2 58 μg l this comparison demonstrates that amoxicillin is commonly used and treatment facilities of these two wwtps in catalonia were not able to eliminate it no significant difference was observed in the concentration of ciprofloxacin in all samples of hww on the other hand a recent study of al qarni et al 46 for hww of saudi arabia showed average concentrations of 5 61 μg l while an older comprehensive study by hirsch et al 5 in germany showed a wide range of ciprofloxacin concentrations 3 87 μg l in treated wastewater groundwater and surface water tetracycline was almost absent from the hospital wastewater and it was found in the first sampling campaign with an average of 0 2 μg l surprisingly its average concentration in all influent samples of the two wwtps was 0 2 μg l and the two plants were able to remove it from the final effluent compared to the other antibiotics tetracycline was not detected during hajj season in hww in the study of meritxell et al tetracycline was below the lower limit of detection in all hww and in the three wwtps influent or effluent samples of spain generally penicillin was found with lower concentrations of the hww 0 1 μg l compared to the influent of the wwtps 0 3 μg l the absence of penicillin from the samples could be due to the fact that it is susceptible to hydrolysis however the highest concentration of penicillin 0 7 μg l was detected in the influent samples collected from the nwwtp during the hajj season one composite sample of the hww showed high concentrations of erythromycin where the average was 5 17 μg l and this sample was collected during the hajj season however it was low or even below the instrumental limit of detection for all samples of the two wwtps similarly erythromycin was also not detected in either the influents or effluents of hwwtps in saudi arabia 46 there was a significant correlation between most of the studied antibiotics the results demonstrated that ciprofloxacin was highly correlated with erythromycin clavulanic acid and metronidazole in all influent samples table 8 nevertheless erythromycin was highly correlated with amoxicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline and penicillin in all effluent samples suggesting that these targets were quite stable in the wastewater table 9 based on tables 8 and 9 it can be clearly observed that a significant correlation between tetracycline ciprofloxacin penicillin and erythromycin amoxicillin exists in all samples collected after treatment suggesting that these targets were quite stable in the wastewater table 10 illustrates the presence of a significant correlation between metronidazole and ciprofloxacin in the presence of amoxicillin other antibiotics were also found to be influential such as penicillin was highly correlated with both amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin and erythromycin was correlated with both amoxicillin and penicillin in the influent samples collected from the nwwtp a significant correlation between metronidazole and ciprofloxacin penicillin with clavulanic acid erythromycin with metronidazole ciprofloxacin was also observed in the influent samples collected from the owwtp table 11 the occurrence of metronidazole penicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline erythromycin ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was also correlated in the effluent samples collected from the nwwtp table 12 table 13 shows a significant correlation between clavulanic acid with both metronidazole and ciprofloxacin metronidazole and ciprofloxacin amoxicillin with both penicillin and erythromycin penicillin with erythromycin in the effluent samples collected from the owwtp penicillin and amoxicillin belong to the same antibiotic class i e β lactam hence their interaction is expected in both influent and effluent samples ciprofloxacin has also been found to interact with clavulanic acid metronidazole and amoxicillin in influent wastewater samples 4 conclusions the optimized conditions of the lc ms selected cartridges of the spe and qc qa procedures showed a successful sensitive methodology for the determination of seven antibiotics penicillin amoxicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline erythromycin metronidazole and clavulanic acid in the hospital and municipal wastewater of doha qatar among the seven antibiotics tested metronidazole and ciprofloxacin were the most abundant types especially in the hww at concentrations of 5 46 μg l and 1 99 μg l respectively penicillin was spotted in the influent samples 0 69 μg l collected from the nwwtp while clavulanic acid 84 74 μg l was still present in the effluent of nwwtp in the samples collected from owwtp erythromycin 7 20 μg l and tetracycline 0 2 μg l were the most prominent antibiotics the levels of amoxicillin penicillin and erythromycin were below the detection limit of 0 1 μg l or even not detected in most of the samples collected from hww and both wwtps the statistical analysis shows that there is no significant difference p 0 05 between owwtp and nwwtp and the methods used in both of the wwtps are effective in reducing removing penicillin and metronidazole nwwtp was effective to remove penicillin with percent reduction 99 34 on average furthermore owwtp was effective to remove metronidazole with removal efficiency 90 22 on average clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin were not removed from nwwtp nor from owwtp however existing treatment facilities within these treatment plants are unable to remove all the studied antibiotics new and advanced methods could be used to remove such contaminants including reverse osmosis ro advanced oxidation o3 and h2o2 and or electrochemical treatment the results revealed that concentrations of antibiotics in the influent wastewater are the same as or even higher their concentrations in the effluent water of the main hospital this confirms that the source is not limited to hospitals and clinics but the direct disposal into the sewer system presence of antibiotics in the treated wastewater of qatar is one of the limiting factors for reuse options especially irrigation and groundwater recharge such emerging contaminants call for optimization of the existing treatment processes and introduce further and advanced treatment technologies including advanced oxidation ozonation hydrogen peroxide when removed the huge amounts 800 000 m3 day of treated wastewater can add significant value to the water budget at the country level and improve the quality of harsh arid environment of qatar as well as enhance public perception of using treated wastewater in several applications e g irrigation landscaping district cooling

14433,in this work an environmentally friendly and economically effective surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon s pgc obtained from alginate biomass was successfully fabricated by functionalizing with anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs and used as an adsorbent for the removal of methylene blue cationic dye from aqueous solutions the structural order and textural properties were examined using xrd raman spectroscopy and sem edx batch adsorption experiments were conducted where the influence of operating parameters such as solution ph contact time adsorbent dosage initial mb concentration and temperature on the sorption capacity were investigated compared with pristine pgc the surfactant modified pgc s pgc exhibited a much higher sorption capacity for mb due to the enhanced electrostatic interaction between the cationic dye and negatively charged s pgc adsorbent the adsorption isotherm and kinetics of adsorption were well fitted by the freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order model respectively the maximum adsorption capacity calculated from langmuir isotherm was 714 and 769 mg g for two adsorbents sdbs pgc 3000 and sds pgc 3000 respectively at 25 c suggesting sds pgc has a comparatively higher sorption capacity further investigation confirmed that the adsorption of mb over s pgc was spontaneous and endothermic in nature successful regeneration of the spent adsorbents with methanol along with its high dye adsorption performance strongly confirms the ability of utilizing s pgc as a promising and reliable adsorbent for cationic dye removal keywords methylene blue porous graphitic carbon surfactant adsorption dye removal 1 introduction rapid growth in industrialization and urbanization has significantly affected the water bodies due to the release of huge industrial effluents which contains highly toxic inorganic and organic pollutants among them discharge of dye effluents without effective treatment from various industries including paper textile paint plastic carpet printing cosmetics and food causes colored pollution one of the major contributors to water pollution 1 3 dyes are chemical compounds that are capable of interacting with materials or surfaces to impart lasting colors their complex aromatic molecular structures with extreme stability and their resistance to temperature light and oxidizers makes these dyes difficult to biodegrade and there by affecting the water quality moreover owing to their intrinsic carcinogenic and mutagenic nature and sunlight inhibiting properties bio accumulation of dyes in living organisms results in severe diseases and disorders making it a potent water pollutant 4 therefore to reduce the negative effects of dyes on aqueous ecosystems it is imperative to remove the dyes from wastewater before discharging to the water bodies to date numerous techniques including adsorption photo catalytic decolonization sonochemical membrane distillation ultrafiltration flocculation coagulation microbial decomposition ozonation electrochemical and wet air oxidation have been employed to treat the dye bearing water and mitigate their impact on the environment 5 7 among the aforementioned methods adsorption is the most effective method and extensively used as it is the most facile and economically viable physicochemical process which has high effluent treatment performance easy operation procedure and widespread availability of adsorbent materials 8 11 carbon based materials are one of the most extensively explored and superior adsorbents that are commonly used for dye adsorption as it possess high capacity for the adsorption of organic materials 12 14 however its high cost has limited its use and researchers are on the lookout for finding cheaper and economically feasible sources for developing carbon based adsorbents 15 16 many authors have reported the use of natural industrial or agricultural wastes such as wheat straw 17 wood apple shell 18 macore fruit 19 eucalyptus sheathiana bark 20 kenaf fibre 21 palm tree 22 date stone 23 rice husk 24 sesame straw 25 etc for developing carbon adsorbents with the endeavor to develop low cost adsorbents with enhanced dye adsorption performance however despite tremendous efforts to utilize low cost carbon adsorbents developed from natural materials industrial or agricultural wastes for dye adsorption its low efficiency has prompted researchers to develop more efficient carbon adsorbent from environment friendly alternative materials thus development of the novel environmentally friendly carbon adsorbents with low cost and high removal performance are still highly desired yet challengeable in this study a porous graphitic carbon pgc developed from natural polymer alginate was utilized to remove methylene blue mb a model dye pollutant from aqueous solutions pgc is a green adsorbent as it was obtained from naturally occurring polysaccharide alginate biomass it has high selectivity low density low cost of manufacturing extremely high porosity good mechanical stability and high surface area making it an environment friendly and promising alternative material for dye adsorption to further improve the surface properties of the pgc a surface modification using sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs was performed and their adsorption capacity for mb a representative of the common cationic dyes found in waste water discharge from textile industry was investigated to the best of our knowledge the use of surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon s pgc for mb removal from aqueous solutions has never been reported in the literature thus the focus of the present study is to investigate the characteristics of the synthesized novel s pgc adsorbent and explore the possibility of using it for mb dye removal the effects of operating parameters such as ph contact time adsorbent dosage initial concentration and temperature on uptake capacity including the kinetics and sorption isotherm of mb during batch adsorption were reported furthermore efforts were paved on understanding the efficiency of the developed s pgc adsorbents in removing other cationic dyes such as methyl violet mv from aqueous solutions 2 experimental 2 1 materials methylene blue mb methyl violet mv sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs of analytical grade and alginic acid calcium salt from brown algae of food grade were received from sigma aldrich usa and used without any extra purification aqueous solutions of all chemicals were prepared using deionized water 2 2 preparation of adsorbent 2 2 1 preparation of pgc pgc was prepared via a simple carbonization process using alginic acid calcium salt from brown algae powder as the carbon precursor 26 to obtain the bio char the biomass material of alginate was placed in a muffle furnace and heated to 900 c at 10 c min in a nitrogen atmosphere the so obtained porous graphitic carbon pgc was cooled to room temperature and stored for further modification purpose 2 2 2 synthesis of sds and sdbs functionalized pgc the prepared pgc was modified using 1500 and 3000 mg l of sds anionic surfactant these concentrations were selected in such a way that it is above and below the critical micelle concentration cmc in a typical modification process 2 wt of pgc was added to a known concentration of surfactant solution and the mixture was stirred for 3 h at 30 c the resulting solid was then filtered and washed several times with deionized water to remove the remaining sds before being dried in an oven at 80 c to obtain the surfactant functionalized pgc similarly for comparison and understanding the effectiveness sdbs functionalized pgc was prepared using the same concentration the obtained samples were denoted as s pgc 1500 and s pgc 3000 where s stand for sds or sdbs depending on the type of anionic surfactant used for the functionalization 2 2 3 characterization of adsorbent the crystalline nature of the synthesized adsorbents was characterized using x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro powder diffractometer with cu kα radiation of 1 5406 a 2θ range of 5 70 and 40 kv 40 ma raman spectroscopy analysis were carried out using jobin yvon horiba labram spectrometer with a he ne laser and operated at 633 nm transmission electron microscopy tem analysis was performed using digital micrograph software gatan usa the porosity and bet surface area of pgc before and after modification were measured using n2 adsorption desorption analysis at 150 c on a micromeritics asps analyzer a scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta feg250 usa equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscope oxford edx uk was used to probe the surface morphologies and texture of the modified pgc adsorbents before and after mb adsorption the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir images of pristine pgc before and after surfactant modification as well as mb adsorbed and desorbed s pgc were recorded using nicolet 6700 ftir spectrophotometer in the wave number region from 400 to 4000 cm 1 finally the zeta potential of the adsorbents was measured between ph 3 0 and 13 0 using zeta pals instrument brookhaven instruments corporation usa with ph adjustment by adding appropriate amounts of 0 01 m naoh or hcl 2 2 4 batch adsorption studies stock solution 1000 ppm of mb was prepared by dissolving appropriate quantity of dye in deionized water and solutions of desired concentrations were prepared by successive dilution of the stock solution batch adsorption experiments were performed in 25 ml conical flasks containing 10 ml of mb solution with known initial concentration a fixed quantity of adsorbents was added and the stoppered conical flasks containing the mixtures were shaken mechanically in a temperature regulated water bath dihan korea at a constant speed of 140 rpm and predetermined temperature and time after the elapse of the contact time the supernatant samples were withdrawn and the residual dye equilibrium concentration was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer at a wave length of 664 nm the percentage removal of mb and amount of mb adsorbed at equilibrium q e was calculated using the eq 1 and 2 respectively 1 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q e v m c 0 c e where c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of mb mg l respectively m is the mass of adsorbent g v is the volume of the solution l similarly to understand how other cationic dyes such as mv and mo interacts with the developed s pgc adsorbents and compare its efficiency with pristine pgc batch adsorption experiments were carried out by using varying dye concentration from 0 to 1000 mg l 2 3 kinetic models it is essential to model the experimental data in order to evaluate the performance of the adsorbents with time understand the adsorption mechanism and get deep insight about the interaction between mb and surfactant modified pgc adsorbents in this work three kinetic models namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models were used to fit the experimental kinetic data 2 3 1 pseudo first order model the linear form of the lagergren pseudo first order model is expressed as 27 3 ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t where q t and q e are the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents at any time and at equilibrium respectively mg g k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 and t is the contact time min the plot of log q e q t versus t gives a linear relationship and the value of q e and k 1 can be determined from the intercept and slope of the plot respectively 2 3 2 pseudo second order model the differential equation of the pseudo second order model is generally described as 28 4 d q t d t k 2 q t q e 2 on integration the linearized and simplified form of ho s equation is given as 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant the equilibrium sorption capacity q e and the value of k 2 can be obtained from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of t q t versus t respectively 2 3 3 intra particle diffusion model the possibility of intra particle diffusion during the adsorption process was investigated using the linear form of the weber and morris 29 model and can be expressed as 6 q t k i d t 0 5 c where k i is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 0 5 at any stage i c is the boundary layer effect at that stage the plot of q t versus t 0 5 gives a linear relationship and the value of k i can be determined from the slope of the plot 8 2 4 adsorption isotherms 2 4 1 langmuir isotherm it is one of the most successfully used isotherms for describing various types of adsorption process the model is based on the following assumptions 1 adsorption takes place on a homogenous adsorbent surface having identical sites with the same degree of availability and magnitude of energy 2 localized adsorption as no interaction occurs between molecules of adsorbates and 3 each site can accommodate only equal amount of molecules 30 the linear form of langmuir model can be expressed mathematically as follows 7 1 q e 1 q m a x 1 q m a x k l c e where q e mg g is the dye equilibrium adsorption ability c e mg l is the equilibrium concentration of dye in the solution q m a x is the maximum dye adsorption capacity and k l l mg is the langmuir constant and corresponds to the adsorption energy from the linear plot of c e q e against c e the value of k l can be achieved however the dimensionless separation factor or equilibrium parameter r l which connotes the shape of the isotherm obtained from the langmuir isotherm is used to determine whether adsorption is favorable or unfavorable and can be defined as follows 8 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c 0 mg l is the initial concentration of mb in the solution the value of r l differentiates between irreversible r l 0 favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 adsorption processes 2 4 2 freundlich isotherm this model relies on the assumption that adsorption takes place on an heterogeneous surface at sites with varying energy of adsorption and hence is more suitable for non ideal processes with rough and heterogeneous surfaces 31 the linear form of the model can be mathematically depicted as below 9 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where k f mg1 1 n l1 n g is the freundlich constant and 1 n is the heterogeneity parameter which is an estimate of the intensity of adsorption 1 n and k f can be determined from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of log q e versus log c e respectively 2 4 3 d r isotherm this model describes that adsorption takes place both on homogenous and heterogeneous surfaces through a pore filling mechanism and is mainly applicable for single solute systems the linear form of the model is as follows 10 l n q e ln q s β ε 2 where q s is the theoretical isotherm saturation capacity mg g 1 β is the d r isotherm constant which is related to sorption energy mol2 kj 2 and ε is the polyani potential which is related to the equilibrium concentration as below 11 ε r t l n 1 1 c e r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t is the absolute temperature k the mean free energy of adsorption e kj mol 1 whose magnitude provides information on the mechanism of adsorption chemical or physical can be deduced from eq 12 12 e 1 2 β 3 results and discussions surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon using sds have been obtained through the process as described in scheme 1 pgc was modified using surfactant solution of sds at a concentration of 1500 and 3000 mg l as depicted in scheme 1 when pgc was added to anionic surfactant water system with surfactant concentration of 1500 mg l of sds which is less than cmc 2365 mg l surfactant ion or molecules adsorb onto the surface and just accumulate on carbon surface through hydrophobic interactions with their hydrophilic parts orienting toward the aqueous phase conversely when the concentration of the surfactant was 3000 mg l above cmc the surfactant molecules aggregate to form micelles that are very stable because of the physical reinforcement and remains in the bulk zone thus the subsequent introduction of surfactant by using a concentration above cmc provides additional functional groups and is believed to further enhance the overall functional performance however in case of sdbs modified pgc even though the cmc of sdbs was low 522 mg l modification was done using the same concentration of 1500 mg l and 3000 mg l so as to compare its effectiveness with sds modified pgc 3 1 characterization of adsorbents 3 1 1 xrd analysis the pristine and surfactant modified pgc adsorbents were characterized using x ray diffraction xrd and the obtained patterns are as depicted in fig 1 in the case of pure pgc the peaks observed at 2θ values of 26ᵒ 44ᵒ and 54ᵒ corresponds to the graphitic carbon planes 002 101 and 004 respectively jcpds file number 41 1487 these well resolved sharp diffraction peaks connote that the carbon has a highly ordered graphitized structure 26 in addition the diffraction peaks at 29ᵒ 34ᵒ 47ᵒ and 51ᵒ can be attributed to the formation of ca oh 2 formed due to the hydration of cao peaks 38ᵒ and 66ᵒ during storage on the other hand from fig 1 it can be seen that the diffraction peaks belonging to that of pristine pgc was observed even in case of s pgc suggesting that the degree of graphitic crystallinity was still maintained however the peaks have slightly shifted to the left which clearly indicates the conformational and textural change associated with the attachment of the surfactant chains on to the carbon surface 32 also the presence of additional peaks which are the characteristic of sds and sdbs ions on the surface of s pgc further indicates that the surfactants were successfully adsorbed onto the carbon surface through hydrophobic interactions 33 3 1 2 raman spectroscopy in order to have a better understanding of the graphitic structure of the prepared pgc and to verify that its graphitic structure is unaltered even after surfactant modification raman spectroscopic analysis was carried out as shown in fig 2 the spectra of pgc shows two bands one at 1360 cm 1 d band and 1580 cm 1 g band the d band is an indication of structural defects and disorders while the g band can be attributed to the vibration of sp2 bonded carbon in a cc bond stretching after modification the d band slightly shifted to a lower wave number and could be attributed to an increase in the degree of disorder within the material caused by modification of the surface of graphitic carbon by surfactant 34 on the other hand the g band remained unaltered further indicating that even after surfactant modification ordered graphitic structure of the carbon caused by the e2 g mode of the hexagonal graphite was unaffected and is in agreement with the results observed from xrd 3 1 3 tem analysis the typical tem image of pristine pgc and surfactant modified pgc are as shown in fig s1 the tem image of pristine pgc showed lattice fringes of about 0 336 nm and can be indexed to the 002 plane indicating that graphitic nature were prevalent in the pristine carbon 35 after modification the underlying graphitic structure was not changed however the graphitic nature of the carbon was found to be masked by the surfactant molecules as shown in fig s1 b and c 3 1 4 bet analysis the bet nitrogen adsorption and desorption analysis provided in fig s2 showed that modification of pgc by surfactants did not change the inherent structure of the pgc carbon both pristine and surfactant modified pgc was found to have a similar adsorption desorption isotherm curves of type iv with a hysteresis loop at 0 4 p p0 0 9 36 however pgc carbon was found to have a larger volume compared to s pgc indicating that the modification using surfactant decreased the pore volume as well as the surface area table 1 this is because when anionic surfactant molecules are coated on the carbon surface these molecules cover the porous channels and cause pore blocking as a result it is difficult for n2 to go into the pores subsequently the surface area of the modified carbon decreases drastically and this behavior is well documented in the literature 37 38 nevertheless with the presence of surfactant the active sites on the surface of pgc increases remarkably resulting in high dye removal efficiency thus annulling the effect of reduction in surface area and pore volume furthermore the pore size of the pgc increased after the modification irrespective of the type of surfactant and could be attributed to the capability of the surfactant molecules to organize themselves however a slight variation in the physical properties is observed between sds and sdbs modified pgc adsorbent and are due to the difference in the chemical structure shapes of micelles and affinity of the surfactant used for modification 3 1 5 sem edx analysis the structure and surface morphology of pristine pgc and that of s pgc adsorbents before and after mb adsorption were investigated by sem microscopy fig 3 pristine pgc was observed to possess uniform interconnected porous structures with cavities having pore size in lower nanometer range 26 however from the sem micrographs of s pgc adsorbents it is quite obvious that surfactant modifications have transformed the physio chemical and surface morphology of the pristine pgc bio char materials the heterogeneous nature of modified pgc surface further indicates successful interaction with sds and sdbs surfactants with the graphitic carbon surface theoretically these structures are believed to provide more active sites for adsorption of dyes and organic compounds 39 furthermore it was worthy to note the emergence and uniform distribution of na and s elements as seen from the corresponding edx spectrum fig 3 and elemental mapping shown in fig s3 supplementary material respectively for both sds and sdbs modified pgc confirming the successful modification of pgc by the surfactants 40 on the other hand after mb adsorption a drastic change was observed in the structural morphology of the s pgc adsorbents the micrographs shown in fig 3c and d clearly showed the attachment of mb molecules all over the carbon surface an indication of effective binding of mb molecules into the pores and cavities of these adsorbents in brief the mb molecules appear to have produced a film free of void which masks the reliefs of particles and porosity of the aggregates 39 41 the corresponding edx spectra fig 3 and elemental mapping shown in fig s4 supplementary material further confirmed the presence of n and cl and the uniform distribution of the elements on the surface of the adsorbed samples indicating that mb molecules were consistently and uniformly loaded onto the surface of the adsorbents particles forming a uniform network structure 3 1 6 ftir analysis the binding of surfactant molecules on the surface of pristine pgc was confirmed using ftir spectroscopy fig 4 depicts the ftir spectra of pristine pgc and after modification using sds and sdbs surfactants the characteristic vibration bands of pristine pgc due to the presence of adsorbed water molecules or hydroxyl oh groups 3425 cm 1 co vibration 1107 cm 1 and carbonate species 874 cm 1 were observed for all the adsorbents 26 the minor peak observed in pristine pgc at 2895 cm 1 attributed to the stretching of ch groups and the characteristic peak at 1431 cm 1 due to the lattice vibrations of coo groups were not found in the modified pgc after surfactant modification these identified spectra were replaced by the characteristic peaks of surfactants such as 2851 cm 1 and 1468 cm 1 stretching vibration of ch2 molecules in surfactant 42 furthermore the intensity of the spectra corresponding to hydroxyl oh groups present in pgc were drastically reduced in s pgc adsorbents this is because of the removal of hydroxyl oh groups into alkanes on the carbon surface with the addition of a surfactant 34 43 which is confirmed from the presence of new absorption band at 2820 cm 1 for modified carbon attributed to the stretching vibration of ch3 molecules present in sds or sdbs the detection of functional groups corresponding to surfactants further confirms that the anionic surfactants has been successfully embedded onto the surface of pgc through hydrophobic interaction after mb adsorption the ftir spectra of s pgc displayed in fig s5 showed significant changes in vibrations the slight increase in intensity and broadness of ir bands related to oh stretching 3431 cm 1 for mb adsorbed s pgc adsorbents confirms the presence of water molecules from adsorption 44 the band intensity at 2820 cm 1 and 2851 cm 1 was reduced significantly and the peaks at 1468 cm 1 disappeared due to utilization of surfactant related functional groups in s pgc adsorbents irrespective of the type of surfactant used for modification also the intensity of the broad bands between 1414 and 1450 cm 1 that denotes the ch bending of ch3 groups increased after adsorption indicating the successful adsorption of mb onto s pgc adsorbents 34 furthermore from fig s5 it can be seen that spent s pgc adsorbents regenerated using methanol had functional group similar to that of fresh adsorbents these results further confirm that methanol was successful in completely desorbing the adsorbed mb molecules from the surface of s pgc adsorbents 3 2 preliminary batch adsorption studies in order to determine the effectiveness of the prepared adsorbents in removing mb from wastewater preliminary adsorption experiments was conducted using the as prepared pristine and surfactant modified pgc adsorbents fig 5 depicts the percentage removal of the adsorbents with initial mb concentration of 100 mg l and varying adsorbent dosage it can be seen that with a maximum dosage of 30 mg only a 57 removal was achieved by the pristine pgc particles while the sdbs and sds modified pgc adsorbents attained 100 removal clearly indicating that the modification of the pgc has drastically enhanced its mb sorption capacity this can be attributed to the fact that mb being a cationic dye occurs as ions with positive charges in aqueous solutions there by participating in electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged s pgc adsorbents see fig 6 45 furthermore it can be seen from fig 5 that the concentration of sds and sdbs used for the modification of pgc also affected the sorption capacity of the adsorbents the adsorbents with 3000 mg l of the respective surfactants performed better than their counterpart s which were modified using 1500 mg l of the surfactants this is probably due to the increase in the available sorption sites with the increase in concentration of surfactants used for modification moreover it was observed that the sds modified pgc had slightly higher removal than the sdbs modified pgc irrespective of the concentration of surfactant used for the modification the order of the removal percentage of the adsorbents are as follows pgc sds 3000 pgc sdbs 3000 pgc sds 1500 pgc sdbs 1500 pgc therefore pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 which gave the highest removal of mb were used for carrying out further experiments 3 3 effect of operating parameters 3 3 1 effect of initial solution ph the initial ph of the solutions may improve or inhibit the uptake and the extent of adsorption as it controls the degree of ionization of basic and acidic compounds and the surface charge of the adsorbent in order to study the effect of initial solution ph on the sorption of mb on s pgc adsorbent the initial solution ph was adjusted to the desired value of 2 to 13 by adding 0 01 m naoh or hcl solutions fig 6 no significant influence of ph on mb dye removal was observed over the ph range from 2 to 10 this was further confirmed from the zeta potential which characterize the sensitivity of the s pgc adsorbent to the ph and their surface charges the results demonstrated that the surface was negatively charged throughout the studied solution ph emphasizing the point that electrostatic interaction plays the major role in this adsorption process however for a ph greater than 10 a consequential improvement in the removal was observed from 80 to 100 this is because as the ph of the solution increases the surface of the adsorbent acquires more negative charges due to the increase in the number of hydroxyl ions as a result the positively charged mb molecules compete with the increasingly negatively charged sds pgc and sdbs pgc surface derived predominantly from hydroxyl ions and produces electric double layer consequently the adsorption efficiency is enhanced at higher solution ph 46 47 since majority of the natural waterbodies exists at neutral ph further experiments were carried out at the original ph of the mb solution of 7 18 3 3 2 effect of contact time to gauge the equilibrium time a key factor in the adsorption processes the removal of mb by s pgc adsorbents were analyzed as a function of contact time over a period of 240 min and the results are as depicted in fig 7 high degree of mb removal was achieved within the first 15 min of contact with the dye for pgc sdbs 3000 96 11 removal and within 3 min for pgc sds 3000 98 89 removal the mb was completely removed attaining 99 99 removal by increasing the contact time up to 60 min beyond which no obvious increase in removal was observed as equilibrium was attained for both s pgc adsorbent this rapid rate of adsorption could be attributed to the availability of large amount of active sites present on the surface of s pgc once all the active sites are saturated system attains steady state and no further increase in removal were observed with increasing contact time thus the results imply that a contact time of 60 min was adequate to achieve saturated adsorption of mb onto both sds and sdbs modified pgc adsorbent 3 3 3 effect of adsorbent dosage the effect of amount of s pgc adsorbent on mb adsorption at three different initial concentrations was studied by varying the dosage from 5 to 30 mg and the results are presented in fig 8 for lower mb concentration of 100 mg l the removal percentage was higher than 93 and 97 for sdbs pgc 3000 and sds pgc 3000 respectively whereas for 300 mg l and 1000 mg l with increasing the amount of dosage from 5 to 30 mg the removal increased from 83 81 to 99 69 and 78 45 to 86 98 respectively for sdbs pgc 3000 and from 88 39 to 100 and 81 55 to 95 52 respectively for sds pgc 3000 thus in general for s pgc adsorbents the percentage mb removal increased with the amount of adsorbent irrespective of the initial mb concentration this might be because higher dosage provides more quantity of sorption sites for the adsorption of mb however the adsorption capacity of the s pgc adsorbents significantly decreased with an increase in adsorbent loading reaching 330 44 mg g from 1971 89 mg g and 332 34 mg g from 1975 40 mg g for sdbs pgc 3000 and sds pgc 3000 respectively when the quantity of adsorbent was increased from 5 mg to 30 mg the decrease in uptake capacity with an increase in adsorbent amount is attributed to the presence of unsaturated sites available on s pgc adsorbents during mb dye adsorption since no significant increase in the percentage removal was observed for a dosage above 10 mg as the available active sites are enough to efficiently adsorb the mb from aqueous solutions further experiments were conducted using 10 mg of s pgc adsorbents 3 3 4 effect of initial mb concentration besides adsorbent dosage the initial concentration of mb dye solution is also believed to influence the removal percentage and adsorption capacity greatly hence it is imperative to probe the influence of initial concentration of mb on adsorption and the results are as shown in fig 9 it was observed that for a fixed adsorbent dosage of 10 mg a complete removal i e 100 of was observed from 2 5 to 80 ppm of mb concentration for both s pgc adsorbents the total removal achieved at such low mb concentrations may be attributed to the high ratio of active binding sites to the number of mb molecules resulting in adequate adsorbent adsorbate interaction however further increasing the initial concentration of dye from 80 mg l to 1000 mg l the percentage removal decreased from 100 to 81 77 and 86 49 for sdbs pgc 3000 and sds pgc 3000 respectively this is because of the saturation of sorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent by the competing adsorbate molecules 40 on the other hand the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increased with increasing the initial dye concentration and could be as a result of the high driving force for mass transfer at higher initial dye concentrations 48 3 3 5 effect of temperature the diffusion rate of mb molecules is temperature dependent thus varying the process temperature is believed to alter the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the uptake of mb onto s pgc adsorbents was investigated at three different temperatures viz 25 c 35 c and 45 c and the results were used to determine the thermodynamic parameters and adsorption isotherms the obtained results are depicted in fig 10 the mb uptake capacity of both sds and sdbs modified pgc adsorbents increased with increasing the temperature from 25 to 45 c indicating clearly that mb is adsorbed endothermically onto s pgc adsorbents the rise in temperature leads to an increase in the interaction between the adsorbed mb molecules and the active sites on s pgc adsorbents owing to the faster rate of diffusion of mb molecules across the external boundary layer and internal pores of the adsorbents and minimal resistance offered by viscous forces in the liquid phase furthermore the expansion of the pore size could also be responsible for the enhanced adsorption capacities exhibited by these adsorbents at high temperature consequently both the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity increased with temperature 15 49 3 4 adsorption kinetics it is important to study the adsorption kinetics as it provides deep insight about adsorption rate and corresponding adsorption mechanisms table 2 contains the kinetic parameters determined from the intercepts and slopes of various kinetic models viz pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models the regression calculations were done using microsoft excel comparing the values of the coefficient of determination r 2 of these models indicates that the sorption of mb onto the two modified pgc i e sdbs and sds adsorbents followed pseudo second order kinetics with a perfect r2 value of 1 in addition the predicted value of q e q e c a l obtained from the pseudo second order model was the closest to the experimentally determined q e value determined experimentally q e e x p further confirming that adsorption of mb onto modified pgc is controlled by chemisorption which involves sharing of valence electrons between the adsorbate and adsorbents conversely the intra particle diffusion model plots did not pass through the origin implying that internal diffusion is not the only rate controlling step rather the sorption of mb onto s pgc adsorbent was controlled by other mechanisms for pgc sds 3000 sorption of mb was found to be governed by three sequential stages the first stage where the rate of adsorption was fastest and occurred within the first 5 min of the process which represents instantaneous adsorption and external diffusion of mb on the surface of the adsorbent the second stage 5 20 min where a decrease in slope was observed due to intra particle diffusion in which the dye molecules migrated to the pores and are adsorbed to the inner active sites and finally the third stage 20 60 min where the adsorption equilibrium was achieved and could be attributed to a decrease in mb concentration in the solution and availability of active sites similarly the sorption of mb onto pgc sdbs 3000 was controlled by three stages but in this case the first second and third stages occur at 1 15 min 15 45 min and 45 60 min respectively therefore these observations further reaffirm that along with intra particle diffusion other mechanisms were involved in the sorption of mb onto modified pgc 3 5 adsorption isotherm the adsorption study conducted at three different temperatures based on varying the initial mb concentration fig 10 was used to evaluate the sorption capacity of the surfactant modified pgc adsorbents and to determine the equilibrium adsorption isotherms these isotherms are primarily employed to describe the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates hence correlation of the equilibrium data by either empirical or theoretical equation is paramount for practical operations the linear form of langmuir freundlich and d r isotherms eqs 7 9 and 10 respectively were used to compute the data presented in table 3 using microsoft excel from table 3 it is possible to discern that among the three models the experimental data fitted perfectly well with langmuir and freundlich models with a r 2 greater than 0 9 compared to d r model r 2 0 8 however a better linearity was exhibited by fitting the curves with freundlich isotherm model than langmuir elucidating the multilayer adsorption of mb dye which may be attributed to the various active sites present on the adsorbent the maximum sorption capacity q m a x of the two adsorbents pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 as calculated using the langmuir model were 714 28 and 769 23 mg g respectively at 25 c the high adsorption affinity exhibited by s pgc adsorbents can be ascribed to the presence of certain functional groups and the surface charge property such as the strong electrostatic interaction between the cationic dye molecules and negatively charged adsorbent surface furthermore the π π stacking of aromatic rings and hydrogen bonding interaction is also believed to play a significant role in the adsorption of mb onto these surfactant modified pgc adsorbents more so as the temperature increased from 25 to 45 c q m a x increased from 714 28 to 833 33 mg g and 769 23 to 909 09 mg g for pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 respectively also it was interesting to observe that sds modified pgc adsorbent has a slightly higher adsorption capacity for mb than sdbs modified one and could be attributed to the bulky benzene ring present in the latter one which slightly prohibits the effective sorption of mb dye due to is negative effect towards the formation of one dimensional surfactant aggregates on adsorbent surface the value of separation factor r l fell within 0 and 1 at all the three temperatures indicating that the adsorption was favorable similar to q m a x r l also increased with an increase in temperature this was because the values of r l was directly proportional to of adsorption as a result increase in temperature favored adsorption and thus the value of r l increased with temperature the freundlich model parameter n which is a measure of the intensity of mb adsorption from aqueous solution calculated at all temperatures exhibited values ranging between 2 41 and 3 19 the high value of k f and n at all temperature not only indicate chemisorption and favorable adsorption but also provides information on the heterogeneity of the surface and the exponential distribution of active sites and their energies the value of mean free energy e obtained from the d r model which was used for identifying whether the adsorption of mb onto s pgc adsorbents were by physisorption or chemisorption was found to be greater than 8 0 kj mol 1 the obtained e value further confirms that the mechanism of adsorption of mb dye onto s pgc adsorbent is through site specific adsorption or chemisorption 40 3 6 thermodynamic study to determine the practical applicability of the adsorption process thermodynamic values must be taken into consideration the dependency of temperature on various parameters related to adsorption process such as standard gibb s free energy change δ g kj mol 1 standard enthalpy change δ h kj mol 1 and standard entropy change δ s j mol 1 were calculated using eqs 13 and 14 and the obtained results are given in table 4 13 δ g r t l n k l 14 l n k l δ s r δ h r t where r 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t k are the universal gas constant and the absolute temperature respectively the values of δ h and δ s were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of l n k l versus 1 t for both pgc adsorbents the value of δ g is negative an indication that the sorption of mb is thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous 50 in addition as temperature is increased δ g values becomes more negative suggesting the presence of an energy barrier at low temperature and sorption process is more favorable at higher temperatures the positive values of δ h 44 28 and 23 30 kj mol 1 for pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 respectively denote that the sorption process followed an endothermic behavior similarly the positive values of δ s 173 01 and 105 40 kj mol 1 for pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 respectively signify that there is an increase in randomness at the adsorbent liquid interface during the adsorption of mb onto s pgc s with possible interaction and structural changes between mb molecules and s pgc particles 50 51 thus the two as synthesized surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon showed faster adsorption rate and higher adsorption capacity for mb dye indicating its potential applications in industry as adsorbents to treat colored wastewater 3 7 mechanism the surface of the s pgc adsorbents is negatively charged owing to the presence of the polar surfactant head so3 group directing towards the bulk of the solution in the event when methylene blue dye which is positively charged n group comes in contact with the carbon surface adsorption occurs through electrostatic interaction resulting in the removal of mb also some of the mb molecules are believed to be adsorbed onto the s pgc surface through hydrophobic interaction between mb and hydrocarbon tail of the surfactant the proposed mechanism illustrating the adsorption of mb onto s pgc is described schematically in scheme 2 3 8 regeneration the reusability of an adsorbent regeneration is an important parameter in determining the effectiveness of the adsorbent for wastewater treatment regeneration of spent adsorbents is usually performed in order to reuse it minimize waste and save the cost of acquiring a new one three different eluents viz hcl hno3 and methanol were tested as regenerants for the release of adsorbed mb from s pgc adsorbents and achieve complete desorption among the aforementioned eluents only methanol completely desorbed the adsorbed mb and hence was used for further regeneration studies fig 11 shows three cycles of adsorption desorption processes carried out at the same reaction conditions a fixed amount i e 0 01 g of the adsorbents was used to adsorb 200 mg l of mb solution followed by desorption and the process was repeated thrice from fig 11 it was observed that even after 3 cycles of adsorption desorption process both s pgc adsorbents exhibited no significant loss in removal indicating high stability and recyclability of the two adsorbents the percentage removal observed for pgc sds 3000 was 98 46 96 26 and 95 19 for first second and third adsorption desorption cycle respectively while 98 14 91 70 and 90 89 for pgc sds 3000 from these results it can be concluded that the pgc modified adsorbents can be used for multiple cycles of mb adsorption with no secondary pollutions in the waste water treatment process 3 9 comparison with other adsorbents a comparison of the surfactant modified pgc adsorbents prepared in this study and other bio derived activated carbons reported in the literature based on the maximum mb adsorption capacity q m a x are presented in table 4 as shown in table 4 sdbs and sds functionalized porous graphitic carbon have the highest adsorption capacities with q m a x values of 714 28 and 769 23 mg g respectively at 25 c and is so far the highest reported in literature for any bio derived carbon also it was interesting to observe that its mb adsorption capacity was even comparable to sds exfoliated graphene particles 782 3 mg g at 25 c 52 this superiority of surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon along with excellent reusability not only demonstrate their excellent adsorption characteristics but also fortify their capability to be used as an attractive and effective candidate for the removal mb dye from wastewater table 5 3 10 adsorptive removal of other cationic dyes as the key mechanism involved in the adsorptive removal of mb dye from aqueous solution using the as prepared anionic surfactant modified pgc is electrostatic interaction it is of utmost importance to study the removal of other cationic dyes this would enable in understanding the practicability of using s pgc as an adsorbent for cationic dyes fig s6 provides the q e vs c e curve exhibited by pristine and modified pgc for both mb and mv adsorption from aqueous solution the comparison of the q m a x value of mb and mv dye adsorption obtained from the langmuir isotherm fig 12 confirms that surfactant treatment has drastically enhanced the mb and mv adsorption capacity of pristine pgc furthermore the results showed that both sds and sdbs modified pgc has extraordinary affinity for mb and mv with sds modified pgc pgc sds 3000 giving the maximum mb and mv loading efficiency of 769 23 mg g and 724 64 mg g in summary the features of large pore size and suitable zeta potential of developed s pgc along with its excellent reusability make it a promising adsorbent for the treatment of colored waste water contaminated with cationic dyes 4 conclusion this study demonstrates for the first time that anionic surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon s pgc prepared from alginate biomass exhibits superior mb adsorption performance compared to unmodified pgc at 25 c sds and sdbs modified pgc demonstrated a maximum mb adsorption capacity of 714 28 and 769 23 mg g respectively greater than many of the bio derived carbon adsorbents reported in the literature various theoretical models were used to investigate the main mechanism responsible for the adsorption in particular the temperature of the solution had a significant influence on dye removal with higher temperatures favoring dye adsorption conversely no variation in removal efficiency was observed with ph up to 10 indicating that the attractive interactions between the oxygenated edge groups present on the pgc surface and dye had negligible effect on the amount of methylene blue adsorbed meanwhile the analysis of the experimental kinetic data for both s pgc adsorbents showed excellent agreement with the adsorption parameters predicted using the pseudo second order kinetics model the adsorption experimental results were also consistent with the freundlich adsorption isotherm suggesting the chemisorption of mb with the active sites present on the chemically heterogeneous s pgc carbon surface therefore it can be concluded that altering the surface of pgc with surfactants enhanced the overall mb adsorption efficiency of pgc illustrating the potential of s pgc as a promising effective low cost and industrially viable carbon based adsorbent for removing colored cationic dye pollutants from wastewaters acknowledgment the first and second

14433,in this work an environmentally friendly and economically effective surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon s pgc obtained from alginate biomass was successfully fabricated by functionalizing with anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs and used as an adsorbent for the removal of methylene blue cationic dye from aqueous solutions the structural order and textural properties were examined using xrd raman spectroscopy and sem edx batch adsorption experiments were conducted where the influence of operating parameters such as solution ph contact time adsorbent dosage initial mb concentration and temperature on the sorption capacity were investigated compared with pristine pgc the surfactant modified pgc s pgc exhibited a much higher sorption capacity for mb due to the enhanced electrostatic interaction between the cationic dye and negatively charged s pgc adsorbent the adsorption isotherm and kinetics of adsorption were well fitted by the freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order model respectively the maximum adsorption capacity calculated from langmuir isotherm was 714 and 769 mg g for two adsorbents sdbs pgc 3000 and sds pgc 3000 respectively at 25 c suggesting sds pgc has a comparatively higher sorption capacity further investigation confirmed that the adsorption of mb over s pgc was spontaneous and endothermic in nature successful regeneration of the spent adsorbents with methanol along with its high dye adsorption performance strongly confirms the ability of utilizing s pgc as a promising and reliable adsorbent for cationic dye removal keywords methylene blue porous graphitic carbon surfactant adsorption dye removal 1 introduction rapid growth in industrialization and urbanization has significantly affected the water bodies due to the release of huge industrial effluents which contains highly toxic inorganic and organic pollutants among them discharge of dye effluents without effective treatment from various industries including paper textile paint plastic carpet printing cosmetics and food causes colored pollution one of the major contributors to water pollution 1 3 dyes are chemical compounds that are capable of interacting with materials or surfaces to impart lasting colors their complex aromatic molecular structures with extreme stability and their resistance to temperature light and oxidizers makes these dyes difficult to biodegrade and there by affecting the water quality moreover owing to their intrinsic carcinogenic and mutagenic nature and sunlight inhibiting properties bio accumulation of dyes in living organisms results in severe diseases and disorders making it a potent water pollutant 4 therefore to reduce the negative effects of dyes on aqueous ecosystems it is imperative to remove the dyes from wastewater before discharging to the water bodies to date numerous techniques including adsorption photo catalytic decolonization sonochemical membrane distillation ultrafiltration flocculation coagulation microbial decomposition ozonation electrochemical and wet air oxidation have been employed to treat the dye bearing water and mitigate their impact on the environment 5 7 among the aforementioned methods adsorption is the most effective method and extensively used as it is the most facile and economically viable physicochemical process which has high effluent treatment performance easy operation procedure and widespread availability of adsorbent materials 8 11 carbon based materials are one of the most extensively explored and superior adsorbents that are commonly used for dye adsorption as it possess high capacity for the adsorption of organic materials 12 14 however its high cost has limited its use and researchers are on the lookout for finding cheaper and economically feasible sources for developing carbon based adsorbents 15 16 many authors have reported the use of natural industrial or agricultural wastes such as wheat straw 17 wood apple shell 18 macore fruit 19 eucalyptus sheathiana bark 20 kenaf fibre 21 palm tree 22 date stone 23 rice husk 24 sesame straw 25 etc for developing carbon adsorbents with the endeavor to develop low cost adsorbents with enhanced dye adsorption performance however despite tremendous efforts to utilize low cost carbon adsorbents developed from natural materials industrial or agricultural wastes for dye adsorption its low efficiency has prompted researchers to develop more efficient carbon adsorbent from environment friendly alternative materials thus development of the novel environmentally friendly carbon adsorbents with low cost and high removal performance are still highly desired yet challengeable in this study a porous graphitic carbon pgc developed from natural polymer alginate was utilized to remove methylene blue mb a model dye pollutant from aqueous solutions pgc is a green adsorbent as it was obtained from naturally occurring polysaccharide alginate biomass it has high selectivity low density low cost of manufacturing extremely high porosity good mechanical stability and high surface area making it an environment friendly and promising alternative material for dye adsorption to further improve the surface properties of the pgc a surface modification using sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs was performed and their adsorption capacity for mb a representative of the common cationic dyes found in waste water discharge from textile industry was investigated to the best of our knowledge the use of surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon s pgc for mb removal from aqueous solutions has never been reported in the literature thus the focus of the present study is to investigate the characteristics of the synthesized novel s pgc adsorbent and explore the possibility of using it for mb dye removal the effects of operating parameters such as ph contact time adsorbent dosage initial concentration and temperature on uptake capacity including the kinetics and sorption isotherm of mb during batch adsorption were reported furthermore efforts were paved on understanding the efficiency of the developed s pgc adsorbents in removing other cationic dyes such as methyl violet mv from aqueous solutions 2 experimental 2 1 materials methylene blue mb methyl violet mv sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs of analytical grade and alginic acid calcium salt from brown algae of food grade were received from sigma aldrich usa and used without any extra purification aqueous solutions of all chemicals were prepared using deionized water 2 2 preparation of adsorbent 2 2 1 preparation of pgc pgc was prepared via a simple carbonization process using alginic acid calcium salt from brown algae powder as the carbon precursor 26 to obtain the bio char the biomass material of alginate was placed in a muffle furnace and heated to 900 c at 10 c min in a nitrogen atmosphere the so obtained porous graphitic carbon pgc was cooled to room temperature and stored for further modification purpose 2 2 2 synthesis of sds and sdbs functionalized pgc the prepared pgc was modified using 1500 and 3000 mg l of sds anionic surfactant these concentrations were selected in such a way that it is above and below the critical micelle concentration cmc in a typical modification process 2 wt of pgc was added to a known concentration of surfactant solution and the mixture was stirred for 3 h at 30 c the resulting solid was then filtered and washed several times with deionized water to remove the remaining sds before being dried in an oven at 80 c to obtain the surfactant functionalized pgc similarly for comparison and understanding the effectiveness sdbs functionalized pgc was prepared using the same concentration the obtained samples were denoted as s pgc 1500 and s pgc 3000 where s stand for sds or sdbs depending on the type of anionic surfactant used for the functionalization 2 2 3 characterization of adsorbent the crystalline nature of the synthesized adsorbents was characterized using x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro powder diffractometer with cu kα radiation of 1 5406 a 2θ range of 5 70 and 40 kv 40 ma raman spectroscopy analysis were carried out using jobin yvon horiba labram spectrometer with a he ne laser and operated at 633 nm transmission electron microscopy tem analysis was performed using digital micrograph software gatan usa the porosity and bet surface area of pgc before and after modification were measured using n2 adsorption desorption analysis at 150 c on a micromeritics asps analyzer a scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta feg250 usa equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscope oxford edx uk was used to probe the surface morphologies and texture of the modified pgc adsorbents before and after mb adsorption the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir images of pristine pgc before and after surfactant modification as well as mb adsorbed and desorbed s pgc were recorded using nicolet 6700 ftir spectrophotometer in the wave number region from 400 to 4000 cm 1 finally the zeta potential of the adsorbents was measured between ph 3 0 and 13 0 using zeta pals instrument brookhaven instruments corporation usa with ph adjustment by adding appropriate amounts of 0 01 m naoh or hcl 2 2 4 batch adsorption studies stock solution 1000 ppm of mb was prepared by dissolving appropriate quantity of dye in deionized water and solutions of desired concentrations were prepared by successive dilution of the stock solution batch adsorption experiments were performed in 25 ml conical flasks containing 10 ml of mb solution with known initial concentration a fixed quantity of adsorbents was added and the stoppered conical flasks containing the mixtures were shaken mechanically in a temperature regulated water bath dihan korea at a constant speed of 140 rpm and predetermined temperature and time after the elapse of the contact time the supernatant samples were withdrawn and the residual dye equilibrium concentration was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer at a wave length of 664 nm the percentage removal of mb and amount of mb adsorbed at equilibrium q e was calculated using the eq 1 and 2 respectively 1 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q e v m c 0 c e where c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of mb mg l respectively m is the mass of adsorbent g v is the volume of the solution l similarly to understand how other cationic dyes such as mv and mo interacts with the developed s pgc adsorbents and compare its efficiency with pristine pgc batch adsorption experiments were carried out by using varying dye concentration from 0 to 1000 mg l 2 3 kinetic models it is essential to model the experimental data in order to evaluate the performance of the adsorbents with time understand the adsorption mechanism and get deep insight about the interaction between mb and surfactant modified pgc adsorbents in this work three kinetic models namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models were used to fit the experimental kinetic data 2 3 1 pseudo first order model the linear form of the lagergren pseudo first order model is expressed as 27 3 ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t where q t and q e are the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents at any time and at equilibrium respectively mg g k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 and t is the contact time min the plot of log q e q t versus t gives a linear relationship and the value of q e and k 1 can be determined from the intercept and slope of the plot respectively 2 3 2 pseudo second order model the differential equation of the pseudo second order model is generally described as 28 4 d q t d t k 2 q t q e 2 on integration the linearized and simplified form of ho s equation is given as 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant the equilibrium sorption capacity q e and the value of k 2 can be obtained from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of t q t versus t respectively 2 3 3 intra particle diffusion model the possibility of intra particle diffusion during the adsorption process was investigated using the linear form of the weber and morris 29 model and can be expressed as 6 q t k i d t 0 5 c where k i is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 0 5 at any stage i c is the boundary layer effect at that stage the plot of q t versus t 0 5 gives a linear relationship and the value of k i can be determined from the slope of the plot 8 2 4 adsorption isotherms 2 4 1 langmuir isotherm it is one of the most successfully used isotherms for describing various types of adsorption process the model is based on the following assumptions 1 adsorption takes place on a homogenous adsorbent surface having identical sites with the same degree of availability and magnitude of energy 2 localized adsorption as no interaction occurs between molecules of adsorbates and 3 each site can accommodate only equal amount of molecules 30 the linear form of langmuir model can be expressed mathematically as follows 7 1 q e 1 q m a x 1 q m a x k l c e where q e mg g is the dye equilibrium adsorption ability c e mg l is the equilibrium concentration of dye in the solution q m a x is the maximum dye adsorption capacity and k l l mg is the langmuir constant and corresponds to the adsorption energy from the linear plot of c e q e against c e the value of k l can be achieved however the dimensionless separation factor or equilibrium parameter r l which connotes the shape of the isotherm obtained from the langmuir isotherm is used to determine whether adsorption is favorable or unfavorable and can be defined as follows 8 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c 0 mg l is the initial concentration of mb in the solution the value of r l differentiates between irreversible r l 0 favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 adsorption processes 2 4 2 freundlich isotherm this model relies on the assumption that adsorption takes place on an heterogeneous surface at sites with varying energy of adsorption and hence is more suitable for non ideal processes with rough and heterogeneous surfaces 31 the linear form of the model can be mathematically depicted as below 9 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where k f mg1 1 n l1 n g is the freundlich constant and 1 n is the heterogeneity parameter which is an estimate of the intensity of adsorption 1 n and k f can be determined from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of log q e versus log c e respectively 2 4 3 d r isotherm this model describes that adsorption takes place both on homogenous and heterogeneous surfaces through a pore filling mechanism and is mainly applicable for single solute systems the linear form of the model is as follows 10 l n q e ln q s β ε 2 where q s is the theoretical isotherm saturation capacity mg g 1 β is the d r isotherm constant which is related to sorption energy mol2 kj 2 and ε is the polyani potential which is related to the equilibrium concentration as below 11 ε r t l n 1 1 c e r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t is the absolute temperature k the mean free energy of adsorption e kj mol 1 whose magnitude provides information on the mechanism of adsorption chemical or physical can be deduced from eq 12 12 e 1 2 β 3 results and discussions surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon using sds have been obtained through the process as described in scheme 1 pgc was modified using surfactant solution of sds at a concentration of 1500 and 3000 mg l as depicted in scheme 1 when pgc was added to anionic surfactant water system with surfactant concentration of 1500 mg l of sds which is less than cmc 2365 mg l surfactant ion or molecules adsorb onto the surface and just accumulate on carbon surface through hydrophobic interactions with their hydrophilic parts orienting toward the aqueous phase conversely when the concentration of the surfactant was 3000 mg l above cmc the surfactant molecules aggregate to form micelles that are very stable because of the physical reinforcement and remains in the bulk zone thus the subsequent introduction of surfactant by using a concentration above cmc provides additional functional groups and is believed to further enhance the overall functional performance however in case of sdbs modified pgc even though the cmc of sdbs was low 522 mg l modification was done using the same concentration of 1500 mg l and 3000 mg l so as to compare its effectiveness with sds modified pgc 3 1 characterization of adsorbents 3 1 1 xrd analysis the pristine and surfactant modified pgc adsorbents were characterized using x ray diffraction xrd and the obtained patterns are as depicted in fig 1 in the case of pure pgc the peaks observed at 2θ values of 26ᵒ 44ᵒ and 54ᵒ corresponds to the graphitic carbon planes 002 101 and 004 respectively jcpds file number 41 1487 these well resolved sharp diffraction peaks connote that the carbon has a highly ordered graphitized structure 26 in addition the diffraction peaks at 29ᵒ 34ᵒ 47ᵒ and 51ᵒ can be attributed to the formation of ca oh 2 formed due to the hydration of cao peaks 38ᵒ and 66ᵒ during storage on the other hand from fig 1 it can be seen that the diffraction peaks belonging to that of pristine pgc was observed even in case of s pgc suggesting that the degree of graphitic crystallinity was still maintained however the peaks have slightly shifted to the left which clearly indicates the conformational and textural change associated with the attachment of the surfactant chains on to the carbon surface 32 also the presence of additional peaks which are the characteristic of sds and sdbs ions on the surface of s pgc further indicates that the surfactants were successfully adsorbed onto the carbon surface through hydrophobic interactions 33 3 1 2 raman spectroscopy in order to have a better understanding of the graphitic structure of the prepared pgc and to verify that its graphitic structure is unaltered even after surfactant modification raman spectroscopic analysis was carried out as shown in fig 2 the spectra of pgc shows two bands one at 1360 cm 1 d band and 1580 cm 1 g band the d band is an indication of structural defects and disorders while the g band can be attributed to the vibration of sp2 bonded carbon in a cc bond stretching after modification the d band slightly shifted to a lower wave number and could be attributed to an increase in the degree of disorder within the material caused by modification of the surface of graphitic carbon by surfactant 34 on the other hand the g band remained unaltered further indicating that even after surfactant modification ordered graphitic structure of the carbon caused by the e2 g mode of the hexagonal graphite was unaffected and is in agreement with the results observed from xrd 3 1 3 tem analysis the typical tem image of pristine pgc and surfactant modified pgc are as shown in fig s1 the tem image of pristine pgc showed lattice fringes of about 0 336 nm and can be indexed to the 002 plane indicating that graphitic nature were prevalent in the pristine carbon 35 after modification the underlying graphitic structure was not changed however the graphitic nature of the carbon was found to be masked by the surfactant molecules as shown in fig s1 b and c 3 1 4 bet analysis the bet nitrogen adsorption and desorption analysis provided in fig s2 showed that modification of pgc by surfactants did not change the inherent structure of the pgc carbon both pristine and surfactant modified pgc was found to have a similar adsorption desorption isotherm curves of type iv with a hysteresis loop at 0 4 p p0 0 9 36 however pgc carbon was found to have a larger volume compared to s pgc indicating that the modification using surfactant decreased the pore volume as well as the surface area table 1 this is because when anionic surfactant molecules are coated on the carbon surface these molecules cover the porous channels and cause pore blocking as a result it is difficult for n2 to go into the pores subsequently the surface area of the modified carbon decreases drastically and this behavior is well documented in the literature 37 38 nevertheless with the presence of surfactant the active sites on the surface of pgc increases remarkably resulting in high dye removal efficiency thus annulling the effect of reduction in surface area and pore volume furthermore the pore size of the pgc increased after the modification irrespective of the type of surfactant and could be attributed to the capability of the surfactant molecules to organize themselves however a slight variation in the physical properties is observed between sds and sdbs modified pgc adsorbent and are due to the difference in the chemical structure shapes of micelles and affinity of the surfactant used for modification 3 1 5 sem edx analysis the structure and surface morphology of pristine pgc and that of s pgc adsorbents before and after mb adsorption were investigated by sem microscopy fig 3 pristine pgc was observed to possess uniform interconnected porous structures with cavities having pore size in lower nanometer range 26 however from the sem micrographs of s pgc adsorbents it is quite obvious that surfactant modifications have transformed the physio chemical and surface morphology of the pristine pgc bio char materials the heterogeneous nature of modified pgc surface further indicates successful interaction with sds and sdbs surfactants with the graphitic carbon surface theoretically these structures are believed to provide more active sites for adsorption of dyes and organic compounds 39 furthermore it was worthy to note the emergence and uniform distribution of na and s elements as seen from the corresponding edx spectrum fig 3 and elemental mapping shown in fig s3 supplementary material respectively for both sds and sdbs modified pgc confirming the successful modification of pgc by the surfactants 40 on the other hand after mb adsorption a drastic change was observed in the structural morphology of the s pgc adsorbents the micrographs shown in fig 3c and d clearly showed the attachment of mb molecules all over the carbon surface an indication of effective binding of mb molecules into the pores and cavities of these adsorbents in brief the mb molecules appear to have produced a film free of void which masks the reliefs of particles and porosity of the aggregates 39 41 the corresponding edx spectra fig 3 and elemental mapping shown in fig s4 supplementary material further confirmed the presence of n and cl and the uniform distribution of the elements on the surface of the adsorbed samples indicating that mb molecules were consistently and uniformly loaded onto the surface of the adsorbents particles forming a uniform network structure 3 1 6 ftir analysis the binding of surfactant molecules on the surface of pristine pgc was confirmed using ftir spectroscopy fig 4 depicts the ftir spectra of pristine pgc and after modification using sds and sdbs surfactants the characteristic vibration bands of pristine pgc due to the presence of adsorbed water molecules or hydroxyl oh groups 3425 cm 1 co vibration 1107 cm 1 and carbonate species 874 cm 1 were observed for all the adsorbents 26 the minor peak observed in pristine pgc at 2895 cm 1 attributed to the stretching of ch groups and the characteristic peak at 1431 cm 1 due to the lattice vibrations of coo groups were not found in the modified pgc after surfactant modification these identified spectra were replaced by the characteristic peaks of surfactants such as 2851 cm 1 and 1468 cm 1 stretching vibration of ch2 molecules in surfactant 42 furthermore the intensity of the spectra corresponding to hydroxyl oh groups present in pgc were drastically reduced in s pgc adsorbents this is because of the removal of hydroxyl oh groups into alkanes on the carbon surface with the addition of a surfactant 34 43 which is confirmed from the presence of new absorption band at 2820 cm 1 for modified carbon attributed to the stretching vibration of ch3 molecules present in sds or sdbs the detection of functional groups corresponding to surfactants further confirms that the anionic surfactants has been successfully embedded onto the surface of pgc through hydrophobic interaction after mb adsorption the ftir spectra of s pgc displayed in fig s5 showed significant changes in vibrations the slight increase in intensity and broadness of ir bands related to oh stretching 3431 cm 1 for mb adsorbed s pgc adsorbents confirms the presence of water molecules from adsorption 44 the band intensity at 2820 cm 1 and 2851 cm 1 was reduced significantly and the peaks at 1468 cm 1 disappeared due to utilization of surfactant related functional groups in s pgc adsorbents irrespective of the type of surfactant used for modification also the intensity of the broad bands between 1414 and 1450 cm 1 that denotes the ch bending of ch3 groups increased after adsorption indicating the successful adsorption of mb onto s pgc adsorbents 34 furthermore from fig s5 it can be seen that spent s pgc adsorbents regenerated using methanol had functional group similar to that of fresh adsorbents these results further confirm that methanol was successful in completely desorbing the adsorbed mb molecules from the surface of s pgc adsorbents 3 2 preliminary batch adsorption studies in order to determine the effectiveness of the prepared adsorbents in removing mb from wastewater preliminary adsorption experiments was conducted using the as prepared pristine and surfactant modified pgc adsorbents fig 5 depicts the percentage removal of the adsorbents with initial mb concentration of 100 mg l and varying adsorbent dosage it can be seen that with a maximum dosage of 30 mg only a 57 removal was achieved by the pristine pgc particles while the sdbs and sds modified pgc adsorbents attained 100 removal clearly indicating that the modification of the pgc has drastically enhanced its mb sorption capacity this can be attributed to the fact that mb being a cationic dye occurs as ions with positive charges in aqueous solutions there by participating in electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged s pgc adsorbents see fig 6 45 furthermore it can be seen from fig 5 that the concentration of sds and sdbs used for the modification of pgc also affected the sorption capacity of the adsorbents the adsorbents with 3000 mg l of the respective surfactants performed better than their counterpart s which were modified using 1500 mg l of the surfactants this is probably due to the increase in the available sorption sites with the increase in concentration of surfactants used for modification moreover it was observed that the sds modified pgc had slightly higher removal than the sdbs modified pgc irrespective of the concentration of surfactant used for the modification the order of the removal percentage of the adsorbents are as follows pgc sds 3000 pgc sdbs 3000 pgc sds 1500 pgc sdbs 1500 pgc therefore pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 which gave the highest removal of mb were used for carrying out further experiments 3 3 effect of operating parameters 3 3 1 effect of initial solution ph the initial ph of the solutions may improve or inhibit the uptake and the extent of adsorption as it controls the degree of ionization of basic and acidic compounds and the surface charge of the adsorbent in order to study the effect of initial solution ph on the sorption of mb on s pgc adsorbent the initial solution ph was adjusted to the desired value of 2 to 13 by adding 0 01 m naoh or hcl solutions fig 6 no significant influence of ph on mb dye removal was observed over the ph range from 2 to 10 this was further confirmed from the zeta potential which characterize the sensitivity of the s pgc adsorbent to the ph and their surface charges the results demonstrated that the surface was negatively charged throughout the studied solution ph emphasizing the point that electrostatic interaction plays the major role in this adsorption process however for a ph greater than 10 a consequential improvement in the removal was observed from 80 to 100 this is because as the ph of the solution increases the surface of the adsorbent acquires more negative charges due to the increase in the number of hydroxyl ions as a result the positively charged mb molecules compete with the increasingly negatively charged sds pgc and sdbs pgc surface derived predominantly from hydroxyl ions and produces electric double layer consequently the adsorption efficiency is enhanced at higher solution ph 46 47 since majority of the natural waterbodies exists at neutral ph further experiments were carried out at the original ph of the mb solution of 7 18 3 3 2 effect of contact time to gauge the equilibrium time a key factor in the adsorption processes the removal of mb by s pgc adsorbents were analyzed as a function of contact time over a period of 240 min and the results are as depicted in fig 7 high degree of mb removal was achieved within the first 15 min of contact with the dye for pgc sdbs 3000 96 11 removal and within 3 min for pgc sds 3000 98 89 removal the mb was completely removed attaining 99 99 removal by increasing the contact time up to 60 min beyond which no obvious increase in removal was observed as equilibrium was attained for both s pgc adsorbent this rapid rate of adsorption could be attributed to the availability of large amount of active sites present on the surface of s pgc once all the active sites are saturated system attains steady state and no further increase in removal were observed with increasing contact time thus the results imply that a contact time of 60 min was adequate to achieve saturated adsorption of mb onto both sds and sdbs modified pgc adsorbent 3 3 3 effect of adsorbent dosage the effect of amount of s pgc adsorbent on mb adsorption at three different initial concentrations was studied by varying the dosage from 5 to 30 mg and the results are presented in fig 8 for lower mb concentration of 100 mg l the removal percentage was higher than 93 and 97 for sdbs pgc 3000 and sds pgc 3000 respectively whereas for 300 mg l and 1000 mg l with increasing the amount of dosage from 5 to 30 mg the removal increased from 83 81 to 99 69 and 78 45 to 86 98 respectively for sdbs pgc 3000 and from 88 39 to 100 and 81 55 to 95 52 respectively for sds pgc 3000 thus in general for s pgc adsorbents the percentage mb removal increased with the amount of adsorbent irrespective of the initial mb concentration this might be because higher dosage provides more quantity of sorption sites for the adsorption of mb however the adsorption capacity of the s pgc adsorbents significantly decreased with an increase in adsorbent loading reaching 330 44 mg g from 1971 89 mg g and 332 34 mg g from 1975 40 mg g for sdbs pgc 3000 and sds pgc 3000 respectively when the quantity of adsorbent was increased from 5 mg to 30 mg the decrease in uptake capacity with an increase in adsorbent amount is attributed to the presence of unsaturated sites available on s pgc adsorbents during mb dye adsorption since no significant increase in the percentage removal was observed for a dosage above 10 mg as the available active sites are enough to efficiently adsorb the mb from aqueous solutions further experiments were conducted using 10 mg of s pgc adsorbents 3 3 4 effect of initial mb concentration besides adsorbent dosage the initial concentration of mb dye solution is also believed to influence the removal percentage and adsorption capacity greatly hence it is imperative to probe the influence of initial concentration of mb on adsorption and the results are as shown in fig 9 it was observed that for a fixed adsorbent dosage of 10 mg a complete removal i e 100 of was observed from 2 5 to 80 ppm of mb concentration for both s pgc adsorbents the total removal achieved at such low mb concentrations may be attributed to the high ratio of active binding sites to the number of mb molecules resulting in adequate adsorbent adsorbate interaction however further increasing the initial concentration of dye from 80 mg l to 1000 mg l the percentage removal decreased from 100 to 81 77 and 86 49 for sdbs pgc 3000 and sds pgc 3000 respectively this is because of the saturation of sorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent by the competing adsorbate molecules 40 on the other hand the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increased with increasing the initial dye concentration and could be as a result of the high driving force for mass transfer at higher initial dye concentrations 48 3 3 5 effect of temperature the diffusion rate of mb molecules is temperature dependent thus varying the process temperature is believed to alter the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the uptake of mb onto s pgc adsorbents was investigated at three different temperatures viz 25 c 35 c and 45 c and the results were used to determine the thermodynamic parameters and adsorption isotherms the obtained results are depicted in fig 10 the mb uptake capacity of both sds and sdbs modified pgc adsorbents increased with increasing the temperature from 25 to 45 c indicating clearly that mb is adsorbed endothermically onto s pgc adsorbents the rise in temperature leads to an increase in the interaction between the adsorbed mb molecules and the active sites on s pgc adsorbents owing to the faster rate of diffusion of mb molecules across the external boundary layer and internal pores of the adsorbents and minimal resistance offered by viscous forces in the liquid phase furthermore the expansion of the pore size could also be responsible for the enhanced adsorption capacities exhibited by these adsorbents at high temperature consequently both the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity increased with temperature 15 49 3 4 adsorption kinetics it is important to study the adsorption kinetics as it provides deep insight about adsorption rate and corresponding adsorption mechanisms table 2 contains the kinetic parameters determined from the intercepts and slopes of various kinetic models viz pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models the regression calculations were done using microsoft excel comparing the values of the coefficient of determination r 2 of these models indicates that the sorption of mb onto the two modified pgc i e sdbs and sds adsorbents followed pseudo second order kinetics with a perfect r2 value of 1 in addition the predicted value of q e q e c a l obtained from the pseudo second order model was the closest to the experimentally determined q e value determined experimentally q e e x p further confirming that adsorption of mb onto modified pgc is controlled by chemisorption which involves sharing of valence electrons between the adsorbate and adsorbents conversely the intra particle diffusion model plots did not pass through the origin implying that internal diffusion is not the only rate controlling step rather the sorption of mb onto s pgc adsorbent was controlled by other mechanisms for pgc sds 3000 sorption of mb was found to be governed by three sequential stages the first stage where the rate of adsorption was fastest and occurred within the first 5 min of the process which represents instantaneous adsorption and external diffusion of mb on the surface of the adsorbent the second stage 5 20 min where a decrease in slope was observed due to intra particle diffusion in which the dye molecules migrated to the pores and are adsorbed to the inner active sites and finally the third stage 20 60 min where the adsorption equilibrium was achieved and could be attributed to a decrease in mb concentration in the solution and availability of active sites similarly the sorption of mb onto pgc sdbs 3000 was controlled by three stages but in this case the first second and third stages occur at 1 15 min 15 45 min and 45 60 min respectively therefore these observations further reaffirm that along with intra particle diffusion other mechanisms were involved in the sorption of mb onto modified pgc 3 5 adsorption isotherm the adsorption study conducted at three different temperatures based on varying the initial mb concentration fig 10 was used to evaluate the sorption capacity of the surfactant modified pgc adsorbents and to determine the equilibrium adsorption isotherms these isotherms are primarily employed to describe the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates hence correlation of the equilibrium data by either empirical or theoretical equation is paramount for practical operations the linear form of langmuir freundlich and d r isotherms eqs 7 9 and 10 respectively were used to compute the data presented in table 3 using microsoft excel from table 3 it is possible to discern that among the three models the experimental data fitted perfectly well with langmuir and freundlich models with a r 2 greater than 0 9 compared to d r model r 2 0 8 however a better linearity was exhibited by fitting the curves with freundlich isotherm model than langmuir elucidating the multilayer adsorption of mb dye which may be attributed to the various active sites present on the adsorbent the maximum sorption capacity q m a x of the two adsorbents pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 as calculated using the langmuir model were 714 28 and 769 23 mg g respectively at 25 c the high adsorption affinity exhibited by s pgc adsorbents can be ascribed to the presence of certain functional groups and the surface charge property such as the strong electrostatic interaction between the cationic dye molecules and negatively charged adsorbent surface furthermore the π π stacking of aromatic rings and hydrogen bonding interaction is also believed to play a significant role in the adsorption of mb onto these surfactant modified pgc adsorbents more so as the temperature increased from 25 to 45 c q m a x increased from 714 28 to 833 33 mg g and 769 23 to 909 09 mg g for pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 respectively also it was interesting to observe that sds modified pgc adsorbent has a slightly higher adsorption capacity for mb than sdbs modified one and could be attributed to the bulky benzene ring present in the latter one which slightly prohibits the effective sorption of mb dye due to is negative effect towards the formation of one dimensional surfactant aggregates on adsorbent surface the value of separation factor r l fell within 0 and 1 at all the three temperatures indicating that the adsorption was favorable similar to q m a x r l also increased with an increase in temperature this was because the values of r l was directly proportional to of adsorption as a result increase in temperature favored adsorption and thus the value of r l increased with temperature the freundlich model parameter n which is a measure of the intensity of mb adsorption from aqueous solution calculated at all temperatures exhibited values ranging between 2 41 and 3 19 the high value of k f and n at all temperature not only indicate chemisorption and favorable adsorption but also provides information on the heterogeneity of the surface and the exponential distribution of active sites and their energies the value of mean free energy e obtained from the d r model which was used for identifying whether the adsorption of mb onto s pgc adsorbents were by physisorption or chemisorption was found to be greater than 8 0 kj mol 1 the obtained e value further confirms that the mechanism of adsorption of mb dye onto s pgc adsorbent is through site specific adsorption or chemisorption 40 3 6 thermodynamic study to determine the practical applicability of the adsorption process thermodynamic values must be taken into consideration the dependency of temperature on various parameters related to adsorption process such as standard gibb s free energy change δ g kj mol 1 standard enthalpy change δ h kj mol 1 and standard entropy change δ s j mol 1 were calculated using eqs 13 and 14 and the obtained results are given in table 4 13 δ g r t l n k l 14 l n k l δ s r δ h r t where r 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t k are the universal gas constant and the absolute temperature respectively the values of δ h and δ s were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of l n k l versus 1 t for both pgc adsorbents the value of δ g is negative an indication that the sorption of mb is thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous 50 in addition as temperature is increased δ g values becomes more negative suggesting the presence of an energy barrier at low temperature and sorption process is more favorable at higher temperatures the positive values of δ h 44 28 and 23 30 kj mol 1 for pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 respectively denote that the sorption process followed an endothermic behavior similarly the positive values of δ s 173 01 and 105 40 kj mol 1 for pgc sdbs 3000 and pgc sds 3000 respectively signify that there is an increase in randomness at the adsorbent liquid interface during the adsorption of mb onto s pgc s with possible interaction and structural changes between mb molecules and s pgc particles 50 51 thus the two as synthesized surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon showed faster adsorption rate and higher adsorption capacity for mb dye indicating its potential applications in industry as adsorbents to treat colored wastewater 3 7 mechanism the surface of the s pgc adsorbents is negatively charged owing to the presence of the polar surfactant head so3 group directing towards the bulk of the solution in the event when methylene blue dye which is positively charged n group comes in contact with the carbon surface adsorption occurs through electrostatic interaction resulting in the removal of mb also some of the mb molecules are believed to be adsorbed onto the s pgc surface through hydrophobic interaction between mb and hydrocarbon tail of the surfactant the proposed mechanism illustrating the adsorption of mb onto s pgc is described schematically in scheme 2 3 8 regeneration the reusability of an adsorbent regeneration is an important parameter in determining the effectiveness of the adsorbent for wastewater treatment regeneration of spent adsorbents is usually performed in order to reuse it minimize waste and save the cost of acquiring a new one three different eluents viz hcl hno3 and methanol were tested as regenerants for the release of adsorbed mb from s pgc adsorbents and achieve complete desorption among the aforementioned eluents only methanol completely desorbed the adsorbed mb and hence was used for further regeneration studies fig 11 shows three cycles of adsorption desorption processes carried out at the same reaction conditions a fixed amount i e 0 01 g of the adsorbents was used to adsorb 200 mg l of mb solution followed by desorption and the process was repeated thrice from fig 11 it was observed that even after 3 cycles of adsorption desorption process both s pgc adsorbents exhibited no significant loss in removal indicating high stability and recyclability of the two adsorbents the percentage removal observed for pgc sds 3000 was 98 46 96 26 and 95 19 for first second and third adsorption desorption cycle respectively while 98 14 91 70 and 90 89 for pgc sds 3000 from these results it can be concluded that the pgc modified adsorbents can be used for multiple cycles of mb adsorption with no secondary pollutions in the waste water treatment process 3 9 comparison with other adsorbents a comparison of the surfactant modified pgc adsorbents prepared in this study and other bio derived activated carbons reported in the literature based on the maximum mb adsorption capacity q m a x are presented in table 4 as shown in table 4 sdbs and sds functionalized porous graphitic carbon have the highest adsorption capacities with q m a x values of 714 28 and 769 23 mg g respectively at 25 c and is so far the highest reported in literature for any bio derived carbon also it was interesting to observe that its mb adsorption capacity was even comparable to sds exfoliated graphene particles 782 3 mg g at 25 c 52 this superiority of surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon along with excellent reusability not only demonstrate their excellent adsorption characteristics but also fortify their capability to be used as an attractive and effective candidate for the removal mb dye from wastewater table 5 3 10 adsorptive removal of other cationic dyes as the key mechanism involved in the adsorptive removal of mb dye from aqueous solution using the as prepared anionic surfactant modified pgc is electrostatic interaction it is of utmost importance to study the removal of other cationic dyes this would enable in understanding the practicability of using s pgc as an adsorbent for cationic dyes fig s6 provides the q e vs c e curve exhibited by pristine and modified pgc for both mb and mv adsorption from aqueous solution the comparison of the q m a x value of mb and mv dye adsorption obtained from the langmuir isotherm fig 12 confirms that surfactant treatment has drastically enhanced the mb and mv adsorption capacity of pristine pgc furthermore the results showed that both sds and sdbs modified pgc has extraordinary affinity for mb and mv with sds modified pgc pgc sds 3000 giving the maximum mb and mv loading efficiency of 769 23 mg g and 724 64 mg g in summary the features of large pore size and suitable zeta potential of developed s pgc along with its excellent reusability make it a promising adsorbent for the treatment of colored waste water contaminated with cationic dyes 4 conclusion this study demonstrates for the first time that anionic surfactant modified porous graphitic carbon s pgc prepared from alginate biomass exhibits superior mb adsorption performance compared to unmodified pgc at 25 c sds and sdbs modified pgc demonstrated a maximum mb adsorption capacity of 714 28 and 769 23 mg g respectively greater than many of the bio derived carbon adsorbents reported in the literature various theoretical models were used to investigate the main mechanism responsible for the adsorption in particular the temperature of the solution had a significant influence on dye removal with higher temperatures favoring dye adsorption conversely no variation in removal efficiency was observed with ph up to 10 indicating that the attractive interactions between the oxygenated edge groups present on the pgc surface and dye had negligible effect on the amount of methylene blue adsorbed meanwhile the analysis of the experimental kinetic data for both s pgc adsorbents showed excellent agreement with the adsorption parameters predicted using the pseudo second order kinetics model the adsorption experimental results were also consistent with the freundlich adsorption isotherm suggesting the chemisorption of mb with the active sites present on the chemically heterogeneous s pgc carbon surface therefore it can be concluded that altering the surface of pgc with surfactants enhanced the overall mb adsorption efficiency of pgc illustrating the potential of s pgc as a promising effective low cost and industrially viable carbon based adsorbent for removing colored cationic dye pollutants from wastewaters acknowledgment the first and second

nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid with potent antipyretic and analgesic properties which also has a protective action against different oxidative agents 1 2 nevertheless nsaids also induce adverse side effects as gastrointestinal disorders 3 p belongs to the oxicams family which are enolic acid derived nsaids it was patented by j g lombardino in 1971 and has been marketed by pfizer inc as feldene since 1980 the patents expired in 1992 and since then it has been a generic drug sold worldwide under several commercial names 4 5 recent investigations correlating uv vis spectrophotometric and low temperature nuclear magnetic resonance measurements with theoretical quantum calculations have shown that in aqueous solution p exists only in its enolamide tautomer due to the fact that the equilibrium of this tautomer with the following more stable one the zwitterionic tautomer is completely displaced towards the former 6 the chemical structure of the enolamide tautomer is shown in scheme 1 p presents a weakly basic site on the pyridine nitrogen and an acidic proton on the enol moiety due to this versatility in its acid basic behavior the uv vis spectrum of the drug in aqueous solution is highly dependent on the ph of the medium 7 10 p also has the ability to complex transition metallic cations both in solution and in solid state the complexation takes place through two coordination sites the pyridine nitrogen atom and the oxygen atom from the amide moiety 11 19 several authors have reported the presence of many ingredients of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps 20 like p and other nsaids in various aquatic ecosystems around the world in concentrations of ng l 1 or even μg l 1 21 22 all these substances including p can be considered as new emerging contaminants 23 which show some generic characteristics all of them have polar and very stable chemical structures thus featuring low degradability and biodegradability wastewater treatment plants are unable to remove these poorly reactive substances after application of conventional chemical or biological remediation processes this means emerging contaminants are released slightly transformed or even unchanged into aquatic environments 24 25 advanced oxidation processes aops 26 29 are a set of techniques based on the generation of hydroxyl radicals ho 30 or other similar radical species with the objective of oxidizing substrates generally organic that cannot be oxidized by conventional techniques the most important aops are ozonation 31 32 photolysis with uv or γ gamma radiation 33 34 electrooxidation 35 36 and fenton chemistry 37 38 aops involve a fundamental step the generation of ho this radical oxidizes non specifically organic substrates with high reaction rates the mechanism may include the addition of ho to aromatic rings or other types of unsaturated bonds as well as the extraction of a hydrogen atom from the organic substrate initiating a radical chain reaction in particular fenton chemistry involves the activation of h2o2 by the fenton reaction eq 1 scheme 2 39 the complete mechanism of the fenton reaction has not been totally elucidated some authors have found evidence of the formation of an adduct between the iron iii and ho which is the reactive species responsible for the oxidation of organic substrates 40 other authors have proposed the formation of higher oxidation states of iron as intermediates 41 however it is known that the fenton reaction is part of a more complex scheme of radical elementary reactions called haber weiss cycle scheme 3 which shows the catalytic nature of the process the haber weiss reaction equation 4 the sum of equations 1 and 3 scheme 3 does not occur in the absence of iron cations 42 the critical experimental parameters in a fenton s process at constant temperature are the ph of the medium and the initial concentrations of iron ii and h2o2 although ph depends in part on the acid basic nature of the organic substrate the optimum ph for fenton s oxidation process is around 3 at higher phs various fe iii aquohydroxy complexes are formed which precipitate by a coagulation phenomenon 39 oxicams are substrates sensitive to oxidation by ho some authors have studied the interaction of p and ho at ph 4 in water acetonitrile 80 20 determining a kinetic constant of 2 2 1010 l mol 1 s 1 43 feng studied the degradation of p in aqueous medium at ph 3 and initial concentration of fe ii of 2 0 10 4 mol l 1 by electro fenton obtaining a value of 2 2 109 l mol 1 s 1 for the kinetic constant of this reaction 22 in the present work we report the study of p degradation by homogeneous fenton s reaction in aqueous medium at room temperature the ph of the medium and initial concentrations of fe ii and h2o2 were optimized additionally a spectrophotometric study of the complexation of fe ii and fe iii by p and its influence on the organic substrate degradation were carried out 2 experimental details 2 1 materials the degradation tests of the organic substrate p sigma chem co were performed using h2o2 30 w w anedra and fe ii sulfate heptahydrate mallinckrodt in ultrapure water solutions of sodium hydroxide cicarelli and or sulfuric acid tetrahedron were used to fix the ph pure methanol merck was used in kinetic studies and iron iii sulfate berna was used for

electrode boeco ba 25 2 3 interactions between p and iron cations in order to study the interactions between p and fe iii in aqueous solution the uv vis spectra of a solution of the drug 5 76 10 5 mol l 1 in sulfuric acid ph 3 0 were recorded before and after the addition of increasing volumes of 8 84 10 3 mol l 1 iron iii sulfate solution in the same medium analogous experiments to study the interactions between p and fe ii cation were carried out increasing volumes of 7 37 10 3 mol l 1 fe ii sulfate solution in sulfuric acid ph 3 0 were added to a 5 76 10 5 mol l 1 solution of p in the same medium and uv vis spectra of these solutions were recorded further experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the effects of the iron cations complexation by the substrate on the degradation of the latter for this the spectral evolution of the mixture 4 64 10 5 mol l 1 p 3 55 10 4 mol l 1 fe ii and 0 016 mol l 1 h2o2 in sulfuric acid ph 3 0 was monitored in parallel two other experiments were performed to evaluate the chemical stability of p in the same initial concentration and in the same medium under two different conditions in the presence of 3 55 10 4 mol l 1 fe ii and 6 14 10 4 mol l 1 fe iii respectively and in the absence of h2o2 the time evolution of these three mixtures was followed by uv vis spectrophotometry recording their spectra every 24 h for a period of eight days 2 4 kinetic runs the kinetic runs were performed in a batch reactor 44 which consisted of a glass beaker placed on a magnetic stirrer open to the atmosphere and at room temperature a ph electrode was placed inside the beaker to check the ph during the reaction samples were withdrawn at different times stopping the reaction by adding a volume of pure methanol which is an effective ho scavenger 45 the absorbances of these samples were measured at 380 nm the absolute value of the slopes of the first kinetic order plots of the experimental data were taken as a parameter for comparing the reaction rates of the different runs tested the kinetic study was developed in three stages in each one of them a parameter was optimized the initial ph the initial concentrations of fe ii and the initial concentrations of h2o2 in all experiments an initial concentration of p of 0 0164 g l 1 4 94 10 5 mol l 1 was used slightly lower than the maximum solubility of the drug in water 0 02 g l 1 46 3 results and discussion 3 1 interactions between p and iron cations fig 1 shows the uv vis spectra of solutions of p in ultrapure water fe ii sulfate in sulfuric acid ph 3 0 fe iii sulfate in sulfuric acid ph 3 0 h2o2 sulfuric acid and methanol p spectrum at ph 7 features three bands in the uv region two intense bands centered at 251 nm and at 359 nm and a third with a lower intensity at 285 nm fig 1 inset shows the uv vis spectra of a solution of p in sulfuric media at different concentrations a hypsochromic effect is observed as the concentration of sulfuric acid in the medium increases fe iii presents an intense band centered at 295 nm which partially overlaps with the p band closest to the visible region fig 2 shows the spectral evolution of a solution of 5 67 10 5 mol l 1 p in sulfuric acid ph 3 0 with the addition of different volumes of 8 84 10 5 mol l 1 fe iii sulfate solution in the same medium the appearance of isosbestic points and the appreciable modification of the profile of the p spectrum were evidence of the formation of a complex between the organic substrate and the metallic cation the p fe iii mixture shows a uv vis spectrum notoriously different from the individual spectra of both species or the sum of both one of the main differences observed is the pronounced absorbance decrease of the p band centered at 359 nm however the spectra of the three species p fe iii and the complex are totally overlapped hence an independent quantification of any of them by direct uv vis spectrophotometry is not possible a similar situation is observed when the fluorescence emission spectra of the three species were recorded data not shown fig 3 shows the spectral evolution for a second experiment analogous to the previous one but in which additions of an fe ii sulfate solution were made on the original p solution the absorbance decreases of the p spectrum due to the consecutive additions of fe ii solution cannot be attributed only to a dilution of the original solution isosbestic points evidenced the formation of a new species probably a fe ii p complex 3 2 effect of the complexation on p degradation even though p forms complexes with both iron cations it should not prevent its degradation aruoma and halliwell reported that iron ions complexed by susceptible to fenton oxidation substrates are able to generate ho which can attack those substrates despite the complexation 47 temporal evolution spectra of the reaction mixture are shown in fig 4 progressive transformation of the spectrum of the mixture tending to the profile of the fe iii sulfate solution is observed characterized by the absorption band centered at 295 nm this fact may indicate that the degradation of the organic substrate complexed or free has been carried out with fe iii remaining in the solution likewise the decrease in the intensity of the band towards 200 nm corresponding to the superposition of the sulfate anion and h2o2 spectra is evidence of the decomposition of the latter with the progress of the degradation reaction finally the decrease in the intensity of the band assigned to the fe iii cation until its stabilization on the sixth day was attributed to the progressive precipitation of the cation either as oxide or as hydroxide which was observed under the naked eye in the recipient with the formation of a red orange precipitate two more experiments were carried out to evaluate the stability of the drug in aqueous solution in the absence of h2o2 and in the presence of the fe ii and fe iii cations respectively the uv vis spectra of the mixture p fe ii recorded for eight days are shown in fig 3 inset the spectra at different times suggest that the complexation of fe ii by p is a slow reaction and that under these conditions p was not degraded notice there is no evidence of the presence of fe iii cations or its complex with p which leads to think that complexation would protect the metallic ion from oxidation the series of spectra that show the temporal evolution of the mixture p fe iii is shown in fig 2 inset from the spectra analysis it is possible to conclude that there is no chemical degradation of the organic substrate besides the precipitation of both species p and fe iii either free or complexed was observed 3 3 optimization of the initial conditions as described in section 2 4 and according to the obtained results a kinetic analysis of the reaction mixtures was carried out 3 3 1 optimization of the initial ph in the first stage kinetic runs using a mixture containing p 4 94 10 5 mol l 1 fe ii 2 73 10 4 mol l 1 and h2o2 0 016 mol l 1 at constant initial concentrations and varying ph between 1 8 and 3 6 were carried out temporal evolution of the reaction mixture at ph 3 0 is shown in fig 5 inset similar spectra were obtained for the rest of the runs data not shown it should be noted that the ph does not vary during the reaction experimental data of ln a t a 0 v s t for each kinetic run were plotted fig 5 in fig 6 the values of the slopes of the linear fittings vs ph are shown the coagulation of fenton s reagent at ph higher than 3 3 was observed in agreement with previous experimental observations reported by other authors indicating that the use of higher p h values is not useful 39 48 analysis of fig 6 indicates that the highest degradation rate of p occurs at a ph 2 8 but is very similar to the rate value at ph 3 0 considering the potential applications for waste water treatment ph 3 0 was selected as the optimized parameter due to the lower cost of adjusting an effluent at ph 3 0 compared to ph 2 8 employment of higher ph values apparently increase rate constant data not shown this could be explained considering that in strongly acidic solution fe iii exists as the hexaaquo ion fe h2o 6 3 26 but as ph increases this ion is hydrolyzed ending in precipitation of ferric oxyhydroxides meaning that the reaction does not proceed in an homogeneous media the ph value obtained is in accordance with those previously reported in the literature for the degradation of various organic compounds by fenton s reaction using fe ii as catalyst 39 3 3 2 optimization of the initial fe ii and h2o2 concentrations the experimental data for the optimization of the initial concentration of fe ii are shown below fig 7 a shows the absolute values of the slopes of the linear fittings as a function of the initial concentration of fe ii the optimum initial concentration of fe ii determined for the degradation of p under the conditions described here was 3 69 10 4 mol l 1 fe ii concentration in a given fenton s process is usually in 1 10 3 1 10 2 mol l 1 range 49 51 however values up to 0 3 mol l 1 have been reported for highly contaminated effluents 52 in the particular case of p degraded by h2o2 generated electrochemically a value of 2 10 4 mol l 1 for the optimum concentration of fe ii has been reported 22 which is in agreement with the one obtained in this work additionally the degradation reaction rate of p in absence of fe ii is two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained using the optimum concentration of the catalyst fig 7b shows the optimization of initial concentration of h2o2 plot according to this figure it is possible to affirm that a concentration of 0 53 mol l 1 h2o2 may achieve the fastest degradation of p in the optimized conditions the fe h2o2 ratio is 7 10 4 a low value which could be probably improved using photo fenton technics 4 conclusions piroxicam is an important nsaid widely used as antipyretic and anti inflammatory drug although it is considered as new emerging contaminant present in diverse water sources a way of removing this drug is by means of the advanced oxidation process as fenton reaction the optimization for the homogeneous fenton process of the nsaid piroxicam degradation in aqueous solution was studied including the influence of the formation of complexes on this process experimental evidences of the formation of two complexes between p and fe ii and fe iii were found however results suggest that complexation does not prevent the development of the fenton reaction for the determination of the optimum concentrations of h2o2 and fe ii it was chosen to work in ph 3 0 medium where a high p degradation rate is ensured 3 69 10 4 mol l 1 was determined as the optimum concentration of the catalyst

and 6 14 10 4 mol l 1 fe iii respectively and in the absence of h2o2 the time evolution of these three mixtures was followed by uv vis spectrophotometry recording their spectra every 24 h for a period of eight days 2 4 kinetic runs the kinetic runs were performed in a batch reactor 44 which consisted of a glass beaker placed on a magnetic stirrer open to the atmosphere and at room temperature a ph electrode was placed inside the beaker to check the ph during the reaction samples were withdrawn at different times stopping the reaction by adding a volume of pure methanol which is an effective ho scavenger 45 the absorbances of these samples were measured at 380 nm the absolute value of the slopes of the first kinetic order plots of the experimental data were taken as a parameter for comparing the reaction rates of the different runs tested the kinetic study was developed in three stages in each one of them a parameter was optimized the initial ph the initial concentrations of fe ii and the initial concentrations of h2o2 in all experiments an initial concentration of p of 0 0164 g l 1 4 94 10 5 mol l 1 was used slightly lower than the maximum solubility of the drug in water 0 02 g l 1 46 3 results and discussion 3 1 interactions between p and iron cations fig 1 shows the uv vis spectra of solutions of p in ultrapure water fe ii sulfate in sulfuric acid ph 3 0 fe iii sulfate in sulfuric acid ph 3 0 h2o2 sulfuric acid and methanol p spectrum at ph 7 features three bands in the uv region two intense bands centered at 251 nm and at 359 nm and a third with a lower intensity at 285 nm fig 1 inset shows the uv vis spectra of a solution of p in sulfuric media at different concentrations a hypsochromic effect is observed as the concentration of sulfuric acid in the medium increases fe iii presents an intense band centered at 295 nm which partially overlaps with the p band closest to the visible region fig 2 shows the spectral evolution of a solution of 5 67 10 5 mol l 1 p in sulfuric acid ph 3 0 with the addition of different volumes of 8 84 10 5 mol l 1 fe iii sulfate solution in the same medium the appearance of isosbestic points and the appreciable modification of the profile of the p spectrum were evidence of the formation of a complex between the organic substrate and the metallic cation the p fe iii mixture shows a uv vis spectrum notoriously different from the individual spectra of both species or the sum of both one of the main differences observed is the pronounced absorbance decrease of the p band centered at 359 nm however the spectra of the three species p fe iii and the complex are totally overlapped hence an independent quantification of any of them by direct uv vis spectrophotometry is not possible a similar situation is observed when the fluorescence emission spectra of the three species were recorded data not shown fig 3 shows the spectral evolution for a second experiment analogous to the previous one but in which additions of an fe ii sulfate solution were made on the original p solution the absorbance decreases of the p spectrum due to the consecutive additions of fe ii solution cannot be attributed only to a dilution of the original solution isosbestic points evidenced the formation of a new species probably a fe ii p complex 3 2 effect of the complexation on p degradation even though p forms complexes with both iron cations it should not prevent its degradation aruoma and halliwell reported that iron ions complexed by susceptible to fenton oxidation substrates are able to generate ho which can attack those substrates despite the complexation 47 temporal evolution spectra of the reaction mixture are shown in fig 4 progressive transformation of the spectrum of the mixture tending to the profile of the fe iii sulfate solution is observed characterized by the absorption band centered at 295 nm this fact may indicate that the degradation of the organic substrate complexed or free has been carried out with fe iii remaining in the solution likewise the decrease in the intensity of the band towards 200 nm corresponding to the superposition of the sulfate anion and h2o2 spectra is evidence of the decomposition of the latter with the progress of the degradation reaction finally the decrease in the intensity of the band assigned to the fe iii cation until its stabilization on the sixth day was attributed to the progressive precipitation of the cation either as oxide or as hydroxide which was observed under the naked eye in the recipient with the formation of a red orange precipitate two more experiments were carried out to evaluate the stability of the drug in aqueous solution in the absence of h2o2 and in the presence of the fe ii and fe iii cations respectively the uv vis spectra of the mixture p fe ii recorded for eight days are shown in fig 3 inset the spectra at different times suggest that the complexation of fe ii by p is a slow reaction and that under these conditions p was not degraded notice there is no evidence of the presence of fe iii cations or its complex with p which leads to think that complexation would protect the metallic ion from oxidation the series of spectra that show the temporal evolution of the mixture p fe iii is shown in fig 2 inset from the spectra analysis it is possible to conclude that there is no chemical degradation of the organic substrate besides the precipitation of both species p and fe iii either free or complexed was observed 3 3 optimization of the initial conditions as described in section 2 4 and according to the obtained results a kinetic analysis of the reaction mixtures was carried out 3 3 1 optimization of the initial ph in the first stage kinetic runs using a mixture containing p 4 94 10 5 mol l 1 fe ii 2 73 10 4 mol l 1 and h2o2 0 016 mol l 1 at constant initial concentrations and varying ph between 1 8 and 3 6 were carried out temporal evolution of the reaction mixture at ph 3 0 is shown in fig 5 inset similar spectra were obtained for the rest of the runs data not shown it should be noted that the ph does not vary during the reaction experimental data of ln a t a 0 v s t for each kinetic run were plotted fig 5 in fig 6 the values of the slopes of the linear fittings vs ph are shown the coagulation of fenton s reagent at ph higher than 3 3 was observed in agreement with previous experimental observations reported by other authors indicating that the use of higher p h values is not useful 39 48 analysis of fig 6 indicates that the highest degradation rate of p occurs at a ph 2 8 but is very similar to the rate value at ph 3 0 considering the potential applications for waste water treatment ph 3 0 was selected as the optimized parameter due to the lower cost of adjusting an effluent at ph 3 0 compared to ph 2 8 employment of higher ph values apparently increase rate constant data not shown this could be explained considering that in strongly acidic solution fe iii exists as the hexaaquo ion fe h2o 6 3 26 but as ph increases this ion is hydrolyzed ending in precipitation of ferric oxyhydroxides meaning that the reaction does not proceed in an homogeneous media the ph value obtained is in accordance with those previously reported in the literature for the degradation of various organic compounds by fenton s reaction using fe ii as catalyst 39 3 3 2 optimization of the initial fe ii and h2o2 concentrations the experimental data for the optimization of the initial concentration of fe ii are shown below fig 7 a shows the absolute values of the slopes of the linear fittings as a function of the initial concentration of fe ii the optimum initial concentration of fe ii determined for the degradation of p under the conditions described here was 3 69 10 4 mol l 1 fe ii concentration in a given fenton s process is usually in 1 10 3 1 10 2 mol l 1 range 49 51 however values up to 0 3 mol l 1 have been reported for highly contaminated effluents 52 in the particular case of p degraded by h2o2 generated electrochemically a value of 2 10 4 mol l 1 for the optimum concentration of fe ii has been reported 22 which is in agreement with the one obtained in this work additionally the degradation reaction rate of p in absence of fe ii is two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained using the optimum concentration of the catalyst fig 7b shows the optimization of initial concentration of h2o2 plot according to this figure it is possible to affirm that a concentration of 0 53 mol l 1 h2o2 may achieve the fastest degradation of p in the optimized conditions the fe h2o2 ratio is 7 10 4 a low value which could be probably improved using photo fenton technics 4 conclusions piroxicam is an important nsaid widely used as antipyretic and anti inflammatory drug although it is considered as new emerging contaminant present in diverse water sources a way of removing this drug is by means of the advanced oxidation process as fenton reaction the optimization for the homogeneous fenton process of the nsaid piroxicam degradation in aqueous solution was studied including the influence of the formation of complexes on this process experimental evidences of the formation of two complexes between p and fe ii and fe iii were found however results suggest that complexation does not prevent the development of the fenton reaction for the determination of the optimum concentrations of h2o2 and fe ii it was chosen to work in ph 3 0 medium where a high p degradation rate is ensured 3 69 10 4 mol l 1 was determined as the optimum concentration of the catalyst fe ii while 0 53 mol l 1 is the optimal initial concentration of h2o2 funding sources this work was supported by contributions from universidad nacional de san luis san luis proico 2 2714 and consejo
