21215,the fossil source energy consumption in maritime transportation is an important input which affects the operating costs in this market cargo ships with potentially represents up to 78 of the total global maritime transportation are considered as vessels with a high fossil fuel consumption these ships need effective energy management to reduce environmental pollution from fossil fuel and to manage sustainable energy related costs in commerce in this study an energy efficiency strategy framework was developed primarily to support efficient energy management as the decision support element in ships considering the ship s cruising processes energy efficiency and economic effectiveness were examined as based on the exergy approach and the economic criteria in this context two new criteria were developed the environmental cost index eci and the energy efficiency index eei according to the analyzes results the energy and exergy efficiencies in the sample ship s cruising processes were found as 38 33 and 35 82 respectively and the calculated eci was 0 41 these reference values showed that the fuel related loss cost of the ship was 19 05 at the end of the study some

climate change maritime shipping which covers about 90 of world transport is an exceptional sector which is showing important developments in this sector where the bulk carrier transportation rate reaches approximately 78 of the total commodity transportation in the world energy consumption does not only have an environmental impact but also has increasing economic costs from this perspective while developing solutions for this problem all of the actors primary strategy must be based on an energy efficiency approach but first of all this effect must be described individualistically on the basis of energy consumption in this context the international maritime organization imo carries out comprehensive studies to reduce the increasing emission effect like energy efficiency design index eedi and ship energy efficiency management plan seemp in particular researches communiqués and studies based on technical operational and design measures as well as effective energy management processes and reductions of greenhouse gas emissions which can be implemented in existing ships are being continually carried out ferreira and kirk 2012 the shipping industry has a significant environmental impact cross border nature and slow progress in reaching environmental and social sustainability aims schwanen 2015 shipping is the only sector in the eu where greenhouse gas emissions have risen since 1990 and in particular the respective shares of emitted air pollutants coming from long distance air and maritime transport are growing ep 2015 although having a highly competitive atmosphere the shipping industry has low cooperation among stakeholders from an environmental protection point of view governments and the shipping industry s interests are not fully matched despite increasing regulatory efforts to promote green or clean shipping environmental governance of shipping has been fragmented lack of necessary coordination and harmonization in international arena creates some uncertainties in establishing statutory compliance requirements and standards lister et al 2015 yliskylä peuralahti and gritsenko 2014 in addition shipping is a cross border activity that brings forward the aspects of place bound and multi scalar nature of sustainability governance shipping is regulated by complex multi level governance arrangements present in different regions roe 2013 schwanen 2015 any efforts to make shipping more sustainable need to take into account formal governance institutions and mechanisms and also informal institutions such as political practices social networks and norms that reproduce and maintain present practices in shipping gibbs 2006 although all of these approaches are defined as an obligation of direct sectoral development they should be considered within the scope of the efficient use of energy and the effectiveness of energy management however energy management in sectoral sustainability has a versatile and complex structure ship voyage processes which are the main focus of consumption include optimal techniques for example zaccone et al 2018 developed a dynamic programming method and aimed at efficient fuel consumption in the process yana et al 2018 established an energy efficient model based on environmental factor by using big data for ships this model aims to divide the route along with environmental criteria yasser and ölçer 2020 improved fuel consumption estimation with artificial neural network ann and multi regression approach and stated that this approach is compatible with the changes the world seaborne transport is expected to increase by 4 yearly in the commodity by 2050 indicating that sectoral greenhouse gas potential will increase about 3 times in this framework intensive studies are being conducted on alternatives for possible mitigation of the sector with about 3 4 of total greenhouse gas emissions james and james 2008 stopford 2009 it has been observed that the fuel consumption of fossil fuels especially diesel consumption has a significant effect in this process for this reason imo defined precautionary restrictions in three stages for reduction of environmental threats tadros et al 2019 imo 2016a b in this context energy efficiency and energy saving can be seen the main criteria for the reduction of emissions based on fossil energy consumption for ship management all of these evaluations have shown that to establish a plan or strategy about sustainability savings on energy efficiency for ship management is a necessity developed along these lines this study presents an approach to energy efficiency strategy that will support efficient energy management processes based on the energy efficiency of ships in this study in the defined voyage processes of vessels effective efficiency evaluations emission effects and related economic performance processes are examined this paper intends to achieve three major goals 1 explaining the importance of sustainable indicators of the ships which covers not only energy efficiency but also the economic sustainability that are relevant to the ship routes 2 analysing the effectiveness of ships energy efficiency practices through sustainable indicators 3 helping marine companies to develop and or adopt their energy efficiency policies for ship management 2 maritime shipping and energy management the maritime transportation which became a major player in the global economy after the 1944 bretton woods agreement and strengthened its position today is a complex structure that not only covers interregional transport deep sea shipping but also many activities such as short sea shipping inland transport which includes road rail river and canal transport and passenger transportation stopford 2009 in international trade commodity freight transportation including liquid and dry bulk containerized and specialized shipping has increased by 5 times since the 1970s the freight market has had a remarkable effect on maritime transportation maritime shipping is a useful tool to improve the capabilities of the ports and helps the economy of the cities economic activities directly related to the oceans are gradually increasing in the world maritime activities significantly contribute to the total gross domestic product gdp s of countries and are vital for global development in international processes gdp and fuel sold for international maritime transport are two important criteria according to these two criteria considered over the past 20 years organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries have taken into account a volume that has increased from 20 000 to 40 000 in gdp and capacity that doubled in mton consumption during the same period james and james 2008 in spite of the growth in commercial volume the processes brought by international competition showed that effective cost management is an important process in the sector in this process brought about by international competition studies based on reducing input costs in enterprises necessitate effective energy management first increasing competition in maritime shipping affects direct costs and forces businesses to take additional measures in terms of efficiency shipping costs have risen by about 60 in some instances and fuel costs are a key component of this and need to be specifically assessed the development of strategies based on energy efficiency and efficient use of energy as a management strategy especially in ships will directly affect energy consumption per commodity ton carried insel 2012 currently the percentage of fuel costs for cargo ships in total operating costs is around 70 while they consume about 4 of total fossil fuel of the world boardley 2014 in this respect sustainable energy management processes must be considered together with power management strategies in ship operation power management of vessels is fuel bound management and depends on external factors technical efficiencies and efficiency of operation maintenance processes the energy management system approach that started with iso 50001 has contributed to many sectors in this respect with eedi and seemp imo has led the maritime industry but the most important process is the development of a management strategy that will develop them in ship operation ferreira and thomas 2012 gilbert et al 2010 although the eedi is actually considered as a valid criterion by imo and national maritime enterprises it is not defined as a condition for all vessels the eedi defined by the evaluation of the environmental impact of a ship based on social benefit is an indicator developed mainly for new ships rather than being an indicator for existing ships in other words the machine power which is planned at the design stage of the ship machinery and installed as the system of the ship is shaped as a result of an improved correlation between the speed and load of the ship energy efficiency design index is calculated by the eedi power sfc fc deadweight speed formula the effect of cargo and speed of ships are directly effective parameters on fuel consumption however an energy performance criterion according to these criteria does not provide sufficient infrastructure for a sustainable management model lützen 2017 seemp can be seen as an improved management plan onboard ships it has a structure that will improve the effective management processes of energy like iso 50001 by considering the current operating conditions onboard ships jensen 2018 however if a management strategy is not developed for these structures these plans only develop a process in which the possible conditions are monitored and evaluated for this reason there is a need for the holistic development of energy management for sustainable effect in system performances for example hongtao et al developed a framework for the real time energy efficiency operating index for defining real fuel consumption and related carbon dioxide emission data reported by individual ships chi et al 2012 structural models that will improve the energy efficiency of ships are the most common applications nowadays for example santiago et al investigated the heat recovery process by using organic rankine cycle orc santiago et al 2017 these type of applications can be defined as improvement actions in energy management processes considering energy performance but these steps must be consistent with strategic approaches which are developed in this study 3 energy efficiency strategy for ships there are important opportunities based on efficient energy use which will require the efficient management of energy in ships which are the main elements of maritime transport there is a need for efficient energy management for the energy efficient operation of engine and substructure components for ships with the help of efficient energy management elements to be developed within this scope the creation and use of sectoral demand for efficient technologies will reduce energy related costs in sectoral competition as a matter of fact konstantinos marios and gerasimos 2018 developed a systematic energy management methodology for the ship propulsion engine in this study the developed methodology is based on an improved statistical analysis structure based on the operating conditions of the motor with many input parameters marie et al created a framework for energy efficient operations on ships for decision support elements jensen 2018 the frame is defined by three models the first model refers to the state of the operational modes of the ship the second model is based on conceptual dependence on the processes and the third model is their integrated solution processes another study about optimization procedure to minimize fuel consumption of a four stroke marine turbocharged diesel engine was developed by tadros et al 2019 they developed a numerical optimization model for simulation of a large four stroke marine turbocharged diesel engine and defined some optimal values for some parameters like the speed of the turbocharger start angle of injection and amount of injected fuel tran proposed operational energy efficiency optimization approach with the multi criteria decision making approach he especially evaluated the impact parameters in navigational conditions tran 2020 all of these studies have shown that energy management should be considered primarily in system integrity however all processes with a commercial value on ships are primarily based on decreasing energy consumption and reducing cost effects energy management is a process of managerial organization in direct or indirect energy consumption of all vehicles in service and production in this context the main purpose of an energy management system onboard ships should aim at reducing energy consumption and costs in the first place as defined in fig 1 as with all energy consuming processes many reasons prevent the realization of the defined targets in ships many preventive studies have also been developed for these barriers that energy management faced for example hannes johnson in his case studies investigated the obstacles related to energy efficiency in short sea shipping by an action research method johnson 2019 in another study especially in problems relating to ship shore communication sharing of responsibilities and performance problems are seen as important points lützen 2017 eedi and seemp developed by the imo are used as the management and control procedure for evaluation of ship energy efficiency and management applications but seemp was developed especially from iso 14000 and it is not sufficient enough for development strategies related to energy efficiency when considered ship energy consumption processes for example in iso 50001 requirements are imperative but not in seemp in addition while goal setting in iso 50001 is a basic behavior it is a volunteer action in seemp johnson made a comparative evaluation regarding the differences in both plans in this study as given in table 1 therefore a decision support element is needed for efficient management of energy in the ships management program in this context in order to be able to successfully implement these imo legislations for ships the energy efficiency strategy has been developed with a flow diagram in fig 2 there are five main stages in strategy development related to management processes in these management processes developed for energy management strategic management elements were evaluated a database must be created for each ship in transportation sector in the analysis of the data to be generated the energy efficiency analyzes of the ship for defined route management and the energy and exergy efficiencies of each process should be monitored continuously with a dynamic program in this process management target efficiencies should be developed by defining the baseline in terms of decision processes this should be defined separately for each energy consumption element in these potentials the economic parameters of the management tools and action plans should also be shaped depending on the target and consumption behaviors created in the process for cargo ships it is possible to develop many actions directly or indirectly in all components such as for main engines motors heat exchangers connected systems and operating parameters significant savings are achieved for example by following an action based on air to fuel rate fuel consumption reaches a minimum as air to fuel ratio reaches 14 5 1 for diesel fuel the process which can be done without investing can be the control of air fuel ratio optimization fuel efficiency can be improved by increasing the combustion efficiency depending on the power curve followed in the ship engines load effect and heat rejection rate parameters are also effective on thermal efficiency of the engine man 2009 al shemmeri 2011 these actions should be monitored with business management models and target analyzes should be evaluated the completed process should be turned into a management tool as a decision support element with its results this strategic management process will contribute to the development of a behavioral culture that will sustain energy efficiency onboard ships it will also improve the management of parametric values especially for eedi energy efficiency in ships should also be considered in terms of sustainability in this context economic criteria have been developed to evaluate the environmental impact with the economic dimension these criteria have been developed to enable maritime companies managers to assess the impact of gains that can be achieved through energy efficiency economic criteria can be expressed as a decision support measure for the energy efficiency strategic approach 4 theoretical analysis ship engines are mostly diesel engines and are referred to as thermodynamic heat engines in their operation processes they are operated on a cycle basis as systems with combustion and associated energy transformations however power requirements in operation processes depend on the effect of fuel energy consumed in the cycle for continuous flow conditions the relationship between the fuel delivered into the system and the resulting product is expressed by a mass balance that is directly connected to the flow of the incoming and outgoing material m i n m o u t 1 m i n m o u t the first law of thermodynamics defines the overall energy balance for the work and heat produced and depending on the principle of conservation of energy under such cycle conditions the overall energy balance for this cycle can be written as the following 2 e i n e o u t 3 q w e i n e o u t 0 4 q n e t w n e t m o u t h v 2 2 g z o u t m i n h v 2 2 g z i n in the above mentioned equations the total input and output flow of energy are indicated by e and in equation 4 the net heat flow in the cycle is indicated by q n e t and the net work amount is indicated by w n e t whereas h v 2 2 g z defines enthalpy kinetic and potential effect respectively all cycles produce work or heat within the surrounding temperature cengel and boles 2018 therefore the conditions under which they exist affect system efficiency this process stated by the concept of exergy defines the maximum work that can be done for the dead state conditions according to the second law of thermodynamics general exergy rate for each point of flow can be expressed as szargut 1986 5 e x e p h e p c h e k i n e p o t here in this equation e p h is physical exergy e x c h is chemical exergy e x k i n is kinetic exergy and e x p o t is potential exergy the overall exergy balance in the cycle for continuous flow conditions may be expressed as 6 e x i n e x o u t e x defines the total exergy flows input and output for the system bounduries if the potential kinetic and chemical exergy are neglected the exergy flow is directly related to the physical exergy flow and the equation of e x i n e x o u t can be written as 7 ϕ h i h 0 t 0 s i s 0 here ϕ is the flow of exergy s is entropy index 0 refers to the environment in the dead state p 0 and t 0 conditions dincer and rosen 2012 the exergy balance of combustion processes during the flow process is defined directly by chemical exergy this connection is related to partial pressure conditions chemical exergy in these conditions is defined as below 8 e c h m r t 0 ln p 0 p 00 where r represents the gas constant p 0 and p 00 respectively define the medium and partial pressures of the system however in general system approaches the exergy of the fuel is directly based on the exergy factor of the fuel chemical exergy in these conditions is 9 ψ c f f 0 ω n c v 0 in this equation ω is the factor of standard specific chemical exergy of fuel and ncv is the net calorific value of the fuel kaushik and omendra 2013 as a thermal process the overall efficiency of the cycle can be calculated depending on both the first and second laws of thermodynamics in these conditions the basic equality is evaluated according to the energy or exergy flows between the output and the input moran et al 2011 accordingly the general equations of the efficiency are as follows 10 η i w n e t e i n 1 e o u t e i n 11 η i i e x o u t e x i n 1 e x d e s t e x i n where e is the energy flow for input and output η is efficiency by indis ı energy and indis ıı exergy besides indis dest is exergy destruction irreversibility in all thermal processes causes significant losses in this respect a general reference approach has been developed for design or system improvements the potential for improvement in a system especially with exergy analyses is considered a reference for reducing entropy production in the system van gool 1997 improvement potential ip can be expressed as 12 i p 1 η e x e x i n e x o u t where η ex is exergy efficiency of the system and ex is the total exergy for input and output of the system the gain of losses due to irreversibility in systems is defined by ip and this is the reference potential in these design or improvement processes 5 sustainable environmental and economic criteria sustainable energy management in shipping companies will reduce fuel costs as well as operating costs in this way the economic evaluation criteria which can be applied for each ship can be developed by individual companies economic evaluation criteria have been developed along with the navigational planning of the ship supported by power consumption and management thermodynamics and life cycle analyzes in this study the energy efficiency index eei and the environmental cost index eci are developed based on the thermodynamic analyzes the flow diagram of this process is given in fig 3 as seen on the figure shortly economic evaluation criteria are developed based on the thermo economic process and life cycle cost analysis in this context evaluations of ship operation are defined by four steps after from the thermo economics and life cycle analysis economic performance criteria eci and eei are developed depending on these steps the eci should be seen as an impact of the direct loss fuel cost accordingly the eci is calculated as 13 e c i i l h w c f u e l c f u e l where i is exergy destruction lhw is defined as low heat value of fuel c is the cost of fuel eci is a loss cost effect in terms of direct loss analysis this value can be seen as an activity criterion based directly on the operating parameters another economic performance criterion eei is the criterion in which we define the relationship between exergy efficiency and energy efficiency operational index eeoi 14 e e i e e o i η i i where δeeoi is change rate between eeoi and average eeoi and η ii is the average exergy efficiency of the voyage the eei should be seen as a benchmark criterion it is a proportional comparison of ship s exergy on fuel with eeoi change in these analyzes the expectation is that the rate of change in the exchange rate is close to zero 6 results and discussions this study is primarily based on the energy efficiency strategy based on the holistic evaluation process of the ship in this context considering the number of voyages of the ship all the elements based on efficiency were examined in fact in order to implement this strategy on ships process related energy studies should be developed this is the first step to define the efficiency potential then the process efficiency should be examined by energy and exergy analyzes however general performance evaluation can be carried out for decision making processes on such ships without going through process analyses with the statistical thermodynamic approach the performance of the vessel can be calculated depending on the fuel consumption and power relationship in this analysing process it was considered firstly the performance evaluation of the energy efficiency strategy with reference to the voyage conditions of a cargo ship depending on available data later the environmental and economic criteria developed due to the performance of the ship were examined together with the energy efficiency strategy the information about ship s regular voyages was collected and data processed the examined cargo ship had a capacity of 8100 kw diesel power the ship proceeding with an average occupancy rate of 83 17 and the total average of 17 651 tonnes was consuming an average of 305 tons of fuel oil and diesel oil including harbour period in this study depending on the strategy developed the cruise parameters of the ship were taken into account 20 of the total 221 journeys are given as an example in table 2 for each time during the voyage period between one port to the other and vice versa it was examined the distribution of fuel consumption change by an average for 221 voyages and distributions is given in fig 4 significant changes were observed for the two criteria that were referenced in the fuel consumption of the ship while a change rate of 40 was observed in time dependent consumption a difference of 29 55 was found in the changes due to travel distance however when the commodity distributions half load or full load were evaluated it was found that this change has a value of 103 58 per unit ton in these fluctuations it can be said that the performances also changed in this respect the engine load performances of the ship were evaluated for a full load the performance analyzes were examined with energy and exergy analyzes based on thermodynamic laws in this context energy efficiency analyzes were performed using equations 1 4 and 10 as well as energy efficiency distributions for 100 power generation of the ship are given in fig 5 considering the consumption distributions the average energy efficiency of the ship was found to be 38 33 considering that the ship has a total of 221 voyages a distribution difference of approximately 47 84 is observed in efficiency performance this ratio is quite remarkable considering the unit load effect also considering the fact that the vessel does not operate continuously with a full load the loss rate is an important potential but the results can be obtained for each voyage the analyzes were based on the thermal efficiency depending on the reference temperature the energy efficiency strategy developed will yield the main outcome parameters for continuous improvement this provides us with the opportunity to compare and evaluate for each voyage of the ship the voyage parameters of the ship were also examined in terms of exergy performance by taking into account the dead state conditions in this framework the exergy efficiencies of the ship voyages were calculated based on equation 11 and the results distribution is given in fig 6 the average exergy yield for the entire process was found to be 35 82 in this context while the upper limit conditions in exergy efficiency were 45 70 the change in performance was found to be 14 79 all of these values were evaluated for the voyage parameters depending on the fuel consumption the sankey diagram for energy performance of the process and the grassmann diagram for exergy performance are given below there are two types of efficiency ratios defined in the ship engine namely the sankey and grassmann diagrams given in fig 7 the first is the efficiency obtained by power analysis and is expressed by an efficiency rate of 90 the second is the efficiency analysis based on the thermal performance expressed as the ratio of the power obtained to the heat energy of the fuel burned this is unfortunately not high in the manual of the man engine the thermal theoretical efficiency is expressed as 50 in this case study irreversibility was evaluated according to statistical thermodynamic analyzes results considering exergy consept the potential for loss which is due to the irreversibility of the ship due to the energy management strategy was evaluated in the improvement potential improvement potential is a measure of the ship s exergy efficiency in this context this evaluation was made for each condition and exergy efficiency and related improvement potential distributions are given in fig 8 considering the exergy efficiency the improvement potential of the ship in relation to the whole process was found to be 38 5 in fuel based consumption only this ratio refers to an important rate considered the emission and cost savings of the ship in terms of fossil fuel consumption this potential shows that important actions on the ship operations must be applied with the energy efficiency strategic model developed especially for the operational indicators evaluation criteria for energy efficiency in ships have sectoral criteria in terms of standards the two main criteria eedi and eeoi are the most common parameters adopted in the sector although eedi is considered to be the design criterion of ships the eeoi can be seen as a performance criterion based on direct voyage conditions the mean eeoi related changes of the ship were investigated for the referral process of voyages the distributions are calculated in fig 9 the mean eeoi value of the ship was found to be 39 19 g t mile according to this value when the peak changes were taken as a reference a cumulative total of over 80 was observed in this context the ship s performance curve shows a very widespread distribution this distribution has been evaluated as an important criterion for operational optimization in transportation conditions with multidimensional criteria in terms of international maritime enterprises however it is important to evaluate this in terms of economic performance criteria even though the fuel is followed by direct economic input by maritime companies consideration of the issue in terms of the above performances is seen as a manageable measure in terms of energy efficiency in this study the eci and eei defined as the economic criteria of the enterprise are presented as important players of the developed strategy when the system is considered for reversibility potential the eci distribution of the ship is given in fig 10 the analysis shows the compatibility between eci and exergy efficiency it is seen that the environmental cost is increased in low efficiency and this effect decreases in high efficiency when analyzed the voyages of the ship it was seen that the average eci distribution was 0 41 however when reversibility was taken into consideration it was expected that this value depends on the consumption in the navigational process was average of 0 23 when looking at the system s loss potential the average cost loss associated with emissions was found to be 19 05 in this context eci is a parameter to be taken into consideration directly in the evaluation of the ship s efficiency the second criterion eei refers to the relationship between eeoi and direct fuel consumption in this context comparative analyzes of the ship for the 221 voyages were discussed and the distributions are given in fig 11 in the analysis it was observed that the values were quite compatible due to exergy efficiency except for peak values specifically the zero line can be taken as a reference value in both directions changes should be seen as a deviation from performance in fuel consumption and operating costs based on all these analyzes the performance criteria of the ship were collected together and the evaluation criteria for the parameters are given in table 3 7 conclusions in this study the performance analyzes and environmental impact analyzes were developed through economic criteria with reference to the navigation process of the cargo ship in this context firstly an efficiency strategy which is to be referenced onboard the ships is presented thermodynamic and the economic criteria have been established for sustainability criteria based on this approach at the same time the criteria for strategic evaluation processes have been determined in addition to the thermodynamic criteria two new criteria have been defined in order to evaluate the economic effects of energy performance such as eci and eei the following results were obtained from this study a the thermodynamic analysis of the ship was done firstly and energy and exergy productivity were found to be 38 33 and 35 82 respectively b the improvement potential for this ship was calculated to be 41 46 in the study eci should be seen as the environmental impact of direct losses in this context when the average of the 221 voyages of this ship was taken into account the eci was 41 19 according to the ideal efficiency conditions of this ship the average loss rate in eci was 19 05 which means that there was considerable fuel loss c eeoi is a criterion that is taken into account in marine enterprises in this respect considering the average eeoi ship consumption had a change range of 80 in this context the operational losses were significant d eei directly demonstrates the impact of losses defined by eeoi in this respect it has been observed that it has a linear effect as regards the exergy efficiency it can be clearly seen from the above analyzes that fuel consumption can be reduced significantly by making performance improvements over the energy efficiency strategy for the shipping company it has been assessed that the economic criteria defined in this study will supply important parameters for the decision making processes based on energy management for vessels and therefore this in turn will provide a significant reduction in costs for

et al 2019 imo 2016a b in this context energy efficiency and energy saving can be seen the main criteria for the reduction of emissions based on fossil energy consumption for ship management all of these evaluations have shown that to establish a plan or strategy about sustainability savings on energy efficiency for ship management is a necessity developed along these lines this study presents an approach to energy efficiency strategy that will support efficient energy management processes based on the energy efficiency of ships in this study in the defined voyage processes of vessels effective efficiency evaluations emission effects and related economic performance processes are examined this paper intends to achieve three major goals 1 explaining the importance of sustainable indicators of the ships which covers not only energy efficiency but also the economic sustainability that are relevant to the ship routes 2 analysing the effectiveness of ships energy efficiency practices through sustainable indicators 3 helping marine companies to develop and or adopt their energy efficiency policies for ship management 2 maritime shipping and energy management the maritime transportation which became a major player in the global economy after the 1944 bretton woods agreement and strengthened its position today is a complex structure that not only covers interregional transport deep sea shipping but also many activities such as short sea shipping inland transport which includes road rail river and canal transport and passenger transportation stopford 2009 in international trade commodity freight transportation including liquid and dry bulk containerized and specialized shipping has increased by 5 times since the 1970s the freight market has had a remarkable effect on maritime transportation maritime shipping is a useful tool to improve the capabilities of the ports and helps the economy of the cities economic activities directly related to the oceans are gradually increasing in the world maritime activities significantly contribute to the total gross domestic product gdp s of countries and are vital for global development in international processes gdp and fuel sold for international maritime transport are two important criteria according to these two criteria considered over the past 20 years organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries have taken into account a volume that has increased from 20 000 to 40 000 in gdp and capacity that doubled in mton consumption during the same period james and james 2008 in spite of the growth in commercial volume the processes brought by international competition showed that effective cost management is an important process in the sector in this process brought about by international competition studies based on reducing input costs in enterprises necessitate effective energy management first increasing competition in maritime shipping affects direct costs and forces businesses to take additional measures in terms of efficiency shipping costs have risen by about 60 in some instances and fuel costs are a key component of this and need to be specifically assessed the development of strategies based on energy efficiency and efficient use of energy as a management strategy especially in ships will directly affect energy consumption per commodity ton carried insel 2012 currently the percentage of fuel costs for cargo ships in total operating costs is around 70 while they consume about 4 of total fossil fuel of the world boardley 2014 in this respect sustainable energy management processes must be considered together with power management strategies in ship operation power management of vessels is fuel bound management and depends on external factors technical efficiencies and efficiency of operation maintenance processes the energy management system approach that started with iso 50001 has contributed to many sectors in this respect with eedi and seemp imo has led the maritime industry but the most important process is the development of a management strategy that will develop them in ship operation ferreira and thomas 2012 gilbert et al 2010 although the eedi is actually considered as a valid criterion by imo and national maritime enterprises it is not defined as a condition for all vessels the eedi defined by the evaluation of the environmental impact of a ship based on social benefit is an indicator developed mainly for new ships rather than being an indicator for existing ships in other words the machine power which is planned at the design stage of the ship machinery and installed as the system of the ship is shaped as a result of an improved correlation between the speed and load of the ship energy efficiency design index is calculated by the eedi power sfc fc deadweight speed formula the effect of cargo and speed of ships are directly effective parameters on fuel consumption however an energy performance criterion according to these criteria does not provide sufficient infrastructure for a sustainable management model lützen 2017 seemp can be seen as an improved management plan onboard ships it has a structure that will improve the effective management processes of energy like iso 50001 by considering the current operating conditions onboard ships jensen 2018 however if a management strategy is not developed for these structures these plans only develop a process in which the possible conditions are monitored and evaluated for this reason there is a need for the holistic development of energy management for sustainable effect in system performances for example hongtao et al developed a framework for the real time energy efficiency operating index for defining real fuel consumption and related carbon dioxide emission data reported by individual ships chi et al 2012 structural models that will improve the energy efficiency of ships are the most common applications nowadays for example santiago et al investigated the heat recovery process by using organic rankine cycle orc santiago et al 2017 these type of applications can be defined as improvement actions in energy management processes considering energy performance but these steps must be consistent with strategic approaches which are developed in this study 3 energy efficiency strategy for ships there are important opportunities based on efficient energy use which will require the efficient management of energy in ships which are the main elements of maritime transport there is a need for efficient energy management for the energy efficient operation of engine and substructure components for ships with the help of efficient energy management elements to be developed within this scope the creation and use of sectoral demand for efficient technologies will reduce energy related costs in sectoral competition as a matter of fact konstantinos marios and gerasimos 2018 developed a systematic energy management methodology for the ship propulsion engine in this study the developed methodology is based on an improved statistical analysis structure based on the operating conditions of the motor with many input parameters marie et al created a framework for energy efficient operations on ships for decision support elements jensen 2018 the frame is defined by three models the first model refers to the state of the operational modes of the ship the second model is based on conceptual dependence on the processes and the third model is their integrated solution processes another study about optimization procedure to minimize fuel consumption of a four stroke marine turbocharged diesel engine was developed by tadros et al 2019 they developed a numerical optimization model for simulation of a large four stroke marine turbocharged diesel engine and defined some optimal values for some parameters like the speed of the turbocharger start angle of injection and amount of injected fuel tran proposed operational energy efficiency optimization approach with the multi criteria decision making approach he especially evaluated the impact parameters in navigational conditions tran 2020 all of these studies have shown that energy management should be considered primarily in system integrity however all processes with a commercial value on ships are primarily based on decreasing energy consumption and reducing cost effects energy management is a process of managerial organization in direct or indirect energy consumption of all vehicles in service and production in this context the main purpose of an energy management system onboard ships should aim at reducing energy consumption and costs in the first place as defined in fig 1 as with all energy consuming processes many reasons prevent the realization of the defined targets in ships many preventive studies have also been developed for these barriers that energy management faced for example hannes johnson in his case studies investigated the obstacles related to energy efficiency in short sea shipping by an action research method johnson 2019 in another study especially in problems relating to ship shore communication sharing of responsibilities and performance problems are seen as important points lützen 2017 eedi and seemp developed by the imo are used as the management and control procedure for evaluation of ship energy efficiency and management applications but seemp was developed especially from iso 14000 and it is not sufficient enough for development strategies related to energy efficiency when considered ship energy consumption processes for example in iso 50001 requirements are imperative but not in seemp in addition while goal setting in iso 50001 is a basic behavior it is a volunteer action in seemp johnson made a comparative evaluation regarding the differences in both plans in this study as given in table 1 therefore a decision support element is needed for efficient management of energy in the ships management program in this context in order to be able to successfully implement these imo legislations for ships the energy efficiency strategy has been developed with a flow diagram in fig 2 there are five main stages in strategy development related to management processes in these management processes developed for energy management strategic management elements were evaluated a database must be created for each ship in transportation sector in the analysis of the data to be generated the energy efficiency analyzes of the ship for defined route management and the energy and exergy efficiencies of each process should be monitored continuously with a dynamic program in this process management target efficiencies should be developed by defining the baseline in terms of decision processes this should be defined separately for each energy consumption element in these potentials the economic parameters of the management tools and action plans should also be shaped depending on the target and consumption behaviors created in the process for cargo ships it is possible to develop many actions directly or indirectly in all components such as for main engines motors heat exchangers connected systems and operating parameters significant savings are achieved for example by following an action based on air to fuel rate fuel consumption reaches a minimum as air to fuel ratio reaches 14 5 1 for diesel fuel the process which can be done without investing can be the control of air fuel ratio optimization fuel efficiency can be improved by increasing the combustion efficiency depending on the power curve followed in the ship engines load effect and heat rejection rate parameters are also effective on thermal efficiency of the engine man 2009 al shemmeri 2011 these actions should be monitored with business management models and target analyzes should be evaluated the completed process should be turned into a management tool as a decision support element with its results this strategic management process will contribute to the development of a behavioral culture that will sustain energy efficiency onboard ships it will also improve the management of parametric values especially for eedi energy efficiency in ships should also be considered in terms of sustainability in this context economic criteria have been developed to evaluate the environmental impact with the economic dimension these criteria have been developed to enable maritime companies managers to assess the impact of gains that can be achieved through energy efficiency economic criteria can be expressed as a decision support measure for the energy efficiency strategic approach 4 theoretical analysis ship engines are mostly diesel engines and are referred to as thermodynamic heat engines in their operation processes they are operated on a cycle basis as systems with combustion and associated energy transformations however power requirements in operation processes depend on the effect of fuel energy consumed in the cycle for continuous flow conditions the relationship between the fuel delivered into the system and the resulting product is expressed by a mass balance that is directly connected to the flow of the incoming and outgoing material m i n m o u t 1 m i n m o u t the first law of thermodynamics defines the overall energy balance for the work and heat produced and depending on the principle of conservation of energy under such cycle conditions the overall energy balance for this cycle can be written as the following 2 e i n e o u t 3 q w e i n e o u t 0 4 q n e t w n e t m o u t h v 2 2 g z o u t m i n h v 2 2 g z i n in the above mentioned equations the total input and output flow of energy are indicated by e and in equation 4 the net heat flow in the cycle is indicated by q n e t and the net work amount is indicated by w n e t whereas h v 2 2 g z defines enthalpy kinetic and potential effect respectively all cycles produce work or heat within the surrounding temperature cengel and boles 2018 therefore the conditions under which they exist affect system efficiency this process stated by the concept of exergy defines the maximum work that can be done for the dead state conditions according to the second law of thermodynamics general exergy rate for each point of flow can be expressed as szargut 1986 5 e x e p h e p c h e k i n e p o t here in this equation e p h is physical exergy e x c h is chemical exergy e x k i n is kinetic exergy and e x p o t is potential exergy the overall exergy balance in the cycle for continuous flow conditions may be expressed as 6 e x i n e x o u t e x defines the total exergy flows input and output for the system bounduries if the potential kinetic and chemical exergy are neglected the exergy flow is directly related to the physical exergy flow and the equation of e x i n e x o u t can be written as 7 ϕ h i h 0 t 0 s i s 0 here ϕ is the flow of exergy s is entropy index 0 refers to the environment in the dead state p 0 and t 0 conditions dincer and rosen 2012 the exergy balance of combustion processes during the flow process is defined directly by chemical exergy this connection is related to partial pressure conditions chemical exergy in these conditions is defined as below 8 e c h m r t 0 ln p 0 p 00 where r represents the gas constant p 0 and p 00 respectively define the medium and partial pressures of the system however in general system approaches the exergy of the fuel is directly based on the exergy factor of the fuel chemical exergy in these conditions is 9 ψ c f f 0 ω n c v 0 in this equation ω is the factor of standard specific chemical exergy of fuel and ncv is the net calorific value of the fuel kaushik and omendra 2013 as a thermal process the overall efficiency of the cycle can be calculated depending on both the first and second laws of thermodynamics in these conditions the basic equality is evaluated according to the energy or exergy flows between the output and the input moran et al 2011 accordingly the general equations of the efficiency are as follows 10 η i w n e t e i n 1 e o u t e i n 11 η i i e x o u t e x i n 1 e x d e s t e x i n where e is the energy flow for input and output η is efficiency by indis ı energy and indis ıı exergy besides indis dest is exergy destruction irreversibility in all thermal processes causes significant losses in this respect a general reference approach has been developed for design or system improvements the potential for improvement in a system especially with exergy analyses is considered a reference for reducing entropy production in the system van gool 1997 improvement potential ip can be expressed as 12 i p 1 η e x e x i n e x o u t where η ex is exergy efficiency of the system and ex is the total exergy for input and output of the system the gain of losses due to irreversibility in systems is defined by ip and this is the reference potential in these design or improvement processes 5 sustainable environmental and economic criteria sustainable energy management in shipping companies will reduce fuel costs as well as operating costs in this way the economic evaluation criteria which can be applied for each ship can be developed by individual companies economic evaluation criteria have been developed along with the navigational planning of the ship supported by power consumption and management thermodynamics and life cycle analyzes in this study the energy efficiency index eei and the environmental cost index eci are developed based on the thermodynamic analyzes the flow diagram of this process is given in fig 3 as seen on the figure shortly economic evaluation criteria are developed based on the thermo economic process and life cycle cost analysis in this context evaluations of ship operation are defined by four steps after from the thermo economics and life cycle analysis economic performance criteria eci and eei are developed depending on these steps the eci should be seen as an impact of the direct loss fuel cost accordingly the eci is calculated as 13 e c i i l h w c f u e l c f u e l where i is exergy destruction lhw is defined as low heat value of fuel c is the cost of fuel eci is a loss cost effect in terms of direct loss analysis this value can be seen as an activity criterion based directly on the operating parameters another economic performance criterion eei is the criterion in which we define the relationship between exergy efficiency and energy efficiency operational index eeoi 14 e e i e e o i η i i where δeeoi is change rate between eeoi and average eeoi and η ii is the average exergy efficiency of the voyage the eei should be seen as a benchmark criterion it is a proportional comparison of ship s exergy on fuel with eeoi change in these analyzes the expectation is that the rate of change in the exchange rate is close to zero 6 results and discussions this study is primarily based on the energy efficiency strategy based on the holistic evaluation process of the ship in this context considering the number of voyages of the ship all the elements based on efficiency were examined in fact in order to implement this strategy on ships process related energy studies should be developed this is the first step to define the efficiency potential then the process efficiency should be examined by energy and exergy analyzes however general performance evaluation can be carried out for decision making processes on such ships without going through process analyses with the statistical thermodynamic approach the performance of the vessel can be calculated depending on the fuel consumption and power relationship in this analysing process it was considered firstly the performance evaluation of the energy efficiency strategy with reference to the voyage conditions of a cargo ship depending on available data later the environmental and economic criteria developed due to the performance of the ship were examined together with the energy efficiency strategy the information about ship s regular voyages was collected and data processed the examined cargo ship had a capacity of 8100 kw diesel power the ship proceeding with an average occupancy rate of 83 17 and the total average of 17 651 tonnes was consuming an average of 305 tons of fuel oil and diesel oil including harbour period in this study depending on the strategy developed the cruise parameters of the ship were taken into account 20 of the total 221 journeys are given as an example in table 2 for each time during the voyage period between one port to the other and vice versa it was examined the distribution of fuel consumption change by an average for 221 voyages and distributions is given in fig 4 significant changes were observed for the two criteria that were referenced in the fuel consumption of the ship while a change rate of 40 was observed in time dependent consumption a difference of 29 55 was found in the changes due to travel distance however when the commodity distributions half load or full load were evaluated it was found that this change has a value of 103 58 per unit ton in these fluctuations it can be said that the performances also changed in this respect the engine load performances of the ship were evaluated for a full load the performance analyzes were examined with energy and exergy analyzes based on thermodynamic laws in this context energy efficiency analyzes were performed using equations 1 4 and 10 as well as energy efficiency distributions for 100 power generation of the ship are given in fig 5 considering the consumption distributions the average energy efficiency of the ship was found to be 38 33 considering that the ship has a total of 221 voyages a distribution difference of approximately 47 84 is observed in efficiency performance this ratio is quite remarkable considering the unit load effect also considering the fact that the vessel does not operate continuously with a full load the loss rate is an important potential but the results can be obtained for each voyage the analyzes were based on the thermal efficiency depending on the reference temperature the energy efficiency strategy developed will yield the main outcome parameters for continuous improvement this provides us with the opportunity to compare and evaluate for each voyage of the ship the voyage parameters of the ship were also examined in terms of exergy performance by taking into account the dead state conditions in this framework the exergy efficiencies of the ship voyages were calculated based on equation 11 and the results distribution is given in fig 6 the average exergy yield for the entire process was found to be 35 82 in this context while the upper limit conditions in exergy efficiency were 45 70 the change in performance was found to be 14 79 all of these values were evaluated for the voyage parameters depending on the fuel consumption the sankey diagram for energy performance of the process and the grassmann diagram for exergy performance are given below there are two types of efficiency ratios defined in the ship engine namely the sankey and grassmann diagrams given in fig 7 the first is the efficiency obtained by power analysis and is expressed by an efficiency rate of 90 the second is the efficiency analysis based on the thermal performance expressed as the ratio of the power obtained to the heat energy of the fuel burned this is unfortunately not high in the manual of the man engine the thermal theoretical efficiency is expressed as 50 in this case study irreversibility was evaluated according to statistical thermodynamic analyzes results considering exergy consept the potential for loss which is due to the irreversibility of the ship due to the energy management strategy was evaluated in the improvement potential improvement potential is a measure of the ship s exergy efficiency in this context this evaluation was made for each condition and exergy efficiency and related improvement potential distributions are given in fig 8 considering the exergy efficiency the improvement potential of the ship in relation to the whole process was found to be 38 5 in fuel based consumption only this ratio refers to an important rate considered the emission and cost savings of the ship in terms of fossil fuel consumption this potential shows that important actions on the ship operations must be applied with the energy efficiency strategic model developed especially for the operational indicators evaluation criteria for energy efficiency in ships have sectoral criteria in terms of standards the two main criteria eedi and eeoi are the most common parameters adopted in the sector although eedi is considered to be the design criterion of ships the eeoi can be seen as a performance criterion based on direct voyage conditions the mean eeoi related changes of the ship were investigated for the referral process of voyages the distributions are calculated in fig 9 the mean eeoi value of the ship was found to be 39 19 g t mile according to this value when the peak changes were taken as a reference a cumulative total of over 80 was observed in this context the ship s performance curve shows a very widespread distribution this distribution has been evaluated as an important criterion for operational optimization in transportation conditions with multidimensional criteria in terms of international maritime enterprises however it is important to evaluate this in terms of economic performance criteria even though the fuel is followed by direct economic input by maritime companies consideration of the issue in terms of the above performances is seen as a manageable measure in terms of energy efficiency in this study the eci and eei defined as the economic criteria of the enterprise are presented as important players of the developed strategy when the system is considered for reversibility potential the eci distribution of the ship is given in fig 10 the analysis shows the compatibility between eci and exergy efficiency it is seen that the environmental cost is increased in low efficiency and this effect decreases in high efficiency when analyzed the voyages of the ship it was seen that the average eci distribution was 0 41 however when reversibility was taken into consideration it was expected that this value depends on the consumption in the navigational process was average of 0 23 when looking at the system s loss potential the average cost loss associated with emissions was found to be 19 05 in this context eci is a parameter to be taken into consideration directly in the evaluation of the ship s efficiency the second criterion eei refers to the relationship between eeoi and direct fuel consumption in this context comparative analyzes of the ship for the 221 voyages were discussed and the distributions are given in fig 11 in the analysis it was observed that the values were quite compatible due to exergy efficiency except for peak values specifically the zero line can be taken as a reference value in both directions changes should be seen as a deviation from performance in fuel consumption and operating costs based on all these analyzes the performance criteria of the ship were collected together and the evaluation criteria for the parameters are given in table 3 7 conclusions in this study the performance analyzes and environmental impact analyzes were developed through economic criteria with reference to the navigation process of the cargo ship in this context firstly an efficiency strategy which is to be referenced onboard the ships is presented thermodynamic and the economic criteria have been established for sustainability criteria based on this approach at the same time the criteria for strategic evaluation processes have been determined in addition to the thermodynamic criteria two new criteria have been defined in order to evaluate the economic effects of energy performance such as eci and eei the following results were obtained from this study a the thermodynamic analysis of the ship was done firstly and energy and exergy productivity were found to be 38 33 and 35 82 respectively b the improvement potential for this ship was calculated to be 41 46 in the study eci should be seen as the environmental impact of direct losses in this context when the average of the 221 voyages of this ship was taken into account the eci was 41 19 according to the ideal efficiency conditions of this ship the average loss rate in eci was 19 05 which means that there was considerable fuel loss c eeoi is a criterion that is taken into account in marine enterprises in this respect considering the average eeoi ship consumption had a change range of 80 in this context the operational losses were significant d eei directly demonstrates the impact of losses defined by eeoi in this respect it has been observed that it has a linear effect as regards the exergy efficiency it can be clearly seen from the above analyzes that fuel consumption can be reduced significantly by making performance improvements over the energy efficiency strategy for the shipping company it has been assessed that the economic criteria defined in this study will supply important parameters for the decision making processes based on energy management for vessels and therefore this in turn will provide a significant reduction in costs for

21216,a numerical model is developed based on the dual boundary element method dbem to solve the problem of surface gravity waves past multiple floating inverted trapezoidal porous boxes under the framework of linear potential flow theory the continuity of velocity and semi empirical quadratic pressure drop equation is adopted on the porous boundary to incorporate the effect of incident wave amplitude on the energy loss coefficient various results by an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes are discussed in the form of scattering coefficients wave reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients and force coefficients horizontal force vertical force and moment the verification of the numerical model is carried out by an independently developed multi domain boundary element method mbem code and also with results available in the literature the study reveals that in most cases the long waves exhibit insignificant hindrance whereas intermediate waves delineate the harmonic oscillations and deep water waves feel maximal hindrance by inverted trapezoidal porous boxes the wave damping of k l 0 95 is obtained for structural width b λ 0 66 by a pair of identical inverted trapezoidal porous boxes the angle of porous wings is helpful to alter the scattering coefficients and also helps in the fine tuning of force coefficients the angle of partially open wings within 30 0 θ 60 0 is suggested along with structural porosity μ 0 25 for effective constriction of incident waves the parametric analysis will be useful in the meticulous design of cost effective breakwaters

integral equation 1 introduction for the decades the wave scattering analysis of breakwaters in several structural configurations has been identified as an interesting subject with regards to the assurance of water based infrastructure from the destructive incident wave energy in general to diminish the wave impact on the leeward locations the submerged and emerged floating bottom seated porous breakwaters are introduced the objective of a permeable structure is to accomplish the maximal wave damping and to obstruct the incoming waves by changing the phase angle in general the porous breakwaters are classified into thick and thin structures the rubble mound barriers are considered as thick structures and it requires the massive capital expense and mountain rocks key design parameters of a rubble mound breakwater are the in situ soil condition water depth and level of protection required in the port and harbour in addition to the meticulous design gulf countries like kuwait lack the required amount of raw materials mainly rocks in building such massive structures neelamani et al 2017 this drifts the researchers to keenly look for alternative breakwaters which are cost effective and gives a superior hydrodynamic performance thin porous barriers offer swift transport and installation reusable cost effective and eco friendly initially the thin structures in the form of horizontal and vertical porous screens are preferred for the temporary protection of coastal structures thereafter an array of thin porous walls consisting of three confined chambers porto torres industrial harbour italy and five confined chambers dalian chemical production terminal china wall breakwaters are developed for the full protection of ports and harbours from the destructive incident waves similarly the floating breakwaters are likewise constructed for creating a tranquil zone in british columbia canada isaacson and byres 1988 a total number of 30 floating breakwaters were accessible and characterized into three classifications such as i concrete caisson barriers ii log bundles and iii pontoons with the vertical plates however in most of the situations the horizontal and vertical plate type structures fail in the distribution of incident wave energy due to uncertain wave loadings the vertical structures depict higher horizontal force and horizontal structures illustrate higher vertical wave loadings and it is identified as one of the prime reasons for frequent failures of horizontal and vertical plate breakwaters to improve the performance porous boxes the combination of vertical and horizontal porous screens are proposed as an effective wave damping structure to secure the offshore amenities moreover the surface piercing porous boxes promote marine aquaculture the wave trapping and wave damping attributes of a single porous box liu et al 2015 singla et al 2019 and a pair of identical porous boxes vijay and sahoo 2019 comprising of vertical edges are already reported using analytical and numerical methods however the performance characteristics of porous boxes can be improved with the new design techniques in the present study an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes comprising of a submerged horizontal plate with seaward and leeward slanting porous wings are proposed as viable wave hindrances for damping of trapped fluid mass in the confined chambers accessible between the slanting wings from a practical perspective the damping of incident wave energy is one of the solutions for providing the tranquil wave zone in the nearshore regions thus the artificial resistance is included in the unadulterated dynamic fluid to dampen the incident waves hence in the present study the porous boxes consisting of slanting wings are proposed and analyzed in the case of an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes the surface gravity wave scattering is a result of the accompanying four possible potential mechanisms i wave motion underneath the porous box and oscillatory fluid flow above the porous box ii wave breaking by porous box and wave induced oscillations around the slating wings iii wave decomposition due to flow past porous boxes and iv wave induced oscillations in the free chambers available between the slanting wings in the present study an itemized note on the wave dispersing execution of an inverted trapezoidal porous box is reported based on continuity of pressure and velocity with the use of dual boundary element method dbem to understand the real field applicability a detailed investigation of the literature is carried out the analysis of wave action on an inclined plate breakwater is a subject of great interest and the angle of plate inclination has gotten more consideration for the successful plan and establishment of the structure in the case of the inclined plate either seaward plate inclination or leeward plate inclination is suggested by several workers murakami et al 1994 reported that the fluid particle velocity is higher for negative leeward inclination as compared with the positive seaward inclination rao et al 2009 recommended the seaward positive inclination based on the visual observations in the physical modelling of the rigid inclined plate which suggest that the seaward inclination enhances the accumulation of sediment particles over the bottom bed and fine sand particles are seen to be moving far away from the inclined plate in the case of leeward inclination most of the studies reported that the angle of inclination θ within 0 0 θ 40 0 is suitable for reducing the wave impact on shoreward regions sobhani et al 1988 cho and kim 2008 cho et al 2013 thereafter the increase in the angle of inclination θ 40 0 causes severe wave loading on the inclined plate nallayarasu et al 1994 the inclined flexible membrane is set a long way from the seabed kharaghani and lee 1986 which is helpful for the potential application of inclined plates in the deep water wave attenuation for the protection offshore oil fields very recently gayen and mondal 2016 examined the wave scattering attributes of a pair of inclined porous plates using the expansion collocation method the study reported the scattering coefficients and force coefficients by a pair of inclined plates the inclined plates are liberated from the water depth and hydrodynamic coefficients are fine tuned on changing the plate porosity jarlan 1961 proposed a new breakwater which consists of seaside thin permeable wall and leeside impermeable wall and this is termed as jarlan breakwater from that point several workers implemented numerous techniques for the development of thin wave screens to protect the marinas kriebel 2005 reported a set of guidelines for the design and development of timber wave screen breakwater which are used in the u s coast guard first district new england huang et al 2011 and dai et al 2018 presented a detailed review of thin porous screens and its noteworthiness in effective damping of incident waves the concept of jarlan breakwater was additionally stretched out by several authors but liu et al 2015 examined semi immersed jarlan breakwater on adding the additional horizontal submerged plate at the keel of the vertical screens this can be viewed as a floating porous box having a leeward rigid screen the analytical results are compared with the laboratory measurements and the study recommended that the horizontal plate along with the vertical screens are appropriate to accomplish maximal wave damping thereafter singla et al 2019 examined the same configuration reported by liu et al 2015 using an analytical approach where the study introduced the porosity for the leeward vertical screen vijay and sahoo 2019 examined a pair of floating porous boxes using the boundary element method the study discussed that the impermeable screens experience higher fluid force as compared with permeable porous screens and seaward porous box encounters more wave impact due to the vertical edges in most of the previous studies a linear porous boundary condition is chosen wherein the effects of wave height on the energy dissipation is ignored molin 2011 demonstrated that under the assumption of uniform porosity in the linear potential flow theory the pressure drop over a porous barrier in an oscillatory flow is a sum of quadratic drag term and an inertia term to represent the flow acceleration through the pores the study routes to the works of mei et al 1974 recent studies on thin porous barriers having a quadratic pressure drop are analyzed using semi analytical and numerical methods are molin and remy 2015 liu and li 2017 mackay and johanning 2020 and lyu et al 2020 boundary element method

domain bem can handle degenerate boundary problems by splitting the original domain into two subdomains however the introduction of hypersingular integral formulation plays an important role to solve the problem more efficiently in a single domain the major drawback of using multi domain bem is attributed to huge matrix size which encourages researchers to use dual boundary element method dbem for solving degenerate boundary problems in a single domain the dual boundary element method dbem is recognized as an elegant method to resolve the rank deficiency issues chen et al 1994 2002 2004 chen and chen 1998 from the mathematical point of view one can not assure the uniqueness of the solution for rank deficiency problems hong and chen 1988 were the first to develop dual bem to handle rank deficiency issues of the conventional bem applying dual bem the degenerate boundary problems such as crack problems and cutoff walls in seepage problems were easily tackled without dividing the actual domain into the subdomain the main idea behind the dual bem is the introduction of a hypersingular boundary integral equation which enables for providing a full rank matrix yueh and tsaur 1999 chen et

of the main conclusions 2 mathematical formulation gravity wave interaction with an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes is investigated in the context of two dimensional linear water wave theory the entire setup is assumed to be tightly held in place by a group of piles at a certain distance along the z axis the numbering of trapezoidal porous boxes is done from left to right in sequential order in the cartesian coordinate system the x axis is taken along the horizontal axis and y axis is vertically positive upward with the origin chosen at the free water surface as shown in fig 1 the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω therefore the existence of a velocity potential φ x y t of the form φ x y t r e φ x y e i ω t where r e denotes the real part of the spatial complex potential φ x y that satisfies the laplace equation given by 1 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 0 the linearized boundary condition on the mean free surface is given by 2 φ y ω 2 g φ 0 on y 0 x boundary condition on the flat rigid bottom is given by 3 φ y 0 x and y h the flow past porous structure obeys a semi empirical quadratic discharge equation derived by molin and remy 2015 and reused by lyu et al 2020 is adopted the pressure drop across the porous barrier is considered to be proportional to the square of the normal velocity of the fluid by considering the linearized hydrodynamic pressure and applying the lorentz linearization the boundary condition on the porous barrier is deduced as 4 φ φ 8 i 3 π ω 1 μ 2 α μ 2 φ n φ n 2 c b φ n where μ α and c b are the porosity of the barrier discharge coefficient and blockage or inertia coefficient respectively n denotes the normal to the surface of the barrier the coefficients of quadratic term in eq 4 denote the energy dissipation and that of velocity term denotes the inertial effects moreover the horizontal fluid velocity is assumed to be continuous on the porous structure which yield 5 φ n φ n based on the experiments suh et al 2011 and huang et al 2011 revealed an empirical relation for the blockage coefficient as 6 c b δ 2 μ where δ is the thickness of the plate the far field boundary conditions on the left and right extremes are given by 7 lim x x i k 0 φ φ i 0 where φ i denotes the incident wave potential and k 0 represent the incident wave number which satisfies the dispersion relation ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 h on the application of separation of variables method the velocity potential in the outer regions is given by 8 φ i g h 2 ω e i k 0 x l y 0 y r 0 e i k 0 x l y 0 y x l and 9 φ i g h 2 ω t 0 e i k 0 x l y 0 y x l the entire breakwater system is considered to be at a sufficiently long distance l h 5 from the shoreline and the effect of evanescent modes is ignored mackay and johanning 2020 on the fictitious boundaries at both extremes the velocity potential and the horizontal fluid velocity potential must be continuous in eqs 8 and 9 the eigenfunction y 0 y is given by 10 y 0 y cosh k 0 y h cosh k 0 h multiplying both sides of eqs 8 and 9 by y 0 y and integrating from h to 0 at x l yields 11 r 0 2 i ω g h n 0 2 h 0 φ y 0 y d y 1 12 t 0 2 i ω g h n 0 2 h 0 φ y 0 y d y where n 0 2 h 0 y 0 2 y d y the reflection coefficient k r is defined as the ratio of reflected wave height to incident wave height and is given as 13 k r r 0 on the other hand the transmission coefficient k t is defined as the ratio of transmitted wave height to incident wave height and is given as 14 k t t 0 the energy loss coefficient is defined as yu and chwang 1994 15 k l 1 k r 2 k t 2 3 numerical solution using dual boundary element method dbem the computational domain of an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes breakwater system is shown in fig 2 as discussed in section 1 the present boundary value problem is solved in a single domain instead of multi domain which eliminates the unnecessary creation of matching boundaries and as a result greater reduction in the matrix size to derive the boundary integral equation corresponding to a given differential equation free space green s function and green s second identity are required let g l q p ln r and g l q p n q 1 r r n q n q is the unit outward normal at point q be the fundamental solution and its normal derivative corresponding to the two dimensional laplace equation applying green s second identity to eq 1 we obtain the boundary integral equation for the velocity potential function φ at the general field point p 16 ε p φ p γ φ q g l q p n q g l q p φ q n q d γ q where ε p is defined by 17 ε p 2 π i f p ω π i f p γ smooth 0 i f p ω γ where r is the distance between the general field point p x y and the integration point q ξ η i e r x ξ 2 y η 2 and γ is the resultant of all the boundaries in the computational domain ω the system of singular and hyper singular boundary integral equations can be obtained across the boundaries of thin zero thickness porous breakwater by considering the boundary points on the two sides of the degenerate boundary which are given by hong and chen 1988 yueh and tsaur 1999 chen et al 2017 18 π φ p γ φ q g l q p n q g l q p φ q n q d γ q p γ r γ 19 π φ p n p γ φ q 2 g l q p n p n q g l q p n p φ q n q d γ q p γ where γ r represents the non degenerate boundary and γ and γ denote the two sides of the degenerate boundary respectively γ is the resultant of all the boundaries i e γ γ r γ γ it is almost not possible to obtain the analytical solution corresponding to the system of boundary integral equations given by eqs 18 and 19 therefore some form of numerical approximation is necessary in the numerical implementation of dbem the boundary γ is discretized into n constant elements in a counter clockwise sense eq 18 can be rewritten in a matrix form as follows 20 u i j φ n t i j φ the entries of the coefficient matrices u i j and t i j are obtained by evaluating the influence coefficients u i j and t i j which are given as follows u i j γ j ln r d γ q t i j γ j n q ln r d γ q π δ i j in the case of a non vanishing thickness plate type breakwater the unknown velocity potential can be obtained by solving eq 20 whereas in the case of a thin or vanishing thickness breakwater it is not sufficient to achieve a unique solution due to the rank deficiency of the influence matrices hence it is necessary to include the hypersingular boundary integral equation the hypersingular boundary integral equation can be derived by applying the normal derivatives to the boundary integral equation of the potential function eq 16 by discretizing the boundary γ into n constant elements eq 19 can also be written in a matrix form as follows 21 l i j φ n m i j φ the entries of the coefficient matrices l i j and m i j are obtained by evaluating the influence coefficients l i j and m i j which are given as follows l i j γ j n p ln r d γ q π δ i j m i j γ j 2 n p n q ln r d γ q in the computation of dbem the system of algebraic equations can be obtained by discretizing the boundary γ into n constant elements and applying the discretized form of the boundary integral equation at the mid point of each element corresponding to each fixed field points the assembling of eqs 20 and 21 give us resultant system of matrix equations which is given by 22 u i j γ r γ r u i j γ r γ u i j γ r γ u i j γ γ r u i j γ γ u i j γ γ l i j γ γ r l i j γ γ l i j γ γ φ n γ r φ n γ φ n γ t i j γ r γ r t i j γ r γ t i j γ r γ t i j γ γ r t i j γ γ t i j γ γ m i j γ γ r m i j γ γ m i j γ γ φ γ r φ γ φ γ after employing the boundary conditions eqs 2 12 into eq 22 we obtain the following system of the linear algebraic equations 23 a φ b where a and b represent the coefficient matrix and column vector respectively it is worth mentioning that as the boundary condition on the porous boxes is nonlinear i e quadratic obtaining a numerical solution is not straight forward therefore we adopted an iterative procedure given by liu and li 2017 the solution of eq 23 provide us with the unknown velocity potential function on the individual boundary the scattering coefficients by the breakwater system are computed using eqs 11 15 the time independent non dimensional horizontal vertical force and moment on the breakwater setup about the reference 0 h is given as 24 x p x y n x d γ ρ g h h y p x y n y d γ ρ g h h m o p x y r x n y r y n x d γ ρ g h h 2 where p x y is the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the porous barriers and is given by 25 p x y i ρ ω φ 4 results and discussion the wave scattering efficiency of an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes is investigated using the dbem the inverted trapezoidal porous box consists of a submerged horizontal porous plate with two inclined plates wings on either end it may be noted that when the porosity is set to unity the barriers are completely invisible to the incoming waves in such a case the full transmission is obtained on the other hand when the porosity is set to zero the barriers are impermeable structures the present study is devoted to examine the porous barriers and hence the discussion on the same is limited the effect of the number of porous boxes change in porosity relative clearance spacing between the boxes plate width submergence depth and wings rotation angle on the scattering coefficients and force coefficients are reported throughout the study the plate thickness of 1 cm discharge coefficient α 0 40 and relative wave steepness h λ 0 05 is fixed and the wings are assumed to be surface piercing with the wing s length e unless otherwise mentioned the arrangement setup of multiple porous boxes is given in table 1 in the case of the odd number of porous boxes the second box lies in the origin whereas the breakwater is located symmetrically about the origin for an even number of porous boxes 4 1 validation of the numerical code with mbem and experiments the validation of the numerical code is carried out with an independently developed multi domain boundary element method mbem code the physical parameters used are d h 0 20 b c 0 50 e b 0 50 n 2 μ 0 20 θ 0 a complete agreement between the two results ensures the integrity of the developed numerical model is shown in fig 3 the results demonstrate that with the increase in the length of the porous plate the wave transmission is reduced and there is a peak shift inward in the wave reflection on the other hand the present numerical results are validated with known results available in the literature in fig 4 a the wave reflection k r versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h is examined in the case of a single submerged plate the physical parameters used are h b 3 c b 2 b e 2 n 2 μ 0 13 θ 0 a very good correlation is observed between the present study results and the experimental results of cho and kim 2013 further the results reveal that an increase in the submergence depth of the plate reduces the wave reflection in fig 4b the wave reflection k r versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h is examined for a pair of horizontally staggered impermeable plates the present solution agrees well with the experimental results of wu 2004 and the numerical results of chen et al 2017 the physical parameters used are d h 0 375 b h 1 0 s h 1 0 n 2 μ 0 θ 0 the zero minima of k r is observed near k 0 h 2 0 for a pair of submerged plates 4 2 effect of the number of porous boxes fig 5 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 5a transmission coefficient k t fig 5b energy loss coefficient k l fig 5c horizontal force x fig 5d vertical force y fig 5e and moment m fig 5f versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for the different number of periodic inverted trapezoidal porous boxes it is apparent from fig 5a the single porous box shows minimal wave reflection as compared with multiple porous boxes at each of the periodic peaks for intermediate wave region k 0 h 1 2 and short wave region k 0 h 3 8 the peak values of k r increases with an increase in the number of porous boxes at k 0 h 1 2 whilst the bandwidth of the peak reduces and this phenomenon is generally reported as bragg scattering of surface gravity waves by periodic wave absorbers vijay et al 2020 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020a b the increase in the number of porous boxes reduces the wave transmission and higher wave transmission is observed for a single porous box n 1 and 30 reduction of k t for a pair of porous boxes n 2 45 reduction of k t for three porous boxes n 3 and 55 reduction of k t for four porous boxes n 4 is obtained as compared with the single porous box at k 0 h 2 5 due to the change in wave damping fig 5c and wave trapping inside the porous box fig 5c demonstrates that the addition of porous boxes for n 2 has less contribution in the wave damping hence there exists a trade off between the project investment and the required tranquil zone the wave damping and wave trapping effect of a pair of porous boxes are considerable as compared with single and triple porous boxes based on the rate of reduction of wave transmission and rate of enhancement of wave damping in the case of intermediate and short period waves the overall hydrodynamic horizontal force vertical force and moment experienced are observed to be minimal for a single porous box as compared with multiple porous boxes and almost 33 33 reduction is observed at the point of optima the minimal wave transmission k t 0 43 is obtained for a pair of porous boxes and a further increase in the number of porous boxes enhances the capital cost of construction and the contribution from the addition of third and fourth porous boxes is minimal in the design viewpoint as it is well known the prerequisite of any offshore breakwater is to have wave transmission k t 0 5 thus it is suggested that a pair of porous boxes suffice to effectively constrict the incident wave action 4 3 effect of porosity fig 6 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 6a transmission coefficient k t fig 6b energy loss coefficient k l fig 6c horizontal force x fig 6d vertical force y fig 6e and moment m fig 6f versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for different porosities the harmonic oscillations and identical estimation of scattering coefficients and force coefficients are observed in the intermediate and deep water waves respectively lower porosity μ 0 1 gives higher wave reflection and lower wave transmission thus the resultant wave damping acquired by the inverted trapezoidal porous box is observed to be negligible as contrasted to the other porosity estimations by the barrier the significant enhance in the loss coefficient is observed for μ 0 2 as compared with μ 0 1 and it is almost 30 at k 0 h 2 this may be due to the combined effect of wave trapping and wave blocking near the inclined wings of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes thereafter the increase in the breakwater porosity shows an insignificant change in the loss coefficient this shows that the barrier arrives at its ideal wave damping level and a further increase in the porosity display the disadvantages of permitting more waves through the structure thus the minimal change in the loss coefficient causes the maximal wave transmission coefficient the sub harmonic peak followed by a primary harmonic peak is observed in the wave reflection and it is generally alluded to as bragg scattering thus the harmonic trough in transmission coefficient and loss coefficient is observed at k 0 h 1 2 due to bragg resonant reflection for intermediate waves the reduction trend in the horizontal and vertical force is observed with increment in the breakwater porosity the moment behaviour is a replica of vertical force coefficient with minimal changes in numerical values the zero minima of vertical and horizontal force are observed at k 0 h 1 2 due to bragg resonant reflection the scattering coefficients and hydrodynamic force coefficients accomplish a harmonic peak and trough values near resonant frequency in the intermediate depth the 13 and 17 reduction of vertical force is observed at k 0 h 0 34 and k 0 h 3 respectively as compared with the moment for rigid breakwaters finally the breakwater porosity μ 0 1 is inadmissible because of insignificant wave damping along with higher force coefficients similarly the breakwater porosity μ 0 4 is unacceptable due to maximal wave transmission and unaltered energy loss coefficient subsequently the breakwater porosity within 0 2 μ 0 3 shows effective wave distribution in the form of scattering coefficients and force coefficients thus the breakwater porosity μ 0 25 is proposed for building the inverted trapezoidal breakwaters for effective wave constriction 4 4 effect of relative clearance fig 7 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 7a transmission coefficient k t fig 7b energy loss coefficient k l fig 7c horizontal force x fig 7d vertical force y fig 7e and moment m fig 7f versus relative clearance s λ for various values of porous box width b d the relative spacing served as impetuses for harmonic oscillations acquired in the scattering coefficients and force coefficients the harmonic oscillations in the form of peaks and troughs are observed for change in relative clearance due to the π phase shift of incident waves and the formation of standing waves respectively in the case of wave reflection the minimal width enhances the magnitude of the harmonic oscillations and maximal width diminish the oscillations through wave damping caused by the fluid discharge the increase in the structural width reduces harmonic oscillations and transmission coefficient due to a change in the loss coefficient previous works vijay et al 2020 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020a b reported that the harmonic troughs in the scattering coefficients are alluded to as wave trapping and phase change of incident waves are responsible for the harmonic peaks in the wave scattering the formation of clapotis is additionally one of the reasons which causes the harmonic oscillatory pattern in the wave scattering coefficients and force coefficients the vertical porous wings θ 90 show higher harmonic oscillations in the scattering coefficients and force coefficients as compared with the inclined porous wings thus the horizontal force attains the highest value for vertical wings due to trapped fluid mass inside the porous box it is also observed that the inclined wings offer very minimal horizontal force coefficient and moderate vertical force coefficient as compared with the vertical wings see section 4 4 this finding is completely new and it will be useful for the meticulous design of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes for the alleviation of coastal infrastructure in the present study most of the results show that the vertical force and moment are in phase however in the present section the change in phase is observed for vertical force and moment in fig 5e f this may be due to the effect of trapped fluid mass in the confined chambers available between the wings and the dissipation of incident wave energy through the porous flow the change in relative spacing between the vertical wings generally enhances the harmonic oscillation and abrupt change in the harmonic peak and trough may lead to fatigue failure and this problem can be solved by having wide chambers for wave trapping for the given wave and structural parameters the change in the loss coefficient fig 7c is minimal with the change in relative spacing thus s λ 1 is suggested for the design and development of breakwaters 4 5 effect of relative plate width fig 8 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 8a transmission coefficient k t fig 8b energy loss coefficient k l fig 8c horizontal force x fig 8d vertical force y fig 8e and moment m fig 8f versus relative plate width b λ for various values of box porosity μ a few past examinations revealed that if the ratio of rubble mound breakwater width to incident wavelength approaches to unity then the breakwater of finite width generally behaves as a semi infinite breakwater thus the identical values of wave reflection zero transmission are plausible with the semi infinite structure dalrymple et al 1991 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020a b in the present case the relative plate width is considered within 0 01 b λ 1 and it is classified into minimal width 0 01 b λ 0 33 moderate width 0 33 b λ 0 66 and higher width 0 66 b λ 1 the minimal width shows the harmonic peak in wave reflection the harmonic trough in the wave transmission along with a moderate loss coefficient is obtained the moderate width shows the multiple oscillations in the scattering coefficients whilst higher structural width shows optimal wave damping by a whooping k l 0 95 thus the minimal wave reflection and transmission coefficients are accomplished additionally the minima of wave reflection and wave transmission are observed for particular values of relative plate width which proposes the creation of a tranquil zone close to the far field locales and wave trapped zone in the confined chamber however a very minimal horizontal force is observed for all the values of porosity throughout it is obvious that the wings are responsible for the horizontal force and zero contribution by a horizontal plate is noticed the minimal horizontal force is mainly attributed to the reduction in the projected area in the vertical direction i e y axis by the wings having θ 30 as stated in the previous sub section the vertical force and moment shows a near identical pattern for various values of plate porosity and almost 50 reduction of vertical force is observed for change in the relative plate width b λ as compared with moment by double trapezoidal porous boxes as stated in section 4 3 the plate porosity μ 0 4 is unsuitable for the design purpose due to minimal wave damping the breakwater porosity within 0 2 μ 0 3 shows effective incident wave distribution for plate width b λ 0 4 and the further increment in the plate width tends to inflate the capital expense the almost identical measure of force coefficients is observed for plate porosity within 0 2 μ 0 4 with the change in relative plate width but minimal plate porosity μ 0 1 shows the oscillatory pattern in the force coefficients which may be due to the resonant wave k l motion of the trapped fluid mass in the confined chambers available between the each of the inclined porous plates 4 6 effect of relative submergence fig 9 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 9a transmission coefficient k t fig 9b energy loss coefficient k l fig 9c horizontal force x fig 9d vertical force y fig 9e and moment m fig 9f versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for various values of relative submergence of porous box d h several studies reported that singla et al 2019 vijay and sahoo 2019 the maximal wave transmission and very minimal wave damping were achieved by floating thin vertical barriers in the case of linear long waves however in the case of slating thin walls inverted trapezoidal porous boxes the sudden increase in the wave reflection and monotonic reduction in the wave transmission is obtained in the long wave region in the form of harmonic peak and trough respectively the optima of wave reflection are obtained by porous boxes in the intermediate wave zone at k 0 h 1 1 for all the values of submergence depth thereafter the almost identical measure of wave reflection and almost zero wave transmission are observed in the deep water zone due to the enhanced wave damping a slight oscillatory pattern is observed in the scattering and force coefficients for higher values of d h and the magnitude of oscillations is nearly minimal in the scattering and force coefficients for intermediate and deep water regions due to the enhance in the wave damping by inclined porous wings the optima of horizontal force vertical force and moment are observed in the long wave regime for all the combinations of relative submergence due to minimal wave damping the increase in the submergence depth shows the phenomena of periodic oscillations in the wave reflection a slight reduction of wave transmission the reduction in k t is attributed to the reduced contribution of the horizontal plates as the submergence depth increases it is obvious that the horizontal force increases due to the increase in the projected area the primary harmonic peak followed by secondary harmonic peak is observed in the force coefficients with the change in dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for all the combinations of submergence depth d h the comparative study is performed on the effect of submergence depth ratio and a reduction of 44 67 and 88 in the horizontal force are obtained for d h 0 3 d h 0 2 and d h 0 1 as compared with d h 0 4 it is observed that the pair of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes behave as dynamic fluid dampers for waves of longer wavelength and intermediate wavelength consequently the wave trapping is noticed in the form of harmonic oscillations similarly the porous boxes act as a kinetic wave hindrance and it causes complete wave blocking and wave trapping along with wave damping for waves of shorter wavelength k 0 h π the variation in the magnitude of force coefficients is observed to be exceptionally insignificant 4 7 effect of wings rotation fig 10 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 10a transmission coefficient k t fig 10b energy loss coefficient k l fig 10c horizontal force x fig 10d vertical force y fig 10e and moment m fig 10f versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for various values of wings rotation θ the wings rotation angle causes several changes in the structural physical view for instance the wings rotation angle θ 0 represents the lengthy horizontal plate no wings wings rotation within 30 θ 60 delineates the inverted trapezoidal porous box partially open wings θ 90 outlines the wave scattering by the porous box of vertical edges vertical wings and wings rotation within 120 θ 150 illustrates the trapezoidal porous box partially closed wings this is an analogy to the opening of a cardboard box the structure is submerged and is not surface piercing further when θ 90 the top end tip of the wings skims the free surface for the given physical parameters the sporadic oscillatory nature is observed in the wave reflection pattern with an increase in the angle of wings rotation the no wings case shows very minimal wave reflection for the deep water waves and an increase in the wave reflection is observed with an increase in the wings rotation the optima of wave reflection and horizontal force is observed for vertical wings the partially closed wings delineate the moderate estimations of wave reflection and maximal wave transmission when contrasted with other combinations due to minimal wave trapping inside the porous box the optima of wave damping are observed for open wings when compared to results of partially closed wings the no wings show the zero horizontal force and vertical wings show the higher horizontal force the partially open and partially closed wings portray the moderate horizontal force which emphatically coincides with the statement reported by vijay et al 2020 the novel breakwater must effectively distribute the incident wave energy in the form of scattering coefficients and force coefficients and it is observed on account of the inverted trapezoidal breakwater partially open wings therefore the present study proposes that the porous box of no wings or vertical wings is unable to distribute the incident wave amplitude as compared with a porous box comprising of partially open wings breakwater having the angle of wings θ 30 and θ 60 shows practically indistinguishable measure of scattering and force coefficients thus the present study suggests the angle of wings within 30 θ 60 to secure the leeward coastal infrastructure from the destructive incident waves the vertical force coefficient and moment display identical pattern for change in dimensionless wavenumber and the 10 25 reduction of vertical force can be expected as compared with the moment for long waves intermediate and short period waves 4 8 contour plots of force coefficients fig 11 a d shows the horizontal force coefficient x experienced by a single porous box fig 11a two porous boxes fig 11b three porous boxes fig 11c and four porous boxes fig 11d for variable dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h and box porosity μ the test conditions are b h 1 0 d b 0 25 b c 0 40 θ 45 the zero minima of horizontal force coefficient x are observed for single and multiple porous boxes at k 0 h 1 2 the higher horizontal force coefficient is obtained for minimal porosity and higher porosity shows the minimal force coefficient almost identical values of horizontal force coefficient are observed for a single porous box and multiple porous boxes show the secondary peak in the intermediate wave zone k 0 h 2 6 due to back and forth motions of incident waves in the free spacing fig 12 a d shows the vertical force coefficient y experienced by a single porous box fig 12a two porous boxes fig 12b three porous boxes fig 12c and four porous boxes fig 12d for variable dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h and box porosity μ the increase in the number of porous boxes y displays the drastic changes in the vertical force coefficient pattern and zero minima of vertical force coefficient y are observed at k 0 h 1 2 for multiple porous boxes the single porous box shows a monotonic reduction of vertical force coefficient y for an increase in the dimensionless wavenumber the numerical results of horizontal force coefficient x fig 11 and vertical force coefficient y fig 12 are presented for a better understanding of the flow pattern 5 conclusions in the present study the surface gravity wave scattering by multiple inverted trapezoidal porous boxes is analyzed using the dual boundary element method dbem in the context of linear potential wave theory on the barriers continuity of velocity and pressure based on a non linear pressure drop is employed to account for the effect of wave height on the energy dissipation and the numerical solution is iteratively obtained apart from the engineering perspective the novelty of the present work lies in the method of solution dbem adopted in the present investigation the developed dbem code is validated with an independently developed multi domain boundary element method mbem code and also experimental results available in the literature parametric analysis is carried out and numerical results in the form of scattering and force coefficients are reported for various wave and structural conditions the bragg resonant reflection is observed at k 0 h 1 2 for a periodic array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes and the corresponding wave transmission and force coefficients approach to zero minima overall the porous box with partially open wings shows significant wave constriction when compared to horizontal wings vertical wings and partially closed wings the optimal wave damping k l 0 95 is achieved with a pair of porous boxes for dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h 2 0 wings rotation θ 30 depth of box d h 0 25 center to center distance h c 0 25 and porous box width 0 66 b λ 1 for all the combinations of porosity thus the present study recommended a pair of porous boxes consisting of box porosity within 0 2 μ 0 3 and the angle of wings rotation 30 θ 60 along with a porous box width within 0 50 b λ 0 75 to secure the

21216,a numerical model is developed based on the dual boundary element method dbem to solve the problem of surface gravity waves past multiple floating inverted trapezoidal porous boxes under the framework of linear potential flow theory the continuity of velocity and semi empirical quadratic pressure drop equation is adopted on the porous boundary to incorporate the effect of incident wave amplitude on the energy loss coefficient various results by an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes are discussed in the form of scattering coefficients wave reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients and force coefficients horizontal force vertical force and moment the verification of the numerical model is carried out by an independently developed multi domain boundary element method mbem code and also with results available in the literature the study reveals that in most cases the long waves exhibit insignificant hindrance whereas intermediate waves delineate the harmonic oscillations and deep water waves feel maximal hindrance by inverted trapezoidal porous boxes the wave damping of k l 0 95 is obtained for structural width b λ 0 66 by a pair of identical inverted trapezoidal porous boxes the angle of porous wings is helpful to alter the scattering coefficients and also helps in the fine tuning of force coefficients the angle of partially open wings within 30 0 θ 60 0 is suggested along with structural porosity μ 0 25 for effective constriction of incident waves the parametric analysis will be useful in the meticulous design of cost effective breakwaters

integral equation 1 introduction for the decades the wave scattering analysis of breakwaters in several structural configurations has been identified as an interesting subject with regards to the assurance of water based infrastructure from the destructive incident wave energy in general to diminish the wave impact on the leeward locations the submerged and emerged floating bottom seated porous breakwaters are introduced the objective of a permeable structure is to accomplish the maximal wave damping and to obstruct the incoming waves by changing the phase angle in general the porous breakwaters are classified into thick and thin structures the rubble mound barriers are considered as thick structures and it requires the massive capital expense and mountain rocks key design parameters of a rubble mound breakwater are the in situ soil condition water depth and level of protection required in the port and harbour in addition to the meticulous design gulf countries like kuwait lack the required amount of raw materials mainly rocks in building such massive structures neelamani et al 2017 this drifts the researchers to keenly look for alternative breakwaters which are cost effective and gives a superior hydrodynamic performance thin porous barriers offer swift transport and installation reusable cost effective and eco friendly initially the thin structures in the form of horizontal and vertical porous screens are preferred for the temporary protection of coastal structures thereafter an array of thin porous walls consisting of three confined chambers porto torres industrial harbour italy and five confined chambers dalian chemical production terminal china wall breakwaters are developed for the full protection of ports and harbours from the destructive incident waves similarly the floating breakwaters are likewise constructed for creating a tranquil zone in british columbia canada isaacson and byres 1988 a total number of 30 floating breakwaters were accessible and characterized into three classifications such as i concrete caisson barriers ii log bundles and iii pontoons with the vertical plates however in most of the situations the horizontal and vertical plate type structures fail in the distribution of incident wave energy due to uncertain wave loadings the vertical structures depict higher horizontal force and horizontal structures illustrate higher vertical wave loadings and it is identified as one of the prime reasons for frequent failures of horizontal and vertical plate breakwaters to improve the performance porous boxes the combination of vertical and horizontal porous screens are proposed as an effective wave damping structure to secure the offshore amenities moreover the surface piercing porous boxes promote marine aquaculture the wave trapping and wave damping attributes of a single porous box liu et al 2015 singla et al 2019 and a pair of identical porous boxes vijay and sahoo 2019 comprising of vertical edges are already reported using analytical and numerical methods however the performance characteristics of porous boxes can be improved with the new design techniques in the present study an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes comprising of a submerged horizontal plate with seaward and leeward slanting porous wings are proposed as viable wave hindrances for damping of trapped fluid mass in the confined chambers accessible between the slanting wings from a practical perspective the damping of incident wave energy is one of the solutions for providing the tranquil wave zone in the nearshore regions thus the artificial resistance is included in the unadulterated dynamic fluid to dampen the incident waves hence in the present study the porous boxes consisting of slanting wings are proposed and analyzed in the case of an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes the surface gravity wave scattering is a result of the accompanying four possible potential mechanisms i wave motion underneath the porous box and oscillatory fluid flow above the porous box ii wave breaking by porous box and wave induced oscillations around the slating wings iii wave decomposition due to flow past porous boxes and iv wave induced oscillations in the free chambers available between the slanting wings in the present study an itemized note on the wave dispersing execution of an inverted trapezoidal porous box is reported based on continuity of pressure and velocity with the use of dual boundary element method dbem to understand the real field applicability a detailed investigation of the literature is carried out the analysis of wave action on an inclined plate breakwater is a subject of great interest and the angle of plate inclination has gotten more consideration for the successful plan and establishment of the structure in the case of the inclined plate either seaward plate inclination or leeward plate inclination is suggested by several workers murakami et al 1994 reported that the fluid particle velocity is higher for negative leeward inclination as compared with the positive seaward inclination rao et al 2009 recommended the seaward positive inclination based on the visual observations in the physical modelling of the rigid inclined plate which suggest that the seaward inclination enhances the accumulation of sediment particles over the bottom bed and fine sand particles are seen to be moving far away from the inclined plate in the case of leeward inclination most of the studies reported that the angle of inclination θ within 0 0 θ 40 0 is suitable for reducing the wave impact on shoreward regions sobhani et al 1988 cho and kim 2008 cho et al 2013 thereafter the increase in the angle of inclination θ 40 0 causes severe wave loading on the inclined plate nallayarasu et al 1994 the inclined flexible membrane is set a long way from the seabed kharaghani and lee 1986 which is helpful for the potential application of inclined plates in the deep water wave attenuation for the protection offshore oil fields very recently gayen and mondal 2016 examined the wave scattering attributes of a pair of inclined porous plates using the expansion collocation method the study reported the scattering coefficients and force coefficients by a pair of inclined plates the inclined plates are liberated from the water depth and hydrodynamic coefficients are fine tuned on changing the plate porosity jarlan 1961 proposed a new breakwater which consists of seaside thin permeable wall and leeside impermeable wall and this is termed as jarlan breakwater from that point several workers implemented numerous techniques for the development of thin wave screens to protect the marinas kriebel 2005 reported a set of guidelines for the design and development of timber wave screen breakwater which are used in the u s coast guard first district new england huang et al 2011 and dai et al 2018 presented a detailed review of thin porous screens and its noteworthiness in effective damping of incident waves the concept of jarlan breakwater was additionally stretched out by several authors but liu et al 2015 examined semi immersed jarlan breakwater on adding the additional horizontal submerged plate at the keel of the vertical screens this can be viewed as a floating porous box having a leeward rigid screen the analytical results are compared with the laboratory measurements and the study recommended that the horizontal plate along with the vertical screens are appropriate to accomplish maximal wave damping thereafter singla et al 2019 examined the same configuration reported by liu et al 2015 using an analytical approach where the study introduced the porosity for the leeward vertical screen vijay and sahoo 2019 examined a pair of floating porous boxes using the boundary element method the study discussed that the impermeable screens experience higher fluid force as compared with permeable porous screens and seaward porous box encounters more wave impact due to the vertical edges in most of the previous studies a linear porous boundary condition is chosen wherein the effects of wave height on the energy dissipation is ignored molin 2011 demonstrated that under the assumption of uniform porosity in the linear potential flow theory the pressure drop over a porous barrier in an oscillatory flow is a sum of quadratic drag term and an inertia term to represent the flow acceleration through the pores the study routes to the works of mei et al 1974 recent studies on thin porous barriers having a quadratic pressure drop are analyzed using semi analytical and numerical methods are molin and remy 2015 liu and li 2017 mackay and johanning 2020 and lyu et al 2020 boundary element method bem has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a variety of real world problems in science and engineering due to its dimensional reduction by order one which helps us in saving memory and computational time various authors have been successfully implemented bem and multi domain bem to analyze the interactions of gravity waves with porous structures yu and chwang 1994 yueh and chuang 2012 liu and li 2017 vijay and sahoo 2019 vijay et al 2019 the conventional bem suffers rank deficiency issues of influence matrices for problems involving degenerate boundaries although the multi domain bem can handle degenerate boundary problems by splitting the original domain into two subdomains however the introduction of hypersingular integral formulation plays an important role to solve the problem more efficiently in a single domain the major drawback of using multi domain bem is attributed to huge matrix size which encourages researchers to use dual boundary element method dbem for solving degenerate boundary problems in a single domain the dual boundary element method dbem is recognized as an elegant method to resolve the rank deficiency issues chen et al 1994 2002 2004 chen and chen 1998 from the mathematical point of view one can not assure the uniqueness of the solution for rank deficiency problems hong and chen 1988 were the first to develop dual bem to handle rank deficiency issues of the conventional bem applying dual bem the degenerate boundary problems such as crack problems and cutoff walls in seepage problems were easily tackled without dividing the actual domain into the subdomain the main idea behind the dual bem is the introduction of a hypersingular boundary integral equation which enables for providing a full rank matrix yueh and tsaur 1999 chen et al 2017 to the best of author s knowledge the surface gravity wave scattering by an array of inverted trapezoidal thin porous barriers is far from complete as several studies reported the effectiveness of slanting porous walls on incident wave damping moreover the area of the confined chamber can be increased with wide open porous barriers analogy to an open carton box with this as motivation the surface gravity wave scattering by an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes using dual boundary element method is examined for the advancement of the concept of breakwaters section

2 presents the mathematical formulation whereas section 3 subtleties the methodology based on the dual boundary element method dbem for solving the boundary value problem section 4 presents the validation of the developed numerical code and the results and discussions of the present numerical study the scattering coefficients such as wave reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients and force coefficients such as moment vertical and horizontal force by a pair of inverted trapezoidal breakwaters are reported for certain wave and structural parameters section 5 provides a summary of the main conclusions 2 mathematical formulation gravity wave interaction with an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes is investigated in the context of two dimensional linear water wave theory the entire setup is assumed to be tightly held in place by a group of piles at a certain distance along the z axis the numbering of trapezoidal porous boxes is done from left to right in sequential order in the cartesian coordinate system the x axis is taken along the horizontal axis and y axis is vertically positive upward with the origin chosen at the free water surface as shown in fig 1 the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω therefore the existence of a velocity potential φ x y t of the form φ x y t r e φ x y e i ω t where r e denotes the real part of the spatial complex potential φ x y that satisfies the laplace equation given by 1 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 0 the linearized boundary condition on the mean free surface is given by 2 φ y ω 2 g φ 0 on y 0 x boundary condition on the flat rigid bottom is given by 3 φ y 0 x and y h the flow past porous structure obeys a semi empirical quadratic discharge equation derived by molin and remy 2015 and reused by lyu et al 2020 is adopted the pressure drop across the porous barrier is considered to be proportional to the square of the normal velocity of the fluid by considering the linearized hydrodynamic pressure and applying the lorentz linearization the boundary condition on the porous barrier is deduced as 4 φ φ 8 i 3 π ω 1 μ 2 α μ 2 φ n φ n 2 c b φ n where μ α and c b are the porosity of the barrier discharge coefficient and blockage or inertia coefficient respectively n denotes the normal to the surface of the barrier the coefficients of quadratic term in eq 4 denote the energy dissipation and that of velocity term denotes the inertial effects moreover the horizontal fluid velocity is assumed to be continuous on the porous structure which yield 5 φ n φ n based on the experiments suh et al 2011 and huang et al 2011 revealed an empirical relation for the blockage coefficient as 6 c b δ 2 μ where δ is the thickness of the plate the far field boundary conditions on the left and right extremes are given by 7 lim x x i k 0 φ φ i 0 where φ i denotes the incident wave potential and k 0 represent the incident wave number which satisfies the dispersion relation ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 h on the application of separation of variables method the velocity potential in the outer regions is given by 8 φ i g h 2 ω e i k 0 x l y 0 y r 0 e i k 0 x l y 0 y x l and 9 φ i g h 2 ω t 0 e i k 0 x l y 0 y x l the entire breakwater system is considered to be at a sufficiently long distance l h 5 from the shoreline and the effect of evanescent modes is ignored mackay and johanning 2020 on the fictitious boundaries at both extremes the velocity potential and the horizontal fluid velocity potential must be continuous in eqs 8 and 9 the eigenfunction y 0 y is given by 10 y 0 y cosh k 0 y h cosh k 0 h multiplying both sides of eqs 8 and 9 by y 0 y and integrating from h to 0 at x l yields 11 r 0 2 i ω g h n 0 2 h 0 φ y 0 y d y 1 12 t 0 2 i ω g h n 0 2 h 0 φ y 0 y d y where n 0 2 h 0 y 0 2 y d y the reflection coefficient k r is defined as the ratio of reflected wave height to incident wave height and is given as 13 k r r 0 on the other hand the transmission coefficient k t is defined as the ratio of transmitted wave height to incident wave height and is given as 14 k t t 0 the energy loss coefficient is defined as yu and chwang 1994 15 k l 1 k r 2 k t 2 3 numerical solution using dual boundary element method dbem the computational domain of an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes breakwater system is shown in fig 2 as discussed in section 1 the present boundary value problem is solved in a single domain instead of multi domain which eliminates the unnecessary creation of matching boundaries and as a result greater reduction in the matrix size to derive the boundary integral equation corresponding to a given differential equation free space green s function and green s second identity are required let g l q p ln r and g l q p n q 1 r r n q n q is the unit outward normal at point q be the fundamental solution and its normal derivative corresponding to the two dimensional laplace equation applying green s second identity to eq 1 we obtain the boundary integral equation for the velocity potential function φ at the general field point p 16 ε p φ p γ φ q g l q p n q g l q p φ q n q d γ q where ε p is defined by 17 ε p 2 π i f p ω π i f p γ smooth 0 i f p ω γ where r is the distance between the general field point p x y and the integration point q ξ η i e r x ξ 2 y η 2 and γ is the resultant of all the boundaries in the computational domain ω the system of singular and hyper singular boundary integral equations can be obtained across the boundaries of thin zero thickness porous breakwater by considering the boundary points on the two sides of the degenerate boundary which are given by hong and chen 1988 yueh and tsaur 1999 chen et al 2017 18 π φ p γ φ q g l q p n q g l q p φ q n q d γ q p γ r γ 19 π φ p n p γ φ q 2 g l q p n p n q g l q p n p φ q n q d γ q p γ where γ r represents the non degenerate boundary and γ and γ denote the two sides of the degenerate boundary respectively γ is the resultant of all the boundaries i e γ γ r γ γ it is almost not possible to obtain the analytical solution corresponding to the system of boundary integral equations given by eqs 18 and 19 therefore some form of numerical approximation is necessary in the numerical implementation of dbem the boundary γ is discretized into n constant elements in a counter clockwise sense eq 18 can be rewritten in a matrix form as follows 20 u i j φ n t i j φ the entries of the coefficient matrices u i j and t i j are obtained by evaluating the influence coefficients u i j and t i j which are given as follows u i j γ j ln r d γ q t i j γ j n q ln r d γ q π δ i j in the case of a non vanishing thickness plate type breakwater the unknown velocity potential can be obtained by solving eq 20 whereas in the case of a thin or vanishing thickness breakwater it is not sufficient to achieve a unique solution due to the rank deficiency of the influence matrices hence it is necessary to include the hypersingular boundary integral equation the hypersingular boundary integral equation can be derived by applying the normal derivatives to the boundary integral equation of the potential function eq 16 by discretizing the boundary γ into n constant elements eq 19 can also be written in a matrix form as follows 21 l i j φ n m i j φ the entries of the coefficient matrices l i j and m i j are obtained by evaluating the influence coefficients l i j and m i j which are given as follows l i j γ j n p ln r d γ q π δ i j m i j γ j 2 n p n q ln r d γ q in the computation of dbem the system of algebraic equations can be obtained by discretizing the boundary γ into n constant elements and applying the discretized form of the boundary integral equation at the mid point of each element corresponding to each fixed field points the assembling of eqs 20 and 21 give us resultant system of matrix equations which is given by 22 u i j γ r γ r u i j γ r γ u i j γ r γ u i j γ γ r u i j γ γ u i j γ γ l i j γ γ r l i j γ γ l i j γ γ φ n γ r φ n γ φ n γ t i j γ r γ r t i j γ r γ t i j γ r γ t i j γ γ r t i j γ γ t i j γ γ m i j γ γ r m i j γ γ m i j γ γ φ γ r φ γ φ γ after employing the boundary conditions eqs 2 12 into eq 22 we obtain the following system of the linear algebraic equations 23 a φ b where a and b represent the coefficient matrix and column vector respectively it is worth mentioning that as the boundary condition on the porous boxes is nonlinear i e quadratic obtaining a numerical solution is not straight forward therefore we adopted an iterative procedure given by liu and li 2017 the solution of eq 23 provide us with the unknown velocity potential function on the individual boundary the scattering coefficients by the breakwater system are computed using eqs 11 15 the time independent non dimensional horizontal vertical force and moment on the breakwater setup about the reference 0 h is given as 24 x p x y n x d γ ρ g h h y p x y n y d γ ρ g h h m o p x y r x n y r y n x d γ ρ g h h 2 where p x y is the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the porous barriers and is given by 25 p x y i ρ ω φ 4 results and discussion the wave scattering efficiency of an array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes is investigated using the dbem the inverted trapezoidal porous box consists of a submerged horizontal porous plate with two inclined plates wings on either end it may be noted that when the porosity is set to unity the barriers are completely invisible to the incoming waves in such a case the full transmission is obtained on the other hand when the porosity is set to zero the barriers are impermeable structures the present study is devoted to examine the porous barriers and hence the discussion on the same is limited the effect of the number of porous boxes change in porosity relative clearance spacing between the boxes plate width submergence depth and wings rotation angle on the scattering coefficients and force coefficients are reported throughout the study the plate thickness of 1 cm discharge coefficient α 0 40 and relative wave steepness h λ 0 05 is fixed and the wings are assumed to be surface piercing with the wing s length e unless otherwise mentioned the arrangement setup of multiple porous boxes is given in table 1 in the case of the odd number of porous boxes the second box lies in the origin whereas the breakwater is located symmetrically about the origin for an even number of porous boxes 4 1 validation of the numerical code with mbem and experiments the validation of the numerical code is carried out with an independently developed multi domain boundary element method mbem code the physical parameters used are d h 0 20 b c 0 50 e b 0 50 n 2 μ 0 20 θ 0 a complete agreement between the two results ensures the integrity of the developed numerical model is shown in fig 3 the results demonstrate that with the increase in the length of the porous plate the wave transmission is reduced and there is a peak shift inward in the wave reflection on the other hand the present numerical results are validated with known results available in the literature in fig 4 a the wave reflection k r versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h is examined in the case of a single submerged plate the physical parameters used are h b 3 c b 2 b e 2 n 2 μ 0 13 θ 0 a very good correlation is observed between the present study results and the experimental results of cho and kim 2013 further the results reveal that an increase in the submergence depth of the plate reduces the wave reflection in fig 4b the wave reflection k r versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h is examined for a pair of horizontally staggered impermeable plates the present solution agrees well with the experimental results of wu 2004 and the numerical results of chen et al 2017 the physical parameters used are d h 0 375 b h 1 0 s h 1 0 n 2 μ 0 θ 0 the zero minima of k r is observed near k 0 h 2 0 for a pair of submerged plates 4 2 effect of the number of porous boxes fig 5 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 5a transmission coefficient k t fig 5b energy loss coefficient k l fig 5c horizontal force x fig 5d vertical force y fig 5e and moment m fig 5f versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for the different number of periodic inverted trapezoidal porous boxes it is apparent from fig 5a the single porous box shows minimal wave reflection as compared with multiple porous boxes at each of the periodic peaks for intermediate wave region k 0 h 1 2 and short wave region k 0 h 3 8 the peak values of k r increases with an increase in the number of porous boxes at k 0 h 1 2 whilst the bandwidth of the peak reduces and this phenomenon is generally reported as bragg scattering of surface gravity waves by periodic wave absorbers vijay et al 2020 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020a b the increase in the number of porous boxes reduces the wave transmission and higher wave transmission is observed for a single porous box n 1 and 30 reduction of k t for a pair of porous boxes n 2 45 reduction of k t for three porous boxes n 3 and 55 reduction of k t for four porous boxes n 4 is obtained as compared with the single porous box at k 0 h 2 5 due to the change in wave damping fig 5c and wave trapping inside the porous box fig 5c demonstrates that the addition of porous boxes for n 2 has less contribution in the wave damping hence there exists a trade off between the project investment and the required tranquil zone the wave damping and wave trapping effect of a pair of porous boxes are considerable as compared with single and triple porous boxes based on the rate of reduction of wave transmission and rate of enhancement of wave damping in the case of intermediate and short period waves the overall hydrodynamic horizontal force vertical force and moment experienced are observed to be minimal for a single porous box as compared with multiple porous boxes and almost 33 33 reduction is observed at the point of optima the minimal wave transmission k t 0 43 is obtained for a pair of porous boxes and a further increase in the number of porous boxes enhances the capital cost of construction and the contribution from the addition of third and fourth porous boxes is minimal in the design viewpoint as it is well known the prerequisite of any offshore breakwater is to have wave transmission k t 0 5 thus it is suggested that a pair of porous boxes suffice to effectively constrict the incident wave action 4 3 effect of porosity fig 6 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 6a transmission coefficient k t fig 6b energy loss coefficient k l fig 6c horizontal force x fig 6d vertical force y fig 6e and moment m fig 6f versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for different porosities the harmonic oscillations and identical estimation of scattering coefficients and force coefficients are observed in the intermediate and deep water waves respectively lower porosity μ 0 1 gives higher wave reflection and lower wave transmission thus the resultant wave damping acquired by the inverted trapezoidal porous box is observed to be negligible as contrasted to the other porosity estimations by the barrier the significant enhance in the loss coefficient is observed for μ 0 2 as compared with μ 0 1 and it is almost 30 at k 0 h 2 this may be due to the combined effect of wave trapping and wave blocking near the inclined wings of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes thereafter the increase in the breakwater porosity shows an insignificant change in the loss coefficient this shows that the barrier arrives at its ideal wave damping level and a further increase in the porosity display the disadvantages of permitting more waves through the structure thus the minimal change in the loss coefficient causes the maximal wave transmission coefficient the sub harmonic peak followed by a primary harmonic peak is observed in the wave reflection and it is generally alluded to as bragg scattering thus the harmonic trough in transmission coefficient and loss coefficient is observed at k 0 h 1 2 due to bragg resonant reflection for intermediate waves the reduction trend in the horizontal and vertical force is observed with increment in the breakwater porosity the moment behaviour is a replica of vertical force coefficient with minimal changes in numerical values the zero minima of vertical and horizontal force are observed at k 0 h 1 2 due to bragg resonant reflection the scattering coefficients and hydrodynamic force coefficients accomplish a harmonic peak and trough values near resonant frequency in the intermediate depth the 13 and 17 reduction of vertical force is observed at k 0 h 0 34 and k 0 h 3 respectively as compared with the moment for rigid breakwaters finally the breakwater porosity μ 0 1 is inadmissible because of insignificant wave damping along with higher force coefficients similarly the breakwater porosity μ 0 4 is unacceptable due to maximal wave transmission and unaltered energy loss coefficient subsequently the breakwater porosity within 0 2 μ 0 3 shows effective wave distribution in the form of scattering coefficients and force coefficients thus the breakwater porosity μ 0 25 is proposed for building the inverted trapezoidal breakwaters for effective wave constriction 4 4 effect of relative clearance fig 7 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 7a transmission coefficient k t fig 7b energy loss coefficient k l fig 7c horizontal force x fig 7d vertical force y fig 7e and moment m fig 7f versus relative clearance s λ for various values of porous box width b d the relative spacing served as impetuses for harmonic oscillations acquired in the scattering coefficients and force coefficients the harmonic oscillations in the form of peaks and troughs are observed for change in relative clearance due to the π phase shift of incident waves and the formation of standing waves respectively in the case of wave reflection the minimal width enhances the magnitude of the harmonic oscillations and maximal width diminish the oscillations through wave damping caused by the fluid discharge the increase in the structural width reduces harmonic oscillations and transmission coefficient due to a change in the loss coefficient previous works vijay et al 2020 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020a b reported that the harmonic troughs in the scattering coefficients are alluded to as wave trapping and phase change of incident waves are responsible for the harmonic peaks in the wave scattering the formation of clapotis is additionally one of the reasons which causes the harmonic oscillatory pattern in the wave scattering coefficients and force coefficients the vertical porous wings θ 90 show higher harmonic oscillations in the scattering coefficients and force coefficients as compared with the inclined porous wings thus the horizontal force attains the highest value for vertical wings due to trapped fluid mass inside the porous box it is also observed that the inclined wings offer very minimal horizontal force coefficient and moderate vertical force coefficient as compared with the vertical wings see section 4 4 this finding is completely new and it will be useful for the meticulous design of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes for the alleviation of coastal infrastructure in the present study most of the results show that the vertical force and moment are in phase however in the present section the change in phase is observed for vertical force and moment in fig 5e f this may be due to the effect of trapped fluid mass in the confined chambers available between the wings and the dissipation of incident wave energy through the porous flow the change in relative spacing between the vertical wings generally enhances the harmonic oscillation and abrupt change in the harmonic peak and trough may lead to fatigue failure and this problem can be solved by having wide chambers for wave trapping for the given wave and structural parameters the change in the loss coefficient fig 7c is minimal with the change in relative spacing thus s λ 1 is suggested for the design and development of breakwaters 4 5 effect of relative plate width fig 8 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 8a transmission coefficient k t fig 8b energy loss coefficient k l fig 8c horizontal force x fig 8d vertical force y fig 8e and moment m fig 8f versus relative plate width b λ for various values of box porosity μ a few past examinations revealed that if the ratio of rubble mound breakwater width to incident wavelength approaches to unity then the breakwater of finite width generally behaves as a semi infinite breakwater thus the identical values of wave reflection zero transmission are plausible with the semi infinite structure dalrymple et al 1991 venkateswarlu and karmakar 2020a b in the present case the relative plate width is considered within 0 01 b λ 1 and it is classified into minimal width 0 01 b λ 0 33 moderate width 0 33 b λ 0 66 and higher width 0 66 b λ 1 the minimal width shows the harmonic peak in wave reflection the harmonic trough in the wave transmission along with a moderate loss coefficient is obtained the moderate width shows the multiple oscillations in the scattering coefficients whilst higher structural width shows optimal wave damping by a whooping k l 0 95 thus the minimal wave reflection and transmission coefficients are accomplished additionally the minima of wave reflection and wave transmission are observed for particular values of relative plate width which proposes the creation of a tranquil zone close to the far field locales and wave trapped zone in the confined chamber however a very minimal horizontal force is observed for all the values of porosity throughout it is obvious that the wings are responsible for the horizontal force and zero contribution by a horizontal plate is noticed the minimal horizontal force is mainly attributed to the reduction in the projected area in the vertical direction i e y axis by the wings having θ 30 as stated in the previous sub section the vertical force and moment shows a near identical pattern for various values of plate porosity and almost 50 reduction of vertical force is observed for change in the relative plate width b λ as compared with moment by double trapezoidal porous boxes as stated in section 4 3 the plate porosity μ 0 4 is unsuitable for the design purpose due to minimal wave damping the breakwater porosity within 0 2 μ 0 3 shows effective incident wave distribution for plate width b λ 0 4 and the further increment in the plate width tends to inflate the capital expense the almost identical measure of force coefficients is observed for plate porosity within 0 2 μ 0 4 with the change in relative plate width but minimal plate porosity μ 0 1 shows the oscillatory pattern in the force coefficients which may be due to the resonant wave k l motion of the trapped fluid mass in the confined chambers available between the each of the inclined porous plates 4 6 effect of relative submergence fig 9 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 9a transmission coefficient k t fig 9b energy loss coefficient k l fig 9c horizontal force x fig 9d vertical force y fig 9e and moment m fig 9f versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for various values of relative submergence of porous box d h several studies reported that singla et al 2019 vijay and sahoo 2019 the maximal wave transmission and very minimal wave damping were achieved by floating thin vertical barriers in the case of linear long waves however in the case of slating thin walls inverted trapezoidal porous boxes the sudden increase in the wave reflection and monotonic reduction in the wave transmission is obtained in the long wave region in the form of harmonic peak and trough respectively the optima of wave reflection are obtained by porous boxes in the intermediate wave zone at k 0 h 1 1 for all the values of submergence depth thereafter the almost identical measure of wave reflection and almost zero wave transmission are observed in the deep water zone due to the enhanced wave damping a slight oscillatory pattern is observed in the scattering and force coefficients for higher values of d h and the magnitude of oscillations is nearly minimal in the scattering and force coefficients for intermediate and deep water regions due to the enhance in the wave damping by inclined porous wings the optima of horizontal force vertical force and moment are observed in the long wave regime for all the combinations of relative submergence due to minimal wave damping the increase in the submergence depth shows the phenomena of periodic oscillations in the wave reflection a slight reduction of wave transmission the reduction in k t is attributed to the reduced contribution of the horizontal plates as the submergence depth increases it is obvious that the horizontal force increases due to the increase in the projected area the primary harmonic peak followed by secondary harmonic peak is observed in the force coefficients with the change in dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for all the combinations of submergence depth d h the comparative study is performed on the effect of submergence depth ratio and a reduction of 44 67 and 88 in the horizontal force are obtained for d h 0 3 d h 0 2 and d h 0 1 as compared with d h 0 4 it is observed that the pair of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes behave as dynamic fluid dampers for waves of longer wavelength and intermediate wavelength consequently the wave trapping is noticed in the form of harmonic oscillations similarly the porous boxes act as a kinetic wave hindrance and it causes complete wave blocking and wave trapping along with wave damping for waves of shorter wavelength k 0 h π the variation in the magnitude of force coefficients is observed to be exceptionally insignificant 4 7 effect of wings rotation fig 10 a f shows the reflection coefficient k r fig 10a transmission coefficient k t fig 10b energy loss coefficient k l fig 10c horizontal force x fig 10d vertical force y fig 10e and moment m fig 10f versus dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h for various values of wings rotation θ the wings rotation angle causes several changes in the structural physical view for instance the wings rotation angle θ 0 represents the lengthy horizontal plate no wings wings rotation within 30 θ 60 delineates the inverted trapezoidal porous box partially open wings θ 90 outlines the wave scattering by the porous box of vertical edges vertical wings and wings rotation within 120 θ 150 illustrates the trapezoidal porous box partially closed wings this is an analogy to the opening of a cardboard box the structure is submerged and is not surface piercing further when θ 90 the top end tip of the wings skims the free surface for the given physical parameters the sporadic oscillatory nature is observed in the wave reflection pattern with an increase in the angle of wings rotation the no wings case shows very minimal wave reflection for the deep water waves and an increase in the wave reflection is observed with an increase in the wings rotation the optima of wave reflection and horizontal force is observed for vertical wings the partially closed wings delineate the moderate estimations of wave reflection and maximal wave transmission when contrasted with other combinations due to minimal wave trapping inside the porous box the optima of wave damping are observed for open wings when compared to results of partially closed wings the no wings show the zero horizontal force and vertical wings show the higher horizontal force the partially open and partially closed wings portray the moderate horizontal force which emphatically coincides with the statement reported by vijay et al 2020 the novel breakwater must effectively distribute the incident wave energy in the form of scattering coefficients and force coefficients and it is observed on account of the inverted trapezoidal breakwater partially open wings therefore the present study proposes that the porous box of no wings or vertical wings is unable to distribute the incident wave amplitude as compared with a porous box comprising of partially open wings breakwater having the angle of wings θ 30 and θ 60 shows practically indistinguishable measure of scattering and force coefficients thus the present study suggests the angle of wings within 30 θ 60 to secure the leeward coastal infrastructure from the destructive incident waves the vertical force coefficient and moment display identical pattern for change in dimensionless wavenumber and the 10 25 reduction of vertical force can be expected as compared with the moment for long waves intermediate and short period waves 4 8 contour plots of force coefficients fig 11 a d shows the horizontal force coefficient x experienced by a single porous box fig 11a two porous boxes fig 11b three porous boxes fig 11c and four porous boxes fig 11d for variable dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h and box porosity μ the test conditions are b h 1 0 d b 0 25 b c 0 40 θ 45 the zero minima of horizontal force coefficient x are observed for single and multiple porous boxes at k 0 h 1 2 the higher horizontal force coefficient is obtained for minimal porosity and higher porosity shows the minimal force coefficient almost identical values of horizontal force coefficient are observed for a single porous box and multiple porous boxes show the secondary peak in the intermediate wave zone k

porous boxes fig 12c and four porous boxes fig 12d for variable dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h and box porosity μ the increase in the number of porous boxes y displays the drastic changes in the vertical force coefficient pattern and zero minima of vertical force coefficient y are observed at k 0 h 1 2 for multiple porous boxes the single porous box shows a monotonic reduction of vertical force coefficient y for an increase in the dimensionless wavenumber the numerical results of horizontal force coefficient x fig 11 and vertical force coefficient y fig 12 are presented for a better understanding of the flow pattern 5 conclusions in the present study the surface gravity wave scattering by multiple inverted trapezoidal porous boxes is analyzed using the dual boundary element method dbem in the context of linear potential wave theory on the barriers continuity of velocity and pressure based on a non linear pressure drop is employed to account for the effect of wave height on the energy dissipation and the numerical solution is iteratively obtained apart from the engineering perspective the novelty of the present work lies in the method of solution dbem adopted in the present investigation the developed dbem code is validated with an independently developed multi domain boundary element method mbem code and also experimental results available in the literature parametric analysis is carried out and numerical results in the form of scattering and force coefficients are reported for various wave and structural conditions the bragg resonant reflection is observed at k 0 h 1 2 for a periodic array of inverted trapezoidal porous boxes and the corresponding wave transmission and force coefficients approach to zero minima overall the porous box with partially open wings shows significant wave constriction when compared to horizontal wings vertical wings and partially closed wings the optimal wave damping k l 0 95 is achieved with a pair of porous boxes for dimensionless wavenumber k 0 h 2 0 wings rotation θ 30 depth of box d h 0 25 center to center distance h c 0 25 and porous box width 0 66 b λ 1 for all the combinations of porosity thus the present study recommended a pair of porous boxes consisting of box porosity within 0 2 μ 0 3 and the angle of wings rotation 30 θ 60 along with a porous box width within 0 50 b λ 0 75 to secure the leeward coastal infrastructure from the intermediate and short period waves credit author contribution statement k g vijay conceptualization methodology software data curation formal analysis and

21217,an les large eddy simulation investigation at r e 8 1 0 4 has been conducted to predict the flow past a simplified frigate shape model at yaw of which the stern is analogous to a double backward facing step at 0 yaw the occurrence of a double bi stable flow configuration is recorded i e an asymmetrical flow topology is observed behind each step and the flow configuration at the flight deck top step is anti symmetrical as compared to the rear step even when the incoming flow is yawed with a small angle e g 2 5 the bi stable flow configuration is still present and the level of the asymmetry is increased at each step moreover the negative angle maintains the same flow configuration as what is shown at 0 yaw while the positive angle leads to the corresponding anti symmetrical flow configuration a larger yaw angle suppresses this asymmetrical flow topology on both steps to explore those asymmetrical phenomena a brief analysis and discussion are included for each case showing that the direction of the incoming flow and the length of each step are key parameters that characterise this double bi stable behaviour keywords bi stable air wakes generic ship les yaw effect double backward facing step 1 introduction recently the ship external flow which is characterised by massive separation reattachment and shear layer evolution from superstructures of a ship has been attracting researchers to study the air wakes above the deck principally to improve shipboard helicopter operations syms 2008 tinney and ukeiley 2009 forrest and owen 2010 herry 2010 herry et al 2011 kääriä et al 2013 bardera 2014 bardera and meseguer 2015 rahimpour and oshkai 2016 gallas et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 rao et al 2019 the first study that investigated this flow was conducted on a highly simplified ship geometry called sfs simple frigate shape model wilkinson et al 1998 reddy et al 2000 zan 2001 syms 2008 tinney and ukeiley 2009 bardera 2014 it was firstly developed as part of an international collaboration among canada australia the united kingdom and the united states attempting to evaluate the accuracy of cfd computational fluid dynamics codes when simulating complex air wakes wilkinson et al 1998 a series of wind tunnel experiments on the sfs model has been conducted by the aerodynamics laboratory al of the national research council in canada nrc wilkinson et al 1998 zan 2001 they used smoke and oil flow visualisations to describe the flow around the sfs and measured the surface pressure distributions for several wod wind over deck angles these data were collected using a 1 60 scale model in the nrc al 2 m 3 m closed circuit wind tunnel according to the surface flow visualisation at 0 yaw the wake structure on the flight deck tends to be symmetric after that bardera 2014 used several experimental techniques such as oil film visualisation piv particle image velocimetry and lda laser doppler anemometry to investigate the flow around a sfs in particular the flow pattern structure on flight deck the velocity distributions on both vertical and horizontal planes of the flight deck flow and point by point flow velocity and turbulence levels as a function of relative wind angle in a vertical line located in the centre of the flight deck were investigated in this case an asymmetric vortex structure in the mid lateral plane behind the superstructure was observed these experimental data were utilised as a benchmark to assess the flow prediction of a reduced scale ship model in wind tunnel tests and on board full scale measurements using a three component anemometer located in the centre of flight deck over a 5 m high mast full scale while the ship course was fixed numerical calculations using rans reddy et al 2000 wakefield et al 2002 and des zhao et al 2015 have also been conducted on this sfs model only showing a symmetric wake behaviour the sfs2 simple frigate shape 2 an updated version of the sfs with an elongated superstructure and a more realistic bow is a conceptual standard ship model that is often used to verify the capabilities of cfd codes for ship air wakes syms 2008 the initial wind tunnel tests to investigate the flow field of the sfs2 were also carried out at the nrc al hot film anemometers were used to obtain the u v and u w data consisting of mean velocities and turbulence intensities along a series of experimental grid maps over the sfs2 to monitor the unsteady velocities several points over the superstructure were set the 1 100 scale model was mounted on a turnable platform and a boundary layer suction device was employed to ensure a uniform incident velocity profile lee 2003 syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 an interesting observation was about the presence of an asymmetric distribution of the velocity profiles above the flight deck this asymmetry is also reproduced numerically by syms 2008 and zhang et al 2018 whereas it was not evidently predicted by forrest and owen 2010 and yuan et al 2018 the region behind the hangar and above the flight deck of a sfs2 model forms the top step while the stern forms the bottom step therefore the flow past the two steps is analogous to that of a 3 dimensional double backward facing step characterised by a large recirculation region behind each step with a horseshoe vortex and a pair of counter rotating vortices on each side of the recirculation region tinney and ukeiley 2009 herry 2010 bardera 2014 rao et al 2019 the asymmetric flow phenomenon of simplified ships was firstly observed by syms 2008 who suspected that the long and narrow bow of the sfs2 leads to the flow locking into one side of the bow recent wind tunnel tests focusing on a sfso model where the sfso is based on the sfs model without funnel and with a pyramid nose in the front showed that the asymmetric mean velocity profiles observed could owe to a bi stable flow herry 2010 herry et al 2011 which indicates the presence of two stable flow configurations which can be observed in the wake in different realisations herry 2010 found that the mean asymmetric flow in the mid lateral plane of the top step is characterised by two large vortices and several small size vortices one of the large vortices is located on one side whereas the other narrower and stretched is seen on the opposite side this flow was observed to switch randomly from one stable configuration to the other at 0 yaw angle in the same study it was also tested the yaw influence on this flow bi stability but only the top step flow was observed the latest study on this bi stable ship flow comes from the fluid dynamics group at chalmers university of technology zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 made a comparison of pans partially averaged navier stokes and les large eddy simulation of the flow past a generic ship showing the occurrence of the two stable flow configurations on the flight deck when a coarser or finer mesh was used to authors knowledge it was the first time that the two flow configurations captured in reduced scale model tests were observed in simulations although the switching behaviour was not shown in one single simulation furthermore they indicated that for the prediction of this bi stable ship flow a steady rans is not sufficient to obtain correct wake structures rao et al 2019 qualitatively analysed the bi stable configurations on both top and bottom steps on two grids previously used by zhang et al 2018 the velocity profiles and contours base pressure velocity and pressure iso surfaces and reynolds stress behind both steps were used to confirm the existence of the asymmetry in each flow configuration the flow structure at the flight deck top step was always anti symmetrical to that on the rear step and the two flow configurations found with two different meshes were anti symmetrical to each other furthermore to suppress the asymmetric flow topology on both steps they used a base cavity on the top step showing a successful suppression of the flow bi stable behaviour forcing the topology into a symmetrical state similar bi stable occurrences have also been observed in squareback bluff body flows such as the ahmed body grandemange et al 2013 2015 volpe et al 2015 and the ground transportation system gts model schmidt et al 2018 rao et al 2018 recently the first numerical work that shows the switching behaviour between two stable flow configurations was conducted by dalla longa et al 2019 on a squareback ahmed body it may be noted that for wind tunnel tests of ship models the minimum recommended reynolds number is 1 1 1 0 4 based on the model width bardera mora et al 2015 rahimpour and oshkai 2016 bardera mora et al 2016 and that the flow characteristics for several sharp edge bodies are invariant with reynolds numbers varying from 1 0 4 to 1 0 7 healey 1992 the upper limit reaches the realistic operating conditions of ships while the lower one is within the range of affordable numerical investigations thereby using well resolved les to study the flow past a ship becomes possible in the work conducted by forrest and owen 2010 it is further assumed that the flow over such a bluff body sfs2 consisting of rectangular surfaces and sharp edges is insensitive to the reynolds number so the flow topology at real r e can be replicated at lower r e the work in this paper particularly aims to follow up our previously published papers zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 where a detailed discussion on the bi stable behaviour at 0 yaw was conducted thereby the yaw effect on the bi stable ship flow is investigated here to understand the flow physics at r e 8 1 0 4 based on the width of the ship previous investigations have mainly focused on the flow characteristics at the flight deck at large yaw angles e g 45 syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 yuan et al 2018 in the latter the asymmetry was observed on the top step flight deck due to the asymmetric incoming flow however no detailed information of the flow characteristics on the bottom step stern was given whether the asymmetry is also found and is similar to that on the top step or not it is still unknown moreover a description of the flow for small yaw angle cases was not given here less are used to predict the ship flow at several small yaw angles 2 5 5 10 in order to give a clear understanding of the yaw effect on the bi stable flow configurations the paper is organised as follows in section 2 the methodology is briefly described section 3 introduces the results of each yaw case including pressure distributions velocity contours streamlines aerodynamic loads and local flow fields as well as bi stable configurations this is followed by conclusions in section 4 2 methodology three subsections are included here the geometry and numerics are firstly described secondly the validation is achieved last the post processing the definitions of aerodynamic force and pressure coefficients and the vortex visualisation technique are introduced 2 1 numerical set up a simplified ship model previously used in zhang et al 2018 and rao et al 2019 is used in this study as shown in fig 1 the model was originally introduced in the previous wind tunnel tests of bardera and meseguer 2015 all dimensions are normalised by the width w 0 15 m of the ship this ship model is generally used for the verification of cfd codes for ship air wakes the length of the bow is approximately three times the width while the length of the flight deck is twice the occurrence of bi stability has been confirmed in ahmed body flows with an aspect ratio width to height of 1 35 having in this case an aspect ratio of 1 29 it gives high chances to observe a similar bi stable phenomenon seeing the rear part of the ship two steps are formed the region behind the hangar and above the flight deck forms the top step while the stern forms the bottom step therefore the geometry can be reconducted to a simple double backward facing step tinney and ukeiley 2009 fig 2 a shows the computational domain where the ship model is fixed to the ground avoiding any clearance between the ship and the ground in order to find a balance between a low blockage ratio the frontal projected area of the ship to the cross sectional area of the computational domain and the size of mesh a cross sectional area of 10 w 10 w is used as the domain creating a blockage ratio of 1 21 the coordinate origin is shown in fig 1 for the simulations the front face inlet and two sides are all treated as inlet boundary conditions to be able to obtain different yaw angles a homogeneous neumann boundary condition was applied u i x i 0 at the outlet the surfaces of the body and the ground were treated as no slip walls the top is treated as symmetry to investigate the yaw effects the incoming flow is yawed at angles of α 2 5 5 10 with respect to the symmetry plane of the ship model as shown in fig 2 b it should be noted that the negative angle corresponds to the flow component towards the reverse direction of the y axis which is defined in fig 1 a commercial finite volume cfd solver avl fire avl 2014 2014 based on a cell centred finite volume approach was used to perform the les simulations based on the standard smagorinsky model this solver has successfully predicted several bluff body flows krajnović 2014 östh and krajnović 2014 minelli et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2018 thus it can be confidently used for this ship flow at yaw once a proper mesh resolution is achieved the physical time step for all cases normalised by the upstream velocity u and the ship width w is δ t 0 004 for each time step the maximum number of inner iterations performed is set to 10 which gives a normalised values for all residuals lower than 1 0 4 the simulation at 0 yaw is conducted for a total time t 192 which corresponds to approximately 4 3 flow passages through the domain and the averaging of the flow quantities starts at t 64 while for the yaw cases the simulations continued up to t 360 for each yaw angle after changing the inlet boundary conditions at t 192 the averaging of the flow started after one flow passage through the domain the aerodynamic force coefficients of the ship are also monitored and sampled during the averaging period for this generic ship model a hexahedral mesh was generated by the commercial grid generator software ansys icem cfd the o grid technique was used to concentrate most of the computational cells around the body so as to capture the flow structures close to the ship accurately and to reduce the cells far away from the walls to examine the effect of the grid resolution on the results three different grids were used the coarse medium and fine grids consisting of approximately 6 10 and 21 million cells respectively the grid resolution of the three grids is described in table 1 in zhang et al 2018 2 2 validation the program validation of the 0 yaw case has been achieved in zhang et al 2018 by making a comparison of time averaged streamwise velocities along two lateral lines downstream of the hangar at 25 and 50 length of the flight deck in the z 0 44 w plane obtained using les r e 8 1 0 4 and previous numerical simulations of forrest and owen 2010 r e 6 58 1 0 5 and syms 2008 r e 5 59 1 0 5 and experiments of the aerodynamics laboratory al of the national research council canada nrc r e 5 59 1 0 5 as discussed in zhang et al 2018 although the reynolds numbers are not identical the comparison is qualitative to show the similar trend of the asymmetry the quantitative difference between numerical and experimental data can ascribe to the location of the funnel which is not consistent see the model in fig 1 and the geometry in syms 2008 also the study of numerical errors and the effect of residuals at 0 yaw have been conducted the iterative error was calculated at residual values of 1 0 4 and 1 0 5 as mentioned in 3 iterations the residual values were found to be below 1 0 4 thus at the residual value of 1 0 4 although the maximum number of iterations is 10 only 3 iterations are performed at a time step if 10 iterations are required to be performed the best way is to enhance the convergence criterion of the residual value e g 1 0 5 the statistical error is obtained by the standard deviation σ values of drag and lift forces the discretisation error was also included in table 2 in zhang et al 2018 which is less than 2 according to the analysis of those results the medium and fine meshes both have adequately resolved the air wake at 0 yaw after carefully comparing the results on the three meshes and having computing resources available the fine mesh is finally chosen for further analysis 2 3 post processing 2 3 1 normalised coefficients the aerodynamic drag lift and side forces are key factors to assess the aerodynamic performance of the ship cruising on the sea at yaw thus to make the comparison more convenient these forces are normalised as below 1 c x f x 0 5 ρ u 2 a c y f y 0 5 ρ u 2 a c z f z 0 5 ρ u 2 a where f x f y and f z are the mean drag force side force and lift force respectively here a is the frontal cross sectional area without considering the funnel the pressure coefficient is defined as 2 c p p p r e f 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the absolute pressure p r e f is the reference pressure of the undisturbed flow field and ρ is the constant density of air which is 1 18858 kg m 3 2 3 2 vortex visualisation technique the q criterion the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor is used for the identification of vortices an iso surface with positive q reveals locations in the flow where the strength of the rotation overcomes the strain thus indicating vortical structures hunt et al 1988 this criterion also adds a secondary condition on the pressure requiring local pressure lower than ambient pressure in the vortex for an incompressible flow the q can be defined as 3 q 1 2 u i x j u j x i 1 2 s i j s i j ω i j ω i j where s i j and ω i j are the symmetric and anti symmetric parts of the resolved velocity gradient tensor note that the q represents the local balance between shear strain rate and vorticity magnitude defining vortices as regions where the vorticity magnitude is greater than the magnitude of rate of strain 3 results and discussion the results for each yaw case are presented and discussed herein with particular attention on the pressure distributions velocity contours streamlines q criterion vorticity magnitude turbulence kinetic energy and aerodynamic loads in the section of mean flows the 0 yaw flow condition is presented and discussed at first followed by 2 5 5 and at last 10 yaw angles in instantaneous flows the q criterion and vorticity are shown at all yaw cases turbulence kinetic energy including the unresolved and total turbulence kinetic energy is also compared in the final subsection the aerodynamic forces as well as asymmetrical characteristics for all cases are listed in tables to show the global yaw effect 3 1 mean flows 3 1 1 0 yaw the flow characteristics of the ship at 0 yaw have been analysed in detail in the previously mentioned papers zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 therefore a brief introduction is brought in to remind the readers of the double bi stable behaviour and to conveniently make a comparison with other yaw cases fig 3 shows the time averaged air wakes of the ship for the top step formed by the region behind the hangar and above the flight deck the pressure is generally lower than that on the bottom step which is the region behind the stern two distinct pressure regions are observed on the vertical base surfaces of each step those regions are highly dependent on the location and shapes of vortices as shown in fig 3 d the large triangular vortex close to the base directly affects the base pressure nevertheless the lower pressure region tends to be smaller than the higher pressure area on each step this asymmetrical flow topology is more clear when illustrated by the iso surfaces of the mean pressure coefficient c p 0 2 and 0 12 for the top and bottom steps respectively as shown in fig 3 b and the time averaged streamwise velocity contour in the lateral mid plane as presented in fig 3 c behind each step with regard to the iso surface of c p a half torus or a so called horseshoe vortex is observed on the top step which is similar to the wake structure of a cube mounted on the ground the absence of underbody incoming flow prevents the formation of a full torus shape as visualised for ahmed body flows lucas et al 2017 in fig 3 c the core region of the low velocity blue colour locates at the upper part of the image on the top step while for the bottom step it lies on the opposite side it is highly interesting to note that in this flow configuration the flow topology at the flight deck top step is generally anti symmetrical to the rear step to identify this asymmetrical flow topology in a clearer way fig 3 d shows the time averaged streamlines projected on two x y planes behind each step this figure indicates that the mean asymmetric flow is characterised by two large vortices in each plane for example at the top step the narrow and stretched vortex is located on the upper side of the image whereas the large triangular one is visualised on the lower side here the authors would like to remind the reader that this flow state can change randomly to the other side in an anti symmetric fashion zhang et al 2018 regarding to this so called bi stable phenomenon there is no clear evidence to show what triggers it the asymmetric distribution of the velocity profiles presented in the wake was probably first observed by syms 2008 who studied the velocity fields above the deck for verifying cfd codes for ship air wakes and supposed that the flow is locked on one side of the ship however no more detailed explanation is illustrated in the work herry 2010 by means of wind tunnel experiments was probably the first researcher to investigate the behaviour of this bi stability in the ship wake his strategy was to place a splitter plate or a small winglet or a cylinder at different locations around the ship rear such as on the side of the hangar behind the second step and adjacent to the region where the streamwise vortices develop generally the small add on showed little effect on the flow asymmetry on the top step when the splitter plate was vertically set behind the bottom step this confirmed that the bi stable behaviour on the second step has little influence on the asymmetrical flow topology observed on the top step therefore the strategy to control the streamwise vortices was to modify the origin or the end of the vortex it was concluded that strengthening the intensity of the vortex from its origin by placing a horizontal splitter plate adjacent to the top step or fixing a cylinder on the lateral wall upstream the top step would delay the occurrence of bi stable phenomenon to a larger yaw angle whereas using a smaller winglet set with an angle of attack to generate a countering vortex will advance this occurrence to a small opposite yaw angle despite this it is not yet clear the formation process and the causes of the asymmetric behaviour therefore after this brief description an attempt to explore the reason behind this phenomenon is proposed using both averaged and instantaneous quantities fig 4 shows the mean c p along three pairs of lines located at the top step s mid height z 0 22 w l 1 at the bottom step s mid height z 0 165 w l 2 on the lateral walls and on the top of the superstructure at 1 4 y 0 25 w and 3 4 y 0 25 w l t o p of the ship width as illustrated in fig 4 a the lines on the sides of the model are used to check if the lateral local mean static pressure distributions are different the top ones are used to determine the discrepancy of mean pressure in the two halves cut by the symmetry plane when x 2 0 w the mean c p hardly shows differences between each of the three pairs indicating that the incoming static pressure is symmetrical this might also indicate that the proposed length of the superstructure l s u p e r s t r u c t u r e 2 0 w is the required minimum length to observe the occurrence of a bi stable flow topology on the top step anyway a careful study of the influence of this parameter is currently under investigation and goes beyond the scope of this paper after x w 2 0 the discrepancies start to increase as shown in the close up located at the right corner of fig 4 b reaching their maxima at the rear of each step it should be noted that a cross point where the pressure on each side is equal is observed for the pressure along l 2 and l t o p respectively regarding to the flow configuration shown in fig 3 the pressure at the y 0 side is lower than at the y 0 side for the top step which is also confirmed by the c p at the end of the superstructure proceeding along l 2 the pressure on the y 0 side increases becoming larger than that on the y 0 side at round x 0 5 w while on the stern it shows a much larger value consequently an opposite behaviour is observed and this relates well to the flow configuration on the top step visualised in fig 3 the qualitative and quantitative analysis of velocity fields at various cross sections could explain why these pressure profiles show such trends fig 5 qualitatively shows the time averaged streamwise velocity contours around the ship with 2 dimensional belts of 0 13 w five sections are selected along the x direction and the belts are decomposed in right y 0 side left y 0 side and top parts to quantify the discrepancy between two sides a spatial mean approach is adopted to obtain the mean values of the areas shown in fig 5 the spatial mean of the velocity is computed by summing the product of the area of each element by the value of the u u taken at the centroid of the element nodal variables are interpolated at each cell centroid using cell shape blending or metric functions for each element over the entire part the final sum is then divided by the total area of the part as follows 4 s p a t i a l m e a n σ u i a i σ a i where u i is the normalised time averaged streamwise velocity taken at centroid of element i a i is the area of element i using this spatial mean approach the mean values for the belt parts around the superstructure and the deck are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively a sketch of the velocity around the ship is shown in fig 6 it should be mentioned that the mean values of rear u p p e r shown in a rectangle with yellow dashed lines in fig 5 is added in table 1 to understand the effect of the incoming flow on the structure on the top step generally the mean u u plots shows inverse trends compared to those of the mean c p plots a 2 3 difference of u u between the y 0 and y 0 sides in the rear side of the flow around the superstructure and a 4 1 difference for the incoming flow of the top step are obtained as shown in figs 6 and 7 a whereas no differences are observed in the front and the middle sections this indicates that the minimum length of the superstructure should be guaranteed so as to observe this asymmetrical flow topology as to the top at the beginning front the flow is symmetrical with a 0 0 difference between the two halves subsequently a switch from positive to negative values appears between the middle and the rear belts as a result more flux flows towards the y 0 side of the deck from the top and the y 0 side of the superstructure because of this flux a difference up to 41 8 between the two halves on the top of the deck is observed this downwash flow showing a difference of 7 3 table 2 at the edge of the stern travels towards the y 0 side in the wake and it seems to restrict the velocity of the corresponding side flow resulting in a higher velocity at the other side y 0 as shown in figs 6 and 7 b note that for the flow topology on the top step the flux from both sides and the top has an equal effect as listed in table 1 however on the bottom step the downwash flow from the deck plays a dominant role in the flow configuration as presented in table 2 fig 7 shows the time averaged streamwise velocity distributions of belts at the end of each step to present the difference clearly a different colourmap is used the smaller mean u u values in tables 1 and 2 correspond to lower velocity contours in particular in the regions close to the walls of the ship it should be noted that grandemange et al 2013 investigated the bi stability in the turbulent wake past parallelepiped bodies at various aspect ratios and wall effects and then concluded that both the ground clearance and the cross section aspect ratio have a critical impact on these bi stable phenomena with regard to this ship flow only the aspect ratio remains the key parameter for the asymmetry in the wake prevezer et al 2002 investigated with cfd and wind tunnel tests the effect of the aspect ratio on the flow behind a bluff fronted lorry to verify whether the asymmetric flow phenomenon truly exists or it is just an artefact induced by the cfd solvers they concluded that the asymmetry may be the natural flow feature of this geometry and dependent on the aspect ratio to be noticed is that the asymmetrical distribution is shown by prevezer et al 2002 in an analogous 3d double forward facing step which is different from what discussed in this paper but it was probably the first attempt to explain a similar asymmetrical phenomenon 3 1 2 2 5 yaw according to the investigation of herry 2010 when the yaw angle α varies in a small range 5 5 the bi stable flow configuration on the top step could switch from one state to the other however no more details about the flow topology on the bottom step were mentioned therefore in this section the results for the ship at small yaw angles are presented to verify if the double asymmetrical phenomenon is still observed on both steps the next section 3 1 3 will focus on the analysis of the effects of larger yaw angles 5 and 10 which has not been investigated in experiments or simulations before fig 8 shows two flow configurations at 2 5 yaw it is interesting to observe that the asymmetrical distributions appear behind both steps in addition the flow configuration at 2 5 is highly anti symmetrical to that at 2 5 compared to the asymmetry at 0 yaw a slight yaw angle of the incoming flow strengthens the asymmetrical distributions on both steps this is closely shown by the mean pressure coefficient on the base surfaces fig 8 a b in particular the regions with lower pressure are enlarged due to either the large triangular vortex moving closer to the base and becoming bigger or the narrow stretched vortex shifting away and reducing its size as illustrated in fig 8 g h the corresponding quantitative results are listed in table 8 of section 3 4 2 the iso surfaces of the mean c p around the top and bottom steps are shown in fig 8 c d and the time averaged streamwise velocity contours in the lateral mid planes behind each step are presented in fig 8 e f a small yaw angle contributes to the formation of a large volume delimited by the same iso value when compared to the 0 yaw case with regard to the time averaged streamwise velocity contours the tail white colour region where u u is approximately 0 4 of the wake is more stretched on the top step than on the bottom one indicating that the level of asymmetry on the top step is stronger than the bottom let us recall the spatial mean values of u u in table 1 at 0 yaw more flux comes from the y 0 side for the top step here the 2 5 yaw case shows a similar flow configuration to that of the 0 yaw case however this negative yaw angle leads to more flux impacting on the y 0 side of the ship model the same approach adopted in the 0 yaw case also will be used to extract the data on the top step to determine what happens at this 2 5 yaw as well as for the 2 5 yaw case the spatial mean values of u u in the corresponding three belts at 2 5 yaw are included in table 3 and for the bottom step the results are listed in table 4 similar to the wakes of other bluff bodies when the incoming flow is yawed at a certain angle an asymmetrical flow distribution is observed on the top step which is a typical wake flow at yaw this is because more flux comes from the windward side of the ship as presented in table 3 however this phenomenon is in contradiction to what has been concluded for the 0 yaw case it should be noted that the discrepancies at 2 5 yaw are slightly larger as compared to the 2 5 yaw case probably indicating that in this case the switching point where the flow configuration changes to the other one is a very small negative angle this has been confirmed by the experimental work of herry 2010 as to the bottom step affected by the boundary layers on the ground and the asymmetrical flow distribution on the deck of the ship the small yaw angles delays the reverse of the difference between two sides in the mean u u at 0 yaw the switching point is originally located around the forebody of the deck while at 2 5 yaw the point moves close to the middle which probably indicates that the length of the deck plays a significant role in this asymmetrical flow topology therefore smaller discrepancies between the left and right sides are created at the rear but the asymmetry is still observed ascribing to the stronger strength of the asymmetry on the top step more downwash flow comes towards the y 0 side of the bottom step as listed in 4 3 1 3 5 and 10 yaw the results for the ship at larger yaw angles of 5 and 10 are presented in this section similar to the previous sections the time averaged air wakes of the ship at 5 and 10 yaw are shown in fig 9 to see how the large yaw angle affects the double asymmetrical distributions on both steps the general observation is that two distinct regions with different pressure values are shown on the base surface of the top step as shown in fig 9 a b and a larger yaw angle contributes to a larger low pressure region concerning the bottom step the large yaw angles weaken this asymmetrical flow topology which is evident at smaller angles and 0 yaw and the global surface pressure is also decreased note that the middle region is dominated by a slightly higher pressure and the two adjacent regions show lower pressure values as presented in fig 9 a b this distribution probably indicates an approximately symmetrical structure as what has been previously reported by rao et al 2019 who observed a lower pressure dominating the middle region with two adjacent regions of higher pressure after incorporating a base cavity on the top step this conclusion is basically confirmed by fig 9 c d and g h although the regions within lower pressure are enlarged on the top step the level of the asymmetry is not strengthened see table 8 of section 3 4 2 this is because the flow at a large angle suppresses the stretched vortex close to the base and enlarges the big triangular vortex which forms at the other side as illustrated in fig 9 g h as compared to the vortices shown at small yaw angles perhaps more attention is needed to fig 9 e f as the tail white colour in each lateral plane shows the same trends which is highly different from those at smaller yaw angles to quantitatively analyse it the spatial mean approach is also utilised in this section the results are listed in tables 5 and 6 in general a larger yaw angle promotes a larger difference of the mean u u in side belts as compared with small 2 5 yaw angles referring to what has been mentioned in section 3 1 2 at small yaw angles the asymmetrical flow distribution on the top step is the inherent of the wake flow at yaw however affected by the funnel the velocity differences over the top of the superstructure does not follow the trend that the windward side shows with the increase of the angle this switching point defined as where the difference changes from a positive value to a negative value moves from the rear of the superstructure to its middle part here the focus is on the yaw effect so the influence of the funnel will be included and discussed in the future study which shows a further exploration on how the upstream conditions could affect the bi stable behaviour regarding the bottom step the trends are similar to those on the top step i e more flux impacts the windward side and the velocity differences increases with the yaw angle at the corresponding cross section but if the attention is paid to the velocity in the deck region the differences reduce this probably depends on the intensity of the asymmetry on the top step as shown in fig 9 and table 8 more flux coming from one side and more uniform flux coming from the top contribute to an approximately symmetrical structure behind the bottom step as shown in fig 9 g h 3 2 instantaneous flows 3 2 1 q criterion to further compare the flow structures for all yaw cases studied the instantaneous and time averaged iso surfaces of q criterion are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the les using a fine mesh well resolves those tiny scale structures and predicts the separated flow regions on the top of the bridge and in the wake of the ship as shown in fig 10 this indicates that the grid resolution around the ship is sufficient at a larger yaw angle a larger separated flow region v1 is observed on the windward side of the bow whereas a smaller region v2 is found on the leeward side as compared to those at 0 and small yaw angles the yaw effect triggers an upstream vortex v3 starting at the tip of the bow but this vortex is not clearly observed at 0 yaw in fig 10 a moreover the yaw angle suppresses the flow separation which is induced by the windward front vertical edge of the superstructure but it promotes a larger separation on the leeward side to explore those vortices clearly the time averaged iso surfaces of q criterion are shown in fig 11 two series of vortices vt1 and vt2 are generated at the tip of the bow at 0 yaw both are symmetrical to each other however at yaw the upstream vortex vt1 tends to be longer and stronger than the downstream one vt2 with the increase of the yaw angle this trend on the leeward side vt3 as well as in the wake vt4 of the ship becomes more evident the flow structure in the 2 5 yaw case is anti symmetrical to that is observed in the 2 5 yaw case 3 2 2 vorticity in order to observe the coherent structures around the ship model and identify the regions of smooth and turbulent flows the vorticity component ω x in the symmetry planes and mid lateral planes at z 0 22 w for all yaw cases are visualised in figs 12 and 13 the smooth incoming flow tends to become turbulent due to the front sharp edges e g the tip of the bow of the generic ship massive separations originating from these edges develop towards the rear leading to high turbulent wake therefore it is not difficult to distinguish where the smooth and turbulent flows are both figures show highly turbulent flow structures around this generic ship model as shown in fig 12 with the increase of the yaw angle the vortex region on the bow of the ship becomes larger while the corresponding region on the top of the superstructure is reduced this phenomenon is significantly observed in fig 10 in the wake the vortex region tends to be suppressed by the yawed flow in fig 13 the vortex distribution around the ship model at 0 yaw is generally symmetrical at a larger yaw angle more vortices are observed in the leeward region and in the wake of the ship however when the angle increases but less than 10 a bit more vortices are also seen in the windward side at 10 yaw those vortices are compressed close to the windward ship surfaces 3 3 turbulence kinetic energy figs 14 and 15 show the unresolved turbulence kinetic energy k u and total turbulence kinetic energy k t o t a l in the symmetry planes for all yaw cases which is always used to examine the capability of the numerical method to resolve the flow the k u is computed from the expression for the smagorinsky model as k u k s g s c s δ s 2 0 3 krajnović et al 2012 according to the instantaneous and time averaged unresolved turbulence kinetic energy k u contours in fig 14 the unresolved regions locate on the front top of the superstructure on the top of the funnel and in the near wake of the funnel this is because of the speed up effect of the flow over them it should be noted that the unresolved region in the near wake of the funnel is affected by the yaw angle at 10 yaw the region is the largest as compared to the other yaw cases this could be ascribed to more flow passing through it in the wake the flow is resolved well with low values of k u the distributions of the instantaneous turbulence kinetic energy k t o t a l in fig 15 is consistent with those in fig 12 confirming that the turbulence kinetic energy comes from the vortices seeing the time averaged k t o t a l contours at a larger angle a larger region with high turbulence kinetic energy is observed figs 16 and 17 show the unresolved turbulence kinetic energy k u and total turbulence kinetic energy k t o t a l in the lateral mid planes for all yaw cases the unresolved regions occur around the front side of the superstructure and in the wake region with evident shear layers which are not clearly shown in fig 13 the unresolved upstream regions tend to reduce while they increase in the wake with the increase of yaw angles the yawed flow could reduce the unresolved region in the windward side whereas an unresolved region is created in front of the superstructure in fig 16 the shear layers evolve from the side of the hanger showing a significant asymmetry which contributes to the orientation of the wake in fig 17 the distributions of k t o t a l is consistent with that in fig 13 seeing the time averaged k t o t a l contours at a larger angle a larger region with high turbulence kinetic energy is observed less than 10 the separation from the windward edge of the superstructure tries to emerge into the leeward vortex region so it grows with the yaw angle at 10 yaw case it finally emerges into the leeward vortex region and the corresponding separation region in the windward side reduces significantly 3 4 global and local quantities 3 4 1 aerodynamic forces the global quantities time averaged aerodynamic forces and corresponding standard deviation σ values for all cases studied in the present work are listed in table 7 here the time histories of forces are not plotted and these details can be found in zhang et al 2018 the contribution of the bi stable behaviour to the aerodynamic forces is not obvious the variations of all forces are highly dependent on the yaw angle the c x increases with the yaw angle up to 5 followed with slight decrease overall the variation is in the range of 0 7 0 8 the c y and c z experienced by the ship model increase significantly at a larger yaw angle in particular for the c y when the angle increases twice the c y nearly increases with the same factor therefore the c y is highly dependent on the yaw angle the c z at 10 yaw reaches approximately 2 times the value recorded at 0 at 0 yaw the c y is a small negative value indicating that the ship experiences a larger pressure load on the y 0 side for the 2 5 yaw cases the absolute force coefficients are very similar the 0 yaw and 2 5 yaw cases show a similar asymmetry regarding the standard deviation values the σ c y is the largest of all three variables ascribing to the bi stable behaviour which contributes to the asymmetrical flow topology the σ c x changes between 0 0146 and 0 0175 at α 5 while at 10 yaw it suddenly increases up to 0 0266 as to the σ c z it is around 0 023 for all cases this means that it is affected by neither the yaw angle nor the bi stable behaviour 3 4 2 asymmetrical characteristics the inclined angles β and γ defined as the angle between the lateral width direction and the line connecting the centres of the two vortices on each step are used to quantify the level of asymmetry as illustrated in fig 18 to simplify the comparison only the absolute values without considering the angle direction are listed in table 8 these data confirm what has been concluded in section 3 based on the surface pressure distributions velocity contours and streamlines the general observation is that the flow shows a stronger level of asymmetry on the top step than on the rear step for each case a small yaw angle could contribute to increasing the strength of the asymmetry however at a larger one the inclined angles β and γ decrease quickly indicating the asymmetry is significantly suppressed at 0 yaw β is nearly twice of γ whereas at 2 5 yaw both angles increase in a similar way it is interesting to observe that the inclined angles β and γ are a little larger at 2 5 than at 2 5 therefore it can be concluded that the 0 is not the switching point for this bi stable behaviour changing from one flow state to the other supposed that the inclined angle tends to a linear distribution in the range of 2 5 2 5 so interpreted angles for the switching point are obtained at 0 5 for the top step and 0 2 for the bottom step in the work conducted by herry 2010 the angle is about 0 2 where the ship geometry is the sfso which is based on the sfs1 model without funnel and with a pyramid nose in the front at 5 yaw β reduces to 14 3 and γ reduces to 1 1 showing an approximately symmetrical wake flow when the flow is yawed at a larger angle β reduces a little but γ increases this increase is probably caused by the coupled effect of the flux coming from the sides and the top of the deck and a brief explanation can be found in section 3 1 3 4 conclusions the yaw effect on the bi stable air wakes of a generic ship model was investigated by using well resolved large eddy simulations the reynolds number is r e 8 1 0 4 based on the width of the ship and the velocity of the incoming flow this model is representative of a ship geometry with a bow in the front and a double step at the rear therefore the flow past the rear steps could be analogous to that of a 3 dimensional double backward facing step according to previous studies syms 2008 zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 this symmetrical geometry with an aspect ratio width height of 1 29 contributes to the occurrence of double bi stable flow configurations at 0 yaw behind each step the asymmetrical flow topology is observed and both are anti symmetrical to each other to explore this phenomenon local quantities such as surface pressure profiles base pressure iso surfaces of pressure velocity contours streamlines and spatial mean streamwise velocity were used to give a detailed explanation the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the differential flux coming from the y 0 and y 0 sides of the ship in the lateral direction could trigger the bi stable flow behaviour in the wake 2 minimum lengths could be required for the superstructure and the deck to create the double bi stable flow configurations this needs to be verified with future simulations 3 the direction of the incoming flow shows an effect on the double bi stable behaviour when the ship is subjected to a small angle e g 2 5 these double bi stable configurations still appear behind each step and the level of the asymmetry is strengthened moreover using opposite yaw angles two flow states are clearly observed the 2 5 yaw case maintains the same flow topology as what is shown at 0 yaw while the 2 5 yaw case leads to an anti symmetrical flow configuration evaluating the angles β and γ at 2 5 yaw 0 seems not to be the switching point for the bi stable configuration this aspect would require a deeper investigation using dynamic simulations to verify the asymmetrical behaviour while continuously changing the yaw angle furthermore at a larger yaw angle the asymmetry on each step is suppressed in particular for the bottom step 4 the global aerodynamic forces of all cases are highly dependent on the yaw angle the c x first increases with the yaw angle up to 5 and then it decreases up to 10 the c y and c z in particular for the c y increase a lot at a larger yaw angle with regard to the standard deviation values the σ c y is the largest in all three variables ascribing to the bi stable behaviour neither the yaw angle nor the bi stable behaviour plays a dominant role in the standard deviation values of lift forces future studies will also attempt to verify the length effects of the bow the superstructure and the deck on the double bi stable configurations to present a clearer understanding of this representative ship flow credit authorship contribution statement jie zhang

21217,an les large eddy simulation investigation at r e 8 1 0 4 has been conducted to predict the flow past a simplified frigate shape model at yaw of which the stern is analogous to a double backward facing step at 0 yaw the occurrence of a double bi stable flow configuration is recorded i e an asymmetrical flow topology is observed behind each step and the flow configuration at the flight deck top step is anti symmetrical as compared to the rear step even when the incoming flow is yawed with a small angle e g 2 5 the bi stable flow configuration is still present and the level of the asymmetry is increased at each step moreover the negative angle maintains the same flow configuration as what is shown at 0 yaw while the positive angle leads to the corresponding anti symmetrical flow configuration a larger yaw angle suppresses this asymmetrical flow topology on both steps to explore those asymmetrical phenomena a brief analysis and discussion are included for each case showing that the direction of the incoming flow and the length of each step are key parameters that characterise this double bi stable behaviour keywords bi stable air wakes generic ship les yaw effect double backward facing step 1 introduction recently the ship external flow which is characterised by massive separation reattachment and shear layer evolution from superstructures of a ship has been attracting researchers to study the air wakes above the deck principally to improve shipboard helicopter operations syms 2008 tinney and ukeiley 2009 forrest and owen 2010 herry 2010 herry et al 2011 kääriä et al 2013 bardera 2014 bardera and meseguer 2015 rahimpour and oshkai 2016 gallas et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 rao et al 2019 the first study that investigated this flow was conducted on a highly simplified ship geometry called sfs simple frigate shape model wilkinson et al 1998 reddy et al 2000 zan 2001 syms 2008 tinney and ukeiley 2009 bardera 2014 it was firstly developed as part of an international collaboration among canada australia the united kingdom and the united states attempting to evaluate the accuracy of cfd computational fluid dynamics codes when simulating complex air wakes wilkinson et al 1998 a series of wind tunnel experiments on the sfs model has been conducted by the aerodynamics laboratory al of the national research council in canada nrc wilkinson et al 1998 zan 2001 they used smoke and oil flow visualisations to describe the flow around the sfs and measured the surface pressure distributions for several wod wind over deck angles these data were collected using a 1 60 scale model in the nrc al 2 m 3 m closed circuit wind tunnel according to the surface flow visualisation at 0 yaw the wake structure on the flight deck tends to be symmetric after that bardera 2014 used several experimental techniques such as oil film visualisation piv particle image velocimetry and lda laser doppler anemometry to investigate the flow around a sfs in particular the flow pattern structure on flight deck the velocity distributions on both vertical and horizontal planes of the flight deck flow and point by point flow velocity and turbulence levels as a function of relative wind angle in a vertical line located in the centre of the flight deck were investigated in this case an asymmetric vortex structure in the mid lateral plane behind the superstructure was observed these experimental data were utilised as a benchmark to assess the flow prediction of a reduced scale ship model in wind tunnel tests and on board full scale measurements using a three component anemometer located in the centre of flight deck over a 5 m high mast full scale while the ship course was fixed numerical calculations using rans reddy et al 2000 wakefield et al 2002 and des zhao et al 2015 have also been conducted on this sfs model only showing a symmetric wake behaviour the sfs2 simple frigate shape 2 an updated version of the sfs with an elongated superstructure and a more realistic bow is a conceptual standard ship model that is often used to verify the capabilities of cfd codes for ship air wakes syms 2008 the initial wind tunnel tests to investigate the flow field of the sfs2 were also carried out at the nrc al hot film anemometers were used to obtain the u v and u w data consisting of mean velocities and turbulence intensities along a series of experimental grid maps over the sfs2 to monitor the unsteady velocities several points over the superstructure were set the 1 100 scale model was mounted on a turnable platform and a boundary layer suction device was employed to ensure a uniform incident velocity profile lee 2003 syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 an interesting observation was about the presence of an asymmetric distribution of the velocity profiles above the flight deck this asymmetry is also reproduced numerically by syms 2008 and zhang et al 2018 whereas it was not evidently predicted by forrest and owen 2010 and yuan et al 2018 the region behind the hangar and above the flight deck of a sfs2 model forms the top step while the stern forms the bottom step therefore the flow past the two steps is analogous to that of a 3 dimensional double backward facing step characterised by a large recirculation region behind each step with a horseshoe vortex and a pair of counter rotating vortices on each side of the recirculation region tinney and ukeiley 2009 herry 2010 bardera 2014 rao et al 2019 the asymmetric flow phenomenon of simplified ships was firstly observed by syms 2008 who suspected that the long and narrow bow of the sfs2 leads to the flow locking into one side of the bow recent wind tunnel tests focusing on a sfso model where the sfso is based on the sfs model without funnel and with a pyramid nose in the front showed that the asymmetric mean velocity profiles observed could owe to a bi stable flow herry 2010 herry et al 2011 which indicates the presence of two stable flow configurations which can be observed in the wake in different realisations herry 2010 found that the mean asymmetric flow in the mid lateral plane of the top step is characterised by two large vortices and several small size vortices one of the large vortices is located on one side whereas the other narrower and stretched is seen on the opposite side this flow was observed to switch randomly from one stable configuration to the other at 0 yaw angle in the same study it was also tested the yaw influence on this flow bi stability but only the top step flow was observed the latest study on this bi stable ship flow comes from the fluid dynamics group at chalmers university of technology zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 made a comparison of pans partially averaged navier stokes and les large eddy simulation of the flow past a generic ship showing the occurrence of the two stable flow configurations on the flight deck when a coarser or finer mesh was used to authors knowledge it was the first time that the two flow configurations captured in reduced scale model tests were observed in simulations although the switching behaviour was not shown in one single simulation furthermore they indicated that for the prediction of this bi stable ship flow a steady rans is not sufficient to obtain correct wake structures rao et al 2019 qualitatively analysed the bi stable configurations on both top and bottom steps on two grids previously used by zhang et al 2018 the velocity profiles and contours base pressure velocity and pressure iso surfaces and reynolds stress behind both steps were used to confirm the existence of the asymmetry in each flow configuration the flow structure at the flight deck top step was always anti symmetrical to that on the rear step and the two flow configurations found with two different meshes were anti symmetrical to each other furthermore to suppress the asymmetric flow topology on both steps they used a base cavity on the top step showing a successful suppression of the flow bi stable behaviour forcing the topology into a symmetrical state similar bi stable occurrences have also been observed in squareback bluff body flows such as the ahmed body grandemange et al 2013 2015 volpe et al 2015 and the ground transportation system gts model schmidt et al 2018 rao et al 2018 recently the first numerical work that shows the switching behaviour between two stable flow configurations was conducted by dalla longa et al 2019 on a squareback ahmed body it may be noted that for wind tunnel tests of ship models the minimum recommended reynolds number is 1 1 1 0 4 based on the model width bardera mora et al 2015 rahimpour and oshkai 2016 bardera mora et al 2016 and that the flow characteristics for several sharp edge bodies are invariant with reynolds numbers varying from 1 0 4 to 1 0 7 healey 1992 the upper limit reaches the realistic operating conditions of ships while the lower one is within the range of affordable numerical investigations thereby using well resolved les to study the flow past a ship becomes possible in the work conducted by forrest and owen 2010 it is further assumed that the flow over such a bluff body sfs2 consisting of rectangular surfaces and sharp edges is insensitive to the reynolds number so the flow topology at real r e can be replicated at lower r e the work in this paper particularly aims to follow up our previously published papers zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 where a detailed discussion on the bi stable behaviour at 0 yaw was conducted thereby the yaw effect on the bi stable ship flow is investigated here to understand the flow physics at r e 8 1 0 4 based on the width of the ship previous investigations have mainly focused on the flow characteristics at the flight deck at large yaw angles e g 45 syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 yuan et al 2018 in the latter the asymmetry was observed on the top step flight deck due to the asymmetric incoming flow however no detailed information of the flow characteristics on the bottom step stern was given whether the asymmetry is also found and is similar to that on the top step or not it is still unknown moreover a description of the flow for small yaw angle cases was not given here less are used to predict the ship flow at several small yaw angles 2 5 5 10 in order to give a clear understanding of the yaw effect on the bi stable flow configurations the paper is organised as follows in section 2 the methodology is briefly described section 3 introduces the results of each yaw case including pressure distributions velocity contours streamlines aerodynamic loads and local flow fields as well as bi stable configurations this is followed by conclusions in section 4 2 methodology three subsections are included here the geometry and numerics are firstly described secondly the validation is achieved last the post processing the definitions of aerodynamic force and pressure coefficients and the vortex visualisation technique are introduced 2 1 numerical set up a simplified ship model previously used in zhang et al 2018 and rao et al 2019 is used in this study as shown in fig 1 the model was originally introduced in the previous wind tunnel tests of bardera and meseguer 2015 all dimensions are normalised by the width w 0 15 m of the ship this ship model is generally used for the verification of cfd codes for ship air wakes the length of the bow is approximately three times the width while the length of the flight deck is twice the occurrence of bi stability has been confirmed in ahmed body flows with an aspect ratio width to height of 1 35 having in this case an aspect ratio of 1 29 it gives high chances to observe a similar bi stable phenomenon seeing the rear part of the ship two steps are formed the region behind the hangar and above the flight deck forms the top step while the stern forms the bottom step therefore the geometry can be reconducted to a simple double backward facing step tinney and ukeiley 2009 fig 2 a shows the computational domain where the ship model is fixed to the ground avoiding any clearance between the ship and the ground in order to find a balance between a low blockage ratio the frontal projected area of the ship to the cross sectional area of the computational domain and the size of mesh a cross sectional area of 10 w 10 w is used as the domain creating a blockage ratio of 1 21 the coordinate origin is shown in fig 1 for the simulations the front face inlet and two sides are all treated as inlet boundary conditions to be able to obtain different yaw angles a homogeneous neumann boundary condition was applied u i x i 0 at the outlet the surfaces of the body and the ground were treated as no slip walls the top is treated as symmetry to investigate the yaw effects the incoming flow is yawed at angles of α 2 5 5 10 with respect to the symmetry plane of the ship model as shown in fig 2 b it should be noted that the negative angle corresponds to the flow component towards the reverse direction of the y axis which is defined in fig 1 a commercial finite volume cfd solver avl fire avl 2014 2014 based on a cell centred finite volume approach was used to perform the les simulations based on the standard smagorinsky model this solver has successfully predicted several bluff body flows krajnović 2014 östh and krajnović 2014 minelli et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2018 thus it can be confidently used for this ship flow at yaw once a proper mesh resolution is achieved the physical time step for all cases normalised by the upstream velocity u and the ship width w is δ t 0 004 for each time step the maximum number of inner iterations performed is set to 10 which gives a normalised values for all residuals lower than 1 0 4 the simulation at 0 yaw is conducted for a total time t 192 which corresponds to approximately 4 3 flow passages through the domain and the averaging of the flow quantities starts at t 64 while for the yaw cases the simulations continued up to t 360 for each yaw angle after changing the inlet boundary conditions at t 192 the averaging of the flow started after one flow passage through the domain the aerodynamic force coefficients of the ship are also monitored and sampled during the averaging period for this generic ship model a hexahedral mesh was generated by the commercial grid generator software ansys icem cfd the o grid technique was used to concentrate most of the computational cells around the body so as to capture the flow structures close to the ship accurately and to reduce the cells far away from the walls to examine the effect of the grid resolution on the results three different grids were used the coarse medium and fine grids consisting of approximately 6 10 and 21 million cells respectively the grid resolution of the three grids is described in table 1 in zhang et al 2018 2 2 validation the program validation of the 0 yaw case has been achieved in zhang et al 2018 by making a comparison of time averaged streamwise velocities along two lateral lines downstream of the hangar at 25 and 50 length of the flight deck in the z 0 44 w plane obtained using les r e 8 1 0 4 and previous numerical simulations of forrest and owen 2010 r e 6 58 1 0 5 and syms 2008 r e 5 59 1 0 5 and experiments of the aerodynamics laboratory al of the national research council canada nrc r e 5 59 1 0 5 as discussed in zhang et al 2018 although the reynolds numbers are not identical the comparison is qualitative to show the similar trend of the asymmetry the quantitative difference between numerical and experimental data can ascribe to the location of the funnel which is not consistent see the model in fig 1 and the geometry in syms 2008 also the study of numerical errors and the effect of residuals at 0 yaw have been conducted the iterative error was calculated at residual values of 1 0 4 and 1 0 5 as mentioned in 3 iterations the residual values were found to be below 1 0 4 thus at the residual value of 1 0 4 although the maximum number of iterations is 10 only 3 iterations are performed at a time step if 10 iterations are required to be performed the best way is to enhance the convergence criterion of the residual value e g 1 0 5 the statistical error is obtained by the standard deviation σ values of drag and lift forces the discretisation error was also included in table 2 in zhang et al 2018 which is less than 2 according to the analysis of those results the medium and fine meshes both have adequately resolved the air wake at 0 yaw after carefully comparing the results on the three meshes and having computing resources available the fine mesh is finally chosen for further analysis 2 3 post processing 2 3 1 normalised coefficients the aerodynamic drag lift and side forces are key factors to assess the aerodynamic performance of the ship cruising on the sea at yaw thus to make the comparison more convenient these forces are normalised as below 1 c x f x 0 5 ρ u 2 a c y f y 0 5 ρ u 2 a c z f z 0 5 ρ u 2 a where f x f y and f z are the mean drag force side force and lift force respectively here a is the frontal cross sectional area without considering the funnel the pressure coefficient is defined as 2 c p p p r e f 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the absolute pressure p r e f is the reference pressure of the undisturbed flow field and ρ is the constant density of air which is 1 18858 kg m 3 2 3 2 vortex visualisation technique the q criterion the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor is used for the identification of vortices an iso surface with positive q reveals locations in the flow where the strength of the rotation overcomes the strain thus indicating vortical structures hunt et al 1988 this criterion also adds a secondary condition on the pressure requiring local pressure lower than ambient pressure in the vortex for an incompressible flow the q can be defined as 3 q 1 2 u i x j u j x i 1 2 s i j s i j ω i j ω i j where s i j and ω i j are the symmetric and anti symmetric parts of the resolved velocity gradient tensor note that the q represents the local balance between shear strain rate and vorticity magnitude defining vortices as regions where the vorticity magnitude is greater than the magnitude of rate of strain 3 results and discussion the results for each yaw case are presented and discussed herein with particular attention on the pressure distributions velocity contours streamlines q criterion vorticity magnitude turbulence kinetic energy and aerodynamic loads in the section of mean flows the 0 yaw flow condition is presented and discussed at first followed by 2 5 5 and at last 10 yaw angles in instantaneous flows the q criterion and vorticity are shown at all yaw cases turbulence kinetic energy including the unresolved and total turbulence kinetic energy is also compared in the final subsection the aerodynamic forces as well as asymmetrical characteristics for all cases are listed in tables to show the global yaw effect 3 1 mean flows 3 1 1 0 yaw the flow characteristics of the ship at 0 yaw have been analysed in detail in the previously mentioned papers zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 therefore a brief introduction is brought in to remind the readers of the double bi stable behaviour and to conveniently make a comparison with other yaw cases fig 3 shows the time averaged air wakes of the ship for the top step formed by the region behind the hangar and above the flight deck the pressure is generally lower than that on the bottom step which is the region behind the stern two distinct pressure regions are observed on the vertical base surfaces of each step those regions are highly dependent on the location and shapes of vortices as shown in fig 3 d the large triangular vortex close to the base directly affects the base pressure nevertheless the lower pressure region tends to be smaller than the higher pressure area on each step this asymmetrical flow topology is more clear when illustrated by the iso surfaces of the mean pressure coefficient c p 0 2 and 0 12 for the top and bottom steps respectively as shown in fig 3 b and the time averaged streamwise velocity contour in the lateral mid plane as presented in fig 3 c behind each step with regard to the iso surface of c p a half torus or a so called horseshoe vortex is observed on the top step which is similar to the wake structure of a cube mounted on the ground the absence of underbody incoming flow prevents the formation of a full torus shape as visualised for ahmed body flows lucas et al 2017 in fig 3 c the core region of the low velocity blue colour locates at the upper part of the image on the top step while for the bottom step it lies on the opposite side it is highly interesting to note that in this flow configuration the flow topology at the flight deck top step is generally anti symmetrical to the rear step to identify this asymmetrical flow topology in a clearer way fig 3 d shows the time averaged streamlines projected on two x y planes behind each step this figure indicates that the mean asymmetric flow is characterised by two large vortices in each plane for example at the top step the narrow and stretched vortex is located on the upper side of the image whereas the large triangular one is visualised on the lower side here the authors would like to remind the reader that this flow state can change randomly to the other side in an anti symmetric fashion zhang et al 2018 regarding to this so called bi stable phenomenon there is no clear evidence to show what triggers it the asymmetric distribution of the velocity profiles presented in the wake was probably first observed by syms 2008 who studied the velocity fields above the deck for verifying cfd codes for ship air wakes and supposed that the flow is locked on one side of the ship however no more detailed explanation is illustrated in the work herry 2010 by means of wind tunnel experiments was probably the first researcher to investigate the behaviour of this bi stability in the ship wake his strategy was to place a splitter plate or a small winglet or a cylinder at different locations around the ship rear such as on the side of the hangar behind the second step and adjacent to the region where the streamwise vortices develop generally the small add on showed little effect on the flow asymmetry on the top step when the splitter plate was vertically set behind the bottom step this confirmed that the bi stable behaviour on the second step has little influence on the asymmetrical flow topology observed on the top step therefore the strategy to control the streamwise vortices was to modify the origin or the end of the vortex it was concluded that strengthening the intensity of the vortex from its origin by placing a horizontal splitter plate adjacent to the top step or fixing a cylinder on the lateral wall upstream the top step would delay the occurrence of bi stable phenomenon to a larger yaw angle whereas using a smaller winglet set with an angle of attack to generate a countering vortex will advance this occurrence to a small opposite yaw angle despite this it is not yet clear the formation process and the causes of the asymmetric behaviour therefore after this brief description an attempt to explore the reason behind this phenomenon is proposed using both averaged and instantaneous quantities fig 4 shows the mean c p along three pairs of lines located at the top step s mid height z 0 22 w l 1 at the bottom step s mid height z 0 165 w l 2 on the lateral walls and on the top of the superstructure at 1 4 y 0 25 w and 3 4 y 0 25 w l t o p of the ship width as illustrated in fig 4 a the lines on the sides of the model are used to check if the lateral local mean static pressure distributions are different the top ones are used to determine the discrepancy of mean pressure in the two halves cut by the symmetry plane when x 2 0 w the mean c p hardly shows differences between each of the three pairs indicating that the incoming static pressure is symmetrical this might also indicate that the proposed length of the superstructure l s u p e r s t r u c t u r e 2 0 w is the required minimum length to observe the occurrence of a bi stable flow topology on the top step anyway a careful study of the influence of this parameter is currently under investigation and goes beyond the scope of this paper after x w 2 0 the discrepancies start to increase as shown in the close up located at the right corner of fig 4 b reaching their maxima at the rear of each step it should be noted that a cross point where the pressure on each side is equal is observed for the pressure along l 2 and l t o p respectively regarding to the flow configuration shown in fig 3 the pressure at the y 0 side is lower than at the y 0 side for the top step which is also confirmed by the c p at the end of the superstructure proceeding along l 2 the pressure on the y 0 side increases becoming larger than that on the y 0 side at round x 0 5 w while on the stern it shows a much larger value consequently an opposite behaviour is observed and this relates well to the flow configuration on the top step visualised in fig 3 the qualitative and quantitative analysis of velocity fields at various cross sections could explain why these pressure profiles show such trends fig 5 qualitatively shows the time averaged streamwise velocity contours around the ship with 2 dimensional belts of 0 13 w five sections are selected along the x direction and the belts are decomposed in right y 0 side left y 0 side and top parts to quantify the discrepancy between two sides a spatial mean approach is adopted to obtain the mean values of the areas shown in fig 5 the spatial mean of the velocity is computed by summing the product of the area of each element by the value of the u u taken at the centroid of the element nodal variables are interpolated at each cell centroid using cell shape blending or metric functions for each element over the entire part the final sum is then divided by the total area of the part as follows 4 s p a t i a l m e a n σ u i a i σ a i where u i is the normalised time averaged streamwise velocity taken at centroid of element i a i is the area of element i using this spatial mean approach the mean values for the belt parts around the superstructure and the deck are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively a sketch of the velocity around the ship is shown in fig 6 it should be mentioned that the mean values of rear u p p e r shown in a rectangle with yellow dashed lines in fig 5 is added in table 1 to understand the effect of the incoming flow on the structure on the top step generally the mean u u plots shows inverse trends compared to those of the mean c p plots a 2 3 difference of u u between the y 0 and y 0 sides in the rear side of the flow around the superstructure and a 4 1 difference for the incoming flow of the top step are obtained as shown in figs 6 and 7 a whereas no differences are observed in the front and the middle sections this indicates that the minimum length of the superstructure should be guaranteed so as to observe this asymmetrical flow topology as to the top at the beginning front the flow is symmetrical with a 0 0 difference between the two halves subsequently a switch from positive to negative values appears between the middle and the rear belts as a result more flux flows towards the y 0 side of the deck from the top and the y 0 side of the superstructure because of this flux a difference up to 41 8 between the two halves on the top of the deck is observed this downwash flow showing a difference of 7 3 table 2 at the edge of the stern travels towards the y 0 side in the wake and it seems to restrict the velocity of the corresponding side flow resulting in a higher velocity at the other side y 0 as shown in figs 6 and 7 b note that for the flow topology on the top step the flux from both sides and the top has an equal effect as listed in table 1 however on the bottom step the downwash flow from the deck plays a dominant role in the flow configuration as presented in table 2 fig 7 shows the time averaged streamwise velocity distributions of belts at the end of each step to present the difference clearly a different colourmap is used the smaller mean u u values in tables 1 and 2 correspond to lower velocity contours in particular in the regions close to the walls of the ship it should be noted that grandemange et al 2013 investigated the bi stability in the turbulent wake past parallelepiped bodies at various aspect ratios and wall effects and then concluded that both the ground clearance and the cross section aspect ratio have a critical impact on these bi stable phenomena with regard to this ship flow only the aspect ratio remains the key parameter for the asymmetry in the wake prevezer et al 2002 investigated with cfd and wind tunnel tests the effect of the aspect ratio on the flow behind a bluff fronted lorry to verify whether the asymmetric flow phenomenon truly exists or it is just an artefact induced by the cfd solvers they concluded that the asymmetry may be the natural flow feature of this geometry and dependent on the aspect ratio to be noticed is that the asymmetrical distribution is shown by prevezer et al 2002 in an analogous 3d double forward facing step which is different from what discussed in this paper but it was probably the first attempt to explain a similar asymmetrical phenomenon 3 1 2 2 5 yaw according to the investigation of herry 2010 when the yaw angle α varies in a small range 5 5 the bi stable flow configuration on the top step could switch from one state to the other however no more details about the flow topology on the bottom step were mentioned therefore in this section the results for the ship at small yaw angles are presented to verify if the double asymmetrical phenomenon is still observed on both steps the next section 3 1 3 will focus on the analysis of the effects of larger yaw angles 5 and 10 which has not been investigated in experiments or simulations before fig 8 shows two flow configurations at 2 5 yaw it is interesting to observe that the asymmetrical distributions appear behind both steps in addition the flow configuration at 2 5 is highly anti symmetrical to that at 2 5 compared to the asymmetry at 0 yaw a slight yaw angle of the incoming flow strengthens the asymmetrical distributions on both steps this is closely shown by the mean pressure coefficient on the base surfaces fig 8 a b in particular the regions with lower pressure are enlarged due to either the large triangular vortex moving closer to the base and becoming bigger or the narrow stretched vortex shifting away and reducing its size as illustrated in fig 8 g h the corresponding quantitative results are listed in table 8 of section 3 4 2 the iso surfaces of the mean c p around the top and bottom steps are shown in fig 8 c d and the time averaged streamwise velocity contours in the lateral mid planes behind each step are presented in fig 8 e f a small yaw angle contributes to the formation of a large volume delimited by the same iso value when compared to the 0 yaw case with regard to the time averaged streamwise velocity contours the tail white colour region where u u is approximately 0 4 of the wake is more stretched on the top step than on the bottom one indicating that the level of asymmetry on the top step is stronger than the bottom let us recall the spatial mean values of u u in table 1 at 0 yaw more flux comes from the y 0 side for the top step here the 2 5 yaw case shows a similar flow configuration to that of the 0 yaw case however this negative yaw angle leads to more flux impacting on the y 0 side of the ship model the same approach adopted in the 0 yaw case also will be used to extract the data on the top step to determine what happens at this 2 5 yaw as well as for the 2 5 yaw case the spatial mean values of u u in the corresponding three belts at 2 5 yaw are included in table 3 and for the bottom step the results are listed in table 4 similar to the wakes of other bluff bodies when the incoming flow is yawed at a certain angle an asymmetrical flow distribution is observed on the top step which is a typical wake flow at yaw this is because more flux comes from the windward side of the ship as presented in table 3 however this phenomenon is in contradiction to what has been concluded for the 0 yaw case it should be noted that the discrepancies at 2 5 yaw are slightly larger as compared to the 2 5 yaw case probably indicating that in this case the switching point where the flow configuration changes to the other one is a very small negative angle this has been confirmed by the experimental work of herry 2010 as to the bottom step affected by the boundary layers on the ground and the asymmetrical flow distribution on the deck of the ship the small yaw angles delays the reverse of the difference between two sides in the mean u u at 0 yaw the switching point is originally located around the forebody of the deck while at 2 5 yaw the point moves close to the middle which probably indicates that the length of the deck plays a significant role in this asymmetrical flow topology therefore smaller discrepancies between the left and right sides are created at the rear but the asymmetry is still observed ascribing to the stronger strength of the asymmetry on the top step more downwash flow comes towards the y 0 side of the bottom step as listed in 4 3 1 3 5 and 10 yaw the results for the ship at larger yaw angles of 5 and 10 are presented in this section similar to the previous sections the time averaged air wakes of the ship at 5 and 10 yaw are shown in fig 9 to see how the large yaw angle affects the double asymmetrical distributions on both steps the general observation is that two distinct regions with different pressure values are shown on the base surface of the top step as shown in fig 9 a b and a larger yaw angle contributes to a larger low pressure region concerning the bottom step the large yaw angles weaken this asymmetrical flow topology which is evident at smaller angles and 0 yaw and the global surface pressure is also decreased note that the middle region is dominated by a slightly higher pressure and the two adjacent regions show lower pressure values as presented in fig 9 a b this distribution probably indicates an approximately symmetrical structure as what has been previously reported by rao et al 2019 who observed a lower pressure dominating the middle region with two adjacent regions of higher pressure after incorporating a base cavity on the top step this conclusion is basically confirmed by fig 9 c d and g h although the regions within lower pressure are enlarged on the top step the level of the asymmetry is not strengthened see table 8 of section 3 4 2 this is because the flow at a large angle suppresses the stretched vortex close to the base and enlarges the big triangular vortex which forms at the other side as illustrated in fig 9 g h as compared to the vortices shown at small yaw angles perhaps more attention is needed to fig 9 e f as the tail white colour in each lateral plane shows the same trends which is highly different from those at smaller yaw angles to quantitatively analyse it the spatial mean approach is also utilised in this section the results are listed in tables 5 and 6 in general a larger yaw angle promotes a larger difference of the mean u u in side belts as compared with small 2 5 yaw angles referring to what has been mentioned in section 3 1 2 at small yaw angles the asymmetrical flow distribution on the top step is the inherent of the wake flow at yaw however affected by the funnel the velocity differences over the top of the superstructure does not follow the trend that the windward side shows with the increase of the angle this switching point defined as where the difference changes from a positive value to a negative value moves from the rear of the superstructure to its middle part here the focus is on the yaw effect so the influence of the funnel will be included and discussed in the future study which shows a further exploration on how the upstream conditions could affect the bi stable behaviour regarding the bottom step the trends are similar to those on the top step i e more flux impacts the windward side and the velocity differences increases with the yaw angle at the corresponding cross section but if the attention is paid to the velocity in the deck region the differences reduce this probably depends on the intensity of the asymmetry on the top step as shown in fig 9 and table 8 more flux coming from one side and more uniform flux coming from the top contribute to an approximately symmetrical structure behind the bottom step as shown in fig 9 g h 3 2 instantaneous flows 3 2 1 q criterion to further compare the flow structures for all yaw cases studied the instantaneous and time averaged iso surfaces of q criterion are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the les using a fine mesh well resolves those tiny scale structures and predicts the separated flow regions on the top of the bridge and in the wake of the ship as shown in fig 10 this indicates that the grid resolution around the ship is sufficient at a larger yaw angle a larger separated flow region v1 is observed on the windward side of the bow whereas a smaller region v2 is found on the leeward side as compared to those at 0 and small yaw angles the yaw effect triggers an upstream vortex v3 starting at the tip of the bow but this vortex is not clearly observed at 0 yaw in fig 10 a moreover the yaw angle suppresses the flow separation which is induced by the windward front vertical edge of the superstructure but it promotes a larger separation on the leeward side to explore those vortices clearly the time averaged iso surfaces of q criterion are shown in fig 11 two series of vortices vt1 and vt2 are generated at the tip of the bow at 0 yaw both are symmetrical to each other however at yaw the upstream vortex vt1 tends to be longer and stronger than the downstream one vt2 with the increase of the yaw angle this trend on the leeward side vt3 as well as in the wake vt4 of the ship becomes more evident the flow structure in the 2 5 yaw case is anti symmetrical to that is observed in the 2 5 yaw case 3 2 2 vorticity in order to observe the coherent structures around the ship model and identify the regions of smooth and turbulent flows the vorticity component ω x in the symmetry planes and mid lateral planes at z 0 22 w for all yaw cases are visualised in figs 12 and 13 the smooth incoming flow tends to become turbulent due to the front sharp edges e g the tip of the bow of the generic ship massive separations originating from these edges develop towards the rear leading to high turbulent wake therefore it is not difficult to distinguish where the smooth and turbulent flows are both figures show highly turbulent flow structures around this generic ship model as shown in fig 12 with the increase of the yaw angle the vortex region on the bow of the ship becomes larger while the corresponding region on the top of the superstructure is reduced this phenomenon is significantly observed in fig 10 in the wake the vortex region tends to be suppressed by the yawed flow in fig 13 the vortex distribution around the ship model at 0 yaw is generally symmetrical at a larger yaw angle more vortices are observed in the leeward region and in the wake of the ship however when the angle increases but less than 10 a bit more vortices are also seen in the windward side at 10 yaw those vortices are compressed close to the windward ship surfaces 3 3 turbulence kinetic energy figs 14 and 15 show the unresolved turbulence kinetic energy k u and total turbulence kinetic energy k t o t a l in the symmetry planes for all yaw cases which is always used to examine the capability of the numerical method to resolve the flow the k u is computed from the expression for the smagorinsky model as k u k s g s c s δ s 2 0 3 krajnović et al 2012 according to the instantaneous and time averaged unresolved turbulence kinetic energy k u contours in fig 14 the unresolved regions locate on the front top of the superstructure on the top of the funnel and in the near wake of the funnel this is because of the speed up effect of the flow over them it should be noted that the unresolved region in the near wake of the funnel is affected by the yaw angle at 10 yaw the region is the largest as compared to the other yaw cases this could be ascribed to more flow passing through it in the wake the flow is resolved well with low values of k u the distributions of the instantaneous turbulence kinetic energy k t o t a l in fig 15 is consistent with those in fig 12 confirming that the turbulence kinetic energy comes from the vortices seeing the time averaged k t o t a l contours at a larger angle a larger region with high turbulence kinetic energy is observed figs 16 and 17 show the unresolved turbulence kinetic energy k u and total turbulence kinetic energy k t o t a l in the lateral mid planes for all yaw cases the unresolved regions occur around the front side of the superstructure and in the wake region with evident shear layers which are not clearly shown in fig 13 the unresolved upstream regions tend to reduce while they increase in the wake with the increase of yaw angles the yawed flow could reduce the unresolved region in the windward side whereas an unresolved region is created in front of the superstructure in fig 16 the shear layers evolve from the side of the hanger showing a significant asymmetry which contributes to the orientation of the wake in fig 17 the distributions of k t o t a l is consistent with that in fig 13 seeing the time averaged k t o t a l contours at a larger angle a larger region with high turbulence kinetic energy is observed less than 10 the separation from the windward edge of the superstructure tries to emerge into the leeward vortex region so it grows with the yaw angle at 10 yaw case it finally emerges into the leeward vortex region and the corresponding separation region in the windward side reduces significantly 3 4 global and local quantities 3 4 1 aerodynamic forces the global quantities time averaged aerodynamic forces and corresponding standard deviation σ values for all cases studied in the present work are listed in table 7 here the time histories of forces are not plotted and these details can be found in zhang et al 2018 the contribution of the bi stable behaviour to the aerodynamic forces is not obvious the variations of all forces are highly dependent on the yaw angle the c x increases with the yaw angle up to 5 followed with slight decrease overall the variation is in the range of 0 7 0 8 the c y and c z experienced by the ship model increase significantly at a larger yaw angle in particular for the c y when the angle increases twice the c y nearly increases with the same factor therefore the c y is highly dependent on the yaw angle the c z at 10 yaw reaches approximately 2 times the value recorded at 0 at 0 yaw the c y is a small negative value indicating that the ship experiences a larger pressure load on the y 0 side for the 2 5 yaw cases the absolute force coefficients are very similar the 0 yaw and 2 5 yaw cases show a similar asymmetry regarding the standard deviation values the σ c y is the largest of all three variables ascribing to the bi stable behaviour which contributes to the asymmetrical flow topology the σ c x changes between 0 0146 and 0 0175 at α 5 while at 10 yaw it suddenly increases up to 0 0266 as to the σ c z it is around 0 023 for all cases this means that it is affected by neither the yaw angle nor the bi stable behaviour 3 4 2 asymmetrical characteristics the inclined angles β and γ defined as the angle between the lateral width direction and the line connecting the centres of the two vortices on each step are used to quantify the level of asymmetry as illustrated in fig 18 to simplify the comparison only the absolute values without considering the angle direction are listed in table 8 these data confirm what has been concluded in section 3 based on the surface pressure distributions velocity contours and streamlines the general observation is that the flow shows a stronger level of asymmetry on the top step than on the rear step for each case a small yaw angle could contribute to increasing the strength of the asymmetry however at a larger one the inclined angles β and γ decrease quickly indicating the asymmetry is significantly suppressed at 0 yaw β is nearly twice of γ whereas at 2 5 yaw both angles increase in a similar way it is interesting to observe that the inclined angles β and γ are a little larger at 2 5 than at 2 5 therefore it can be concluded that the 0 is not the switching point for this bi stable behaviour changing from one flow state to the other supposed that the inclined angle tends to a linear distribution in the range of 2 5 2 5 so interpreted angles for the switching point are obtained at 0 5 for the top step and 0 2 for the bottom step in the work conducted by herry 2010 the angle is about 0 2 where the ship geometry is the sfso which is based on the sfs1 model without funnel and with a pyramid nose in the front at 5 yaw β reduces to 14 3 and γ reduces to 1 1 showing an approximately symmetrical wake flow when the flow is yawed at a larger angle β reduces a little but γ increases this increase is probably caused by the coupled effect of the flux coming from the sides and the top of the deck and a brief explanation can be found in section 3 1 3 4 conclusions the yaw effect on the bi stable air wakes of a generic ship model was investigated by using well resolved large eddy simulations the reynolds number is r e 8 1 0 4 based on the width of the ship and the velocity of the incoming flow this model is representative of a ship geometry with a bow in the front and a double step at the rear therefore the flow past the rear steps could be analogous to that of a 3 dimensional double backward facing step according to previous studies syms 2008 zhang et al 2018 rao et al 2019 this symmetrical geometry with an aspect ratio width height of 1 29 contributes to the occurrence of double bi stable flow configurations at 0 yaw behind each step the asymmetrical flow topology is observed and both are anti symmetrical to each other to explore this phenomenon local quantities such as surface pressure profiles base pressure iso surfaces of pressure velocity contours streamlines and spatial mean streamwise velocity were used to give a detailed explanation the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the differential flux coming from the y 0 and y 0 sides of the ship in the lateral direction could trigger the bi stable flow behaviour in the wake 2 minimum lengths could be required for the superstructure and the deck to create the double bi stable flow configurations this needs to be verified with future simulations 3 the direction of the incoming flow shows an effect on the double bi stable behaviour when the ship is subjected to a small angle e g 2 5 these double bi stable configurations still appear behind each step and the level of the asymmetry is strengthened moreover using opposite yaw angles two flow states are clearly observed the 2 5 yaw case maintains the same flow topology as what is shown at 0 yaw while the 2 5 yaw case leads to an anti symmetrical flow configuration evaluating the angles β and γ at 2 5 yaw 0 seems not to be the switching point for the bi stable configuration this aspect would require a deeper investigation using dynamic simulations to verify the asymmetrical behaviour while continuously changing the yaw angle furthermore at a larger yaw angle the asymmetry on each step is suppressed in particular for the bottom step 4 the global aerodynamic forces of all cases are highly dependent on the yaw angle the c x first increases with the yaw angle up to 5 and then it decreases up to 10 the c y and c z in particular for the c y increase a lot at a larger yaw angle with regard to the standard deviation values the σ c y is the largest in all three variables ascribing to the bi stable behaviour neither the yaw angle nor the bi stable behaviour plays a dominant role in the standard deviation values of lift forces future studies will also attempt to verify the length effects of the bow the superstructure and the deck on the double bi stable configurations to present a clearer understanding of this representative ship flow credit authorship contribution statement jie zhang

21218,an experimental and numerical study on the hydrodynamic characteristics of arc shaped plate type aspt breakwaters was carried out the accuracy and reliability of the developed 2d numerical model were verified through experimental results which show the following as the relative plate width increases a decrease in k t and a slight increase in k r occur the maximum increase in the transmission coefficient is approximately 11 the wave height increases by 4 cm when d h 0 05 the difference in the reflection coefficient at h h values of 0 10 and 0 17 is great with the maximum amplitude decreasing to 39 6 the wave pressure p distribution pattern differs significantly between the upper and lower surfaces of the arc shaped plate when d h 0 05 the difference in the absolute value between positive and negative p values ranges only from 0 06 to 0 21 kpa the vertical wave force on the aspt breakwater is significantly greater than the horizontal wave force the flow field distribution differs notably between the wave facing and back wave sides of the aspt breakwater a relatively notable vortex is formed on the back wave side the results of this study can be used as a theoretical reference for the application of aspt breakwaters in engineering keywords arc shaped plate type breakwater wave dissipating performance wave pressure flow field openfoam 1 introduction plate type open breakwaters can effectively dissipate wave energy and thereby protect shorelines and harbor buildings these plate type open breakwater structures adequately consider the fact that over 90 of sea wave energy is concentrated in surface waters and effectively dissipated by disrupting the motion path of water particles gu et al 2016 in addition these breakwaters have a low requirement for foundations and a simple structure are easy to construct are ecologically and environmentally friendly save material and can facilitate free exchange between waters inside and outside a harbor area as a result their hydrodynamic performance has received extensive attention from numerous researchers and engineers carmigniani et al 2019 he et al 2019 regarding flat plate type open breakwaters stoker et al 1957 were the first to theoretically analyze the transmission and reflection coefficients k t and k r respectively of underwater fixed plate type open breakwaters under the action of long waves based on wave energy flow theory qiu et al 1986 derived an analytical expression for single flat plate type open breakwaters at any water depth due to rapid changes in actual ocean tides the engineering application of single flat plate type open breakwaters in waters with wide tidal ranges is limited li et al 2019 fang et al 2017 and gu et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic performance of double and multiflat plate type open breakwaters they found that the k t and k r values of a multiflat plate type open breakwater are significantly affected by the relative plate width as well as the relative submerged depth and relative water depth of the top plate compared to a single flat plate type open breakwater the wave dissipating performance of a multiflat plate type open breakwater with three or more plates is not significantly higher liu et al 2014 fang et al 2017 the relative plate width is the primary factor that affects the k t of a flat plate type open breakwater the maximum wave dissipating performance of a flat plate type open breakwater is realized when it is placed near the static water surface liu et al 2014 he et al 2018a b the abovementioned research results with respect to flat plate type open breakwaters can provide a theoretical reference for studying other types of plate type open breakwaters in addition to flat plate type open breakwaters experts and researchers have studied the wave dissipating performance of vertical π shaped u shaped upside down t shaped and t shaped plate type open breakwaters koh et al 2016 an et al 2013 their results reveal the following multivertical plate type open breakwaters can significantly dissipate incident wave energy the wave reflecting performance of symmetrical double oblique plate type open breakwaters is higher than that of single oblique plate type open breakwaters but lower than that of symmetrical double vertical plate type open breakwaters karmakar et al 2012 gayen et al 2016 the wave reflecting performance of symmetrical double oblique plate type open breakwaters is higher than that of single oblique plate type open breakwaters but lower than that of double vertical plate type open breakwaters karmakar et al 2012 gayen et al 2016 based on the bragg resonance conditions a multivertical plate type open breakwater has the minimum k t and the maximum wave dissipating performance when the spacing between vertical plates is set to half the wavelength of the incident wave and the wavelength of the incident wave is close to twice the spacing between vertical plates xu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 for a t shaped plate type open breakwater the vertical plate height significantly affects its wave dissipating performance zhan et al 2017 t shaped plate type open breakwaters outperform upside down t shaped plate type open breakwaters in wave dissipation and can block 20 30 more incident wave energy neelamani et al 2002 through physical model tests günaydın et al 2004 2007 studied u and π shaped plate type open breakwaters and determined the relationships between k t k r and the wave dissipation coefficient open breakwaters and their hydrodynamic performance have always been an important topic in the ocean engineering field he et al 2018a b rey et al 2011 inspired by semicircular breakwaters jiang et al 2017 kundapura et al 2019 wang et al 2016 proposed an arc shaped plate type aspt open breakwater its primary structural feature is the use of arc shaped plates rather than flat plates with various curvature radii as the top wave dissipating structure of the plate type open breakwater the k t of an aspt open breakwater can be maintained below 0 5 at a relative plate width of 0 2 in addition reducing the spacing between arc shaped plates can help improve the wave dissipating performance of the plate type open breakwater the number of plates has no significant impact on the wave dissipating performance of the plate type open breakwater wang et al 2019 studied the interactions between waves and aspt open breakwaters using the boundary element method based on potential flow theory they found that at a submerged depth wave height ratio of 0 05 the wave dissipating performance of an upper aspt open breakwater was approximately 50 higher than that of a flat plate type open breakwater however wang et al 2019 investigated wave dissipation only when a single aspt open breakwater is below the still water surface and did not examine the wave dissipating performance when the top of the open breakwater is placed at various positions relative to the still water surface with the development of high performance computers and the maturation of numerical simulation techniques viscous flow models based on the navier stokes equations have been used in numerical simulations of some wave breaking phenomena bihs et al 2016 vermeire et al 2017 waves break when acting on plate type open breakwaters higuera et al 2015 li et al 2019 used a viscous flow model to compare the wave dissipating performance of arc shaped and flat plate type open breakwaters and found that aspt open breakwaters when placed above or slightly above the still water surface significantly outperform flat plate type open breakwaters in terms of wave dissipation to date very few systematic studies on the hydrodynamic performance of aspt open breakwaters have been reported

were conducted in the multifunctional wave current tank fig 1 at the port coastal and offshore engineering experimental center of ludong university the dimensions of the tank were as shown in fig 1 one end of the tank was equipped with a servo motor driven absorption paddle type wave generator capable of generating stable continuous regular waves gravel average gravel particle size 100 150 mm was placed at the other end of the tank to eliminate wall end reflection the dimensions of the gravel beach were as shwn in fig 1 the physical tank was divided into two small tanks one with a width of 0 8 m and the other with a width of 1 2 m the experimental study was carried out in a small tank with a width of 0 8 m the monitoring equipment used in the tests included ds30 multipoint wave height h measuring systems and ds30 multipoint pressure p measuring systems the sampling interval was set to 0 02 s according to the goda two point method goda et al 1976 two wave gauges 1 and 2 spaced 0 74 m apart were placed on the wave facing side of the breakwater model the 2 wave gauge was 4 46 m from the front end of the open breakwater the wave reflection coefficient k r was calculated based on the measurements of the 1 and 2 wave gauges one wave gauge 3 was placed on the back wave side of the breakwater model the 3 wave gauge was 4 46 m from the back end of the open breakwater the wave transmission coefficient k t was calculated based on the measurements of the 3 wave gauge 2 2 model parameters the aspt breakwater model used in the tests was fabricated using polymethyl methacrylate fig 2 a the main model parameters are as shown in fig 2b a width of 0 025 m was reserved at each of the wave facing and back wave edges of the model where circular holes were drilled for the screws used to fix the arc shaped plate fig 2b during the tests the height of the arc shaped plate was varied by adjusting the position of the nuts to vary the submerged depth d of the aspt breakwater six circular holes 0 02 m in diameter were drilled into both the upper and lower surfaces of the breakwater to fix the wave pressure p sensors fig 3 shows the arrangement of the p measuring points the p sensors at the nos 1 6 and 7 12 measuring points were used to monitor p on the upper and lower surfaces of the arc shaped plate respectively 2 3 test parameters regular waves were used in the tests the test parameters were given in table 1 in this study d is defined as the distance between the line tangent to the apex of the arc shaped plate and the static water level swl a positive d means that the apex of the arc shaped plate is above the swl while a negative d means that the apex of the arc shaped plate is below the swl fig 2b a total of 60 groups of tests with various combinations of wave parameters were designed to reduce the number of test errors three tests were conducted in each group the results of which were averaged table 1 summarizes the main physical parameters used in this study 3 numerical model openfoam an open source program is used to study the interactions between waves and the aspt breakwater the governing equations boundary conditions validation of the wave generation and dissipation mesh independence analysis and 2d model construction are elaborated in the following sections the relevant test parameters are the same as the physical model see the test parameters section for details 3 1 governing equations continuity and reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are used as the fluid governing equations a cartesian coordinate system is also used the positive x axis direction is the wave propagation direction and the y axis indicates the vertical direction relative to the tank the upward direction is positive the model adopted is similar to that of sun et al 2019 the following are the governing equations 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u μ u ρ τ c κ α g x ρ p ρ g h s where u is the average velocity vector t is time ρ τ is the reynolds stress term τ characterizes the impulse induced reynolds stress tensor c κ α is the surface tension term c is the surface tension coefficient c 0 07 kg s2 κ is the curvature of the free surface α is the volume

the pressure point of a structure is at the free surface p ρ g h represents the hydrodynamic pressure which is expressed as follows 3 p ρ g h p ρ g x 3 2 boundary conditions the 2d numerical model contains four types of boundary conditions 1 dynamic boundary conditions at the wave generation end of the tank similar to the paddle type wave generator the boundary can move back and forth and generate the target waves the velocity of the mesh cells adjacent to the dynamic boundary is consistent with the moving velocity of the boundary i e 4 u w a l l u w a l l based on linear wave theory the following relationship between the height of a regular wave and the stroke of the paddle is obtained biesel and suquet 1951 5 h t h s 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d where h t is referred to as the transfer function h is the height of the regular wave s is the stroke of the wave generation paddle k is the wavenumber and d is the water depth assuming that the wave generation paddle is in simple harmonic motion the wave surface equation for regular waves is as follows 6 η x t h 2 cos k x ω t by setting the position of the wave generation paddle to x 0 the displacement and velocity functions of the wave generation paddle are obtained as follows 7 x t s 2 sin ω t 8 u t s 2 ω cos ω t where t is time and ω is the circular frequency of the target wave 2 wave dissipation conditions at the end of the tank the damping layer wave dissipation method is used in this numerical model that is a wave dissipation source term i e s in eq 2 is added to the momentum equation to allow the wave velocity in the wave dissipation region to decrease gradually the wave dissipation source term is expressed as follows 9 s ρ u χ 10 χ χ 1 x x 0 l s x x 0 0 x x 0 where ρ is the density u is the velocity vector χ is an attenuation function χ 1 is an attenuation coefficient x is the horizontal coordinate of the cartesian coordinate system x 0 is the horizontal coordinate of the starting point of the damping wave dissipation region and l s is the length of the damping wave dissipation region preferably l s is 1 2 times the wavelength sun et al 2019 thus the attenuation coefficient is set to 5 in this study 3 free surface conditions in this numerical model the volume of fluid method is employed to track the free surface of the fluid the mesh cells at the free surface are filled with air and fluid the volume fraction of the fluid α the density of the fluid mixture ρ and the dynamic viscosity μ can be expressed as follows 11 ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ α μ α μ w 1 α μ α where ρ w and ρ α are the densities of water and air respectively ρ w 1000 kg m3 and ρ α 1 205 kg m3 and μw and μα are the dynamic viscosities of water and air respectively μw 1 01 10 3 pa s and μα 17 9 10 6 pa s 4 fixed wall boundary conditions in this numerical model no slip conditions are applied to both the sidewalls and bottom of the numerical tank in addition for the sidewalls and bottom of the numerical tank their velocity and pressure satisfy the following equations 12 u w a l l 0 13 p n w a l l 0 3 3 validation of wave generation and dissipation a 2d numerical model of an empty tank 12 m in length and 0 8 m in height is established fig 4 this model is then used to simulate the generation and propagation of regular waves under the following conditions h 0 60 m h 0 10 m and t 2 0 s in addition the numerical results for locations x 2 4 9 and 11 7 m away from the wave generation paddle are compared with the theoretical values for second order stokes waves fig 5 the results reveal the following the wave profiles measured by the nos 1 x 2 m and 2 x 4 m wave gauges are in good agreement with the theoretical values this result suggests that continuous stable reliable regular waves can be generated in the established numerical tank the no 3 wave gauge x 9 m is located near the starting end of the damping wave dissipation region the wave profile measured by this wave gauge is significantly lower than the theoretical value the no 4 wave gauge x 11 7 m is located at the end of the tank i e the terminating end of the damping wave dissipation region the wave surface elevation measured by this wave gauge approaches 0 which suggests that the wave energy is almost completely consumed evidently the damping wave dissipation region can eliminate the reflection by the wall at the end of the tank 3 4 mesh independence analysis meshes were generated for the numerical empty bank model length 12 m height 0 8 m established in section 3 3 fig 4 using four mesh generations given in table 1 the mesh cell scale in the incident wave direction the number of mesh cells in the incident wave direction the mesh cell scale in the h direction the number of mesh cells in the h direction and the mesh generation unit are denoted by x n x y n y and m respectively see table 2 for details numerical models of the four mesh resolutions were used to simulate regular waves under the following conditions h 0 60 m h 0 10 m and t 1 20 s in addition the wave profiles at x 6 m were measured as demonstrated in fig 6 the wave profiles at the normal mesh resolution after two mesh refinements are significantly higher than the results calculated using the models at the very coarse and coarse mesh resolutions in addition the wave profiles calculated using the regular mesh generation model are in almost complete agreement with those calculated using the fine mesh generation model this result suggests that the regular mesh resolution established in this study can meet the accuracy requirements of numerical calculations 3 5 2d numerical model construction the above method is used to establish a 2d numerical model for the interactions between waves and an aspt breakwater see the model parameters described in section 2 2 for the specific dimension of this breakwater the test parameters given in section 2 3 are used as wave elements in the numerical tests the established numerical tank is 12 m in length and 0 8 m in height the wave facing side of the aspt breakwater is 6 3 m away from the wave generation paddle two wave gauges 1 and 2 and one wave gauge 3 are placed on the wave facing and back wave sides respectively at the same positions as those in the physical model tests under various conditions fig 7 shows the arrangement of the numerical tank model the regular mesh scale validated using the empty tank model is used to generate a mesh for the established numerical aspt breakwater model the mesh cells near the swl are refined to accurately capture changes in the free surface the mesh cells surrounding the aspt breakwater are refined to address the problem of boundary layers surrounding the structure fig 8 shows the mesh generated for the local areas surrounding the breakwater 4 data analysis and evaluation 4 1 method for computing the transmission coefficient based on the h duration curve measured by the no 3 wave gauge behind the aspt breakwater the transmitted wave height h t on the back wave side of the breakwater is calculated using the upward zero crossing method on this basis k t is calculated using eq 14 14 k t h t h i where h t is the transmitted h and h i is the incident h 4 2 method for computing the reflection coefficient based on the h duration curves measured by the nos 1 and 2 wave gauges on the wave facing side of the aspt breakwater the incident h h i and reflected h h r on the wave facing side of the aspt breakwater are separated using the goda two point method goda et al 1976 the k r of the breakwater is calculated using eq 15 15 k r h r h i where h r is the reflected h and h i is the incident h 4 3 method for computing the wave force based on the instantaneous wave pressure at different measuring points on the upper and lower surfaces of the aspt breakwater the wave force acting on the area impacted by the wave pressure represented by each measuring point is calculated the wave force is projected in the horizontal direction and vertical direction and synchronous integration is performed along the horizontal direction and vertical direction thus the instantaneous horizontal and vertical wave forces on the aspt breakwater are calculated the wave force calculated in this paper is the mean wave force per unit length of the breakwater along the direction of the crest line under the action of regular waves the breakwater is subjected to uniform forces along the direction of the crest line thus the pressure measuring points are evenly arranged on both sides of the centerline along the direction of the crest line to measure the wave pressures on the upper and lower surfaces respectively and then the wave forces on the breakwater are obtained by integrating and summing these pressures the specific calculation method is as follows according to each instantaneous wave pressure at different measuring points of the aspt breakwater the wave force on the action area is represented by each pressure measuring point the wave forces are decomposed and integrated synchronously along the horizontal and vertical directions to obtain the instantaneous horizontal and vertical wave forces of the aspt breakwater the calculation diagram of the wave force on the aspt breakwater is shown in fig 9 for simplicity of description only 6 measuring points on the lower surface of the aspt breakwater are given in fig 9 the treatment method for the 6 measuring points on the upper surface is the same the aspt breakwater is divided into 6 microarcs and the center point of each section is the position of 6 pressure measuring points assuming that the pressure values on each microarc are the same they are all wave pressure values monitored by the pressure measuring points of this section in fig 9 the arc radius of the aspt breakwater is r 0 26 m p i represents the wave pressure on the microarc l i represents the length of the microarc θ i represents the angle between the wave pressure direction and the positive direction of the x axis and i represents the number of measuring points via the central angle formula θ i n 180 l i π r the direction angle of the wave pressure on each measuring point is calculated the wave pressure direction angle and microarc length are shown in table 3 taking microarc l 5 as an example each instantaneous wave force f 5 can be calculated by eq 16 16 f 5 p 5 l 5 the instantaneous wave forces on microarc l 5 are decomposed along the horizontal and vertical directions and the component forces in each instantaneous horizontal and vertical direction can be obtained see eqs 17 and 18 for details 17 f 5 x f 5 cos θ 5 18 f 5 y f 5 sin θ 5 by summing the wave forces synchronously along the horizontal and vertical directions the instantaneous horizontal wave forces f x and vertical wave forces f y of the aspt breakwater can be obtained as shown in eqs 19 and 20 19 f x i 1 12 f i x 20 f y i 1 12 f i y 5 results and discussion 5 1 transmission coefficient 5 1 1 effect of the relative plate width fig 10 shows the transmission coefficient comparison of the numerical and experimental results of the aspt breakwater with the w l at h h values of 0 10 and 0 17 and d h values of 0 05 0 and 0 05 w l is the ratio of the horizontal width w of the arc shaped plate to l when h t and h are known l can be determined from the dispersion relationship as demonstrated in fig 10 the simulated k t is in relatively good agreement with the measured k t under various conditions the relative w l significantly affects k t as w l increases k t decreases the k t of the aspt breakwater is relatively high under some conditions to inspect the shape effect the macagno equation 1953 was used for comparison as presented in fig 10 under the same conditions the transmission coefficient of the aspt breakwater is much smaller than the results of macagno s theory 1953 the aspt breakwater is clearly superior in terms of the wave attenuation performance 5 1 2 effect of the relative wave height the variation in the transmission coefficients of the aspt breakwater with the relative height for the tested relative submergence is presented in fig 11 the results show that the transmission coefficient increases with the relative wave height for 100 of the experimental tests the maximum increase is approximately 11 i e the wave height increases by 4 cm as a result the relative wave height has a significant impact on the transmission coefficients of the aspt breakwater more water will cross the aspt breakwater because more wave energy is carried by larger waves when larger waves encounter the aspt breakwater therefore the transmission coefficient is also larger under the action of a larger wave 5 1 3 effect of the relative submergence the transmission coefficients of the aspt breakwater vary with the relative submergence at different wave heights as shown in fig 12 the results reveal that the transmission coefficients at a relative submergence depth of 0 05 are significantly larger than those at relative submergences of 0 05 and 0 the range of increase is approximately 4 8 34 7 the transmission coefficient of the aspt breakwater at the still water surface and at 0 05 m above the still water surface is significantly better than that at 0 05 m below the still water surface therefore the relative submergence has a significant influence on the transmission coefficient of the aspt breakwater with the aspt breakwater located above the still water surface the barrier effect on waves is larger than that produced from the aspt breakwater located under the still water surface as a result the transmission coefficient is smaller when the aspt breakwater is located above the still water surface 5 2 reflection coefficient 5 2 1 effect of the relative plate width fig 13 shows the reflection coefficient comparison of the simulated and measured variations in k r of the aspt breakwater with w l at h h values of 0 10 and 0 17 and d h values of 0 05 0 and 0 05 as demonstrated in fig 13 the simulated k r is in relatively good agreement with the measured k r under most conditions the k r of the aspt breakwater increases as w l increases when d h 0 05 i e the arc shaped plate is above the swl and h h 0 10 no notable trend in the variation in k r with w l can be observed clearly increasing w l can more effectively increase the wave reflection and improve the wave dissipating performance of the aspt breakwater 5 2 2 effect of the relative wave height the variation in the reflection coefficients of the aspt breakwater with the relative wave height is predicted in fig 14 the results show that the reflection coefficient decreases with the relative wave height within the scope of this experiment when d h 0 05 and 0 the variation trends of the reflection coefficient at h h values of 0 10 and 0 17 are similar while when d h 0 05 the difference in the reflection coefficient is large with the maximum amplitude decreasing to 39 6 indicating that the wave height has a large influence on the reflection coefficient when the aspt breakwater is below the swl 5 2 3 effect of the relative submergence the reflection coefficients of the aspt breakwater vary with the relative submergence at different relative wave heights as presented in fig 15 the results show that the reflection coefficients at relative submergence depths of 0 05 and 0 05 are significantly larger than those at a relative submergence of 0 when h h 0 10 the reflection coefficient is the largest at d h 0 05 with a maximum increase of 1 5 times that at d h 0 when h h 0 17 the reflection coefficient is the largest at d h 0 05 with a maximum increase of 1 4 times that at d h 0 thus the difference in the reflection coefficients at relative submergence depths of 0 05 and 0 05 varies with the relative wave height 5 3 wave pressure 5 3 1 time history fig 16 shows a comparison of the simulated and measured p duration curves for various locations on the upper and lower surfaces of the aspt breakwater when h 0 60 m t 1 2 s h h 0 17 and d h 0 05 the arc shaped plate is above the swl see fig 3 in section 2 2 for the locations of the p measuring points as demonstrated in fig 16 good agreement exists between the simulated and measured p values at each measuring point the nos 1 6 7 and 12 measuring points are below the swl the positive and negative p values at these measuring points are distributed nearly symmetrically with time the no 1 measuring point is located on the upper surface of the arc shaped plate on the incident wave side the locations of the nos 6 and 1 measuring points are symmetrical along the axis in the direction of the wave crest line because the no 6 measuring point is on the upper surface of the arc shaped plate on the back wave side the p value at the no 6 measuring point is lower than that at the no 1 measuring point similarly the p value at the no 12 measuring point is lower than that at the no 7 measuring point the p sensors at the nos 2 3 4 and 5 measuring points are all above the swl the negative p values measured at these points are all 0 the nos 8 9 10 and 11 measuring points are symmetrical to the nos 2 3 4 and 5 measuring points along the axis in the direction of wave propagation respectively the nos 8 9 10 and 11 measuring points are on the lower surface of the arc shaped plate where wave breaking and mixing occur thus certain negative p values exist as a result the positive p values are significantly higher than the negative p values at the nos 8 9 10 and 11 measuring points 5 3 2 distribution of the wave pressure envelope fig 17 shows a comparison of the simulated and measured p envelopes at various locations on the aspt breakwater under various d h values when h 0 60 m t 1 2 s and h h 0 17 p is the average pressure at various measuring points on the aspt breakwater under various conditions unit kpa x is the horizontal distance between a measuring point and the wave facing side apex of the aspt breakwater the nos 1 6 measuring points are located successively on the upper surface of the arc shaped plate from the wave facing side to the back wave side and the nos 7 12 measuring points are located successively on the lower surface of the arc shaped plate from the wave facing side to the back wave side fig 3 as demonstrated in fig 17 the p envelopes calculated using the established numerical model are in good agreement with those obtained from the physical model tests the positive and negative p values on the aspt breakwater are nearly symmetrically distributed under all conditions except for the p envelope on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater when d h 0 05 i e the arc shaped plate is above the swl the positive and negative p values on the aspt breakwater are both greater when the aspt breakwater is at or above the swl than when the arc shaped plate is below the swl mainly due to the following when waves act on the aspt breakwater if the aspt breakwater is at or above the swl these waves will impact the arc shaped plate in the forward direction and climb along the arc shaped plate thereby exerting a relatively large impact force on the arc shaped plate if the aspt breakwater is below the swl the impact of these waves will be relatively weaker under the same conditions both the positive and negative p values exerted by waves are significantly greater on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater than on its lower surface changes in the positive and negative p values at various measuring points on the lower surface of the aspt breakwater are relatively stable when d h 0 05 the difference in the absolute value between positive and negative p values ranges only from 0 06 to 0 21 kpa these positive and negative values at various measuring points on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater vary in an oscillating manner the positive and negative p values at the two sides of the arc shaped plate are relatively high evidently the action of waves on the wave facing and back wave ends of the arc shaped plate is more pronounced the maximum p value approximately 0 40 kpa occurs on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater these findings suggest that the wave facing and back wave ends of aspt breakwaters should be structurally strengthened in practical engineering applications 5 4 wave force 5 4 1 time history fig 18 shows a comparison of the simulated and measured horizontal and vertical wave force duration curves of the aspt breakwater when h 0 60 m t 1 2 s h h 0 17 and d h 0 05 the arc shaped plate is above the swl see section 4 3 for the method used to compute the horizontal and vertical wave forces as demonstrated in fig 18 good agreement exists between the simulated and measured horizontal and vertical wave forces at different relative submergences 5 4 2 effect of the relative plate width fig 19 presents a comparison of the simulated and measured variations in the horizontal and vertical mean f values on the aspt breakwater with w l when h 0 60 m h h 0 10 and 0 17 and d h 0 05 0 and 0 05 as demonstrated the mean f values calculated using the established numerical models are in relatively good agreement with those obtained from the physical model tests under most conditions both the horizontal and vertical mean f increase as w l increases although the vertical mean f increases to a more significant extent the vertical mean f on the aspt breakwater is significantly larger than the horizontal mean f in all cases which occurs because when a wave acts on the aspt breakwater its p acts vertically on the arc shaped plate in its tangent direction and the vertical component of p is higher than its horizontal component therefore the vertical f is greater than the horizontal f after integration h significantly affects the vertical f on the aspt breakwater the vertical f increases as the relative h increases evidently h is an important factor that affects the structural stability of an aspt breakwater at various d h values the vertical positive and negative f values on the aspt breakwater are distributed nearly symmetrically 5 5 flow field fig 20 compares the simulated and measured flow field structures within one period as waves act on the aspt breakwater when h 0 60 m t 1 2 s h h 0 17 and d h 0 05 as demonstrated in fig 20 the established numerical model can satisfactorily simulate changes in the flow field structure surrounding the aspt breakwater at t 1 6t waves act on the wave facing side of the aspt breakwater and water begins to climb along the arc shaped surface because the lower section of the arc shaped plate is permeable there is already relatively notable fluid motion already occurs on the back wave side of the breakwater at t 1 3t a relatively large amount of water rushes to the aspt breakwater forming a notable vortex at the bottom of the back wave side of the arc shaped plate water turbulence is relatively significant the water directly under the arc shaped plate flows to the two sides of the arc shaped plate at t 1 2t water continues to climb and surpasses the wave facing side of the arc shaped plate forming a nappe it then climbs to the apex of the arc shaped plate a small amount of air is mixed in directly under the arc shaped plate the vortex on the back wave side of the arc shaped plate weakens at t 2 3t the water has completely surpassed the arc shaped plate the entire breakwater is under the water surface at t 5 6t water begins to fall along the two sides of the arc shaped plate a small amount of air exists directly under the arc shaped plate relatively significant water turbulence is detected on the two sides of the arc shaped plate at t t the water has almost completely fallen the water turbulence on the two sides of the arc shaped plate weakens the fallen water converges resulting in transient backward motion at this time the fluid in the local area surrounding the arc shaped plate moves in the direction opposite that of the wave propagation 6 conclusions this study presents a numerical model for the interactions between waves and aspt breakwaters that is based on a viscous flow model this numerical model is validated on the basis of physical model test results the hydrodynamic characteristics of the aspt breakwater under the action of a long period wave are discussed systematically the main conclusions derived from this study can be summarized as follows 1 at a fixed relative h and a fixed d h the k t of the aspt breakwater decreases as w l increases whereas its k r slightly increases as w l increases the wave dissipating performance of the aspt breakwater is higher when this breakwater is at or above the swl than when it is below the swl 2 the positive and negative p values at various measuring points on the lower surfaces of the aspt breakwater are distributed nearly symmetrically with respect to the axis where the pressure is equal to zero the p value is higher on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater than on its lower surface the vertical f value is significantly higher than the horizontal f value on the aspt breakwater 3 the aspt breakwater significantly affects the flow field around it within t a notable vortex is formed at the bottom of the back wave side of the aspt breakwater after the water completely falls transient backwater motion occurs resulting from the convergence of the water at this time the fluid surrounding the arc shaped plate moves in a direction opposite that of the wave propagation credit authorship

21218,an experimental and numerical study on the hydrodynamic characteristics of arc shaped plate type aspt breakwaters was carried out the accuracy and reliability of the developed 2d numerical model were verified through experimental results which show the following as the relative plate width increases a decrease in k t and a slight increase in k r occur the maximum increase in the transmission coefficient is approximately 11 the wave height increases by 4 cm when d h 0 05 the difference in the reflection coefficient at h h values of 0 10 and 0 17 is great with the maximum amplitude decreasing to 39 6 the wave pressure p distribution pattern differs significantly between the upper and lower surfaces of the arc shaped plate when d h 0 05 the difference in the absolute value between positive and negative p values ranges only from 0 06 to 0 21 kpa the vertical wave force on the aspt breakwater is significantly greater than the horizontal wave force the flow field distribution differs notably between the wave facing and back wave sides of the aspt breakwater a relatively notable vortex is formed on the back wave side the results of this study can be used as a theoretical reference for the application of aspt breakwaters in engineering keywords arc shaped plate type breakwater wave dissipating performance wave pressure flow field openfoam 1 introduction plate type open breakwaters can effectively dissipate wave energy and thereby protect shorelines and harbor buildings these plate type open breakwater structures adequately consider the fact that over 90 of sea wave energy is concentrated in surface waters and effectively dissipated by disrupting the motion path of water particles gu et al 2016 in addition these breakwaters have a low requirement for foundations and a simple structure are easy to construct are ecologically and environmentally friendly save material and can facilitate free exchange between waters inside and outside a harbor area as a result their hydrodynamic performance has received extensive attention from numerous researchers and engineers carmigniani et al 2019 he et al 2019 regarding flat plate type open breakwaters stoker et al 1957 were the first to theoretically analyze the transmission and reflection coefficients k t and k r respectively of underwater fixed plate type open breakwaters under the action of long waves based on wave energy flow theory qiu et al 1986 derived an analytical expression for single flat plate type open breakwaters at any water depth due to rapid changes in actual ocean tides the engineering application of single flat plate type open breakwaters in waters with wide tidal ranges is limited li et al 2019 fang et al 2017 and gu et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic performance of double and multiflat plate type open breakwaters they found that the k t and k r values of a multiflat plate type open breakwater are significantly affected by the relative plate width as well as the relative submerged depth and relative water depth of the top plate compared to a single flat plate type open breakwater the wave dissipating performance of a multiflat plate type open breakwater with three or more plates is not significantly higher liu et al 2014 fang et al 2017 the relative plate width is the primary factor that affects the k t of a flat plate type open breakwater the maximum wave dissipating performance of a flat plate type open breakwater is realized when it is placed near the static water surface liu et al 2014 he et al 2018a b the abovementioned research results with respect to flat plate type open breakwaters can provide a theoretical reference for studying other types of plate type open breakwaters in addition to flat plate type open breakwaters experts and researchers have studied the wave dissipating performance of vertical π shaped u shaped upside down t shaped and t shaped plate type open breakwaters koh et al 2016 an et al 2013 their results reveal the following multivertical plate type open breakwaters can significantly dissipate incident wave energy the wave reflecting performance of symmetrical double oblique plate type open breakwaters is higher than that of single oblique plate type open breakwaters but lower than that of symmetrical double vertical plate type open breakwaters karmakar et al 2012 gayen et al 2016 the wave reflecting performance of symmetrical double oblique plate type open breakwaters is higher than that of single oblique plate type open breakwaters but lower than that of double vertical plate type open breakwaters karmakar et al 2012 gayen et al 2016 based on the bragg resonance conditions a multivertical plate type open breakwater has the minimum k t and the maximum wave dissipating performance when the spacing between vertical plates is set to half the wavelength of the incident wave and the wavelength of the incident wave is close to twice the spacing between vertical plates xu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 for a t shaped plate type open breakwater the vertical plate height significantly affects its wave dissipating performance zhan et al 2017 t shaped plate type open breakwaters outperform upside down t shaped plate type open breakwaters in wave dissipation and can block 20 30 more incident wave energy neelamani et al 2002 through physical model tests günaydın et al 2004 2007 studied u and π shaped plate type open breakwaters and determined the relationships between k t k r and the wave dissipation coefficient open breakwaters and their hydrodynamic performance have always been an important topic in the ocean engineering field he et al 2018a b rey et al 2011 inspired by semicircular breakwaters jiang et al 2017 kundapura et al 2019 wang et al 2016 proposed an arc shaped plate type aspt open breakwater its primary structural feature is the use of arc shaped plates rather than flat plates with various curvature radii as the top wave dissipating structure of the plate type open breakwater the k t of an aspt open breakwater can be maintained below 0 5 at a relative plate width of 0 2 in addition reducing the spacing between arc shaped plates can help improve the wave dissipating performance of the plate type open breakwater the number of plates has no significant impact on the wave dissipating performance of the plate type open breakwater wang et al 2019 studied the interactions between waves and aspt open breakwaters using the boundary element method based on potential flow theory they found that at a submerged depth wave height ratio of 0 05 the wave dissipating performance of an upper aspt open breakwater was approximately 50 higher than that of a flat plate type open breakwater however wang et al 2019 investigated wave dissipation only when a single aspt open breakwater is below the still water surface and did not examine the wave dissipating performance when the top of the open breakwater is placed at various positions relative to the still water surface with the development of high performance computers and the maturation of numerical simulation techniques viscous flow models based on the navier stokes equations have been used in numerical simulations of some wave breaking phenomena bihs et al 2016 vermeire et al 2017 waves break when acting on plate type open breakwaters higuera et al 2015 li et al 2019 used a viscous flow model to compare the wave dissipating performance of arc shaped and flat plate type open breakwaters and found that aspt open breakwaters when placed above or slightly above the still water surface significantly outperform flat plate type open breakwaters in terms of wave dissipation to date very few systematic studies on the hydrodynamic performance of aspt open breakwaters have been reported

were conducted in the multifunctional wave current tank fig 1 at the port coastal and offshore engineering experimental center of ludong university the dimensions of the tank were as shown in fig 1 one end of the tank was equipped with a servo motor driven absorption paddle type wave generator capable of generating stable continuous regular waves gravel average gravel particle size 100 150 mm was placed at the other end of the tank to eliminate wall end reflection the dimensions of the gravel beach were as shwn in fig 1 the physical tank was divided into two small tanks one with a width of 0 8 m and the other with a width of 1 2 m the experimental study was carried out in a small tank with a width of 0 8 m the monitoring equipment used in the tests included ds30 multipoint wave height h measuring systems and ds30 multipoint pressure p measuring systems the sampling interval was set to 0 02 s according to the goda two point method goda et al 1976 two wave gauges 1 and 2 spaced 0 74 m apart were placed on the wave facing side of the breakwater model the 2 wave gauge was 4 46 m from the front end of the open breakwater the wave reflection coefficient k r was calculated based on the measurements of the 1 and 2 wave gauges one wave gauge 3 was placed on the back wave side of the breakwater model the 3 wave gauge was 4 46 m from the back end of the open breakwater the wave transmission coefficient k t was calculated based on the measurements of the 3 wave gauge 2 2 model parameters the aspt breakwater model used in the tests was fabricated using polymethyl methacrylate fig 2 a the main model parameters are as shown in fig 2b a width of 0 025 m was reserved at each of the wave facing and back wave edges of the model where circular holes were drilled for the screws used to fix the arc shaped plate fig 2b during the tests the height of the arc shaped plate was varied by adjusting the position of the nuts to vary the submerged depth d of the aspt breakwater six circular holes 0 02 m in diameter were drilled into both the upper and lower surfaces of the breakwater to fix the wave pressure p sensors fig 3 shows the arrangement of the p measuring points the p sensors at the nos 1 6 and 7 12 measuring points were used to monitor p on the upper and lower surfaces of the arc shaped plate respectively 2 3 test parameters regular waves were used in the tests the test parameters were given in table 1 in this study d is defined as the distance between the line tangent to the apex of the arc shaped plate and the static water level swl a positive d means that the apex of the arc shaped plate is above the swl while a negative d means that the apex of the arc shaped plate is below the swl fig 2b a total of 60 groups of tests with various combinations of wave parameters were designed to reduce the number of test errors three tests were conducted in each group the results of which were averaged table 1 summarizes the main physical parameters used in this study 3 numerical model openfoam an open source program is used to study the interactions between waves and the aspt breakwater the governing equations boundary conditions validation of the wave generation and dissipation mesh independence analysis and 2d model construction are elaborated in the following sections the relevant test parameters are the same as the physical model see the test parameters section for details 3 1 governing equations continuity and reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are used as the fluid governing equations a cartesian coordinate system is also used the positive x axis direction is the wave propagation direction and the y axis indicates the vertical direction relative to the tank the upward direction is positive the model adopted is similar to that of sun et al 2019 the following are the governing equations 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u μ u ρ τ c κ α g x ρ p ρ g h s where u is the average velocity vector t is time ρ τ is the reynolds stress term τ

the pressure point of a structure is at the free surface p ρ g h represents the hydrodynamic pressure which is expressed as follows 3 p ρ g h p ρ g x 3 2 boundary conditions the 2d numerical model contains four types of boundary conditions 1 dynamic boundary conditions at the wave generation end of the tank similar to the paddle type wave generator the boundary can move back and forth and generate the target waves the velocity of the mesh cells adjacent to the dynamic boundary is consistent with the moving velocity of the boundary i e 4 u w a l l u w a l l based on linear wave theory the following relationship between the height of a regular wave and the stroke of the paddle is obtained biesel and suquet 1951 5 h t h s 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d where h t is referred to as the transfer function h is the height of the regular wave s is the stroke of the wave generation paddle k is the wavenumber and d is the water depth assuming that the wave generation paddle is in simple harmonic motion the wave surface equation for regular waves is as follows 6 η x t h 2 cos k x ω t by setting the position of the wave generation paddle to x 0 the displacement and velocity functions of the wave generation paddle are obtained as follows 7 x t s 2 sin ω t 8 u t s 2 ω cos ω t where t is time and ω is the circular frequency of the target wave 2 wave dissipation conditions at the end of the tank the damping layer wave dissipation method is used in this numerical model that is a wave dissipation source term i e s in eq 2 is added to the momentum equation to allow the wave velocity in the wave dissipation region to decrease gradually the wave dissipation source term is expressed as follows 9 s ρ u χ 10 χ χ 1 x x 0 l s x x 0 0 x x 0 where ρ is the density u is the velocity vector χ is an attenuation function χ 1 is an attenuation coefficient x is the horizontal coordinate of the cartesian coordinate system x 0 is the horizontal coordinate of the starting point of the damping wave dissipation region and l s is the length of the damping wave dissipation region preferably l s is 1 2 times the wavelength sun et al 2019 thus the attenuation coefficient is set to 5 in this study 3 free surface conditions in this numerical model the volume of fluid method is employed to track the free surface of the fluid the mesh cells at the free surface are filled with air and fluid the volume fraction of the fluid α the density of the fluid mixture ρ and the dynamic viscosity μ can be expressed as follows 11 ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ α μ α μ w 1 α μ α where ρ w and ρ α are the densities of water and air respectively ρ w 1000 kg m3 and ρ α 1 205 kg m3 and μw and μα are the dynamic viscosities of water and air respectively μw 1 01 10 3 pa s and μα 17 9 10 6 pa s 4 fixed wall boundary conditions in this numerical model no slip conditions are applied to both the sidewalls and bottom of the numerical tank in addition for the sidewalls and bottom of the numerical tank their velocity and pressure satisfy the following equations 12 u w a l l 0 13 p n w a l l 0 3 3 validation of wave generation and dissipation a 2d numerical model of an empty tank 12 m in length and 0 8 m in height is established fig 4 this model is then used to simulate the generation and propagation of regular waves under the following conditions h 0 60 m h 0 10 m and t 2 0 s in addition the numerical results for locations x 2 4 9 and 11 7 m away from the wave generation paddle are compared with the theoretical values for second order stokes waves fig 5 the results reveal the following the wave profiles measured by the nos 1 x 2 m and 2 x 4 m wave gauges are in good agreement with the theoretical values this result suggests that continuous stable reliable regular waves can be generated in the established numerical tank the no 3 wave gauge x 9 m is located near the starting end of the damping wave dissipation region the wave profile measured by this wave gauge is significantly lower than the theoretical value the no 4 wave gauge x 11 7 m is located at the end of the tank i e the terminating end of the damping wave dissipation region the wave surface elevation measured by this wave gauge approaches 0 which suggests that the wave energy is almost completely consumed evidently the damping wave dissipation region can eliminate the reflection by the wall at the end of the tank 3 4 mesh independence analysis meshes were generated for the numerical empty bank model length 12 m height 0 8 m established in section 3 3 fig 4 using four mesh generations given in table 1 the mesh cell scale in the incident wave direction the number of mesh cells in the incident wave direction the mesh cell scale in the h direction the number of mesh cells in the h direction and the mesh generation unit are denoted by x n x y n y and m respectively see table 2 for details numerical models of the four mesh resolutions were used to simulate regular waves under the following conditions h 0 60 m h 0 10 m and t 1 20 s in addition the wave profiles at x 6 m were measured as demonstrated in fig 6 the wave profiles at the normal mesh resolution after two mesh refinements are significantly higher than the results calculated using the models at the very coarse and coarse mesh resolutions in addition the wave profiles calculated using the regular mesh generation model are in almost complete agreement with those calculated using the fine mesh generation model this result suggests that the regular mesh resolution established in this study can meet the accuracy requirements of numerical calculations 3 5 2d numerical model construction the above method is used to establish a 2d numerical model for the interactions between waves and an aspt breakwater see the model parameters described in section 2 2 for the specific dimension of this breakwater the test parameters given in section 2 3 are used as wave elements in the numerical tests the established numerical tank is 12 m in length and 0 8 m in height the wave facing side of the aspt breakwater is 6 3 m away from the wave generation paddle two wave gauges 1 and 2 and one wave gauge 3 are placed on the wave facing and back wave sides respectively at the same positions as those in the physical model tests under various conditions fig 7 shows the arrangement of the numerical tank model the regular mesh scale validated using the empty tank model is used to generate a mesh for the established numerical aspt breakwater model the mesh cells near the swl are refined to accurately capture changes in the free surface the mesh cells surrounding the aspt breakwater are refined to address the problem of boundary layers surrounding the structure fig 8 shows the mesh generated for the local areas surrounding the breakwater 4 data analysis and evaluation 4 1 method for computing the transmission coefficient based on the h duration curve measured by the no 3 wave gauge behind the aspt breakwater the transmitted wave height h t on the back wave side of the breakwater is calculated using the upward zero crossing method on this basis k t is calculated using eq 14 14 k t h t h i where h t is the transmitted h and h i is the incident h 4 2 method for computing the reflection coefficient based on the h duration curves measured by the nos 1 and 2 wave gauges on the wave facing side of the aspt breakwater the incident h h i and reflected h h r on the wave facing side of the aspt breakwater are separated using the goda two point method goda et al 1976 the k r of the breakwater is calculated using eq 15 15 k r h r h i where h r is the reflected h and h i is the incident h 4 3 method for computing the wave force based on the instantaneous wave pressure at different measuring points on the upper and lower surfaces of the aspt breakwater the wave force acting on the area impacted by the wave pressure represented by each measuring point is calculated the wave force is projected in the horizontal direction and vertical direction and synchronous integration is performed along the horizontal direction and vertical direction thus the instantaneous horizontal and vertical wave forces on the aspt breakwater are calculated the wave force calculated in this paper is the mean wave force per unit length of the breakwater along the direction of the crest line under the action of regular waves the breakwater is subjected to uniform forces along the direction of the crest line thus the pressure measuring points are evenly arranged on both sides of the centerline along the direction of the crest line to measure the wave pressures on the upper and lower surfaces respectively and then the wave forces on the breakwater are obtained by integrating and summing these pressures the specific calculation method is as follows according to each instantaneous wave pressure at different measuring points of the aspt breakwater the wave force on the action area is represented by each pressure measuring point the wave forces are decomposed and integrated synchronously along the horizontal and vertical directions to obtain the instantaneous horizontal and vertical wave forces of the aspt breakwater the calculation diagram of the wave force on the aspt breakwater is shown in fig 9 for simplicity of description only 6 measuring points on the lower surface of the aspt breakwater are given in fig 9 the treatment method for the 6 measuring points on the upper surface is the same the aspt breakwater is divided into 6 microarcs and the center point of each section is the position of 6 pressure measuring points assuming that the pressure values on each microarc are the same they are all wave pressure values monitored by the pressure measuring points of this section in fig 9 the arc radius of the aspt breakwater is r 0 26 m p i represents the wave pressure on the microarc l i represents the length of the microarc θ i represents the angle between the wave pressure direction and the positive direction of the x axis and i represents the number of measuring points via the central angle formula θ i n 180 l i π r the direction angle of the wave pressure on each measuring point is calculated the wave pressure direction angle and microarc length are shown in table 3 taking microarc l 5 as an example each instantaneous wave force f 5 can be calculated by eq 16 16 f 5 p 5 l 5 the instantaneous wave forces on microarc l 5 are decomposed along the horizontal and vertical directions and the component forces in each instantaneous horizontal and vertical direction can be obtained see eqs 17 and 18 for details 17 f 5 x f 5 cos θ 5 18 f 5 y f 5 sin θ 5 by summing the wave forces synchronously along the horizontal and vertical directions the instantaneous horizontal wave forces f x and vertical wave forces f y of the aspt breakwater can be obtained as shown in eqs 19 and 20 19 f x i 1 12 f i x 20 f y i 1 12 f i y 5 results and discussion 5 1 transmission coefficient 5 1 1 effect of the relative plate width fig 10 shows the transmission coefficient comparison of the numerical and experimental results of the aspt breakwater with the w l at h h values of 0 10 and 0 17 and d h values of 0 05 0 and 0 05 w l is the ratio of the horizontal width w of the arc shaped plate to l when h t and h are known l can be determined from the dispersion relationship as demonstrated in fig 10 the simulated k t is in relatively good agreement with the measured k t under various conditions the relative w l significantly affects k t as w l increases k t decreases the k t of the aspt breakwater is relatively high under some conditions to inspect the shape effect the macagno equation 1953 was used for comparison as presented in fig 10 under the same conditions the transmission coefficient of the aspt breakwater is much smaller than the results of macagno s theory 1953 the aspt breakwater is clearly superior in terms of the wave attenuation performance 5 1 2 effect of the relative wave height the variation in the transmission coefficients of the aspt breakwater with the relative height for the tested relative submergence is presented in fig 11 the results show that the transmission coefficient increases with the relative wave height for 100 of the experimental tests the maximum increase is approximately 11 i e the wave height increases by 4 cm as a result the relative wave height has a significant impact on the transmission coefficients of the aspt breakwater more water will cross the aspt breakwater because more wave energy is carried by larger waves when larger waves encounter the aspt breakwater therefore the transmission coefficient is also larger under the action of a larger wave 5 1 3 effect of the relative submergence the transmission coefficients of the aspt breakwater vary with the relative submergence at different wave heights as shown in fig 12 the results reveal that the transmission coefficients at a relative submergence depth of 0 05 are significantly larger than those at relative submergences of 0 05 and 0 the range of increase is approximately 4 8 34 7 the transmission coefficient of the aspt breakwater at the still water surface and at 0 05 m above the still water surface is significantly better than that at 0 05 m below the still water surface therefore the relative submergence has a significant influence on the transmission coefficient of the aspt breakwater with the aspt breakwater located above the still water surface the barrier effect on waves is larger than that produced from the aspt breakwater located under the still water surface as a result the transmission coefficient is smaller when the aspt breakwater is located above the still water surface 5 2 reflection coefficient 5 2 1 effect of the relative plate width fig 13 shows the reflection coefficient comparison of the simulated and measured variations in k r of the aspt breakwater with w l at h h values of 0 10 and 0 17 and d h values of 0 05 0 and 0 05 as demonstrated in fig 13 the simulated k r is in relatively good agreement with the measured k r under most conditions the k r of the aspt breakwater increases as w l increases when d h 0 05 i e the arc shaped plate is above the swl and h h 0 10 no notable trend in the variation in k r with w l can be observed clearly increasing w l can more effectively increase the wave reflection and improve the wave dissipating performance of the aspt breakwater 5 2 2 effect of the relative wave height the variation in the reflection coefficients of the aspt breakwater with the relative wave height is predicted in fig 14 the results show that the reflection coefficient decreases with the relative wave height within the scope of this experiment when d h 0 05 and 0 the variation trends of the reflection coefficient at h h values of 0 10 and 0 17 are similar while when d h 0 05 the difference in the reflection coefficient is large with the maximum amplitude decreasing to 39 6 indicating that the wave height has a large influence on the reflection coefficient when the aspt breakwater is below the swl 5 2 3 effect of the relative submergence the reflection coefficients of the aspt breakwater vary with the relative submergence at different relative wave heights as presented in fig 15 the results show that the reflection coefficients at relative submergence depths of 0 05 and 0 05 are significantly larger than those at a relative submergence of 0 when h h 0 10 the reflection coefficient is the largest at d h 0 05 with a maximum increase of 1 5 times that at d h 0 when h h 0 17 the reflection coefficient is the largest at d h 0 05 with a maximum increase of 1 4 times that at d h 0 thus the difference in the reflection coefficients at relative submergence depths of 0 05 and 0 05 varies with the relative wave height 5 3 wave pressure 5 3 1 time history fig 16 shows a comparison of the simulated and measured p duration curves for various locations on the upper and lower surfaces of the aspt breakwater when h 0 60 m t 1 2 s h h 0 17 and d h 0 05 the arc shaped plate is above the swl see fig 3 in section 2 2 for the locations of the p measuring points as demonstrated in fig 16 good agreement exists between the simulated and measured p values at each measuring point the nos 1 6 7 and 12 measuring points are below the swl the positive and negative p values at these measuring points are distributed nearly symmetrically with time the no 1 measuring point is located on the upper surface of the arc shaped plate on the incident wave side the locations of the nos 6 and 1 measuring points are symmetrical along the axis in the direction of the wave crest line because the no 6 measuring point is on the upper surface of the arc shaped plate on the back wave side the p value at the no 6 measuring point is lower than that at the no 1 measuring point similarly the p value at the no 12 measuring point is lower than that at the no 7 measuring point the p sensors at the nos 2 3 4 and 5 measuring points are all above the swl the negative p values measured at these points are all 0 the nos 8 9 10 and 11 measuring points are symmetrical to the nos 2 3 4 and 5 measuring points along the axis in the direction of wave propagation respectively the nos 8 9 10 and 11 measuring points are on the lower surface of the arc shaped plate where wave breaking and mixing occur thus certain negative p values exist as a result the positive p values are significantly higher than the negative p values at the nos 8 9 10 and 11 measuring points 5 3 2 distribution of the wave pressure envelope fig 17 shows a comparison of the simulated and measured p envelopes at various locations on the aspt breakwater under various d h values when h 0 60 m t 1 2 s and h h 0 17 p is the average pressure at various measuring points on the aspt breakwater under various conditions unit kpa x is the horizontal distance between a measuring point and the wave facing side apex of the aspt breakwater the nos 1 6 measuring points are located successively on the upper surface of the arc shaped plate from the wave facing side to the back wave side and the nos 7 12 measuring points are located successively on the lower surface of the arc shaped plate from the wave facing side to the back wave side fig 3 as demonstrated in fig 17 the p envelopes calculated using the established numerical model are in good agreement with those obtained from the physical model tests the positive and negative p values on the aspt breakwater are nearly symmetrically distributed under all conditions except for the p envelope on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater when d h 0 05 i e the arc shaped plate is above the swl the positive and negative p values on the aspt breakwater are both greater when the aspt breakwater is at or above the swl than when the arc shaped plate is below the swl mainly due to the following when waves act on the aspt breakwater if the aspt breakwater is at or above the swl these waves will impact the arc shaped plate in the forward direction and climb along the arc shaped plate thereby exerting a relatively large impact force on the arc shaped plate if the aspt breakwater is below the swl the impact of these waves will be relatively weaker under the same conditions both the positive and negative p values exerted by waves are significantly greater on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater than on its lower surface changes in the positive and negative p values at various measuring points on the lower surface of the aspt breakwater are relatively stable when d h 0 05 the difference in the absolute value between positive and negative p values ranges only from 0 06 to 0 21 kpa these positive and negative values at various measuring points on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater vary in an oscillating manner the positive and negative p values at the two sides of the arc shaped plate are relatively high evidently the action of waves on the wave facing and back wave ends of the arc shaped plate is more pronounced the maximum p value approximately 0 40 kpa occurs on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater these findings suggest that the wave facing and back wave ends of aspt breakwaters should be structurally strengthened in practical engineering applications 5 4 wave force 5 4 1 time history fig 18 shows a comparison of the simulated and measured horizontal and vertical wave force duration curves of the aspt breakwater when h 0 60 m t 1 2 s h h 0 17 and d h 0 05 the arc shaped plate is above the swl see section 4 3 for the method used to compute the horizontal and vertical wave forces as demonstrated in fig 18 good agreement exists between the simulated and measured horizontal and vertical wave forces at different relative submergences 5 4 2 effect of the relative plate width fig 19 presents a comparison of the simulated and measured variations in the horizontal and vertical mean f values on the aspt breakwater with w l when h 0 60 m h h 0 10 and 0 17 and d h 0 05 0 and 0 05 as demonstrated the mean f values calculated using the established numerical models are in relatively good agreement with those obtained from the physical model tests under most conditions both the horizontal and vertical mean f increase as w l increases although the vertical mean f increases to a more significant extent the vertical mean f on the aspt breakwater is significantly larger than the horizontal mean f in all cases which occurs because when a wave acts on the aspt breakwater its p acts vertically on the arc shaped plate in its tangent direction and the vertical component of p is higher than its horizontal component therefore the vertical f is greater than the horizontal f after integration h significantly affects the vertical f on the aspt breakwater the vertical f increases as the relative h increases evidently h is an important factor that affects the structural stability of an aspt breakwater at various d h values the vertical positive and negative f values on the aspt breakwater are distributed nearly symmetrically 5 5 flow field fig 20 compares the simulated and measured flow field structures within one period as waves act on the aspt breakwater when h 0 60 m t 1 2 s h h 0 17 and d h 0 05 as demonstrated in fig 20 the established numerical model can satisfactorily simulate changes in the flow field structure surrounding the aspt breakwater at t 1 6t waves act on the wave facing side of the aspt breakwater and water begins to climb along the arc shaped surface because the lower section of the arc shaped plate is permeable there is already relatively notable fluid motion already occurs on the back wave side of the breakwater at t 1 3t a relatively large amount of water rushes to the aspt breakwater forming a notable vortex at the bottom of the back wave side of the arc shaped plate water turbulence is relatively significant the water directly under the arc shaped plate flows to the two sides of the arc shaped plate at t 1 2t water continues to climb and surpasses the wave facing side of the arc shaped plate forming a nappe it then climbs to the apex of the arc shaped plate a small amount of air is mixed in directly under the arc shaped plate the vortex on the back wave side of the arc shaped plate weakens at t 2 3t the water has completely surpassed the arc shaped plate the entire breakwater is under the water surface at t 5 6t water begins to fall along the two sides of the arc shaped plate a small amount of air exists directly under the arc shaped plate relatively significant water turbulence is detected on the two sides of the arc shaped plate at t t the water has almost completely fallen the water turbulence on the two sides of the arc shaped plate weakens the fallen water converges resulting in transient backward motion at this time the fluid in the local area surrounding the arc shaped plate moves in the direction opposite that of the wave propagation 6 conclusions this study presents a numerical model for the interactions between waves and aspt breakwaters that is based on a viscous flow model this numerical model is validated on the basis of physical model test results the hydrodynamic characteristics of the aspt breakwater under the action of a long period wave are discussed systematically the main conclusions derived from this study can be summarized as follows 1 at a fixed relative h and a fixed d h the k t of the aspt breakwater decreases as w l increases whereas its k r slightly increases as w l increases the wave dissipating performance of the aspt breakwater is higher when this breakwater is at or above the swl than when it is below the swl 2 the positive and negative p values at various measuring points on the lower surfaces of the aspt breakwater are distributed nearly symmetrically with respect to the axis where the pressure is equal to zero the p value is higher on the upper surface of the aspt breakwater than on its lower surface the vertical f value is significantly higher than the horizontal f value on the aspt breakwater 3 the aspt breakwater

the kriging model by the aid of the gradient information of geometric constraints which further improves the optimization efficiency finally the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework is verified by performing the shape optimization of a bwbug keywords underwater glider optimization design shape parameterization hydrodynamic analysis kriging model 1 introduction with the development of human society and the depletion of resources on land the development and utilization of marine resources have been paid more and more attention around the world as a new type of underwater vehicle autonomous underwater glider aug wood et al 2007 bachmayer et al 2004 2006 leonard et al 2007 has a small demand for energy and can navigate efficiently in the ocean for a long time because of its low manufacturing cost and maintenance cost aug can be reused and deployed in a large amount recently it has played an increasingly important role in large scale ocean exploration and monitoring the basic working principle of aug is to convert the lift generated by hydrofoil into the power to move it forward so the lift drag ratio has an important impact on the horizontal range of aug the blended wing body underwater glider bwbug sun et al 2015 has a flat fuselage with wing profile shape and the hydrofoil smoothly blends with the fuselage compared with the traditional underwater glider which is composed of revolving body and hydrofoils bwbug has a higher lift drag ratio and can glide a longer horizontal distance to further explore the high lift drag ratio characteristics of bwbug the optimization design method chengshan et al 2018 is gradually applied to its shape design and plays an increasingly important role the shape optimization design of bwbug mainly consists of three parts shape hydrodynamic analysis shape parametric modeling and optimization method the shape hydrodynamic analysis is a subject which uses computers to carry on numerical calculations to solve the force acting on bwbug in the flow field and then to calculate the corresponding objective and constraint functions in the optimization the shape parametric modeling is to define and express the shape of bwbug with a set of design parameters through certain functional relationship and then transforms the shape optimization design process into the optimization of this set of design parameters the optimization method is the top level structure of the shape optimization design which controls the operation of the whole optimization design and determines the development direction of the optimization at present computational fluid dynamics cfd method has become the commonly hydrodynamic analysis method with the rapid development of computer technology its basic idea is to generate the volume grid in the computational fluid domain and build a large scale discrete algebraic equation on the volume grid to compute the hydrodynamic parameters because cfd method has the advantage of low cost and short cycle compared with the experimental fluid dynamics method it was widely used in the shape optimization design such as the turbine optimization alizadeh et al 2020 madsen et al 2019 the ship optimization guo et al 2019 the aircraft optimization benaouali and kachel 2019 and so on in the shape optimization bwbug it was also applied to perform the hydrodynamic performance prediction and a series of research achievements was obtained xiong et al 2013 seo et al 2008 computer aided design cad is the most used method of shape parameterization it mainly relies on ug catia and other commercial cad software to generate shape automatically through secondary development li et al 2005 haimes and drela 2013 gu gu et al 2009 defined the shape and size parameters of the underwater glider as state variables and directly drove catia parametric program to complete the geometric parametric modeling of the underwater glider lu lv et al 2018 also used cad software to carry out the parametric study of the underwater glider however cad method needs use finite difference method to compute the surface sensitivities thus subjecting the sensitivities to truncation and round off errors truong 2014 in addition the cost of finite difference method is not negligible considering that each geometry regeneration can take several seconds or even minutes to complete alonso et al 2003 gagnon 2015 another kind of shape parameterization method mainly consists of nurbs non uniform rational b splines t splines and so on which are tailored to the objects of optimum design such as ship katsoulis et al 2019 yacht cirello a m 2008 and marine propellers arapakopoulos et al 2019 due to the advantages of low development difficulty and easy modularization intelligent optimization method has become the most widely used optimization method nowadays its main idea is to simulate some natural phenomena or physical processes to achieve the search and approximation of the optimal solution fu fu et al 2018 set eight optimization variables and optimized the shape of the underwater glider using nsgaii non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii tang tang et al 2018 set seven optimization variables and used beso bi directional evolutionary structural optimization method to optimize the shell of the underwater glider theoretically this kind of optimization method can converge to the global optimal solution but it needs more iterations and calculations in the optimization process which is only suitable for the optimization design of the shape of underwater glider with few variables mentioned aiming to reduce the computation consumption in the optimization process the optimization methods based on the surrogate model haftka et al 2016 forrester et al 2008 have been widely developed in recent years they mainly use the surrogate model to replace the time consuming numerical simulation analysis and add new samples according to certain criteria in the optimization process to iteratively update the surrogate model wang wang et al 2017 set up 9 design variables and used gaussian kernel function to establish the surrogate model of the flying underwater glider which was optimized through particle swarm optimization sun and li sun et al 2015 2017 set up 10 design variables and used kriging model to perform the hydrodynamic shape optimization of the underwater glider however when the shape optimization problem of bwbug has more geometric constraints how to develop a more efficient optimization method based on the characteristics of geometric constraints is worth to further study to increase the lift drag ratio of the bwbug maximally and improve the cfd based optimization efficiency this paper proposes a kriging based shape optimization framework for the bwbug with nurbs based parametrization firstly based on the theory of nurbs a parameterization method of bwbug shape is proposed to realize the flexible shape deformation according to the physical geometric meaning moreover the calculation formulation of geometric constraints and corresponding gradients is derived to improve the computational efficiency compared with cad parameterization method secondly the cfd based numerical model is built to perform the hydrodynamic analysis of bwbug and the mesh independence is studied thirdly an optimization framework based on kriging model is built to optimize the shape of bwbug in the presented optimization framework the kriging model is updated iteratively with sample points infilled dynamically by gradient optimization algorithm to further improve the optimization efficiency finally the optimal design of one bwbug is carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method and optimization framework 2 shape parametrization of bwbug in this section the shape parameterization method of bwbug is presented it is mainly composed of three parts the basic theory of nurbs the nurbs based geometric parametrization method the calculation method of geometric constraints and its gradients which are described in detail in the following part 2 1 nurbs theory compared with the b spline method the nurbs method can accurately represent the conic section and the elementary analytic surface which overcomes the uncertainty of the b spline method and makes the curve and surface have a unified mathematical description form for geometric definition of industrial product piegl and tiller 1997 farin et al 2002 at present it is widely used in the field of geometric modeling of automobile aircraft ship and other industries piegl 1991 shi et al 2013 kumar et al 2001 gagnon and zingg 2013 a nurbs curve of degree p is defined as follows piegl and tiller 1997 1 c u i 0 n n i p u w i p i i 0 n n i p u w i 0 u 1 where w i is the weights and w i 0 p i is the control point coordinate n i p u is the p th degree b spline basis function defined on the nonuniform knot vector 2 u 0 0 p 1 u p 1 u m p 1 1 1 p 1 a nurbs surface of degree p in the u direction and degree q in the v direction is defined in the following form piegl and tiller 1997 3 s u v i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j p i j i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j 0 u v 1 where w i j is the weight p i j forms a bidirectional control net n i p u and n j p v are the nonrational b spline basis functions defined on the following knot vectors 4 u 0 0 p 1 u p 1 u r p 1 1 1 p 1 v 0 0 q 1 u q 1 u s q 1 1 1 q 1 from above nurbs method can easily modify the geometric shape by changing the control points and weights it also has the characteristics of high accuracy and efficiency in parametric modeling of complex geometry therefore nurbs method is chosen to be the underlying tool for the geometric parametrization of bwbug 2 2 nurbs based geometric parametrization for the bwbug its fuselage adopts a flat ellipsoid shape and is smoothly connected with the wing to obtain a high lift drag ratio this shape has a significant feature each cross section is composed of the airfoil section based on the basic theory of nurbs the three dimensional geometric parametrization of bwbug is realized by the following five steps 1 parameterization of airfoil curve assuming that q k x k y k 0 k l are the l 1 data points of an initial airfoil curve and sequentially arranged on the airfoil curve with the trailing edge as the starting and ending point through the global approximation theory of nurbs seek a nurbs curve of degree p 5 c u i 0 n n i p u w i p i i 0 n n i p u w i 0 u 1 satisfying that q 0 c 0 q l c 1 and the remaining data points is approximated in the least squares sense with the given number of p i 6 k 1 l 1 q k c u k 2 where u k 0 k l is the parameter value of each data points q k which can be obtained by the deboor method piegl and tiller 1997 note that p i is chosen as the parameterized variable of airfoil curve and its number can be freely given according to the designer s parametric demand 2 set the thickness and chord length of each airfoil section use x y z to represent chordwise vertical and spanwise directions respectively and define the airfoil obtained by step 1 on the x y plane then the coordinate value of the j th control point on the i th airfoil can be denoted as p i j x i j y i j 0 t after applying the chord length factor s i and the thickness factor t i to modify the chord length and thickness of the i th airfoil respectively the modified coordinate value b i j of the j th control point on the i th airfoil can be expressed by the following formula 7 b i j 1 0 0 0 t i 0 0 0 1 s i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 p i j 3 set the rotation angle for each airfoil section use θ i α i β i γ i t to denote the rotation angle of the i th airfoil profile on the x y z axes then the coordinate value c i j obtained by rotating the control points b i j can be computed by the following formula 8 c i j 1 0 0 0 cos β i sin β i 0 sin β i cos β i cos α i 0 sin α i 0 1 0 sin α i 0 cos α i cos γ i sin γ i 0 sin γ i cos γ i 0 0 0 1 b i j 4 set the placement position of each airfoil section use t i a i b i c i t to indicate the placement position of the i th airfoil then the coordinates of the j th control point of the i th airfoil is determined by 9 d i j c i j t i 5 based on the nurbs surface equation the shape of bwbug can be expressed as the following mathematical expression 10 s u v i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j d i j i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j in summary the parametric modeling process of bwbug is mainly realized by manipulating the control points of each airfoil section through local and global parameterization variables which are described in detail in table 1 fig 1 shows the parameterization diagram of one bwbug in which the red dot is the value of d i j in formula 10 the shape in fig 1 will be deformed with the change of parametric variables in table 1 2 3 calculation of geometric constraints and gradients due to the internal loading requirements of bwbug the corresponding thickness constraints need to be set at different positions if these constraints can be calculated quickly and accurately the optimization efficiency can be improved based on the method of geometric parametrization in section 2 2 this paper proposes an efficient and accurate method for calculating thickness constraints and their gradients suppose that the thickness constraints g i t h i c k i t h i c k 0 0 i 1 n c need to be set at the coordinates x i 0 z i in x z plane where t h i c k i is the geometric thickness between the upper and lower surfaces of bwbug as the blue line shown in fig 2 t h i c k 0 is the thickness value set according to the equipment installation requirements before calculating the thickness constraint g i the parametric coordinates u i v i of the point x i 0 z i need to be determined in advance by solving inversely the following equation 11 s x u i v i x i 0 s z u i v i z i 0 because the bwbug has upper and lower surfaces there are two solutions located on the upper and lower surfaces respectively when solving equation 11 if u i 1 v i 1 is the solution on the upper surface and u i 2 v i 2 is the solution on the lower surface then the thickness constraint located at the coordinate x i 0 z i is 12 g i s y u i 1 v i 1 s y u i 2 v i 2 t h i c k 0 one of the main advantages of using nurbs surface to parameterize the shape of bwbug is that it can derive the gradient analytical expression for any point on the surface based on formula 10 the gradient expression of surface point located at parametric coordinates u v with respect to variables d i j can be computed by the following formula 13 s u v d i j n i p u n j p v w i j i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j furthermore the gradient expression of geometric constraint g i with respect to parametric variables p i j s i t i θ i t i can be obtained as follows 14 g i p i j d i j p i j s y u i 1 v i 1 d i j d i j p i j s y u i 2 v i 2 d i j 15 g i a j 0 n d i j a s y u i 1 v i 1 d i j j 0 n d i j a s y u i 2 v i 2 d i j where a represents the arbitrary variable among s i t i θ i and t i 3 cfd based hydrodynamic analysis 3 1 cfd solver the commercial software fine marine is chosen to perform the hydrodynamic analysis in this paper because the bwbug sails at a low speed of 1kn in the ocean the water is set as the fluid and the impressible model is selected to carry out the numerical simulations the density and dynamic viscosity of water are set by 998 2 k g m 3 and 1 003 10 3 p a s respectively the governing equations of mass conservation and momentum conservation for the impressible flow are expressed in the following formula 16 16 u i x i 0 u i t x j u i u j 1 ρ p x i μ x j u i x j u j x i x j u i u j the above governing equations is solved by adopting the s s t k w turbulence model which has great advantages in predicting inverse pressure gradient flow and separation flow the convergence criteria are that the root mean square residual is less than 10 5 or the total number of iterations has reached 1000 3 2 domain and mesh settings the numerical computational domain with boundary conditions for the bwbug is exhibited fig 3 due to that the bwbug has a symmetrical geometry half of bwbug is modeled to reduce the computation cost the shape of the domain is configured a box topology where the bwbug is placed at the origin of the coordinates by using the l as the reference length the size of the domain is set to 10 l 15 l 0 10 l 10 l 10 l in length width and height direction respectively the front face of the domain is set to the velocity inlet and the back face of the domain is set to the pressure outlet the face in the x y plane is set to the symmetry plane whereas the rest side faces are set to the slip wall boundary conditions moreover the wall condition is allocated to the face of bwbug the trimmed mesher and prism layer mesher are used to generate the volume mesh in the computational domain five layers of prism mesh with a growth ratio of 1 2 are generated for the boundary layer of bwbug two levels of volumetric controls in the shape of bricks are used during the volume meshing to increase the local cell density around the bwbug moreover to generate the mesh automatically the macro file is built to automatically generate volume mesh fig 4 shows the meshes in the symmetry plane and surface of bwbug 3 3 mesh independence study to verify the influence of grid size on the computational results four sets of numerical models with different grid size are established to carry out the grid independence study the number of four sets of grids are 200w 300w 400w and 500w respectively and the same method is used for local grid refinement all the numerical simulations are carried out under the condition of 1 k n speed and 4 angle of attack and the corresponding numerical results of lift drag ratio are shown in table 2 through comparative analysis when the number of grids reaches 400w the lift drag ratio of bwbug is almost the same which indicates that the increase of grid size has no effect on the computational results considering the computational accuracy and efficiency the grid with 400w size is selected for the following numerical simulations 4 kriging based optimization framework with gradients of geometric constraints the optimization method controls the operation of the whole optimization design and has an important influence on the optimization efficiency in this paper a kriging based optimization framework is built to improve the optimization efficiency of the bwbug firstly the kriging model of the lift drag ratio is constructed then the gradient information of geometric constraints is used to accelerate the selection of new sample points to update the kriging model iteratively which further improves the optimization efficiency 4 1 kriging construction of the lift drag ratio the lift drag ratio is the primary objective in performing the shape optimization of bwbug and its calculation is the most time consuming to reduce computational cost in the optimization process kriging model is established to replace the original computational model in this paper the kriging model sacks et al 1989 simpson et al 2001 of lift drag ratio is an interpolation model whose estimated value y ˆ x 0 at the design point x 0 is defined as the linear combination of sample data y s 17 y ˆ x 0 w t x 0 y s from above the lift drag ratio at any design point can be predicted if the weighting coefficients are given here the optimal weighting coefficients are obtained by solving the following equations 18 r f f t 0 w x 0 λ r f x 0 where f f 1 x 1 f m x 1 f 1 x n f m x n r r x 1 x 1 r x 1 x n r x n x 1 r x n x n r r x 1 x 0 r x n x 0 r is called correlation matrix which is composed of correlation function values between all known sample points r is called correlation vector which is composed of correlation function values between unknown points and all known sample points by solving the linear equation 18 and substituting it into equation 17 the estimated value of lift drag ratio can be obtained by 19 y ˆ x 0 f t x 0 β ˆ r t r 1 y s f s β ˆ where β ˆ f t r f 1 f t r 1 y s r 1 y s f s β ˆ is the column vector only related to the known sample points and just need to be calculated once in the model training subsequently to predict the lift drag ratio at any design point x 0 simply need calculate the dot product of r t and r 1 y s f s β ˆ whose calculation time can be ignored compared with the original model in addition the mean square error of estimated lift drag ratio can also be computed as follows 20 m s e y ˆ x 0 σ 2 1 r t r 1 r f t r 1 r f t f t r 1 f 1 f t r 1 r f t 4 2 infill sample points with gradients of geometric constraints after the initial kriging model is established the next step in the optimization process is to infill new sample points through certain criteria and update the kriging model iteratively until the optimization converges minimum of surrogate prediction msp and expected improvement ei are the common criteria for infilling sample points msp parr et al 2012 this method is the simplest and the earliest adopted method its principle is to find the sample point which minimizes the objective function of the surrogate model as the newly infilled sample point for the bwbug the sample point to be infilled is obtained by solving the following sub optimization problem with geometric constraints 21 min y ˆ x s t g i t h i c k i t h i c k i 0 0 i 1 n c x l x x u where y ˆ x is the kriging model of lift drag ratio g i is the thickness constraint defined in section 2 3 ei jones et al 1998 this method was proposed by jones in 1998 also known as the global optimization method ego it is assumed that the current optimal objective function value is y min and the prediction results of kriging model conform to the normal distribution y ˆ x n y ˆ x s 2 whose mean value is y ˆ x and standard deviation is s x for the minimization problem the objective function improvement is defined as 22 i max y min y ˆ x 0 the expected value of i x can be calculated by the following formula 23 e i x y min y ˆ φ y min y ˆ s s φ y min y ˆ s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 where φ and φ represent the cumulative distribution function and probability density function respectively for the bwbug the following sub optimization problem with constraints is solved to get the maximum ei value and sample point to be infilled 24 max e i x s t g i t h i c k i t h i c k i 0 0 i 1 n c x l x x u where g i is still the thickness constraint defined in section 2 3 the testing results han 2016 liu et al 2012 show that msp method converges faster but it is easy to lead to premature optimization ei method can search for regions with fewer sampling points to jump out of local optimal solution which has good global property but the convergence slows down in the later stage of optimization to overcome the defects of the single criterion and improve the robustness this paper combines the two criteria described above to infill sample points in the optimization process of bwbug therefore the msp sub optimization problem 21 and ei sub optimization problem 24 need to be solved to get the infill sample points when taking intelligent optimization methods pso or nsga to solve these sub optimization problems thousands of thickness constraints need to be calculated in the whole optimization if each geometry regeneration takes several seconds or even minutes to complete the cost of thickness constraint calculation is considerable considering that the gradients of thickness constraint can be analytically computed by the expressions in section 2 3 and that gradient based optimization methods slsqp or ipopt need two orders of function evaluations lower than the intelligent optimization methods yu et al 2018 lyu et al 2014 the sqp optimization method sun and yuan 2006 nocedal and wright 2006 is adopted to solve the above sub optimization problem to improve the optimization efficiency another thing to consider is that the gradient based optimization method is easy to converge to the local optimal solution in this paper a global optimum solution is obtained by using the sqp optimization method through the following three steps firstly multiple initial points are generated uniformly in the variable space by the doe design of experiment then the sqp method is applied to perform the multi point optimization which takes every initial point generated as the start point of optimization finally the results of multi point optimization are compared and the best solution is chosen as the infill sample point from all the above the kriging based optimization framework for the shape of bwbug is constructed and briefly described in fig 5 5 shape optimization of an bwbug in this section one bwbug with bilateral symmetry structure is optimized to verify the effectiveness of the presented kriging based optimization framework 5 1 problem description the initial shape of the bwbug is composed of 11 airfoil sections and all the 11 airfoil sections are naca0012 airfoils considering that the bwbug is bilateral symmetrical the left half shape consisting of 6 airfoil sections is selected to perform the optimization design to reduce the number of parametric variables further to reduce the amount of calculation for the optimization objectives because the bwbug need not to balance the weight with lift and the lift drag ratio determines the gliding distance the optimization should not be performed by minimizing the drag at constant lift as the air glider referring to the literatures sun et al 2015 chengshan et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the lift drag ratio l d is chosen as the optimization objective to be maximized in addition the cfd based method proposed in section 3 is applied to compute the lift drag ratio for the selection of optimization design variables considering that the loading equipment and their layout inside bwbug have been determined before optimization the span length chord length and placement position of each airfoil section are set as constant in the optimization process to keep the basic shape profile unchanged which makes the initial equipment and their layout unchanged while the thickness factor and rotation angle in z direction of each airfoil section are selected as the optimal design variables to improve the performance of bwbug for the optimization constraints the thicknesses at the quarter chord of each airfoil section are required to be not less than the thickness requirements of the internal structure and loading equipment in addition the variation interval of optimization design variable is required to be given appropriately not only to ensure an enough space for optimization exploration and but also to avoid the increase of calculation amount caused by too large interval from all above the optimization problem of the bwbug is described in detail in table 3 5 2 optimization results for solving the optimization problem in table 3 using the kriging based optimization framework 70 initial samples are selected by latin hypercube sampling lhs and the optimization is stopped when the distance between continuous optimal sample points is less than 10 4 in addition the optimality condition is satisfied with a tolerance of 10 6 in solving the sub optimization problem 21 and 24 to get the sample point to be infilled respectively fig 6 shows the convergence history of the shape optimization of the initial bwbug the optimization convergences after 20 iterations in which a total of 110 hydrodynamic analyses of bwbug are carried out table 4 lists all the optimal values obtained from the shape optimization it is shown that the thickness at each airfoil section satisfies the requirement of constraint and the maximum lift drag ratio is increased by 18 98 compared with the initial bwbug whose maximum lift drag ratio is 14 8309 in order to test the prediction capability of the kriging model in the process of convergence to the optimum solution the kriging constructed in each iteration is applied to estimate the value of l d at the optimal point and all the estimated value of l d are illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 shows that the estimated values at the initial stage of optimization has a certain error compared with the value obtained by the actual simulation however with the continuous infill of the sample points the estimated value become more and more accurate and finally is the same as the actual simulation value in addition the performance of msp and ei methods for infilling sample points is also studied in a simple way fig 8 shows the distance between msp and ei solutions in each iteration which is defined by the 2 norm of the two solution vectors the literatures han 2016 liu et al 2012 indicate that msp method is a pure exploitation infill criterion and may be trapped in local optimum ei method prefers to explore the untried regions with fewer sampling points to jump out of local optimal solution but its convergence slows down near the optimum solution from fig 8 the distance of msp and ei solutions varies greatly in the early stage of the optimization and gradually decreases in the later stage it indicates that ei method tries to explore unknown area to find the global optimum in the early stage however with the continuous infill of sample points the global optimum is gradually approached in the later stage of the optimization which leads to the ei solution getting closer and closer to the msp solution fig 9 compares the pressure distribution on upper surface between the initial shape and the optimized shape respectively meanwhile fig 10 compares the pressure distribution on lower surface of the initial shape and the optimized shape respectively from fig 9 it is shown that the low pressure area on the upper surface of the optimized shape is larger than that of the initial shape especially at the location close to the leading edge from fig 10 the high pressure area on the lower surface of the optimized shape is larger than that of the initial shape taken together the lift generated by the optimized shape is greater than that generated by the initial shape fig 11 compares the normalized lift distribution along the spanwise position between the initial shape and the optimized shape and a hypothetical elliptical lift distribution is also introduced in grey line it is shown that the lift distribution of the optimized shape is much closer to the elliptical lift distribution than that of initial shape which means the optimized shape has less induced drag than the initial shape the same result is also obtained in the bwb literatures for aircraft lyu and martins 2014 lyu 2014 in these literatures the initial geometry shape is set to be like the first generation boeing bwb design with 800 passengers and a series of optimization studies with different variables and constraints are carried out the results also show that the optimum solution is close to elliptical in summary the optimized shape generates much higher lift and its normalized lift distribution is close to the elliptical to reduce the induced drag which results in a higher lift drag ratio than the initial shape if the optimization variables have a large design spaces it can be predicted that the optimum solution will be much closer to the elliptical to gain a higher l d 6 conclusions for the bwbug this paper presents a kriging based shape optimization framework for the bwbug with nurbs based parametrization a shape parameterization method of bwbug based on nurbs is proposed furthermore the analytical formulas of geometric constraints and their gradients are derived then the rans solver of fine marine is applied to the hydrodynamic analysis of bwbug in the optimization design process finally based on kriging model and adaptive sampling methods a kriging based optimization framework for the shape of bwbug is built and the gradient information of geometric constraints is used to select the sample points to be infilled which further improves the optimization efficiency to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods and optimization framework one bwbug is taken as an example to perform the shape optimization the results show that normalized lift distribution of the optimized shape is much closer to the elliptical and the lift drag ratio is increased by 18 98 compared with the initial shape while satisfying the required geometric constraints which shows the value and prospect of the proposed optimization framework in shape optimization design of bwbug credit authorship contribution statement daiyu zhang

of human society and the depletion of resources on land the development and utilization of marine resources have been paid more and more attention around the world as a new type of underwater vehicle autonomous underwater glider aug wood et al 2007 bachmayer et al 2004 2006 leonard et al 2007 has a small demand for energy and can navigate efficiently in the ocean for a long time because of its low manufacturing cost and maintenance cost aug can be reused and deployed in a large amount recently it has played an increasingly important role in large scale ocean exploration and monitoring the basic working principle of aug is to convert the lift generated by hydrofoil into the power to move it forward so the lift drag ratio has an important impact on the horizontal range of aug the blended wing body underwater glider bwbug sun et al 2015 has a flat fuselage with wing profile shape and the hydrofoil smoothly blends with the fuselage compared with the traditional underwater glider which is composed of revolving body and hydrofoils bwbug has a higher lift drag ratio and can glide a longer horizontal distance to further explore the high lift drag ratio characteristics of bwbug the optimization design method chengshan et al 2018 is gradually applied to its shape design and plays an increasingly important role the shape optimization design of bwbug mainly consists of three parts shape hydrodynamic analysis shape parametric modeling and optimization method the shape hydrodynamic analysis is a subject which uses computers to carry on numerical calculations to solve the force acting on bwbug in the flow field and then to calculate the corresponding objective and constraint functions in the optimization the shape parametric modeling is to define and express the shape of bwbug with a set of design parameters through certain functional relationship and then transforms the shape optimization design process into the optimization of this set of design parameters the optimization method is the top level structure of the shape optimization design which controls the operation of the whole optimization design and determines the development direction of the optimization at present computational fluid dynamics cfd method has become the commonly hydrodynamic analysis method with the rapid development of computer technology its basic idea is to generate the volume grid in the computational fluid domain and build a large scale discrete algebraic equation on the volume grid to compute the hydrodynamic parameters because cfd method has the advantage of low cost and short cycle compared with the experimental fluid dynamics method it was widely used in the shape optimization design such as the turbine optimization alizadeh et al 2020 madsen et al 2019 the ship optimization guo et al 2019 the aircraft optimization benaouali and kachel 2019 and so on in the shape optimization bwbug it was also applied to perform the hydrodynamic performance prediction and a series of research achievements was obtained xiong et al 2013 seo et al 2008 computer aided design cad is the most used method of shape parameterization it mainly relies on ug catia and other commercial cad software to generate shape automatically through secondary development li et al 2005 haimes and drela 2013 gu gu et al 2009 defined the shape and size parameters of the underwater glider as state variables and directly drove catia parametric program to complete the geometric parametric modeling of the underwater glider lu lv et al 2018 also used cad software to carry out the parametric study of the underwater glider however cad method needs use finite difference method to compute the surface sensitivities thus subjecting the sensitivities to truncation and round off errors truong 2014 in addition the cost of finite difference method is not negligible considering that each geometry regeneration can take several seconds or even minutes to complete alonso et al 2003 gagnon 2015 another kind of shape parameterization method mainly consists of nurbs non uniform rational b splines t splines and so on which are tailored to the objects of optimum design such as ship katsoulis et al 2019 yacht cirello a m 2008 and marine propellers arapakopoulos et al 2019 due to the advantages of low development difficulty and easy modularization intelligent optimization method has become the most widely used optimization method nowadays its main idea is to simulate some natural phenomena or physical processes to achieve the search and approximation of the optimal solution fu fu et al 2018 set eight optimization variables and optimized the shape of the underwater glider using nsgaii non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii tang tang et al 2018 set seven optimization variables and used beso bi directional evolutionary structural optimization method to optimize the shell of the underwater glider theoretically this kind of optimization method can converge to the global optimal solution but it needs more iterations and calculations in the optimization process which is only suitable for the optimization design of the shape of underwater glider with few variables mentioned aiming to reduce the computation consumption in the optimization process the optimization methods based on the surrogate model haftka et al 2016 forrester et al 2008 have been widely developed in recent years they mainly use the surrogate model to replace the time consuming numerical simulation analysis and add new samples according to certain criteria in the optimization process to iteratively update the surrogate model wang wang et al 2017 set up 9 design variables and used gaussian kernel function to establish the surrogate model of the flying underwater glider which was optimized through particle swarm optimization sun and li sun et al 2015 2017 set up 10 design variables and used kriging model to perform the hydrodynamic shape optimization of the underwater glider however when the shape optimization problem of bwbug has more geometric constraints how to develop a more efficient optimization method based on the characteristics of geometric constraints is worth to further study to increase the lift drag ratio of the bwbug maximally and improve the cfd based optimization efficiency this paper proposes a kriging based shape optimization framework for the bwbug with nurbs based parametrization firstly based on the theory of nurbs a parameterization method of bwbug shape is proposed to realize the flexible shape deformation according to the physical geometric meaning moreover the calculation formulation of geometric constraints and corresponding gradients is derived to improve the computational efficiency compared with cad parameterization method secondly the cfd based numerical model is built to perform the hydrodynamic analysis of bwbug and the mesh independence is studied thirdly an optimization framework based on kriging model is built to optimize the shape of bwbug in the presented optimization framework the kriging model is updated iteratively with sample points infilled dynamically by gradient optimization algorithm to further improve the optimization efficiency finally the optimal design of one bwbug is carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method and optimization framework 2 shape parametrization of bwbug in this section the shape parameterization method of bwbug is presented it is mainly composed of three parts the basic theory of nurbs the nurbs based geometric parametrization method the calculation method of geometric constraints and its gradients which are described in detail in the following part 2 1 nurbs theory compared with the b spline method the nurbs method can accurately represent the conic section and the elementary analytic surface which overcomes the uncertainty of the b spline method and makes the curve and surface have a unified mathematical description form for geometric definition of industrial product piegl and tiller 1997 farin et al 2002 at present it is widely used in the field of geometric modeling of automobile aircraft ship and other industries piegl 1991 shi et al 2013 kumar et al 2001 gagnon and zingg 2013 a nurbs curve of degree p is defined as follows piegl and tiller 1997 1 c u i 0 n n i p u w i p i i 0 n n i p u w i 0 u 1 where w i is the weights and w i 0 p i is the control point coordinate n i p u is the p th degree b spline basis function defined on the nonuniform knot vector 2 u 0 0 p 1 u p 1 u m p 1 1 1 p 1 a nurbs surface of degree p in the u direction and degree q in the v direction is defined in the following form piegl and tiller 1997 3 s u v i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j p i j i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j 0 u v 1 where w i j is the weight p i j forms a bidirectional control net n i p u and n j p v are the nonrational b spline basis functions defined on the following knot vectors 4 u 0 0 p 1 u p 1 u r p 1 1 1 p 1 v 0 0 q 1 u q 1 u s q 1 1 1 q 1 from above nurbs method can easily modify the geometric shape by changing the control points and weights it also has the characteristics of high accuracy and efficiency in parametric modeling of complex geometry therefore nurbs method is chosen to be the underlying tool for the geometric parametrization of bwbug 2 2 nurbs based geometric parametrization for the bwbug its fuselage adopts a flat ellipsoid shape and is smoothly connected with the wing to obtain a high lift drag ratio this shape has a significant feature each cross section is composed of the airfoil section based on the basic theory of nurbs the three dimensional geometric parametrization of bwbug is realized by the following five steps 1 parameterization of airfoil curve assuming that q k x k y k 0 k l are the l 1 data points of an initial airfoil curve and sequentially arranged on the airfoil curve with the trailing edge as the starting and ending point through the global approximation theory of nurbs seek a nurbs curve of degree p 5 c u i 0 n n i p u w i p i i 0 n n i p u w i 0 u 1 satisfying that q 0 c 0 q l c 1 and the remaining data points is approximated in the least squares sense with the given number of p i 6 k 1 l 1 q k c u k 2 where u k 0 k l is the parameter value of each data points q k which can be obtained by the deboor method piegl and tiller 1997 note that p i is chosen as the parameterized variable of airfoil curve and its number can be freely given according to the designer s parametric demand 2 set the thickness and chord length of each airfoil section use x y z to represent chordwise vertical and spanwise directions respectively and define the airfoil obtained by step 1 on the x y plane then the coordinate value of the j th control point on the i th airfoil can be denoted as p i j x i j y i j 0 t after applying the chord length factor s i and the thickness factor t i to modify the chord length and thickness of the i th airfoil respectively the modified coordinate value b i j of the j th control point on the i th airfoil can be expressed by the following formula 7 b i j 1 0 0 0 t i 0 0 0 1 s i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 p i j 3 set the rotation angle for each airfoil section use θ i α i β i γ i t to denote the rotation angle of the i th airfoil profile on the x y z axes then the coordinate value c i j obtained by rotating the control points b i j can be computed by the following formula 8 c i j 1 0 0 0 cos β i sin β i 0 sin β i cos β i cos α i 0 sin α i 0 1 0 sin α i 0 cos α i cos γ i sin γ i 0 sin γ i cos γ i 0 0 0 1 b i j 4 set the placement position of each airfoil section use t i a i b i c i t to indicate the placement position of the i th airfoil then the coordinates of the j th control point of the i th airfoil is determined by 9 d i j c i j t i 5 based on the nurbs surface equation the shape of bwbug can be expressed as the following mathematical expression 10 s u v i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j d i j i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j in summary the parametric modeling process of bwbug is mainly realized by manipulating the control points of each airfoil section through local and global parameterization variables which are described in detail in table 1 fig 1 shows the parameterization diagram of one bwbug in which the red dot is the value of d i j in formula 10 the shape in fig 1 will be deformed with the change of parametric variables in table 1 2 3 calculation of geometric constraints and gradients due to the internal loading requirements of bwbug the corresponding thickness constraints need to be set at different positions if these constraints can be calculated quickly and accurately the optimization efficiency can be improved based on the method of geometric parametrization in section 2 2 this paper proposes an efficient and accurate method for calculating thickness constraints and their gradients suppose that the thickness constraints g i t h i c k i t h i c k 0 0 i 1 n c need to be set at the coordinates x i 0 z i in x z plane where t h i c k i is the geometric thickness between the upper and lower surfaces of bwbug as the blue line shown in fig 2 t h i c k 0 is the thickness value set according to the equipment installation requirements before calculating the thickness constraint g i the parametric coordinates u i v i of the point x i 0 z i need to be determined in advance by solving inversely the following equation 11 s x u i v i x i 0 s z u i v i z i 0 because the bwbug has upper and lower surfaces there are two solutions located on the upper and lower surfaces respectively when solving equation 11 if u i 1 v i 1 is the solution on the upper surface and u i 2 v i 2 is the solution on the lower surface then the thickness constraint located at the coordinate x i 0 z i is 12 g i s y u i 1 v i 1 s y u i 2 v i 2 t h i c k 0 one of the main advantages of using nurbs surface to parameterize the shape of bwbug is that it can derive the gradient analytical expression for any point on the surface based on formula 10 the gradient expression of surface point located at parametric coordinates u v with respect to variables d i j can be computed by the following formula 13 s u v d i j n i p u n j p v w i j i 0 n j 0 m n i p u n j p v w i j furthermore the gradient expression of geometric constraint g i with respect to parametric variables p i j s i t i θ i t i can be obtained as follows 14 g i p i j d i j p i j s y u i 1 v i 1 d i j d i j p i j s y u i 2 v i 2 d i j 15 g i a j 0 n d i j a s y u i 1 v i 1 d i j j 0 n d i j a s y u i 2 v i 2 d i j where a represents the arbitrary variable among s i t i θ i and t i 3 cfd based hydrodynamic analysis 3 1 cfd solver the commercial software fine marine is chosen to perform the hydrodynamic analysis in this paper because the bwbug sails at a low speed of 1kn in the ocean the water is set as the fluid and the impressible model is selected to carry out the numerical simulations the density and dynamic viscosity of water are set by 998 2 k g m 3 and 1 003 10 3 p a s respectively the governing equations of mass conservation and momentum conservation for the impressible flow are expressed in the following formula 16 16 u i x i 0 u i t x j u i u j 1 ρ p x i μ x j u i x j u j x i x j u i u j the above governing equations is solved by adopting the s s t k w turbulence model which has great advantages in predicting inverse pressure gradient flow and separation flow the convergence criteria are that the root mean square residual is less than 10 5 or the total number of iterations has reached 1000 3 2 domain and mesh settings the numerical computational domain with boundary conditions for the bwbug is exhibited fig 3 due to that the bwbug has a symmetrical geometry half of bwbug is modeled to reduce the computation cost the shape of the domain is configured a box topology where the bwbug is placed at the origin of the coordinates by using the l as the reference length the size of the domain is set to 10 l 15 l 0 10 l 10 l 10 l in length width and height direction respectively the front face of the domain is set to the velocity inlet and the back face of the domain is set to the pressure outlet the face in the x y plane is set to the symmetry plane whereas the rest side faces are set to the slip wall boundary conditions moreover the wall condition is allocated to the face of bwbug the trimmed mesher and prism layer mesher are used to generate the volume mesh in the computational domain five layers of prism mesh with a growth ratio of 1 2 are generated for the boundary layer of bwbug two levels of volumetric controls in the shape of bricks are used during the volume meshing to increase the local cell density around the bwbug moreover to generate the mesh automatically the macro file is built to automatically generate volume mesh fig 4 shows the meshes in the symmetry plane and surface of bwbug 3 3 mesh independence study to verify the influence of grid size on the computational results four sets of numerical models with different grid size are established to carry out the grid independence study the number of four sets of grids are 200w 300w 400w and 500w respectively and the same method is used for local grid refinement all the numerical simulations are carried out under the condition of 1 k n speed and 4 angle of attack and the corresponding numerical results of lift drag ratio are shown in table 2 through comparative analysis when the number of grids reaches 400w the lift drag ratio of bwbug is almost the same which indicates that the increase of grid size has no effect on the computational results considering the computational accuracy and efficiency the grid with 400w size is selected for the following numerical simulations 4 kriging based optimization framework with gradients of geometric constraints the optimization method controls the operation of the whole optimization design and has an important influence on the optimization efficiency in this paper a kriging based optimization framework is built to improve the optimization efficiency of the bwbug firstly the kriging model of the lift drag ratio is constructed then the gradient information of geometric constraints is used to accelerate the selection of new sample points to update the kriging model iteratively which further improves the optimization efficiency 4 1 kriging construction of the lift drag ratio the lift drag ratio is the primary objective in performing the shape optimization of bwbug and its calculation is the most time consuming to reduce computational cost in the optimization process kriging model is established to replace the original computational model in this paper the kriging model sacks et al 1989 simpson et al 2001 of lift drag ratio is an interpolation model whose estimated value y ˆ x 0 at the design point x 0 is defined as the linear combination of sample data y s 17 y ˆ x 0 w t x 0 y s from above the lift drag ratio at any design point can be predicted if the weighting coefficients are given here the optimal weighting coefficients are obtained by solving the following equations 18 r f f t 0 w x 0 λ r f x 0 where f f 1 x 1 f m x 1 f 1 x n f m x n r r x 1 x 1 r x 1 x n r x n x 1 r x n x n r r x 1 x 0 r x n x 0 r is called correlation matrix which is composed of correlation function values between all known sample points r is called correlation vector which is composed of correlation function values between unknown points and all known sample points by solving the linear equation 18 and substituting it into equation 17 the estimated value of lift drag ratio can be obtained by 19 y ˆ x 0 f t x 0 β ˆ r t r 1 y s f s β ˆ where β ˆ f t r f 1 f t r 1 y s r 1 y s f s β ˆ is the column vector only related to the known sample points and just need to be calculated once in the model training subsequently to predict the lift drag ratio at any design point x 0 simply need calculate the dot product of r t and r 1 y s f s β ˆ whose calculation time can be ignored compared with the original model in addition the mean square error of estimated lift drag ratio can also be computed as follows 20 m s e y ˆ x 0 σ 2 1 r t r 1 r f t r 1 r f t f t r 1 f 1 f t r 1 r f t 4 2 infill sample points with gradients of geometric constraints after the initial kriging model is established the next step in the optimization process is to infill new sample points through certain criteria and update the kriging model iteratively until the optimization converges minimum of surrogate prediction msp and expected improvement ei are the common criteria for infilling sample points msp parr et al 2012 this method is the simplest and the earliest adopted method its principle is to find the sample point which minimizes the objective function of the surrogate model as the newly infilled sample point for the bwbug the sample point to be infilled is obtained by solving the following sub optimization problem with geometric constraints 21 min y ˆ x s t g i t h i c k i t h i c k i 0 0 i 1 n c x l x x u where y ˆ x is the kriging model of lift drag ratio g i is the thickness constraint defined in section 2 3 ei jones et al 1998 this method was proposed by jones in 1998 also known as the global optimization method ego it is assumed that the current optimal objective function value is y min and the prediction results of kriging model conform to the normal distribution y ˆ x n y ˆ x s 2 whose mean value is y ˆ x and standard deviation is s x for the minimization problem the objective function improvement is defined as 22 i max y min y ˆ x 0 the expected value of i x can be calculated by the following formula 23 e i x y min y ˆ φ y min y ˆ s s φ y min y ˆ s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 where φ and φ represent the cumulative distribution function and probability density function respectively for the bwbug the following sub optimization problem with constraints is solved to get the maximum ei value and sample point to be infilled 24 max e i x s t g i t h i c k i t h i c k i 0 0 i 1 n c x l x x u where g i is still the thickness constraint defined in section 2 3 the testing results han 2016 liu et al 2012 show that msp method converges faster but it is easy to lead to premature optimization ei method can search for regions with fewer sampling points to jump out of local optimal solution which has good global property but the convergence slows down in the later stage of optimization to overcome the defects of the single criterion and improve the robustness this paper combines the two criteria described above to infill sample points in the optimization process of bwbug therefore the msp sub optimization problem 21 and ei sub optimization problem 24 need to be solved to get the infill sample points when taking intelligent optimization methods pso or nsga to solve these sub optimization problems thousands of thickness constraints need to be calculated in the whole optimization if each geometry regeneration takes several seconds or even minutes to complete the cost of thickness constraint calculation is considerable considering that the gradients of thickness constraint can be analytically computed by the expressions in section 2 3 and that gradient based optimization methods slsqp or ipopt need two orders of function evaluations lower than the intelligent optimization methods yu et al 2018 lyu et al 2014 the sqp optimization method sun and yuan 2006 nocedal and wright 2006 is adopted to solve the above sub optimization problem to improve the optimization efficiency another thing to consider is that the gradient based optimization method is easy to converge to the local optimal solution in this paper a global optimum solution is obtained by using the sqp optimization method through the following three steps firstly multiple initial points are generated uniformly in the variable space by the doe design of experiment then the sqp method is applied to perform the multi point optimization which takes every initial point generated as the start point of optimization finally the results of multi point optimization are compared and the best solution is chosen as the infill sample point from all the above the kriging based optimization framework for the shape of bwbug is constructed and briefly described in fig 5 5 shape optimization of an bwbug in this section one bwbug with bilateral symmetry structure is optimized to verify the effectiveness of the presented kriging based optimization framework 5 1 problem description the initial shape of the bwbug is composed of 11 airfoil sections and all the 11 airfoil sections are naca0012 airfoils considering that the bwbug is bilateral symmetrical the left half shape consisting of 6 airfoil sections is selected to perform the optimization design to reduce the number of parametric variables further to reduce the amount of calculation for the optimization objectives because the bwbug need not to balance the weight with lift and the lift drag ratio determines the gliding distance the optimization should not be performed by minimizing the drag at constant lift as the air glider referring to the literatures sun et al 2015 chengshan et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the lift drag ratio l d is chosen as the optimization objective to be maximized in addition the cfd based method proposed in section 3 is applied to compute the lift drag ratio for the selection of optimization design variables considering that the loading equipment and their layout inside bwbug have been determined before optimization the span length chord length and placement position of each airfoil section are set as constant in the optimization process to keep the basic shape profile unchanged which makes the initial equipment and their layout unchanged while the thickness factor and rotation angle in z direction of each airfoil section are selected as the optimal design variables to improve the performance of bwbug for the optimization constraints the thicknesses at the quarter chord of each airfoil section are required to be not less than the thickness requirements of the internal structure and loading equipment in addition the variation interval of optimization design variable is required to be given appropriately not only to ensure an enough space for optimization exploration and but also to avoid the increase of calculation amount caused by too large interval from all above the optimization problem of the bwbug is described in detail in table 3 5 2 optimization results for solving the optimization problem in table 3 using the kriging based optimization framework 70 initial samples are selected by latin hypercube sampling lhs and the optimization is stopped when the distance between continuous optimal sample points is less than 10 4 in addition the optimality condition is satisfied with a tolerance of 10 6 in solving the sub optimization problem 21 and 24 to get the sample point to be infilled respectively fig 6 shows the convergence history of the shape optimization of the initial bwbug the optimization convergences after 20 iterations in which a total of 110 hydrodynamic analyses of bwbug are carried out table 4 lists all the optimal values obtained from the shape optimization it is shown that the thickness at each airfoil section satisfies the requirement of constraint and the maximum lift drag ratio is increased by 18 98 compared with the initial bwbug whose maximum lift drag ratio is 14 8309 in order to test the prediction capability of the kriging model in the process of convergence to the optimum solution the kriging constructed in each iteration is applied to estimate the value of l d at the optimal point and all the estimated value of l d are illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 shows that the estimated values at the initial stage of optimization has a certain error compared with the value obtained by the actual simulation however with the continuous infill of the sample points the estimated value become more and more accurate and finally is the same as the actual simulation value in addition the performance of msp and ei methods for infilling sample points is also studied in a simple way fig 8 shows the distance between msp and ei solutions in each iteration which is defined by the 2 norm of the two solution vectors the literatures han 2016 liu et al 2012 indicate that msp method is a pure exploitation infill criterion and may be trapped in local optimum ei method prefers to explore the untried regions with fewer sampling points to jump out of local optimal solution but its convergence slows down near the optimum solution from fig 8 the distance of msp and ei solutions varies greatly in the early stage of the optimization and gradually decreases in the later stage it indicates that ei method tries to explore unknown area to find the global optimum in the early stage however with the continuous infill of sample points the global optimum is gradually approached in the later stage of the optimization which leads to the ei solution getting closer and closer to the msp solution fig 9 compares the pressure distribution on upper surface between the initial shape and the optimized shape respectively meanwhile fig 10 compares the pressure distribution on lower surface of the initial shape and the optimized shape respectively from fig 9 it is shown that the low pressure area on the upper surface of the optimized shape is larger than that of the initial shape especially at the location close to the leading edge from fig 10 the high pressure area on the lower surface of the optimized shape is larger than that of the initial shape taken together the lift generated by the optimized shape is greater than that generated by the initial shape fig 11 compares the normalized lift distribution along the spanwise position between the initial shape and the optimized shape and a hypothetical elliptical lift distribution is also introduced in grey line it is shown that the lift distribution of the optimized shape is much closer to the elliptical lift distribution than that of initial shape which means the optimized shape has less induced drag than the initial shape the same result is also obtained in the bwb literatures for aircraft lyu and martins 2014 lyu 2014 in these literatures the initial geometry shape is set to be like the first generation boeing bwb design with 800 passengers and a series of optimization studies with different variables and constraints are carried out the results also show that the optimum solution is close to elliptical in summary the optimized shape generates much higher lift and its normalized lift distribution is close to the elliptical to reduce the induced drag which results in a higher lift drag ratio than the initial shape if the optimization variables have a large design spaces it can be predicted that the optimum solution will be much closer to the elliptical to gain a higher l d 6 conclusions for the bwbug this paper presents a kriging based shape optimization framework for the bwbug with nurbs based parametrization a shape parameterization method of bwbug based on nurbs is proposed furthermore the analytical formulas of geometric constraints and their gradients are derived then the rans solver of fine marine is applied to the hydrodynamic analysis of bwbug in the optimization design process finally based on kriging model and adaptive sampling methods a kriging based optimization framework for the shape of bwbug is built and the gradient information of geometric constraints is used to select the sample points to be infilled which further improves the optimization efficiency to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods and optimization framework one bwbug is taken as an example to perform the shape optimization the results show that normalized lift distribution of the optimized shape is much closer to the elliptical and the lift drag ratio is increased by 18 98 compared with the initial shape while satisfying the required geometric constraints which shows the value and prospect of the proposed optimization framework in shape optimization design of bwbug credit authorship contribution statement daiyu zhang
