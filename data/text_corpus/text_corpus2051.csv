10255,in many countries including new zealand limits on freshwater availability have led to a push toward improved irrigation efficiency via changes in irrigation application technologies so as to increase the crop per drop in this paper we provide evidence of unintended consequences to groundwater arising from improved irrigation efficiency in parts of the canterbury plains new zealand we compare groundwater levels groundwater nitrate concentrations and stable isotope values from before and after the change in irrigation efficiency we show that changes in irrigation methods from low efficiency border dyke irrigation to high efficiency sprinkler irrigation has resulted in reduced recharge to groundwater and reductions in groundwater levels groundwater level reductions of up to 17 m have occurred in some areas the reduced groundwater levels have impacted spring flows and required groundwater users to drill new wells to access the now deeper groundwater the reduction in irrigation recharge has also likely contributed to increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater in response to the unintended consequences documented in this study managed aquifer recharge is being implemented as a means of augmenting groundwater levels quality and spring fed waterways as such increased irrigation efficiency may not be reducing water use in this region a regional water balance would be required to determine if water savings are occurring overall keywords irrigation efficiency groundwater recharge groundwater quality groundwater storage flood irrigation 1 introduction groundwater is a vitally important resource both globally gleeson et al 2012 giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 and in new zealand rosen and white 2001 westerhoff et al 2018 irrigated agriculture has profound impacts on groundwater via depletion famiglietti et al 2011 konikow and kendy 2005 postel 2000 wada et al 2010 and through contamination derived directly or indirectly from agricultural practices böhlke 2002 nitrate no3 is considered one of the primary contaminants associated with agriculture burri et al 2019 spalding and exner 1993 and has become a major concern in a number of new zealand groundwater systems cetin 2015 ministry for the environment and stats nz 2017 mclay et al 2001 oecd 2017 scott 2013 stewart et al 2011 there has been a push to increase irrigation efficiency ie internationally driven by concerns over meeting the food requirements of a growing global population in the face of climate change and sustainability boundaries faures 2007 foley et al 2011 wallace 2000 approximately 280 million hectares 86 of global irrigated area uses a relatively water inefficient flood type irrigation method including for the use of rice paddies in contrast approximately 35 million hectares 11 uses relatively efficient sprinkler type systems fao 2014 in line with grafton et al 2018 we define ie as the ratio of the volume of irrigation water beneficially applied on a field i e that is used for growing a crop to the total volume of irrigation water applied a component of ie application efficiency ae is the focus of this paper and defined as the average depth of irrigation water contributing to a target divided by the average depth of water applied to the crop burt et al 1997 commonly the target is the field capacity of the soil and hence the definition for ae is restated as the net volume of water stored in the root zone divided by the volume of water applied to the crop bright et al 2018 water not stored within the crop root zone is assumed to recharge groundwater it is thought that improvements in ae provide water quality benefits in the form of reduced nutrients leached through to groundwater and waterways bright et al 2018 in addition to water savings in new zealand local regulators have recently imposed requirements around minimum irrigation ae environment canterbury 2016 waikato regional council 2019 border dyke irrigation a type of flood surface irrigation is a low cost irrigation method that has historical use within new zealand the method involves temporarily damming a water race i e a canal carrying water diverted from a river or storage pond and then opening a border so that irrigation water can spill onto pasture border dyke irrigation provides greater quantities of water than the soil can hold resulting in large amounts of irrigation water passing through the root zone to the underlying groundwater table srinivasan et al 2016 a relatively low ae of 30 60 has been estimated for border dyke irrigation in new zealand settings by brown 2016 and 50 56 by stronge 2001 in contrast sprinkler irrigation applies water through sprinkler heads or nozzles typically at a uniform rate resulting in a reduced loss of irrigation water to groundwater when compared to border dyke sprinkler irrigation has an estimated ae of around 75 90 edkins and mcindoe 2006 recently it has been argued that higher ie rarely reduces water consumption and that improved ie can have a range of unintended consequences grafton et al 2018 one of these unintended consequences relating specifically to higher ae is reduced groundwater levels from reductions in return flow i e reductions in irrigation water moving through the vadose zone to groundwater a number of new zealand researchers have predicted that changes in irrigation methods might have profound impacts to regional groundwater resources in new zealand e g davey 2006 dommisse 2006 scott 2013 thorley et al 2010 however to date there have been no comprehensive studies carried out in new zealand to confirm these predictions this research aims to identify changes in groundwater quantity and quality on the hinds rangitata plain as a result of regional changes in irrigation methods that have led to higher ae specifically the objectives of this research are to 1 assess changes in groundwater quantity since 2006 i e since conversion from border dyke to sprinkler type irrigation 2 assess changes in groundwater nutrients since 2006 3 use groundwater isotopic composition to assess changes in irrigation recharge since 2006 4 determine the degree to which climate specifically trends in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration might be influencing observed changes in hydrology 5 identify consequences to groundwater of improvements in ae 1 1 case study area the hinds rangitata plain hrp is located in the south island of new zealand on the canterbury plains fig 1 the hrp covers an area of 580 km2 bounded by the rangitata and hinds rivers southern alps foothills and the pacific ocean hereafter the hrp is referred to as the study area for simplicity the study area was selected because previous research by dommisse 2006 who studied the hydrological impacts of border dyke irrigation provided a comprehensive set of baseline data for the 2005 2006 irrigation season irrigated agriculture in the study area started in the late 1940s with the completion of a surface water irrigation scheme the mayfield hinds irrigation scheme mhis mhis sources and distributes water to irrigators from the rangitata river through a 320 km network of water races early uptake of irrigation water was low and primarily in the form of relatively inefficient wild flooding and border dyke irrigation over the next seventy years the demand for water increased in the study area a result of changing land use and the expansion of irrigated agriculture durney et al 2014 1 2 physical setting the canterbury plains are a series of coalescing glacial outwash and alluvial fans comprised of quaternary gravels wilson 1985 soils within the study area are typically shallow 200 mm deep free draining stony silt loam with low water holding capacity profile available water of 65 70 mm this soil type is prone to drought in the summer and requires extensive irrigation dommisse 2006 hanson and abraham 2013 average annual precipitation ranges from 614 mm at the coast to 950 mm at the foothills in the upper regions of the study area durney et al 2014 groundwater within the gravels flows from the foothills of the southern alps to the coast often emerging as springs or creeks near the coast dommisse 2006 the distance from the coast to the foothills is approximately 50 km and ranges in elevation from sea level to 400 m 1 3 land use land use in the study area is influenced by a number of factors including soil type rainfall accessibility to water economics i e relative market prices environment technological advances education and community expectations dodson 2006 dommisse 2006 historically land use in the study area has been predominantly sheep pastoral and mixed farming i e cash crop and stock there has been an increase in dairy within the study area leading to higher risk of nitrate contamination ramesh et al 2009 in 2006 dairy made up 35 of land use in the study area dodson 2006 and by 2015 16 this had increased to 62 as detailed by farm environment plans mhv water limited personal communication march 15 2017 1 4 changes in irrigation practises irrigation practices within the study area have undergone rapid change in the past two decades see supplementary figure 1 during the 2005 2006 irrigation season 76 of irrigation was by border dyke and 24 by sprinkler dommisse 2006 during the 2013 2014 irrigation season 10 of irrigation was by border dyke and 90 by sprinkler predominately in the form of centre pivots canterbury maps 2019 these trends in irrigation conversion have continued mhv water limited personal communication march 15 2017 water provided for irrigation use by mhis is taken from the rangitata river which has its headwaters in an alpine setting nitrate n concentrations from the rangitata river sampled approximately 20 km downstream of the irrigation intake are consistently low 5 year median of 0 054 mg l lawa 2019 and has been shown to provide a dilution effect to groundwater nitrate n values when applied through border dyke irrigation in the study area dommisse 2006 this dilution effect from border dyke irrigation has been observed elsewhere in canterbury close 1987 it was speculated that regional conversion to more efficient irrigation would result in a considerable loss of groundwater recharge and subsequent changes in groundwater quantity and quality davey 2006 dommisse 2006 it is important to understand the source of water for irrigation i e surface water versus groundwater however this is difficult due to a paucity of data relating to groundwater use in the area arising from a lack of metering and data collection during the study period the mhis supplies water to irrigators from surface water and the annual average supply remained relatively stable over the study period mhv water limited personal communication march 15 2017 irrigators sought to supplement this surface water supply i e insure against times when supply was restricted because of low flows in the rangitata river through an increase in groundwater well installation starting in the 1990s and peaking during the 2000 2010 period over time the mhis increased water storage capabilities and this in addition to individual farm ponds constructed over the same period improved the reliability of supply reducing the need for supplementary groundwater supply 1 5 groundwater quality water quality monitoring on the hinds plains a region that includes the study area showed increases in average annual nitrate n between 2005 and 2012 in shallow groundwater 13 wells sampled with depths 41 m below ground increasing from 7 to 11 mg l and surface water drains 7 sites were sampled increasing from 6 mg l to 10 mg l scott 2013 the lack of historic data for deep wells in the study area makes it difficult to determine long term nitrate trends and little is known about shallow and deep groundwater residence times within the study area 2 materials and methods this research consisted of two parts the collection of field data in the study area and a desktop study that analysed the field data comparing the findings with research by dommisse 2006 i e when the study area was predominantly irrigated by border dyke the field campaign in this study was specifically designed to enable a comparison of groundwater quantity and quality data collected and reported by dommisse 2006 a piezometric survey consisting of 72 wells was carried out in summer 2017 i e during the irrigation season wells used in the dommisse 2006 study also carried out in summer during the irrigation season were prioritized for selection to enable comparison and an estimation of change in groundwater volume between 2006 and 2017 horizontal and vertical coordinates for all of the wells were obtained using a trimble geo 7x trimble 2019 to ensure horizontal and vertical accuracy of the measuring points water samples were collected from 33 groundwater sites for a range of water chemistry and stable isotopes see fig 1 these wells were selected because they fit the criteria for groundwater sampling outlined within the nz national protocol for groundwater sampling ministry for the environment 2006 2 1 eigenmodel to identify historic trends in groundwater head and the relationship to climate inputs an eigenmodel bidwell et al 1991 was built for the study eigenmodelling is a one dimensional physics based mathematical approach for assessing the temporal response of an aquifer to the influence of time variant recharge eigenmodels are based around a simple representation of an aquifer and provide a useful method for determining the causes of aquifer response particularly where long term groundwater level trends are the key source of information on the historical and current behaviour of an aquifer the eigenmodel approach has been widely used in groundwater assessment studies in new zealand e g stenger et al 2008 williams et al 2008 records of well k37 0245 canterbury maps 2019 were used for the eigenmodel beginning in january 1960 and continuing to the present this well is located in the centre of the study area see fig 1 and was selected due to its historic and high frequency groundwater level data historic rainfall records for the model were obtained from two sources a niwa climate station station i d 5049 niwa 2019 located within 3 km of the hinds township and previously unpublished rainfall data from a local landowner station i d 1 penman pet which predicts evaporation based on mean daily temperature wind speed air pressure and solar radiation was obtained from a niwa climate station station i d 39845 niwa 2019 climate station locations are shown in fig 1 rainfall pet and groundwater level data between january 1 1960 and december 31 1969 were used to calibrate the model this interval provides a calibration period in which minor groundwater development and irrigation had occurred the modelled output therefore predicts groundwater levels based on climate data and do not include irrigation as a recharge component thus a comparison of modelled groundwater levels with observed groundwater levels can be used to infer irrigation recharge over time 2 2 groundwater nitrate n modelling two models were constructed for this study in order to compare the three dimensional distribution of nitrate n within the same aquifer over a decade as described in section 2 1 33 wells were sampled for quality parameters during the 2016 2017 irrigation season and the nitrate n values were compared with those captured by dommisse 2006 during the 2005 2006 irrigation season leapfrog works version 3 0 1 hereafter referred to as leapfrog seequent ltd 2019 a hydrogeological software package was used to create the two models leapfrog uses radial basis functions for its interpolation and extrapolation algorithms in order to make predictions at locations where there are no measurements nichols et al 2020 radial basis functions approximate a specific type of kriging called dual kriging a comprehensive explanation of dual kriging is provided by horowitz et al 1996 the two groundwater nitrate models were constructed from data obtained in this study and data from 68 sites sampled by dommisse 2006 using the same method first the middle point of each well screen used in either dataset was calculated to provide the location within the aquifer to assign each nitrate n value the horizontal boundaries were set using the surrounding water features i e rangitata river hinds river and the sea and the inland boundary of the study area the upper vertical boundary for each model was set using the corresponding piezometric surface as described in section 3 1 the lower vertical boundary was set by creating a straight line between the base of the deepest wells sampled in lieu of data relating to the base of the aquifer the leapfrog radial basis functions engine was then run with nitrate n output ranges set to relevant new zealand nitrate n biotoxicity and drinking water standards anzecc 2000 2 3 stable oxygen isotopes as tracers stable oxygen isotopes can be used for their characteristic isotope signature to reveal the source of recharge in a groundwater system stable oxygen isotopes are useful tracers in the hydrologic cycle as they are a constituent atom of the water molecule and are continuously added at catchment scale by natural processes i e rainfall and snowmelt events stable oxygen isotopes have been used extensively in hydrological research both internationally jasechko 2019 and within new zealand stewart and morgenstern 2001 canterbury alpine rivers such as the rangitata river have their origins in high altitude catchments alpine river water has been shown to have δ 18o values ranging from 90 00 to 120 00 dommisse 2006 hanson and abraham 2013 a δ 18o value of 10 30 00 has been reported for the rangitata river by hanson and abraham 2013 lowland rainfall recharge that falls near the coast is shown to have δ 18o values of 7 70 00 stewart and morgenstern 2001 thus groundwater in the study area that has been recharged from irrigation water i e alpine river water will tend to have more negative δ 18o values compared to groundwater supplied by rainfall recharge stable oxygen isotopes were collected from 57 groundwater sites during the 2005 2006 irrigation season by dommisse 2006 and 33 in this study during the 2016 2017 irrigation season the composition of recharge was estimated for both survey periods using the assumption that only two recharge sources contributed to the groundwater system irrigation and rainfall recharge to calculate the ratio rainfall recharge was estimated as rainfall sample δ 18 o river δ 18 o rain δ 18 o river δ 18 o this approach was applied by close et al 1995 in the neighbouring catchment of ashburton rakaia to estimate the ratio of river and rainfall recharge in groundwater 3 results 3 1 groundwater volume changes a groundwater level change map was produced using the piezometric survey snapshot recorded during the 2005 2006 irrigation season by dommisse 2006 and the piezometric survey carried out in this study during the 2016 2017 irrigation season fig 2 a similar period of below average rainfall occurred prior to the dommisse 2006 piezometric survey and the piezometric surveys carried out during this study a volumetric decrease of 262 6 gl was calculated between 2006 and 2017 this value was calculated using the change in groundwater level surface shown in fig 2 and an assumed average effective porosity of 0 17 dann et al 2008 using the value of 262 6 gl an annual volumetric decrease of 23 9 gl can be determined between 2006 and 2017 this is equal to approximately 18 of the annual average irrigation volume i e between 2009 and 2017 or 27 of the annual groundwater abstraction volume in 2006 dommisse 2006 spatially the most significant groundwater level decline of between 10 and 17 m occur inland of state highway 1 which is a road shown in fig 2 running roughly parallel and a distance of 13 km from the coast and intersecting the study area coastward of state highway 1 the decline in groundwater levels range between 0 m and 9 m increases in groundwater levels of up to 4 m were shown near the coast close to the hinds river the cause of this increase is difficult to determine and might relate to the few observations in this area the difference might simply reflect poor interpolation resulting from the kriging 3 2 eigenmodel the results of the eigenmodelling are shown in fig 3 there is generally good agreement between the modelled and observed groundwater level during the calibration period although large drops in observed groundwater levels were simulated slightly too conservatively by the model i e late 1960 and late 1967 the post calibration results of the eigenmodel show two distinctly different periods in terms of the match between modelled and observed groundwater level the first period is from the early 1980s to mid 2000s when the modelled groundwater level is consistently lower than the observed groundwater level the peaks in observed groundwater levels during this period generally occur within irrigation seasons and frequently do so independent of the modelled line the difference between the observed and modelled groundwater levels ranges from 0 5 m to 6 m during the peaks and 1 to 4 m during the troughs as the model predicts groundwater level results from climate inputs and does not account for irrigation recharge we interpret the difference between the modelled and observed groundwater level during this period to be indicative of elevated groundwater levels caused by increased recharge from low efficiency border dyke irrigation that is the eigenmodel is indicating that elevated groundwater levels during this period are likely a response to irrigation recharge rather than increased rainfall in general the second period occurs from around 2010 and continues to the end of the model in 2016 the observed and modelled groundwater level has a good fit similar to that of the calibration period we interpret these results as indicating that the decline in observed groundwater levels since the mid 2000s is reflecting a reduction in irrigation derived recharge relative to that occurring in the period from the early 1980s to mid 2000s 3 3 nitrate n modelling two groundwater nitrate n models were developed to identify the three dimensional distribution of nitrate n in the study area groundwater under border dyke and sprinkler type irrigation the first model see fig 4 upper was developed using nitrate n values from groundwater samples collected by dommisse 2006 during the 2005 2006 irrigation season this model provides a snapshot of the study area groundwater system under almost entirely border dyke irrigation the model shows relatively low levels of nitrate n i e 5 6 mg l with some stratification of groundwater nitrate n concentration with depth and an increase in nitrate n values toward the coast the second model was developed using the nitrate n values from groundwater samples collected as part of the current study during the 2016 2017 irrigation season this model provides a snapshot of the groundwater system within the study area under almost entirely sprinkler type irrigation this model shows relatively high levels of nitrate n i e 6 9 mg l similar to the 2006 distribution there is a general trend of increased nitrate n concentration within proximity of the surface and towards the coast despite similar spatial trends between the two nitrate n distributions the areas of shallow groundwater that show elevated nitrate n concentration in the 2006 distribution are not as consistent across the study area as they are in the 2017 distribution appearing as local patches similarly shallow groundwater containing low nitrate n concentration i e 3 8 mg l appear as local patches in the 2006 distribution this inconsistency in the distribution of shallow groundwater nitrate n concentration might simply relate to the higher density of data from dommisse 2006 providing a more accurate depiction of the groundwater system or perhaps shows leakage from the open water race network by wash areas or a possible dilution effect from border dyke use that is not present under sprinkler type conditions cross sections of the two models are presented in fig 5 the cross section location is shown in fig 1 and further illustrate the degree of change in groundwater nitrate n concentration between the two periods despite this both periods show similar high nitrate n areas most notably in shallow groundwater and closer to the coast these areas of contamination found in both models suggest the dommisse 2006 data might simply indicate early groundwater contamination that has gotten worse over time 3 4 stable oxygen isotopes an estimation of the ratio between irrigation and rainfall recharge in groundwater samples collected during summer 2006 and summer 2017 was conducted the ratio of rainfall and irrigation recharge was calculated for each site and categorised by the depth of the well within the water table i e bore depth less depth to water the median value from each range was then taken and compared across the two datasets as shown in table 1 the results show that at all depths there is a decline of irrigation recharge relative to rainfall recharge this change is greatest in samples collected within the upper 10 m of the aquifer with irrigation recharge estimated as 45 in 2006 and 29 in 2017 4 discussion 4 1 changes in groundwater quantity in the study area elevated levels of groundwater were shown to occur through the 1970s and 1980s where they remained elevated for the next two decades the eigenmodel results fig 3 show increased groundwater recharge from border dyke and other flood irrigation to be the likely cause of the elevated groundwater levels it was not until around the mid 2000s that groundwater levels began to decline thorley et al 2010 found similar results in the neighbouring ashburton lyndhurst irrigation scheme that showed the recharge component from the ashburton lyndhurst irrigation scheme to be significantly propping up groundwater levels the authors noted that as increasingly efficient irrigation develops on the ashburton lyndhurst irrigation scheme it is likely that groundwater users might face dry wells and reduced reliability meredith and blais 2019 describe similar conditions in montana usa where the development of flood irrigation schemes contributed to elevated groundwater levels shallow wells were developed over time as the population considered the elevated aquifer conditions to be normal an annual volumetric decrease in groundwater of 23 9 gl was calculated between 2006 and 2017 fig 2 and illustrates part of the downward trend in groundwater levels that began in the early 2000 s identifying the major cause of the decline in aquifer storage is difficult without long term accurate data for each recharge and discharge component despite this the change in groundwater δ 18o composition recorded in the 2005 2006 and 2016 2017 irrigation seasons provides evidence that groundwater recharge originating from the mhis had declined over this period the estimated ratio between rainfall and irrigation recharge groundwater now indicates a system principally sourced from local precipitation with little mixing of alpine derived irrigation water 4 2 changes in groundwater quality modelled spatial distributions of nitrate n using data from the 2005 2006 and 2016 2017 irrigation seasons show a substantial increase in the groundwater nitrate n concentration between the two periods particularly in shallow groundwater fig 4 and 5 the increase of nitrate n concentration in groundwater and spring fed streams between 2006 and 2017 coincides with major irrigation conversion and land use changes as detailed previously section 1 4 although border dyke irrigation may increase the total amount of nitrate transported into the groundwater system burden 1982 the overall groundwater nitrate n concentration is kept low due to the dilution effect provided by the high quality mhis water i e 1 mg l nitrate n burden 1982 dommisse 2006 further evidence illustrating how the dilution effect has changed over time is provided by the regional shift in δ18o to less negative values in groundwater this change indicates only minor groundwater recharge from the current mhis in addition dommisse 2006 showed a substantial decline in nitrate n concentration in shallow groundwater throughout the irrigation season slowly increasing a few weeks after the irrigation season ended and irrigation recharge ceased in the 2016 2017 seasonal sampling shallow groundwater nitrate n concentration was relatively steady and showed no notable changes during the irrigation season there are two possible reasons that either individually or collectively explain the elevation of nitrate n levels in groundwater since 2005 1 the change to efficient irrigation and decreases in groundwater recharge and dilution of nitrate 2 increased land use by dairy and associated nitrate leaching the decline in aquifer storage groundwater quality and spring flows environment canterbury 2019 has prompted local community stakeholders to implement a managed aquifer recharge mar program across the catchment bower et al 2018 water for the mar program is supplied from the rangitata river and delivered to strategic locations the program uses a range of hydrological indicators to determine groundwater recharge rates and to manage potential flooding that occurred frequently under border dyke conditions dommisse 2006 this management change demonstrates a regional shift from unmanaged aquifer recharge i e border dyke irrigation to managed aquifer recharge in combination with efficient irrigation a regional water balance would be required to determine if water savings are occurring overall 5 conclusions the aim of this research was to identify changes in groundwater quantity and quality resulting from the conversion of border dyke to sprinkler irrigation in the study area regional border dyke irrigation was shown to cause artificially high groundwater levels between the early 1980s and mid 2000s the decline in groundwater levels that follows this artificial high coincides with major improvements to regional ie and ae an annual volumetric decrease in groundwater of 23 87 gl was calculated between 2006 and 2017 and illustrates part of the downward trend in groundwater levels a change to a less negative isotopic composition of δ18o in groundwater occurred between in 2005 6 and 2016 17 this indicates a shift in the source of groundwater recharge away from alpine derived irrigation water i e mhis water toward local precipitation as such the aquifer and flow in the spring fed drains have become increasingly dependent on levels of local rainfall without augmentation from irrigation water nitrate n concentration in groundwater within the study area has increased substantially over the past decade and poses a serious risk to drinking water sources this in combination with declining groundwater levels and spring flows is at least in part an unintended consequence of improved ae a managed aquifer recharge scheme is being implemented to address these unintended consequences but will also reduce the water savings that improved irrigation efficiency was originally intended to achieve declaration of competing interest the authors

increase the crop per drop in this paper we provide evidence of unintended consequences to groundwater arising from improved irrigation efficiency in parts of the canterbury plains new zealand we compare groundwater levels groundwater nitrate concentrations and stable isotope values from before and after the change in irrigation efficiency we show that changes in irrigation methods from low efficiency border dyke irrigation to high efficiency sprinkler irrigation has resulted in reduced recharge to groundwater and reductions in groundwater levels groundwater level reductions of up to 17 m have occurred in some areas the reduced groundwater levels have impacted spring flows and required groundwater users to drill new wells to access the now deeper groundwater the reduction in irrigation recharge has also likely contributed to increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater in response to the unintended consequences documented in this study managed aquifer recharge is being implemented as a means of augmenting groundwater levels quality and spring fed waterways as such increased irrigation efficiency may not be reducing water use in this region a regional water balance

specifically trends in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration might be influencing observed changes in hydrology 5 identify consequences to groundwater of improvements in ae 1 1 case study area the hinds rangitata plain hrp is located in the south island of new zealand on the canterbury plains fig 1 the hrp covers an area of 580 km2 bounded by the rangitata and hinds rivers southern alps foothills and the pacific ocean hereafter the hrp is referred to as the study area for simplicity the study area was selected because previous research by dommisse 2006 who studied the hydrological impacts of border dyke irrigation provided a comprehensive set of baseline data for the 2005 2006 irrigation season irrigated agriculture in the study area started in the late 1940s with the completion of a surface water irrigation scheme the mayfield hinds irrigation scheme mhis mhis sources and distributes water to irrigators from the rangitata river through a 320 km network of water races early uptake of irrigation water was low and primarily in the form of relatively inefficient wild flooding and border dyke irrigation over the next seventy years the demand for water increased in the study area a result of changing land use and the expansion of irrigated agriculture durney et al 2014 1 2 physical setting the canterbury plains are a series of coalescing glacial outwash and alluvial fans comprised of quaternary gravels wilson 1985 soils within the study area are typically shallow 200 mm deep free draining stony silt loam with low water holding capacity profile available water of 65 70 mm this soil type is prone to drought in the summer and requires extensive irrigation dommisse 2006 hanson and abraham 2013 average annual precipitation ranges from 614 mm at the coast to 950 mm at the foothills in the upper regions of the study area durney et al 2014 groundwater within the gravels flows from the foothills of the southern alps to the coast often emerging as springs or creeks near the coast dommisse 2006 the distance from the coast to the foothills is approximately 50 km and ranges in elevation from sea level to 400 m 1 3 land use land use in the study area is influenced by a number of factors including soil type rainfall accessibility to water economics i e relative market prices environment technological advances education and community expectations dodson 2006 dommisse 2006 historically land use in the study area has been predominantly sheep pastoral and mixed farming i e cash crop and stock there has been an increase in dairy within the study area leading to higher risk of nitrate contamination ramesh et al 2009 in 2006 dairy made up 35 of land use in the study area dodson 2006 and by 2015 16 this had increased to 62 as detailed by farm environment plans mhv water limited personal communication march 15 2017 1 4 changes in irrigation practises irrigation practices within the study area have undergone rapid change in the past two decades see supplementary figure 1 during the 2005 2006 irrigation season 76 of irrigation was by border dyke and 24 by sprinkler dommisse 2006 during the 2013 2014 irrigation season 10 of irrigation was by border dyke and 90 by sprinkler predominately in the form of centre pivots canterbury maps 2019 these trends in irrigation conversion have continued mhv water limited personal communication march 15 2017 water provided for irrigation use by mhis is taken from the rangitata river which has its headwaters in an alpine setting nitrate n concentrations from the rangitata river sampled approximately 20 km downstream of the irrigation intake are consistently low 5 year median of 0 054 mg l lawa 2019 and has been shown to provide a dilution effect to groundwater nitrate n values when applied through border dyke irrigation in the study area dommisse 2006 this dilution effect from border dyke irrigation has been observed elsewhere in canterbury close 1987 it was speculated that regional conversion to more efficient irrigation would result in a considerable loss of groundwater recharge and subsequent changes in groundwater quantity and quality davey 2006 dommisse 2006 it is important to understand the source of water for irrigation i e surface water versus groundwater however this is difficult due to a paucity of data relating to groundwater use in the area arising from a lack of metering and data collection during the study period the mhis supplies water to irrigators from surface water and the annual average supply remained relatively stable over the study period mhv water limited personal communication march 15 2017 irrigators sought to supplement this surface water supply i e insure against times when supply was restricted because of low flows in the rangitata river through an increase in groundwater well installation starting in the 1990s and peaking during the 2000 2010 period over time the mhis increased water storage capabilities and this in addition to individual farm ponds constructed over the same period improved the reliability of supply reducing the need for supplementary groundwater supply 1 5 groundwater quality water quality monitoring on the hinds plains a region that includes the study area showed increases in average annual nitrate n between 2005 and 2012 in shallow groundwater 13 wells sampled with depths 41 m below ground increasing from 7 to 11 mg l and surface water drains 7 sites were sampled increasing from 6 mg l to 10 mg l scott 2013 the lack of historic data for deep wells in the study area makes it difficult to determine long term nitrate trends and little is known about shallow and deep groundwater residence times within the study area 2 materials and methods this research consisted of two parts the collection of field data in the study area and a desktop study that analysed the field data comparing the findings with research by dommisse 2006 i e when the study area was predominantly irrigated by border dyke the field campaign in this study was specifically designed to enable a comparison of groundwater quantity and quality data collected and reported by dommisse 2006 a piezometric survey consisting of 72 wells was carried out in summer 2017 i e during the irrigation season wells used in the dommisse 2006 study also carried out in summer during the irrigation season were prioritized for selection to enable comparison and an estimation of change in groundwater volume between 2006 and 2017 horizontal and vertical coordinates for all of the wells were obtained using a trimble geo 7x trimble 2019 to ensure horizontal and vertical accuracy of the measuring points water samples were collected from 33 groundwater sites for a range of water chemistry and stable isotopes see fig 1 these wells were selected because they fit the criteria for groundwater sampling outlined within the nz national protocol for groundwater sampling ministry for the environment 2006 2 1 eigenmodel to identify historic trends in groundwater head and the relationship to climate inputs an eigenmodel bidwell et al 1991 was built for the study eigenmodelling is a one dimensional physics based mathematical approach for assessing the temporal response of an aquifer to the influence of time variant recharge eigenmodels are based around a simple representation of an aquifer and provide a useful method for determining the causes of aquifer response particularly where long term groundwater level trends are the key source of information on the historical and current behaviour of an aquifer the eigenmodel approach has been widely used in groundwater assessment studies in new zealand e g stenger et al 2008 williams et al 2008 records of well k37 0245 canterbury maps 2019 were used for the eigenmodel beginning in january 1960 and continuing to the present this well is located in the centre of the study area see fig 1 and was selected due to its historic and high frequency groundwater level data historic rainfall records for the model were obtained from two sources a niwa climate station station i d 5049 niwa 2019 located within 3 km of the hinds township and previously unpublished rainfall data from a local landowner station i d 1 penman pet which predicts evaporation based on mean daily temperature wind speed air pressure and solar radiation was obtained from a niwa climate station station i d 39845 niwa 2019 climate station locations are shown in fig 1 rainfall pet and groundwater level data between january 1 1960 and december 31 1969 were used to calibrate the model this interval provides a calibration period in which minor groundwater development and irrigation had occurred the modelled output therefore predicts groundwater levels based on climate data and do not include irrigation as a recharge component thus a comparison of modelled groundwater levels with observed groundwater levels can be used to infer irrigation recharge over time 2 2 groundwater nitrate n modelling two models were constructed for this study in order to compare the three dimensional distribution of nitrate n within the same aquifer over a decade as described in section 2 1 33 wells were sampled for quality parameters during the 2016 2017 irrigation season and the nitrate n values were compared with those captured by dommisse 2006 during the 2005 2006 irrigation season leapfrog works version 3 0 1 hereafter referred to as leapfrog seequent ltd 2019 a hydrogeological software package was used to create the two models leapfrog uses radial basis functions for its interpolation and extrapolation algorithms in order to make predictions at locations where there are no measurements nichols et al 2020 radial basis functions approximate a specific type of kriging called dual kriging a comprehensive explanation of dual kriging is provided by horowitz et al 1996 the two groundwater nitrate models were constructed from data obtained in this study and data from 68 sites sampled by dommisse 2006 using the same method first the middle point of each well screen used in either dataset was calculated to provide the location within the aquifer to assign each nitrate n value the horizontal boundaries were set using the surrounding water features i e rangitata river hinds river and the sea and the inland boundary of the study area the upper vertical boundary for each model was set using the corresponding piezometric surface as described in section 3 1 the lower vertical boundary was set by creating a straight line between the base of the deepest wells sampled in lieu of data relating to the base of the aquifer the leapfrog radial basis functions engine was then run with nitrate n output ranges set to relevant new zealand nitrate n biotoxicity and drinking water standards anzecc 2000 2 3 stable oxygen isotopes as tracers stable oxygen isotopes can be used for their characteristic isotope signature to reveal the source of recharge in a groundwater system stable oxygen isotopes are useful tracers in the hydrologic cycle as they are a constituent atom of the water molecule and are continuously added at catchment scale by natural processes i e rainfall and snowmelt events stable oxygen isotopes have been used extensively in hydrological research both internationally jasechko 2019 and within new zealand stewart and morgenstern 2001 canterbury alpine rivers such as the rangitata river have their origins in high altitude catchments alpine river water has been shown to have δ 18o values ranging from 90 00 to 120 00 dommisse 2006 hanson and abraham 2013 a δ 18o value of 10 30 00 has been reported for the rangitata river by hanson and abraham 2013 lowland rainfall recharge that falls near the coast is shown to have δ 18o values of 7 70 00 stewart and morgenstern 2001 thus groundwater in the study area that has been recharged from irrigation water i e alpine river water will tend to have more negative δ 18o values compared to groundwater supplied by rainfall recharge stable oxygen isotopes were collected from 57 groundwater sites during the 2005 2006 irrigation season by dommisse 2006 and 33 in this study during the 2016 2017 irrigation season the composition of recharge was estimated for both survey periods using the assumption that only two recharge sources contributed to the groundwater system irrigation and rainfall recharge to calculate the ratio rainfall recharge was estimated as rainfall sample δ 18 o river δ 18 o rain δ 18 o river δ 18 o this approach was applied by close et al 1995 in the neighbouring catchment of ashburton rakaia to estimate the ratio of river and rainfall recharge in groundwater 3 results 3 1 groundwater volume changes a groundwater level change map was produced using the piezometric survey snapshot recorded during the 2005 2006 irrigation season by dommisse 2006 and the piezometric survey carried out in this study during the 2016 2017 irrigation season fig 2 a similar period of below average rainfall occurred prior to the dommisse 2006 piezometric survey and the piezometric surveys carried out during this study a volumetric decrease of 262 6 gl was calculated between 2006 and 2017 this value was calculated using the change in groundwater level surface shown in fig 2 and an assumed average effective porosity of 0 17 dann et al 2008 using the value of 262 6 gl an annual volumetric decrease of 23 9 gl can be determined between 2006 and 2017 this is equal to approximately 18 of the annual average irrigation volume i e between 2009 and 2017 or 27 of the annual groundwater abstraction volume in 2006 dommisse 2006 spatially the most significant groundwater level decline of between 10 and 17 m occur inland of state highway 1 which is a road shown in fig 2 running roughly parallel and a distance of 13 km from the coast and intersecting the study area coastward of state highway 1 the decline in groundwater levels range between 0 m and 9 m increases in groundwater levels of up to 4 m were shown near the coast close to the hinds river the cause of this increase is difficult to determine and might relate to the few observations in this area the difference might simply reflect poor interpolation resulting from the kriging 3 2 eigenmodel the results of the eigenmodelling are shown in fig 3 there is generally good agreement between the modelled and observed groundwater level during the calibration period although large drops in observed groundwater levels were simulated slightly too conservatively by the model i e late 1960 and late 1967 the post calibration results of the eigenmodel show two distinctly different periods in terms of the match between modelled and observed groundwater level the first period is from the early 1980s to mid 2000s when the modelled groundwater level is consistently lower than the observed groundwater level the peaks in observed groundwater levels during this period generally occur within irrigation seasons and frequently do so independent of the modelled line the difference between the observed and modelled groundwater levels ranges from 0 5 m to 6 m during the peaks and 1 to 4 m during the troughs as the model predicts groundwater level results from climate inputs and does not account for irrigation recharge we interpret the difference between the modelled and observed groundwater level during this period to be indicative of elevated groundwater levels caused by increased recharge from low efficiency border dyke irrigation that is the eigenmodel is indicating that elevated groundwater levels during this period are likely a response to irrigation recharge rather than increased rainfall in general the second period occurs from around 2010 and continues to the end of the model in 2016 the observed and modelled groundwater level has a good fit similar to that of the calibration period we interpret these results as indicating that the decline in observed groundwater levels since the mid 2000s is reflecting a reduction in irrigation derived recharge relative to that occurring in the period from the early 1980s to mid 2000s 3 3 nitrate n modelling two groundwater nitrate n models were developed to identify the three dimensional distribution of nitrate n in the study area groundwater under border dyke and sprinkler type irrigation the first model see fig 4 upper was developed using nitrate n values from groundwater samples collected by dommisse 2006 during the 2005 2006 irrigation season this model provides a snapshot of the study area groundwater system under almost entirely border dyke irrigation the model shows relatively low levels of nitrate n i e 5 6 mg l with some stratification of groundwater nitrate n concentration with depth and an increase in nitrate n values toward the coast the second model was developed using the nitrate n values from groundwater samples collected as part of the current study during the 2016 2017 irrigation season this model provides a snapshot of the groundwater system within the study area under almost entirely sprinkler type irrigation this model shows relatively high levels of nitrate n i e 6 9 mg l similar to the 2006 distribution there is a general trend of increased nitrate n concentration within proximity of the surface and towards the coast despite similar spatial trends between the two nitrate n distributions the areas of shallow groundwater that show elevated nitrate n concentration in the 2006 distribution are not as consistent across the study area as they are in the 2017 distribution appearing as local patches similarly shallow groundwater containing low nitrate n concentration i e 3 8 mg l appear as local patches in the 2006 distribution this inconsistency in the distribution of shallow groundwater nitrate n concentration might simply relate to the higher density of data from dommisse 2006 providing a more accurate depiction of the groundwater system or perhaps shows leakage from the open water race network by wash areas or a possible dilution effect from border dyke use that is not present under sprinkler type conditions cross sections of the two models are presented in fig 5 the cross section location is shown in fig 1 and further illustrate the degree of change in groundwater nitrate n concentration between the two periods despite this both periods show similar high nitrate n areas most notably in shallow groundwater and closer to the coast these areas of contamination found in both models suggest the dommisse 2006 data might simply indicate early groundwater contamination that has gotten worse over time 3 4 stable oxygen isotopes an estimation of the ratio between irrigation and rainfall recharge in groundwater samples collected during summer 2006 and summer 2017 was conducted the ratio of rainfall and irrigation recharge was calculated for each site and categorised by the depth of the well within the water table i e bore depth less depth to water the median value from each range was then taken and compared across the two datasets as shown in table 1 the results show that at all depths there is a decline of irrigation recharge relative to rainfall recharge this change is greatest in samples collected within the upper 10 m of the aquifer with irrigation recharge estimated as 45 in 2006 and 29 in 2017 4 discussion 4 1 changes in groundwater quantity in the study area elevated levels of groundwater were shown to occur through the 1970s and 1980s where they remained elevated for the next two decades the eigenmodel results fig 3 show increased groundwater recharge from border dyke and other flood irrigation to be the likely cause of the elevated groundwater levels it was not until around the mid 2000s that groundwater levels began to decline thorley et al 2010 found similar results in the neighbouring ashburton lyndhurst irrigation scheme that showed the recharge component from the ashburton lyndhurst irrigation scheme to be significantly propping up groundwater levels the authors noted that as increasingly efficient irrigation develops on the ashburton lyndhurst irrigation scheme it is likely that groundwater users might face dry wells and reduced reliability meredith and blais 2019 describe similar conditions in montana usa where the development of flood irrigation schemes contributed to elevated groundwater levels shallow wells were developed over time as the population considered the elevated aquifer conditions to be normal an annual volumetric decrease in groundwater of 23 9 gl was calculated between 2006 and 2017 fig 2 and illustrates part of the downward trend in groundwater levels that began in the early 2000 s identifying the major cause of the decline in aquifer storage is difficult without long term accurate data for each recharge and discharge component despite this the change in groundwater δ 18o composition recorded in the 2005 2006 and 2016 2017 irrigation seasons provides evidence that groundwater recharge originating from the mhis had declined over this period the estimated ratio between rainfall and irrigation recharge groundwater now indicates a system principally sourced from local precipitation with little mixing of alpine derived irrigation water 4 2 changes in groundwater quality modelled spatial distributions of nitrate n using data from the 2005 2006 and 2016 2017 irrigation seasons show a substantial increase in the groundwater nitrate n concentration between the two periods particularly in shallow groundwater fig 4 and 5 the increase of nitrate n concentration in groundwater and spring fed streams between 2006 and 2017 coincides with major irrigation conversion and land use changes as detailed previously section 1 4 although border dyke irrigation may increase the total amount of nitrate transported into the groundwater system burden 1982 the overall groundwater nitrate n concentration is kept low due to the dilution effect provided by the high quality mhis water i e 1 mg l nitrate n burden 1982 dommisse 2006 further evidence illustrating how the dilution effect has changed over time is provided by the regional shift in δ18o to less negative values in groundwater this change indicates only minor groundwater recharge from the current mhis in addition dommisse 2006 showed a substantial decline in nitrate n concentration in shallow groundwater throughout the irrigation season slowly increasing a few weeks after the irrigation season ended and irrigation recharge ceased in the 2016 2017 seasonal sampling shallow groundwater nitrate n concentration was relatively steady and showed no notable changes during the irrigation season there are two possible reasons that either individually or collectively explain the elevation of nitrate n levels in groundwater since 2005 1 the change to efficient irrigation and decreases in groundwater recharge and dilution of nitrate 2 increased land use by dairy and associated nitrate leaching the decline in aquifer storage groundwater quality and spring flows environment canterbury 2019 has prompted local community stakeholders to implement a managed aquifer recharge mar program across the catchment bower et al 2018 water for the mar program is supplied from the rangitata river and delivered to strategic locations the program uses a range of hydrological indicators to determine groundwater recharge rates and to manage potential flooding that occurred frequently under border dyke conditions dommisse 2006 this management change demonstrates a regional shift from unmanaged aquifer recharge i e border dyke irrigation to managed aquifer recharge in combination with efficient irrigation a regional water balance would be required to determine if water savings are occurring overall 5 conclusions the aim of this research was to identify changes in groundwater quantity and quality resulting from the conversion of border dyke to sprinkler irrigation in the study area regional border dyke irrigation was shown to cause artificially high groundwater levels between the early 1980s and mid 2000s the decline in groundwater levels that follows this artificial high coincides with major improvements to regional ie and ae an annual volumetric decrease in groundwater of 23 87 gl was calculated between 2006 and 2017 and illustrates part of the downward trend in groundwater levels a change to a less negative isotopic composition of δ18o in groundwater occurred between in 2005 6 and 2016 17 this indicates a shift in the source of groundwater recharge away from alpine derived irrigation water i e mhis water toward local precipitation as such the aquifer and flow in the spring fed drains have become increasingly dependent on levels of local rainfall without augmentation from irrigation water nitrate n concentration in groundwater within the study area has increased substantially over the past decade and poses a serious risk to drinking water sources this in combination with declining groundwater levels and spring flows is at least in part an unintended consequence of improved ae a managed aquifer recharge scheme is being implemented to address these unintended consequences but will also reduce the water savings that improved irrigation efficiency was originally intended to achieve declaration of competing interest the authors

10256,meteorological data are often collected in dry desert regions where the local environments exhibit effects of aridity caused by the lack of evapotranspiration et in contrast the standard reference et eto calculations of fao56 and asce assume that the surfaces underlying collected weather data are well watered so that near surface meteorological measurements reflect the cooling and humidifying effects of an evaporating surface in this study we develop a weather data conditioning process and algorithms to adjust for biases in meteorological data that exhibit aridity effects the conditioning process is intended to adjust the weather data to better exhibit characteristics of data collected over a well watered vegetated surface prior to use of the data to estimate reference et the procedure involves the extrapolation of air temperature vapor pressure and wind speed profiles to and from a regional blending height using standard surface energy balance equations and flux profile relationships and employing et estimated for the ambient dry conditions of an arid weather station and reference et that should co exist with weather measurements used to calculation reference et example applications are given with 24 hour weather data and hourly weather data in idaho and nevada results indicate that reference eto can be overstated by as much as 25 in southern idaho and 8 in eastern nevada the methodology is intended to be transferrable to other regions and climates and is self aware of the need for conditioning of weather data according to differences in ambient et and the reference et estimates keywords evapotranspiration aridity boundary layer profiles blending height conditioning reference evapotranspiration surface energy balance weather data 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is generally the second largest component of hydrologic systems and water balances following precipitation and is the driving component for irrigation water requirements iwr of agricultural crops quantifying et for specific crops and regions is required for litigation of water right applications and disputes design of irrigation systems for basin water balance estimates for irrigation water management for improvement of crop yields and water use efficiency and for weather prediction many parts of the world including the western united states are struggling to combat climate change changing environmental policies such as sustainable groundwater management act of california california groundwater n d and reduced water for ecosystems as well as for the agriculture sector because of extreme droughts and increased competition for water accurate et computations assist with estimating amounts of water entering groundwater systems huntington et al 2016 and guide policymakers in coping with effects of climatic extremes wilhite 2000 there continues to be continuous encouragement from various stakeholders for more accurate et estimates over increasingly large spatial and temporal scales kalluri et al 2003 meinzen dick and van der hoek 2001 1 1 reference et reference crop et or reference evapotranspiration etref is a concept suggested by jensen 1968 wright and jensen 1972 and doorenbos and pruitt 1975 1977 to address some of the ambiguities associated with definitions for potential et and to serve as a consistent climatic index for et etref has become the standard means to characterize climatic effects on the et rate standardizations by fao allen et al 1998 and asce 2005 2016 provide consistency and reproducibility in estimating etref and a consistent basis for determining and expressing kc curves especially at the local scale many satellite based remote sensing models employ reference et for model calibration and for interpolation of et between satellite overpass dates allen et al 2007 dhungel et al 2016b biases in reference et estimates caused by aridity of weather data can cause overestimation of spatial et estimates some physically based et algorithms interpolate between satellite overpass dates dhungel et al 2016b long and singh 2010 semmens et al 2016 and reduce the dependency on reference et estimates mardikis et al 2005 vicente serrano et al 2007 and on mathematical interpolation trezza et al 2013 however a majority of studies still utilize interpolation techniques that employ reference et currently the standard and most common practice for calculating et for agricultural crops uses a two step crop coefficient kc reference et etref approach where etref is the rate at which soil water if readily available would be converted to water vapor for a specific fully vegetated reference surface under given atmospheric conditions the crop coefficient modifies the value for etref to account for specific effects of crop type amount of ground covered stage of growth aerodynamic roughness and stomatal control the recommended procedures for estimating etref utilize physically based forms of the penman monteith pm method the fao56 allen et al 1998 and its equivalent asce 2005 standardized pm method have been standardized with respect to internal parameters and supporting equations because numbers and densities of weather stations collecting solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed required for the pm method are often limited procedures have been developed that utilize gridded weather data from weather forecast and land data assimilation system ldas products rodell 2020 these systems support application of the standardized etref method and create the means to produce more robust and climatically sensitive data sets of crop et and net iwr that may be more fully useable by scientific resource management and policy making communities 1 2 impact of weather data aridity on reference et calculations an important assumption and requirement in applying the pm method to calculate etref for irrigated agriculture is the assumption that the surface underlying a weather data set is evaporating or transpiring at nearly the same rate as the etref calculation produced by the pm equation and that the near surface profiles for air temperature humidity and wind speed are in equilibrium with the well watered surface represented by etref allen et al 1998 2013a 2013b asce 2005 2016 this requirement stems from the use of a relatively low bulk surface resistance high surface conductance in the pm equation that instructs the equation to estimate relatively large etref according to the air temperature humidity and wind speed properties that are assigned at the reference height above the surface the reference height is generally established at 2 m doorenbos and pruitt 1975 1977 asce 1990 2016 allen et al 1998 in addition the net radiation rn estimate for the standardized pm etref equation assumes a relatively cool surface with long wave radiative emission that can be as much as 100 w m 2 less than that emitted by a non evaporating warmer surface informing the standardized pm etref equation with arid data gives the standardized equation the wrong idea on what the et flux from the underlying surface must have been to cause the warmer than realistic air temperature lower than realistic humidity higher than realistic wind speed and lower than realistic outgoing longwave radiation to occur in spite of being located over an assumed vegetated surface having high surface conductance in other words the user of the pm equation has created an impossible situation where the pm equation is informed with near surface air properties that do not and can not exist in the presence of relatively large et rates this impossible situation must be mitigated by either limiting weather data sets to those that are collected over large well watered surfaces or by conditioning a weather data set to adjust the near surface air temperature humidity and wind speed data to levels expected and realistic for well watered conditions 1 3 gridded weather data sets current methods for estimating et and iwr are generally based on calculations of et made using data from sparsely located weather stations many of which may be located in partially or completely dry nonevaporating environments over the past 10 20 years the advent of gridded historical weather data derived from sophisticated ldas operated by noaa s national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the national science foundation sponsored national center for atmospheric research ncar has provided an alternative data source to the traditional use of point based weather station data for estimating et and iwr ldas systems are operated for purposes of weather research and weather and climate forecasting the ldas systems assimilate electronically available weather data from point weather sites around the globe and couple those data with land process soil and vegetation water balance models and with atmospheric models to extend the point data and to create gridded weather data

by matching grid points and found relatively good correspondence a similar study was done by hidalgo et al 2005 for california and in florida by said et al 2006 interest in computing etref from gridded weather data has led to the creation of two recent products from noaa one estimating etref using nldas data hobbins 2016 and another product forecasting etref using the national digital forecast database ndfd called forecasted reference evapotranspiration fret palmer et al 2016 1 4 biases in gridded weather data the ldas applications do not evaluate nor mitigate for the impacts of dryness of weather sites used in the data assimilation processes on reference et estimates made for use with irrigation related management these impacts can overstate computed etref as demonstrated by blankenau et al 2020 by as much as 20 30 greatly reducing the value and adequacy of the reference et estimates for irrigation planning design and management and hydrologic studies when used to calculate etref the gldas nldas and other data sets should be reviewed to determine whether the gridded data contain substantial artifacts of dryness from the original weather data used to drive the lsm models thereby violating assumptions in reference et estimation these artifacts may produce weather data that are characteristic of regional weather systems which in semiarid and arid climates reflect general aridity of the region however for purposes of estimating etref for use in irrigation related settings the ambient gridded weather data may not exhibit the conditioning effects that irrigation has on near surface air properties where air temperature is reduced and humidity content is increased by et supplied by irrigation generally the ldas models creating the gridded data sets are not aware of and do not include irrigation in their daily soil water balances that are used to estimate et and the partitioning of available energy into sensible heat flux h and estimation of rn some of the earlier studies to understand the human induced modifications to boundary layer fluxes by irrigation include adegoke et al 2003 barnston and schickedanz 1984 jaksa and sridhar 2015 and sridhar and anderson 2017 a study at idaho allen et al 1983 reported calculated etref as high as 17 greater when using weather data collected over nonirrigated environments as opposed to that collected over irrigated environments while temesgen et al 1999 reported eto as high as 25 stemming from aridity effects the recent study by blankenau et al 2020 compared weather properties and resulting etref calculations for more than 100 agricultural weather stations across the us with data from nldas gldas cfsv2 gridmet the real time mesoscale analysis rtma and the national digital forecast database ndfd data systems they found summertime etref computed from the gridded weather data sets to exceed that computed from the agricultural weather stations by 10 30 on average with rtma and ndfd having smaller biases than the other four gridded data sets as an example of aridity artifacts in gridded weather data sets figs 1 and 2 show 3 hourly air temperature and 3 hourly vapor pressure for a narr data set which is similar to the nldas data set for a grid cell located near twin falls idaho during a period during july 2008 the data are compared against measured air temperature and vapor pressure from the nearby twin falls agrimet station that is an electronic automated weather station that is located in an irrigated agricultural environment while there is close correspondence between the two data sets which is a positive indication of good assimilation of general weather data at a local scale the narr near surface air temperature generally overstated the agrimet air temperature by up to 5 c and the vapor pressure representing near surface water vapor content was understated by about one half during july fig 3 shows vapor pressure for the two twin falls data sets for the 2008 year the two data sets were in good agreement during the first four months of 2008 and during the last two months of 2008 when surface conditions were mostly barren for both ambient and irrigated fields and no irrigation was occurring the substantial separation of the two data sets occurred beginning in june when desert grasses dried due to lack of precipitation and irrigated crops were often near full ground cover and maximum et these types of outcomes are common and as shown in a later section will cause overestimation of etref by as much as 20 30 by ignoring the influence of conditioning of the equilibrium boundary layer ebl due to evaporative cooling that occurs over irrigated agriculture jacobs and debruin 1992 brown 2001 asce 2005 allen 2011 lewis et al 2014 moorhead et al 2015 martins et al 2017 and paredes et al 2018 1 5 approaches to adjusting aridity impacted weather data researchers hydrologists and engineers have long recognized the impact of local aridity on near surface weather measurements and the lack of synchronization with the evaporating surfaces associated with irrigated agriculture and the consequent incongruency with etref equations such as the standardized fao 56 and asce penman monteith method in the past empirical methods have been developed to adjust arid air temperature downward and in some cases adjust arid vapor pressure upward allen et al 1983 1998 ley et al 1994 jensen et al 1997 temesgen et al 1999 these empirical approaches generally employ linear adjustments based on observed differences between weather data collected from close by irrigated and nonirrigated locations or by differences between daily minimum air temperature tmin and daily average dew point temperature tdew some applications of the pm method for etref have recommended dismissing the tdew data from measured weather data sets that exhibit effects of aridity lack of conditioning by et and have instead replaced measurements with estimated tdew values that are reflective of well watered settings estimated tdew was produced by applying expected differences between measured tmin and tdew under irrigated conditions allen et al 1998 asce 2005 2016 allen and robison 2007 these methods while useful provide approximate assessments or adjustments to arid air temperature and humidity data and have been considered to be stop gap measures 1 5 1 boundary and blending layer approaches a theoretically based boundary layer profile procedure is described here that conditions gridded data sets to better represent weather data that should exist under well watered surface conditions and therefore provides a better data set for estimating etref for use in irrigation related environments allen et al 2013a 2013b the boundary layer profile method employs the blending height concept discussed in the next section to establish near surface air temperature ta specific humidity q and wind speed uz adjustments to transform arid point weather data or gridded hourly 3 hourly and daily narr or nldas type weather data into conditioned weather data series that are more suitable for computing point or gridded reference evapotranspiration representing the special and specific equilibrium conditions that are experienced over irrigated surfaces the procedure can be applied to weather data used for estimating et for irrigation systems management water rights management irrigation planning irrigation scheduling and for general water resources analyses the procedure is primarily based on theoretical concepts that should not require empirical calibration 1 5 2 objectives of this study objectives of this study were to 1 develop the means to transform point weather data or gridded hourly 3 hourly or daily weather data from ldas and similar data sets into conditioned weather data series that can be used to compute gridded reference evapotranspiration representing the equilibrium conditions associated with irrigated surfaces 2 investigate the accuracy and extent of bias corrections in the gridded data sets by comparing against weather data measured over well watered vegetated surfaces 2 materials and methods this section details the procedure developed to condition ambient weather data collected in an arid ambient environment or produced by an ldas to better reflect what would have been measured or modeled under the same climate and environmental conditions but where a large evaporating reference surface existed that is by definition well watered this adjustment is necessary to condition weather data prior to processing by a reference et equation such as the fao or asce ewri standardized penman monteith equations that most accurately approximate the expected et within an irrigated environment 2 1 the blending height and profiles the procedure uses extrapolation of reported air temperature ta specific humidity or vapor pressure e and wind speed uz profiles from near the ground surface up to a blending height that is established 50 to a few hundred m above the surface fig 4a the extrapolation of ta e and uz from near the ground surface to the blending height is made using the estimated ambient et and associated sensible heat flux h once ta e and uz properties are established at the blending height new profiles for ta e and uz are established back towards the surface fig 4b but using et and h quantities that represent the new etref new conditioned values for ta e and uz are then selected from the conditioned profiles at 2 or 3 m height above the ground surface a refined estimate for etref is then calculated the approach follows a common assumption that a blending height exists over a subregion that has temperature humidity and wind speed uz properties that do not change very rapidly as an air mass moves from over nonirrigated to over irrigated surfaces or vice versa wieringa 1986 shuttleworth et al 2009 as a consequence the air properties estimated for the blending height can be assumed to be a somewhat fixed boundary condition and endpoint during establishment of postulated boundary layer profiles for ta humidity q or e and uz the properties of the blending layer are assumed to be the same and representative of general regional climate whether the underlying surface is evapotranspiring at ambient regional rates that are based on precipitation inputs or whether the underlying surface is evapotranspiring at higher rates supported by irrigation therefore the estimated fluxes for et and consequently net radiation rn soil heat flux g and h can be switched from ambient to irrigated situations and new profiles for ta e and uz established using the same blending layer endpoints the new profiles are used to estimate the near surface properties associated with the switch in et rn g and h that represent a well watered surface condition the approach is similar to switching out the carpet where a drier carpet is replaced with a wetter carpet and ta e and uz profiles associated with the wetter carpet are established the use of a blending layer in this manner has been employed in a number of models that model the lower portions of the planetary boundary layer including mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 de bruin 1989 philip 1996 shuttleworth 2006 and in applications for estimating et by shuttleworth 2006 2007 shuttleworth et al 2009 and lhomme et al 2015 wieringa 1986 interpreted the blending height as a height above which modifications to air flow due to changes in surface conditions are not discernable individually and where an overall stress or heat flux profile can exist that represents the combined surface conditions of a large area mason 1988 defined the blending height as a scale height at which the flow is approximately in equilibrium with the local surface and also independent of horizontal position mahrt 1996 showed theoretically that the height of the blended layer depends on deviation of turbulent fluctuations in vertical velocity uniformity of patches of varying vegetation characteristics the surface friction velocity and the free convection velocity scale raupach and finnigan 1995 suggested that the blending height can be taken to be at the top of the surface layer which is on the order of 50 m under a range of surface conditions the 50 m blending height has been utilized in the disalexi remote sensing of et model norman et al 2003 to extrapolate ta and uz to the ground surface and by shuttleworth 2006 2007 shuttleworth et al 2009 and lhomme et al 2015 the blending height in the procedure described in the next section is kept as a variable to be set by the user however as shown later a 50 m height has been found to work well with idaho and nevada data and is recommended as a default value the process is somewhat insensitive to the value for the blending height since slopes of ta q and uz profiles are relatively vertical with very small gradients near the blending height shuttleworth 2006 2007 and lhomme et al 2015 applied the blending height concept to establish profiles for ta and q from the surface to the blending height to transform crop coefficients into equivalent bulk surface resistances and to establish properties of near surface vapor pressure deficit for the pm equation that incorporate feedback of the et flux however neither procedure incorporated effects of boundary layer stability and instability which can be sizeable under low et high h conditions and can substantially impact shapes of ta and q profiles boundary instability also impacts near surface wind speed by increasing the entrainment of higher velocity air from the blending height to the surface 2 2 calculations the conditioning procedure is divided into three primary parts or steps 1 establish ambient ta q and uz profiles from a near surface measurement height s that extend up to a blending height based on ambient ta q and uz measurements or estimates and using estimated ambient et as shown in fig 4a 2 establish conditioned ta q and uz profiles from the blending height back toward the surface using a reference et flux imposed at the surface as shown in fig 4b 3 after an iteratively determined calculation of reference et and established conditioned ta q and uz profiles select final conditioned values for ta q and uz at a standardized reference height of 2 m from the conditioned profiles and make a final calculation for etref a flowchart of primary variables and components of the process is illustrated in fig 5 standard boundary layer profile equations are employed with some adjustments on limits of buoyancy corrections to help control numerical instability during calculation the procedure is proposed for application to hourly or daily weather data in the case of hourly data the process is applied separately to each hourly period hourly timesteps are short enough that all weather parameters and boundary layer profiles can be assumed to be synchronized and scalar and flux values can be treated as though they are nearly instantaneous a full data set containing measurements of air temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed is required 2 2 1 working with 24 hour data the blending height and profile procedure that is developed for use with hourly data conditioning is also used for 24 hour weather data conditioning to provide consistency and to produce a procedure that should not ordinarily require empirical calibration or adjustment the latter is a desirable feature of the approach future work can aim towards simplification and perhaps linearization of some components such as boundary layer stability correction however all algorithms are straightforward to code into software and provide a relatively sound basis for the establishment of scalar profiles in the case of daily 24 hour weather data data properties vary substantially within the 24 hour time step so that daily averages can not be used in calculations for energy balance and extrapolation of scalars to the blending height instead two times during the day representing extremes in air temperature are selected as proxies to establish bias corrections for ta q and uz for example assuming that daily maximum tmax and daily minimum tmin temperatures are available in a daily weather data set one can assign approximate times of occurrence to these extremes if unknown for example 2 p m for tmax and 5 a m for tmin and make approximations for humidity and uz at those same times based on daily averages for humidity and uz solar radiation rs at the times of tmax and tmin can be estimated using the daily average atmospheric transmissivity to estimate rs and calculated theoretical solar radiation an instantaneous value for 2 p m time can be estimated from the 24 hour average as 1 r s 2 p m r s 24 r s o 24 r s o 2 p m where rs 24 is the 24 hour average rs rso 24 is the theoretical rs for the 24 hour period under clear sky conditions and rso 2pm is the clear sky rs at 2 p m equation 1 assumes that atmospheric transmissivity and cloudiness conditions at 2 p m are the same as the average for the day rso can be calculated from a variety of algorithms for example those by allen et al 1998 and asce 2005 2016 vapor pressure generally increases during daytime if there is evaporation from the surface daytime wind speed tends to increase on average due to atmospheric buoyancy effects caused by surface heating and associated entrainment of higher velocity air from aloft therefore a 2 p m vapor pressure can be assumed for example to be 1 2 times the 24 hour average and e at 5 a m can be assumed to be 0 83 times the 24 hour average so that the 24 hour value determined by averaging the two extremes is not changed similar values can be established for wind speed for example where 2 p m wind speed is 1 2 times the 24 hour average and 5 a m is 0 83 times the 24 hour average to simulate generally higher daytime wind speeds than nighttime 2 2 2 part 1 establishment of ambient ta q and uz near surface profiles the starting point in the conditioning procedure is the establishment of ambient ta q and uz profiles from the near surface measurement height or heights using the measured or gridded ambient weather data and where the profiles extend up to a blending height as shown in fig 4a the shapes of the profiles are based on the ambient ta q and uz measurements or estimates and energy balance components that are derived from an estimated ambient et the ambient et used to develop the profiles should be the et flux that was responsible for or was a result of the measured or estimated ta q and uz values in the point or gridded weather data set some gridded weather data sets for example nldas and narr include estimates for etamb that are determined during the establishment of the gridded weather data via atmospheric circulation models coupled with lsm s in the case of point weather data etamb can be determined from a daily soil water balance that uses precipitation as an input or it can be derived from complementary theory huntington et al 2011 sridhar and anderson 2017 in other cases etamb for a dry soil surface can be estimated as a function of ndvi allen et al 2013a 2013b step one determines energy balance components that are associated with and that explain the etamb and ambient weather data parameters of the gridded weather data each time step either an hourly timestep or the approximate time of tmax and tmin for daily data is evaluated separately the net radiation under ambient

radiation rn amb and sensible heat flux hamb and then updated in the iteration process using an equation developed for use in the metric model allen et al 2016 asce 2016 that follows stull 1988 for

where uz amb is the ambient wind speed at zu the height of wind measurement zero plane displacement d can be approximated from zom using standard functions of vegetation height as d 5 5zom asce 2016 the roughness length for momentum zom can be estimated from vegetation height and density asce 2016 for idaho grass rangeland zom was assumed to be 0 02 m and the roughness length for heat zoh was assumed to be 0 1zom the denominator of eq 10 is limited to greater or equal to 4 or 5 to constrain u when ψsm z l is large for numerical stability the integrated stability corrections for momentum and heat transport ψsm and ψsh are computed using the formulations by paulson 1970 and webb 1970 depending on the atmospheric conditions for unstable atmospheric conditions i e l 0 12 ψ sm z l 2 ln 1 x 2 ln 1 x 2 2 2 arctan x π 2 13 ψ sh z l 2 ln 1 x 2 2 where parameter x of the stability correction is computed from the following equation 14 x 1 16 z d l 0 25 where z wind measurement height zu for ψsm z l and z air temperature and humidity measurement height zm for ψsh z l for stable atmospheric conditions i e l 0 15 ψ sm z l ψ sh z l 5 2 z d l for stable conditions an upper limit is placed on l of l 1 0 to keep ψsm z l from becoming too strong under stable conditions that may create physically impossible conditions of strong negative h that is expected to flow through a very stable near surface boundary layer the aerodynamic resistance between the surface and near surface measurement heights is computed with stability correction and updated in the iterative procedure using the following standard equation 16 r ah ln z u d z om ψ sm z m l ln z m d z oh ψ sh z u l k 2 u z amb the iteration process is repeated until rah converges with updated estimates for gamb rn amb hamb ts amb and rah zu is the measurement height for wind speed and zm is the measurement height for air temperature and humidity 2 2 3 part 2 extrapolate ambient ta q and uz to the blended height the second process step uses the energy balance components fluxes of heat h and vapor le determined for the ambient conditions represented by the gridded weather data to extrapolate the near surface ambient weather data to the blending height at 50 200 m above the surface at the blending height the characteristics for ta e or q and uz are presumed to be independent of the specific characteristics for the underlying surface and characteristic for the larger region using the ambient condition surface energy balance components air temperature ta bl specific humidity qbl and wind speed ubl are extrapolated to the blending height set at 50 m in our application in this stage the integrated stability corrections for momentum and heat transport ψsm and ψsh are computed between the surface and

physically impossible conditions where the negative sensible heat flux that is imposed requires sufficient turbulent mixing of the near surface boundary layer that can be retarded by a thick stable layer allen et al 2016 2 2 4 part 3 extrapolate ta q and uz from the blending height back to the surface using reference well watered fluxes to derive conditioned weather parameters at this point estimates for ta q and uz have been established at the blending height the surface below is then exchanged for a well watered reference surface represented by the clipped grass reference the third process step uses an iteratively developed reference et estimate to determine energy balance components and boundary layer profiles for ta q and uz that are associated with a reference et flux at the surface that is in equilibrium with the weather parameters at both the blending height and near surface measurement heights fig 4b each weather data time step is evaluated independently the reference et eto ref at the well watered irrigated surface is computed from the penman monteith method for the clipped grass reference which utilizes net radiation rn ref and ground heat flux gref for reference conditions the net outgoing longwave component of rn ref rnl ref is computed using a slob style equation where allen and debruin 2008 and asce 2016 demonstrated that net outgoing long wave radiation r nl can be estimated for well watered vegetated surfaces e g for reference conditions using a simple function of atmospheric transmissivity for short wave radiation τ sw represented by the ratio of rs to exoatmospheric radiation ra 22 r n l r e f 170 33 e a ref 0 5 τ sw where e a ref is vapor pressure of the air under reference conditions in kpa and units for r nl ref are w m 2 allen and debruin 2008 found eq 22 to estimate well at locations in germany the netherlands idaho usa and oklahoma usa for hourly and daily calculation time steps the use of τ sw in the equations automatically accounts for effects of cloud cover on incoming thermal radiation and thus r nl and for effects of sun angle on r nl eq 4 43 of asce 2016 provides means to estimate τ sw for low sun angles and during nighttime the net radiation at reference condition rn ref is calculated as 23 r n ref 1 α r s r nl ref the gref is calculated using the simplified relation from allen et al 1998 and asce 2005 2016 based on rn

process so that rs 50 s m 1 for daytime and 200 s m 1 for nighttime following allen et al 1998 2005 and asce 2005 2016 rah ref is aerodynamic resistance between the surface and the scalar measurement height calculated using eq 16 but where ψsh and ψsm stability terms are set to 0 0 following standardized eto ref practice where the equilibrium boundary layer for the first few m over the reference surface is often near neutral alternatively the standardized and simplified form of the fao 56 allen et al 1998 and asce 2005 2016 eto ref equation can be used the pyschrometric constant is calculated

3 because final values for ta ref qref and ea ref are not known the eto ref calculation is updated each iteration with new estimates for ta ref qref uref and rn ref as a result a double nested iteration is required iterations for stability corrections and iterations for eto ref the first estimates for ea ref tref and uref are ea amb ta amb and uamb to get the process started the slope of saturation vapor pressure is calculated from the following equation that is valid for the near neutral conditions assumed to hold above areference surface 29 2503 exp 17 27 t a ref t a ref 237 3 t a

ref is computed from the following equation 34 u z ref u z bl u ln z bl d z u d ψ sm z bl l ψ sm z u l k advection effects on transport of h to the ground surface and its effect on etref calculation are accounted for in the procedure the additional energy provided by advection is important and is common to irrigated areas in semiarid and arid environments allen et al 1998 brutsaert 1982 jensen and allen 2016 under most daytime conditions in a semiarid environment there will be a downward gradient of temperature towards the surface that has been established with the substituted reference surface in addition there will be a counter gradient for vapor in other words warm dry air is transported downward to a well watered surface both of these actions support advection and are captured by the procedure that establishes the scalar profiles 2 2 5 limitations on parameters for numerical stability friction velocity u in eq 31 is calculated during the first two iteration steps by assuming neutral conditions to help the calculation process remain computationally stable and to compensate for the tendency for initial estimates for eto ref to be overstated when used with ambient profiles the overstatement of eto ref can cause strong negative h that creates strong near surface boundary layer stability that creates a physically unrealistic condition allen et al 2016 after the first two iterations buoyancy correction ψsm is included during the iteration process for extrapolating profiles from the blending height values for ts h and rlout tend to pendulum back and forth each iteration with lessened swing with each new iteration the amount of swing can be dampened and convergence quickened by averaging the last two calculations for the three ψs terms calculated from equations 12 13 and 15 allen et al 2016 dhungel et al 2016a values for monin obhukov l in ψsh and ψsm in eqs 32 34 are limited to l 10 m when the calculation for l is greater than zero stable conditions when extrapolating down from the zbl this is done for numerical stability and is a technique used in the metric remote sensing of et process allen et al 2007 2016 in addition ψsm zbl l in eq 34 is calculated using z 10 m if l 0 for numerical stability usually about 10 iterations are required for convergence of all terms in the profile and supporting equations for ta q and u after convergence with 24 hour weather data a final etref estimate is calculated using a daily timestep and standardized reference equation where the conditioned ea and uz in the 24 hour timestep equation are averaged from the two applications at estimated times of tmax and tmin and where tmax and tmin are conditioned air temperature from the daytime and night time periods etref calculation methods are described in allen et al 1998 and asce 2005 2016 in cases where the nighttime for example the 5 a m time with 24 hour data application becomes numerically unstable due to large stability of the near surface boundary layer then conditioning adjustments to tmin amb can be estimated as being the same as those for tmax amb allen et al 1983 ley et al 1994 in other words the difference tmax amb tmax ref is subtracted from tmin amb to produce tmin ref 35 t min ref t min amb t max amb t max ref the conditioning adjustments to ea amb and uamb for the tmax 2 p m application can be assigned to the 24 hour values for ea and uz when conditioning estimation for nighttime becomes numerically unstable 3 results and discussion 3 1 example application 24 hour data an example application of the conditioning procedure is made using paired weather data collected near twin falls idaho during 2008 and 2009 where two electronic weather stations were placed in two targeted environments one in a desert area near balanced rock west of castleford idaho usa and the other at the university of idaho kimberly idaho research and extension center over irrigated alfalfa fig 6 the balanced rock ambient location was surrounded by an extensive distance of rainfed rangeland comprised of sparse dry grass mixed with occasional sagebrush the kimberly location representing reference irrigated conditions was surrounded by an extensive distance of irrigated crops the analysis applied the conditioning procedure on a daily basis where as described in part 1 the 24 hour period was represented using two times of the day representing times of maximum 2 p m and minimum 5 a m air temperature air temperature vapor pressure and wind speed were all adjusted by the conditioning process differences between ambient and irrigated ta ea and uz were similar to those shown in figs 1 and 2 for narr vs reference conditions ambient et for the balanced rock data set was estimated as 0 05 rn due to the very dry conditions during late summer for simplicity rather than taken from the narr data set impacts of conditioning were relatively moderate for air temperature but were quite substantial for humidity fig 7 shows daily values measured for daily maximum air temperature for the reference tmax at kimberly id over irrigated alfalfa and ambient tmax near balanced rock during july and august 2009 as well as the conditioned results where balanced rock data were conditioned adjusted to represent reference tmax the conditioning adjustments were on average successful in matching the kimberly reference data with some variation in the effectiveness of the conditioning from day to day adjustments to the temperature data averaged about 2 c very low values were caused by numerical instability in monin obhukov computations results for all days between august 23 2008 and november 10 2009 are shown in fig 8 for ambient and conditioned tmax data at balanced rock vs measured reference data at kimberly the 1 033 bias slope for ambient rangeland data was reduced to 0 987 bias slope following conditioning and differences between means reduced from an average 0 42 c overestimation using ambient balanced rock data to an average 0 3 c underestimation using the conditioned tmax data over the 448 day period this indicates that some over conditioning took place on some days root mean square error rmse reduced from 1 55 c to 1 34 c r2 values were not changed indicating that covariance of the data was preserved by the conditioning the largest amount of conditioning occurred during the warmest periods of the year which also represent the relatively driest periods this is an expected and desirable outcome where for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock tmax and kimberly tmax averaged 1 43 c and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock tmax and kimberly tmax averaged 0 18 c indicating relatively accurate conditioning during summer months when peak etref occurs rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 1 95 c to 1 22 c appliers of the methodology can utilize multiplier coefficients on the adjustment term of eq 32 to reduce or enlarge the amount of conditioning adjustment to ta amb if they sense over or under conditioning the processing of conditioning for minimum air temperature assigned a time of 5 a m occasionally failed to reach numerical convergence during part 3 when ta q and u profiles were established over a reference surface this was caused by the overestimation of the strength of a stable near surface boundary layer when rn was negative it appears that stronger limits need to be imposed on l and the height over which the stability corrections are employed this is a topic for future research in the example case the procedure switched over to using eq 35 in the 24 hour conditioning example the slope of the tmin comparison to kimberly data reduced from 1 18 to 1 08 and r2 improved from 0 91 to 0 92 over the 448 day period differences between means reduced from an average 1 58 c overestimation using ambient balanced rock data to an average 0 87 c overestimation using the conditioned tmin data this indicates that under conditioning took place on most days for tmin this suggests that the nighttime cooling effect of et over the irrigated surface at kimberly was more pronounced than the conditioning process estimated rmse reduced from 2 88 c to 2 29 c as with tmax the largest amount of conditioning occurred during the warmest periods of the year for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock tmin and kimberly tmin averaged 2 37 c and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock tmin and kimberly tmin averaged 1 11 c therefore the tmin of the desert data set was brought 1 2 c closer to tmin measured in the irrigated environment which was more than 50 of the original difference rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 3 32 c to 2 27 c fig 9 vapor pressure measured at the kimberly and balanced rock desert locations and the balanced rock data conditioned to equilibrium reference conditions is shown in fig 10 for july and august 2009 and in fig 11 for a year and one half period from august 2008 through november 2009 similar to the previous comparison against narr data in figs 2 and 3 vapor content over the irrigated kimberly site was nearly double that measured over the dry rangeland ambient the conditioning of the ambient data did a fairly good job in bringing the desert vapor content expressed as vapor pressure up toward that measured over the irrigated surface by adding vapor from the imposed and moist reference surface into the near surface boundary layer fig 10 shows a gain in ea from 18 understatement ambient to a 6 over statement over the 448 day period differences between means reduced from an average 0 11 kpa underestimation using ambient balanced rock data to an average 0 06 kpa overestimation using the conditioned 2 p m ea data part of the over statement was caused by a few outliers rmse reduced from 0 20 kpa to 0 15 kpa as with tmax and tmin the largest amount of conditioning to ea occurred during the warmest periods of the year when differences between et from the ambient desert surface and irrigated surfaces were greatest for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock 2 p m ea and kimberly ea averaged 0 28 kpa and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock 2 p m ea and kimberly ea averaged 0 03 kpa indicating relatively good performance by the midsummer conditioning of near surface vapor pressure rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 0 35 kpa to 0 19 kpa overall the conditioning of ea at the 2 p m time was successful in producing a conditioned data set that was reflective of measurements over the irrigated setting especially during growing season months conditioning during the dormant winter period may not be necessary since wetness of the two regions is similar and differences in ea are expected to be small however the winter ea was conditioned here to demonstrate the behavior of the process wind speed measured at the kimberly and balanced rock desert locations is shown in fig 12 for a two month period during summer 2008 along with wind speed based on the conditioned balance rock data measured ambient wind speed was about 20 stronger over the desert site than measured over the irrigated site due to lower aerodynamic roughness of the desert and due to impacts of large sensible heat flux and buoyancy over the desert that fostered downward entrainment of higher velocity air from aloft toward the warm surface the entrainment process was moderated at the irrigated kimberly site by the lower sensible heat flux and lower or even negative buoyancy in the near surface boundary layer the use of nonconditioned wind speed adds to the overestimation of etref with nonreference weather data the conditioning process tended to replicate the wind speeds measured at kimberly relatively well by reducing entrainment of higher velocity wind from aloft the conditioning did increase the variance of estimates relative to kimberly by about 6 but it reduced the overstatement of wind speed from 17 to 0 3 fig 13 indicating good performance of the conditioning process for wind speed differences between means over the 448 day period reduced from an average 0 52 m s 1 overestimation at a 3 m height above the surface using ambient balanced rock wind speed data to an average 0 01 m s 1 overestimation using the conditioned 2 pm uz data rmse reduced from 1 08 m s 1 to 0 85 m s 1 as with the other scalers the largest amount of conditioning to uz occurred during the warmest periods of the year when differences between buoyancy of air above the ambient desert surface and irrigated surfaces were greatest for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock 2 p m uz and kimberly uz averaged 0 59 m s 1 and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock 2 p m uz and kimberly uz at 3 m height averaged 0 16 m s 1 indicating relatively effective midsummer conditioning of near surface wind speed rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 0 86 m s 1 to 0 60 m s 1 fig 14 shows reference eto estimated for mid afternoon 2 p m time using the balanced rock desert data before and after conditioning of the weather data for the two month july august period during summer of 2009 the et fluxes reduced by about 10 with the conditioning fig 15 shows grass reference eto in mm day 1 for the 24 hour daily timestep data computed from the weather data collected the balanced rock desert site using the ambient measured tmax tmin vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed and also eto calculated from conditioned reference bal rock tmax vapor pressure and wind speed data the 24 hour timestep form of the standardized fao 56 equation was employed allen et al 1998 asce 2005 the calculations are compared to eto calculated from weather data measured 80 km to the east near kimberly over irrigated alfalfa the impact of the adjustments applied to a daily basis was quite substantial averaging 20 reduction in estimated eto and are in good agreement with the target eto computed from the reference kimberly data twenty four hour eto is plotted in fig 16 for a year and one half period from august 2008 through november 2009 for eto calculated from ambient and conditioned rangeland weather data collected at the balanced rock location vs eto calculated from weather data collected over irrigated alfalfa near kimberly eto with the ambient desert data reduced from 32 greater than the reference data set to 6 greater when using the conditioned desert data set eto estimates were reduced by an average of 25 which is a substantial decrease in the context of water rights management and hydrologic water balances covariance of estimates reduced slightly for the conditioned data set solar radiation data were measured at both the rangeland site and irrigated site and were used in eto calculations with no adjustment differences between means over the 448 day period reduced from an average 0 81 mm d 1 overestimation using ambient balanced rock wind speed data to an average 0 09 mm d 1 overestimation using the conditioned weather data rmse of 24 hour estimates for eto reduced from 1 23 mm d 1 to 0 58 mm d 1 as with the ta ea and uz scalers the largest amount of conditioning to eto occurred during the warmest periods of the year when differences in wetness of the ambient desert surface and irrigated surfaces were greatest for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock eto and kimberly eto averaged 1 53 mm d 1 and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock eto and kimberly eto averaged 0 41 mm d 1 indicating that conditioning of ta ea and uz data during midsummer removed 73 of the overestimation bias in eto caused by using arid weather data rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 1 80 mm d 1 to 0 74 mm d 1 overall the conditioning of the ambient 24 hour weather data set collected in a very dry nonirrigated setting was largely successful and indicates the benefits and consistencies of using theoretical boundary layer profile mechanics to simulate near surface processes occurring in the presence of evapotranspiration no adjustments were made to the ambient data sets or conditioning process to help direct its outcomes save for limits placed on some buoyancy correction calculations to help foster numerical convergence during iterations this indicates that the primarily theoretical procedure is relatively robust and may not require any localized calibration it also appears that some of the over or under conditioning of ta ea and uz parameters had some cancelling effect during calculation of eto in the example application actual ambient et for the balanced rock data set was estimated as 0 05 rn that simplified assumption did not appear to introduce significant error to the conditioning process future work can explore using actual et taken from a daily soil water balance or taken from a gridded ldas lsm weather data set such as the narr data set where the ldas lsm simulations do not include water inputs from irrigation 3 2 example application hourly data as an example application of the conditioning process to hourly weather data two weather stations in eastern nevada near the utah state line were evaluated the two weather stations represented a desert and an agricultural site that are within 3 km of each other as shown in fig 17 the stations represent a region having a semi arid environment with primarily desert vegetation and with occasional irrigated agriculture areas the agricultural area surrounding the snake valley is composed of mostly a hay pasture mix national land cover dataset nlcd class 81 that is irrigated while the salt desert weather station is surrounded by non irrigated shrub nlcd class 52 the conditioning algorithm requires ambient ta ea uz rs and actual et as inputs the ambient latent heat flux le estimates were acquired from nldas hourly data hydroshare apps n d cosgrove et al 2003 while ta ea uz and rs data were acquired from the two weather stations via the nicenet https nicenet dri edu last accessed july 27 2020 weather data network managed by the desert research institute the near surface air temperature ta can elevate to nearly 40 c in summer over the salt desert site the salt desert wind speed data were measured at a 10 m height so a logarithmic profile relationship was used to translate the wind speed from 10 m to 3 m to be congruent with the snake valley wind speed measurements the data spanned a period from august 2011 to december 2013 which provided the opportunity to observe the seasonal variation between the desert and agriculture environments and the behavior of the conditioning procedure fig 18 shows 7 day moving averages for air temperature based on hourly timesteps where conditioned ta for the salt desert station decreased toward the irrigated data as expected although differences among all three data sets were small the 7 day maximum was about 27 c during this period during all three summers the hottest desert temperatures become cooler following conditioning but still remained about a degree c above the values measured over the irrigation site there were some cases during winter where very cool desert temperatures were not as warm as those measured over the irrigated field although differences were small fig 19 shows ambient and conditioned ea data at the salt desert location and measured ea at the snake valley site during 2011 2013 conditioned and irrigated ea followed each other relatively closely the amount of conditioning increase to ea was largest during midsummer as expected due to dry conditions during summer months even though levels of humidity were higher during that period due to greater capacities of hot desert air the maximum 7 day moving average ea was about 1 5 kpa during the period fig 20 shows the 3 m wind speed for the salt desert station before and after conditioning along with measurements over the irrigated snake valley averaged over 24 hour periods in contrast to the idaho data set that relied on measured weather data for the ambient and irrigated sites the conditioned gridded wind speed at salt desert increased away from wind speed measurements at the irrigated snake valley site during summer periods the zom used to represent the ambient conditions at salt desert during step one of blending height establishment was a relatively rough 0 3 m whereas the zom used to represent the reference surface during conditioning was 0 084 m representing tall alfalfa the smoother roughness for the reference surface increased near surface wind speed for the conditioned data it is possible that a substantial amount of differences between the wind speed measurements at the irrigated site and wind speed estimates in the ambient nldas hourly data set stem from error and representation bias inherent to the nldas data set the nldas lsm data set has an approximately 12 km grid size so that differences in the surface orography used in the model may lead to discrepancies with wind speed observations especially in mixed environments of irrigated agriculture and desert rangeland the snake valley irrigated weather station has a mountain range six km to the west and open desert to the east so that its orography is complex ambient values for hourly ta ea and uz were used to represent the conditioned values during nighttime due to occasional numerical instability in the monin obukhov based boundary layer stability correction this dampened some of the differences shown in the moving averages the use of nonconditioned nighttime values in the eto calculations is not expected to have a major impact on total eto estimates for 24 hour and longer periods since energy availability is relatively low during nighttime hourly conditioned air temperature is plotted against the ambient measurements at the salt desert station and against measurements at the irrigated snake valley station in fig 21 for the 08 2011 12 2013 period the extent of conditioning averaged about 4 c cooling during periods of high daytime temperatures during summer months with occasional substantial conditioning cooling of as much as 20 c for a few periods the conditioning nearly always cooled near surface air temperature left graph of fig 21 the degree of adjustment by the conditioning process was relatively well behaved with little or no new variation introduced into the data set scatter between conditioned ta and ta measured at the irrigated site spanned 10 c at times fig 21 right graph due to differences in logged data between the two data sets that scatter was not due to the conditioning process as evidenced from the left graph overall the r2 was high at 0 95 with slope of 0 98 and rmse shown in the figure as rmsd for conditioned data of 2 7 c as discussed for wind speed a portion of the rmse may reflect differences in the natures of the two data sets gridded vs measured data rather than error introduced by the conditioning process hourly conditioned vapor pressure is plotted against the ambient measurements at the salt desert station and against measurements at the irrigated snake valley station in fig 22 for the 08 2011 12 2013 period the extent of conditioning was relatively substantial for vapor pressure and averaged about 0 3 kpa added to the ambient values the adjustment by conditioning was well behaved for vapor pressure and in nearly all cases humidity was added to the ambient air during the conditioning with some additions doubling the water content of the near surface boundary layer scatter between conditioned ea and ea measured at the irrigated site spanned 0 8 kpa at times fig 22 right graph some of this variation was likely due to differences in logged data between the two stations as evidenced previously for ta the r2 was lower for vapor pressure data than for air temperature data at 0 87 although the slope of the regression was 0 96 with intercept of nearly 0 0 rmse shown as rmsd was 0 12 kpa hourly conditioned wind speed is plotted against the ambient measurements at the salt desert station and against measurements at the irrigated snake valley station in fig 23 for the 08 2011 12 2013 period the conditioning procedure only slightly decreased estimated wind speed for the salt desert site and sometimes increased it the conditioned wind speed was similar to that at the snake valley irrigated site for wind speeds below about 4 m s 1 but with large scatter and was generally below wind speeds measured at the irrigated site for wind speeds above 4 m s 1 fig 23 righthand graph scatter between conditioned uz and uz measured at the irrigated site spanned 2 m s 1 at times the impact of conditioning on wind speed was relatively sensitive to the roughness value used to represent the ambient desert conditions 0 02 m in our case this relatively small value reflects the sparse local vegetation and could have been increased to reflect a mixture of local vegetation and more rough vegetation in the mountain area six km to the west as well as terrain roughness a sensitivity analysis on zom for the desert location showed relatively large sensitivity of wind speed adjustments to zom as its value was varied from 0 02 m to 0 3 m with conditioned wind speeds increasing over measured ambient wind speeds for zom 0 08 m the increase was related to the value for zom used to represent the reference surface that was superimposed to the ambient desert surface where zom 0 084 m simulating a clipped grass weather surface the r2 was lower for wind speed than for vapor pressure and air temperature data at 0 75 and the slope of the regression was only 0 74 with a 0 82 ms 1 intercept the rmse shown as rmsd was 0 79 m s 1 reference eto values for the irrigated snake valley site were computed using the refet software of the university of idaho allen 2010 the ambient and conditioned eto for the salt desert site were computed using the standardized fao 56 penman monteith equation inside the conditioning algorithm as given in eq 25 where the calculations were validated using the refet model hourly calculated eto using conditioned ta ea and uz data is plotted against calculations made using the ambient measurements at the salt desert station and against calculations made using measurements at the irrigated snake valley station in fig 24 for the 08 2011 12 2013 period in general the conditioning process reduced calculated reference eto by about 0 03 0 1 mm hr 1 or about 5 20 some of the lessened impact of overall conditioning was due to the sometimes increase in conditioned wind speed described previously which counteracted cooling of air temperature and humidification of the near surface boundary layer scatter between conditioned eto and eto calculated using measured weather at the irrigated site spanned about 0 2 mm hr 1 at times fig 24 right graph most of this variation was caused by differences in logged data between the two stations as noted previously the r2 was relatively high for eto calculations at 0 98 even though r2 was substantially lower for wind speed and vapor pressure inputs the slope of the regression line was 0 94 with a nearly 0 intercept the rmse was 0 05 mm hr 1 fig 25 shows a plot of sensible heat flux h extracted at the time of daily maximum ta for the snake valley site during july through september 2012 estimated h during the conditioning process was relatively large for the ambient conditions averaging about 200 w m 2 values for h averaged about 0 0 for the conditioned data set having a reference et as the lower boundary which is common for well watered settings fig 26 shows cumulative values for grass reference eto and alfalfa reference etr for the two and one half year simulation period the cumulative ambient eto from august 2011 to december 2013 was 3400 mm and cumulative conditioned eto was 3138 mm with a difference of 7 7 the cumulative irrigated eto at the snake valley site was 3160 mm which was only 0 7 higher than the conditioned eto and 7 lower than the ambient eto from the salt desert location similar differences were noted for cumulative etr which averaged about 27 higher than cumulative eto overall the impact of conditioning on cumulative eto and etr over an extended period was significant at about 8 reduction in estimates as noted for the idaho illustration these differences are considered to be substantial for eto data used in water rights management and in hydrologic studies 4 conclusions meteorological data collected from an arid environment are frequently utilized for many hydrological and remote sensing applications those data and resulting reference et estimates may suffer from an aridity bias relative to reference et estimates that are characteristic of an irrigated setting in this study we developed a weather data conditioning algorithm to quantify the effects of surface aridity on reference evapotranspiration calculations the conditioning algorithm is based on standard surface energy balance equations and flux profile relationships that can be applied to both point weather station data as well as with gridded weather data sets the meteorological variables from the two desert environments illustrated more closely mimicked data from reference agricultural environments after conditioning assumptions of continuity in air masses at a blending height above both dry and reference surfaces within the same climate appear to be valid as does the use of the standard flux profile equations in summary the conditioning of gridded weather data to remove artifacts of aridity using theoretical boundary layer theory appears to be a robust method that should have good transferability to other locations and climates it is noteworthy that weather data collected over a reference well watered surface and that do not exhibit negative effects of local aridity will automatically have little or no conditioning based correction this is a benefit of the flux profile conditioning process as compared to older empirical adjustment methods that applied constant adjustments regardless of the wetting history of the weather measurement site or corrections that needed empirical calibration for each new application the conditioning procedures developed are exploratory in nature and will benefit from future testing and application to various gridded weather data sets and to more climatic regions additional sensitivity analyses on impact of estimated blending layer height land surface roughness and extent and magnitude of boundary layer stability corrections will help to improve robustness and consistency of conditioning based adjustments to arid weather data some linearities might be introduced to simplify and accelerate computations declaration of competing

10256,meteorological data are often collected in dry desert regions where the local environments exhibit effects of aridity caused by the lack of evapotranspiration et in contrast the standard reference et eto calculations of fao56 and asce assume that the surfaces underlying collected weather data are well watered so that near surface meteorological measurements reflect the cooling and humidifying effects of an evaporating surface in this study we develop a weather data conditioning process and algorithms to adjust for biases in meteorological data that exhibit aridity effects the conditioning process is intended to adjust the weather data to better exhibit characteristics of data collected over a well watered vegetated surface prior to use of the data to estimate reference et the procedure involves the extrapolation of air temperature vapor pressure and wind speed profiles to and from a regional blending height using standard surface energy balance equations and flux profile relationships and employing et estimated for the ambient dry conditions of an arid weather station and reference et that should co exist with weather measurements used to calculation reference et example applications are given with 24 hour weather data and hourly weather data in idaho and nevada results indicate that reference eto can be overstated by as much as 25 in southern idaho and 8 in eastern nevada the methodology is intended to be transferrable to other regions and climates and is self aware of the need for conditioning of weather data according to differences in ambient et and the reference et estimates keywords evapotranspiration aridity boundary layer profiles blending height conditioning reference evapotranspiration surface energy balance weather data 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is generally the second largest component of hydrologic systems and water balances following precipitation and is the driving component for irrigation water requirements iwr of agricultural crops quantifying et for specific crops and regions is required for litigation of water right applications and disputes design of irrigation systems for basin water balance estimates for irrigation water management for improvement of crop yields and water use efficiency and for weather prediction many parts of the world including the western united states are struggling to combat climate change changing environmental policies such as sustainable groundwater management act of california california groundwater n d and reduced water for ecosystems as well as for the agriculture sector because of extreme droughts and increased competition for water accurate et computations assist with estimating amounts of water entering groundwater systems huntington et al 2016 and guide policymakers in coping with effects of climatic extremes wilhite 2000 there continues to be continuous encouragement from various stakeholders for more accurate et estimates over increasingly large spatial and temporal scales kalluri et al 2003 meinzen dick and van der hoek 2001 1 1 reference et reference crop et or reference evapotranspiration etref is a concept suggested by jensen 1968 wright and jensen 1972 and doorenbos and pruitt 1975 1977 to address some of the ambiguities associated with definitions for potential et and to serve as a consistent climatic index for et etref has become the standard means to characterize climatic effects on the et rate standardizations by fao allen et al 1998 and asce 2005 2016 provide consistency and reproducibility in estimating etref and a consistent basis for determining and expressing kc curves especially at the local scale many satellite based remote sensing models employ reference et for model calibration and for interpolation of et between satellite overpass dates allen et al 2007 dhungel et al 2016b biases in reference et estimates caused by aridity of weather data can cause overestimation of spatial et estimates some physically based et algorithms interpolate between satellite overpass dates dhungel et al 2016b long and singh 2010 semmens et al 2016 and reduce the dependency on reference et estimates mardikis et al 2005 vicente serrano et al 2007 and on mathematical interpolation trezza et al 2013 however a majority of studies still utilize interpolation techniques that employ reference et currently the standard and most common practice for calculating et for agricultural crops uses a two step crop coefficient kc reference et etref approach where etref is the rate at which soil water if readily available would be converted to water vapor for a specific fully vegetated reference surface under given atmospheric conditions the crop coefficient modifies the value for etref to account for specific effects of crop type amount of ground covered stage of growth aerodynamic roughness and stomatal control the recommended procedures for estimating etref utilize physically based forms of the penman monteith pm method the fao56 allen et al 1998 and its equivalent asce 2005 standardized pm method have been standardized with respect to internal parameters and supporting equations because numbers and densities of weather stations collecting solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed required for the pm method are often limited procedures have been developed that utilize gridded weather data from weather forecast and land data assimilation system ldas products rodell 2020 these systems support application of the standardized etref method and create the means to produce more robust and climatically sensitive data sets of crop et and net iwr that may be more fully useable by scientific resource management and policy making communities 1 2 impact of weather data aridity on reference et calculations an important assumption and requirement in applying the pm method to calculate etref for irrigated agriculture is the assumption that the surface underlying a weather data set is evaporating or transpiring at nearly the same rate as the etref calculation produced by the pm equation and that the near surface profiles for air temperature humidity and wind speed are in equilibrium with the well watered surface represented by etref allen et al 1998 2013a 2013b asce 2005 2016 this requirement stems from the use of a relatively low bulk surface resistance high surface conductance in the pm equation that instructs the equation to estimate relatively large etref according to the air temperature humidity and wind speed properties that are assigned at the reference height above the surface the reference height is generally established at 2 m doorenbos and pruitt 1975 1977 asce 1990 2016 allen et al 1998 in addition the net radiation rn estimate for the standardized pm etref equation assumes a relatively cool surface with long wave radiative emission that can be as much as 100 w m 2 less than that emitted by a non evaporating warmer surface informing the standardized pm etref equation with arid data gives the standardized equation the wrong idea on what the et flux from the underlying surface must have been to cause the warmer than realistic air temperature lower than realistic humidity higher than realistic wind speed and lower than realistic outgoing longwave radiation to occur in spite of being located over an assumed vegetated surface having high surface conductance in other words the user of the pm equation has created an impossible situation where the pm equation is informed with near surface air properties that do not and can not exist in the presence of relatively large et rates this impossible situation must be mitigated by either limiting weather data sets to those that are collected over large well watered surfaces or by conditioning a weather data set to adjust the near surface air temperature humidity and wind speed data to levels expected and realistic for well watered conditions 1 3 gridded weather data sets current methods for estimating et and iwr are generally based on calculations of et made using data from sparsely located weather stations many of which may be located in partially or completely dry nonevaporating environments over the past 10 20 years the advent of gridded historical weather data derived from sophisticated ldas operated by noaa s national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the national science foundation sponsored national center for atmospheric research ncar has provided an alternative data source to the traditional use of point based weather station data for estimating et and iwr ldas systems are operated for purposes of weather research and weather and climate forecasting the ldas systems assimilate electronically available weather data from point weather sites around the globe and couple those data with land process soil and vegetation water balance models and with atmospheric models to extend the point data and to create gridded weather data sets that are traceable to the original point measurements data products include the 30 year 1979 present north american land data assimilation system nldas retrospective forcings cosgrove et al 2003

automatically from sources using python style scripts brought into geospatial processing structures such as arcmap or python gdal scripts and processed to reference et some grids including gridmet nldas and cfsv2 are available in near real time on the google earth engine some previous applications of reference et computations made with gridded ldas types of data systems include senay et al 2008 who applied the fao 56 based pm reference et method to 1 0 degree ldas data for the globe they compared against etref derived from the california irrigation water management information system cimis by matching grid points and found relatively good correspondence a similar study was done by hidalgo et al 2005 for california and in florida by said et al 2006 interest in computing etref from gridded weather data has led to the creation of two recent products from noaa one estimating etref using nldas data hobbins 2016 and another product forecasting etref using the national digital forecast database ndfd called forecasted reference evapotranspiration fret palmer et al 2016 1 4 biases in gridded weather data the ldas applications do not evaluate nor mitigate for the impacts of dryness of weather sites used in the data assimilation processes on reference et estimates made for use with irrigation related management these impacts can overstate computed etref as demonstrated by blankenau et al 2020 by as much as 20 30 greatly reducing the value and adequacy of the reference et estimates for irrigation planning design and management and hydrologic studies when used to calculate etref the gldas nldas and other data sets should be reviewed to determine whether the gridded data contain substantial artifacts of dryness from the original weather data used to drive the lsm models thereby violating assumptions in reference et estimation these artifacts may produce weather data that are characteristic of regional weather systems which in semiarid and arid climates reflect general aridity of the region however for purposes of estimating etref for use in irrigation related settings the ambient gridded weather data may not exhibit the conditioning effects that irrigation has on near surface air properties where air temperature is reduced and humidity content is increased by et supplied by irrigation generally the ldas models creating the gridded data sets are not aware of and do not include irrigation in their daily soil water balances that are used to estimate et and the partitioning of available energy into sensible heat flux h and estimation of rn some of the earlier studies to understand the human induced modifications to boundary layer fluxes by irrigation include adegoke et al 2003 barnston and schickedanz 1984 jaksa and sridhar 2015 and sridhar and anderson 2017 a study at idaho allen et al 1983 reported calculated etref as high as 17 greater when using weather data collected over nonirrigated environments as opposed to that collected over irrigated environments while temesgen et al 1999 reported eto as high as 25 stemming from aridity effects the recent study by blankenau et al 2020 compared weather properties and resulting etref calculations for more than 100 agricultural weather stations across the us with data from nldas gldas cfsv2 gridmet the real time mesoscale analysis rtma and the national digital forecast database ndfd data systems they found summertime etref computed from the gridded weather data sets to exceed that computed from the agricultural weather stations by 10 30 on average with rtma and ndfd having smaller biases than the other four gridded data sets as an example of aridity artifacts in gridded weather data sets figs 1 and 2 show 3 hourly air temperature and 3 hourly vapor pressure for a narr data set which is similar to the nldas data set for a grid cell located near twin falls idaho during a period during july 2008 the data are compared against measured air temperature and vapor pressure from the nearby twin falls agrimet station that is an electronic automated weather station that is located in an irrigated agricultural environment while there is close correspondence between the two data sets which is a positive indication of good assimilation of general weather data at a local scale the narr near surface air temperature generally overstated the agrimet air temperature by up to 5 c and the vapor pressure representing near surface water vapor content was understated by about one half during july fig 3 shows vapor pressure for the two twin falls data sets for the 2008 year the two data sets were in good agreement during the first four months of 2008 and during the last two months of 2008 when surface conditions were mostly barren for both ambient and irrigated fields and no irrigation was occurring the substantial separation of the two data sets occurred beginning in june when desert grasses dried due to lack of precipitation and irrigated crops were often near full ground cover and maximum et these types of outcomes are common and as shown in a later section will cause overestimation of etref by as much as 20 30 by ignoring the influence of conditioning of the equilibrium boundary layer ebl due to evaporative cooling that occurs over irrigated agriculture jacobs and debruin 1992 brown 2001 asce 2005 allen 2011 lewis et al 2014 moorhead et al 2015 martins et al 2017 and paredes et al 2018 1 5 approaches to adjusting aridity impacted weather data researchers hydrologists and engineers have long recognized the impact of local aridity on near surface weather measurements and the lack of synchronization with the evaporating surfaces associated with irrigated agriculture and the consequent incongruency with etref equations such as the standardized fao 56 and asce penman monteith method in the past empirical methods have been developed to adjust arid air temperature downward and in some cases adjust arid vapor pressure upward allen et al 1983 1998 ley et al 1994 jensen et al 1997 temesgen et al 1999 these empirical approaches generally employ linear adjustments based on observed differences between weather data collected from close by irrigated and nonirrigated locations or by differences between daily minimum air temperature tmin and daily average dew point temperature tdew some applications of the pm method for etref have recommended dismissing the tdew data from measured weather data sets that exhibit effects of aridity lack of conditioning by et and have instead replaced measurements with estimated tdew values that are reflective of well watered settings estimated tdew was produced by applying expected differences between measured tmin and tdew under irrigated conditions allen et al 1998 asce 2005 2016 allen and robison 2007 these methods while useful provide approximate assessments or adjustments to arid air temperature and humidity data and have been considered to be stop gap measures 1 5 1 boundary and blending layer approaches a theoretically based boundary layer profile procedure is described here that conditions gridded data sets to better represent weather data that should exist under well watered surface conditions and therefore provides a better data set for estimating etref for use in irrigation related environments allen et al 2013a 2013b the boundary layer profile method employs the blending height concept discussed in the next section to establish near surface air temperature ta specific humidity q and wind speed uz adjustments to transform arid point weather data or gridded hourly 3 hourly and daily narr or nldas type weather data into conditioned weather data series that are more suitable for computing point or gridded reference evapotranspiration representing the special and specific equilibrium conditions that are experienced over irrigated surfaces the procedure can be applied to weather data used for estimating et for irrigation systems management water rights management irrigation planning irrigation scheduling and for general water resources analyses the procedure is primarily based on theoretical concepts that should not require empirical calibration 1 5 2 objectives of this study objectives of this study were to 1 develop the means to transform point weather data or gridded hourly 3 hourly or daily weather data from ldas and similar data sets into conditioned weather data series that can be used to compute gridded reference evapotranspiration representing the equilibrium conditions associated with irrigated surfaces 2 investigate the accuracy and extent of bias corrections in the gridded data sets by comparing against weather data measured over well watered vegetated surfaces 2 materials and methods this section details the procedure developed to condition ambient weather data collected in an arid ambient environment or produced by an ldas to better reflect what would have been measured or modeled under the same climate and environmental conditions but where a large evaporating reference surface existed that is by definition well watered this adjustment is necessary to condition weather data prior to processing by a reference et equation such as the fao or asce ewri standardized penman monteith equations that most accurately approximate the expected et within an irrigated environment 2 1 the blending height and profiles the procedure uses extrapolation of reported air temperature ta specific humidity or vapor pressure e and wind speed uz profiles from near the ground surface up to a blending height that is established 50 to a few hundred m above the surface fig 4a the extrapolation of ta e and uz from near the ground surface to the blending height is made using the estimated ambient et and associated sensible heat flux h once ta e and uz properties are established at the blending height new profiles for ta e and uz are established back towards the surface fig 4b but using et and h quantities that represent the new etref new conditioned values for ta e and uz are then selected from the conditioned profiles at 2 or 3 m height above the ground surface a refined estimate for etref is then calculated the approach follows a common assumption that a blending height exists over a subregion that has temperature humidity and wind speed uz properties that do not change very rapidly as an air mass moves from over nonirrigated to over irrigated surfaces or vice versa wieringa 1986 shuttleworth et al 2009 as a consequence the air properties estimated for the blending height can be assumed to be a somewhat fixed boundary condition and endpoint during establishment of postulated boundary layer profiles for ta humidity q or e and uz the properties of the blending layer are assumed to be the same and representative of general regional climate whether the underlying surface is evapotranspiring at ambient regional rates that are based on precipitation inputs or whether the underlying surface is evapotranspiring at higher rates supported by irrigation therefore the estimated fluxes for et and consequently net radiation rn soil heat flux g and h can be switched from ambient to irrigated situations and new profiles for ta e and uz established using the same blending layer endpoints the new profiles are used to estimate the near surface properties associated with the switch in et rn g and h that represent a well watered surface condition the approach is similar to switching out the carpet where a drier carpet is replaced with a wetter carpet and ta e and uz profiles associated with the wetter carpet are established the use of a blending layer in this manner has been employed in a number of models that model the lower portions of the planetary boundary layer including mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 de bruin 1989 philip 1996 shuttleworth 2006 and in applications for estimating et by shuttleworth 2006 2007 shuttleworth et al 2009 and lhomme et al 2015 wieringa 1986 interpreted the blending height as a height above which modifications to air flow due to changes in surface conditions are not discernable individually and where an overall stress or heat flux profile can exist that represents the combined surface conditions of a large area mason 1988 defined the blending height as a scale height at which the flow is approximately in equilibrium with the local surface and also independent of horizontal position mahrt 1996 showed theoretically that the height of the blended layer depends on deviation of turbulent fluctuations in vertical velocity uniformity of patches of varying vegetation characteristics the surface friction velocity and the free convection velocity scale raupach and finnigan 1995 suggested that the blending height can be taken to be at the top of the surface layer which is on the order of 50 m under a range of surface conditions the 50 m blending height has been utilized in the disalexi remote sensing of et model norman et al 2003 to extrapolate ta and uz to the ground surface and by shuttleworth 2006 2007 shuttleworth et al 2009 and lhomme et al 2015 the blending height in the procedure described in the next section is kept as a variable to be set by the user however as shown later a 50 m height has been found to work well with idaho and nevada data and is recommended as a default value the process is somewhat insensitive to the value for the blending height since slopes of ta q and uz profiles are relatively vertical with very small gradients near the blending height shuttleworth 2006 2007 and lhomme et al 2015 applied the blending height concept to establish profiles for ta and q from the surface to the blending height to transform crop coefficients into equivalent bulk surface resistances and to establish properties of near surface vapor pressure deficit for the pm equation that incorporate feedback of the et flux however neither procedure incorporated effects of boundary layer stability and instability which can be sizeable under low et high h conditions and can substantially impact shapes of ta and q profiles boundary instability also impacts near surface wind speed by increasing the entrainment of higher velocity air from the blending height to the surface 2 2 calculations the conditioning procedure is divided into three primary parts or steps 1 establish ambient ta q and uz profiles from a near surface measurement height s that extend up to a blending height based on ambient ta q and uz measurements or estimates and using estimated ambient et as shown in fig 4a 2 establish conditioned ta q and uz profiles from the blending height back toward the surface using a reference et flux imposed at the surface as shown in fig 4b 3 after an iteratively determined calculation of reference et and established conditioned ta q and uz profiles select final conditioned values for ta q and uz at a standardized reference height of 2 m from the conditioned profiles and make a final calculation for etref a flowchart of primary variables and components of the process is illustrated in fig 5 standard boundary layer profile equations are employed with some adjustments on limits of buoyancy corrections to help control numerical instability during calculation the procedure is proposed for application to hourly or daily weather data in the case of hourly data the process is applied separately to each hourly period hourly timesteps are short enough that all weather parameters and boundary layer profiles can be assumed to be synchronized and scalar and flux values can be treated as though they are nearly instantaneous a full data set containing measurements of air temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed is required 2 2 1 working with 24 hour data the blending height and profile procedure that is developed for use with hourly data conditioning is also used for 24 hour weather data conditioning to provide consistency and to produce a procedure that should not ordinarily require empirical calibration or adjustment the latter is a desirable feature of the approach future work can aim towards simplification and perhaps linearization of some components such as boundary layer stability correction however all algorithms are straightforward to code into software and provide a relatively sound basis for the establishment of scalar profiles in the case of daily 24 hour weather data data properties vary substantially within the 24 hour time step so that daily averages can not be used in calculations for energy balance and extrapolation of scalars to the blending height instead two times during the day representing extremes in air temperature are selected as proxies to establish bias corrections for ta q and uz for example assuming that daily maximum tmax and daily minimum tmin temperatures are available in a daily weather data set one can assign approximate times of occurrence to these extremes if unknown for example 2 p m for tmax and 5 a m for tmin and make approximations for humidity and uz at those same times based on daily averages for humidity and uz solar radiation rs at the times of tmax and tmin can be estimated using the daily average atmospheric transmissivity to estimate rs and calculated theoretical solar radiation an instantaneous value for 2 p m time can be estimated from the 24 hour average as 1 r s 2 p m r s 24 r s o 24 r s o 2 p m where rs 24 is the 24 hour average rs rso 24 is the theoretical rs for the 24 hour period under clear sky conditions and rso 2pm is the clear sky rs at 2 p m equation 1 assumes that atmospheric transmissivity and cloudiness conditions at 2 p m are the same as the average for the day rso can be calculated from a variety of algorithms for example those by allen et al 1998 and asce 2005 2016 vapor pressure generally increases during daytime if there is evaporation from the surface daytime wind speed tends to increase on average due to atmospheric buoyancy effects caused by surface heating and associated entrainment of higher velocity air from aloft therefore a 2 p m vapor pressure can be assumed for example to be 1 2 times the 24 hour average and e at 5 a m can be assumed to be 0 83 times the 24 hour average so that the 24 hour value determined by averaging the two extremes is not changed similar values can be established for wind speed for example where 2 p m wind speed is 1 2 times the 24 hour average and 5 a m is 0 83 times the 24 hour average to simulate generally higher daytime wind speeds than nighttime 2 2 2 part 1 establishment of ambient ta q and uz near surface profiles the starting point in the conditioning procedure is the establishment of ambient ta q and uz profiles from the near surface measurement height or heights using the measured or gridded ambient weather data and where the profiles extend up to a blending height as shown in fig 4a the shapes of the profiles are based on the ambient ta q and uz measurements or estimates and energy balance components that are derived from an estimated ambient et the ambient et used to develop the profiles should be the et flux that was responsible for or was a result of the measured or estimated ta q and uz values in the point or gridded weather data set some gridded weather data sets for example nldas and narr include estimates for etamb that are determined during the establishment of the gridded weather data via atmospheric circulation models coupled with lsm s in the case of point weather data etamb can be determined from a daily soil water balance that uses precipitation as an input or it can be derived from complementary theory huntington et al 2011 sridhar and anderson 2017 in other cases etamb for a dry soil surface can be estimated as a function of ndvi allen et al 2013a 2013b step one determines energy balance components that are associated with and that explain the etamb and ambient weather data parameters of the gridded weather data each time step either an hourly timestep or the approximate time of tmax and tmin for daily data is evaluated separately the net radiation under ambient

the roughness length for momentum zom can be estimated from vegetation height and density asce 2016 for idaho grass rangeland zom was assumed to be 0 02 m and the roughness length for heat zoh was assumed to be 0 1zom the denominator of eq 10 is limited to greater or equal to 4 or 5 to constrain u when ψsm z l is large for numerical stability the integrated stability corrections for momentum and heat transport ψsm and ψsh are computed using the formulations by paulson 1970 and webb 1970 depending on the atmospheric conditions for unstable atmospheric conditions i e l 0 12 ψ sm z l 2 ln 1

amb and rah zu is the measurement height for wind speed and zm is the measurement height for air temperature and humidity 2 2 3 part 2 extrapolate ambient ta q and uz to the blended height the second process step uses the energy balance components fluxes of heat h and vapor le determined for the ambient conditions represented by the gridded weather data to extrapolate the near surface ambient weather data to the blending height at 50 200 m above the surface at the blending height the characteristics for ta e or q and uz are presumed to be independent of the specific characteristics for the underlying surface and characteristic for the larger region using the ambient condition surface energy balance components air temperature ta bl specific humidity qbl and wind speed ubl are extrapolated to the blending height set at 50 m in our application in this stage the integrated stability corrections for momentum and heat transport ψsm and ψsh are computed between the surface and

physically impossible conditions where the negative sensible heat flux that is imposed requires sufficient turbulent mixing of the near surface boundary layer that can be retarded by a thick stable layer allen et al 2016 2 2 4 part 3 extrapolate ta q and uz from the blending height back to the surface using reference well watered fluxes to derive conditioned weather parameters at this point estimates for ta q and uz have been established at the blending height the surface below is then exchanged for a well watered reference surface represented by the clipped grass reference the third process step uses an iteratively developed reference et estimate to determine energy balance components and boundary layer profiles for ta q and uz that are associated with a reference et flux at the surface that is in equilibrium with the weather parameters at both the blending height and near surface measurement heights fig 4b each weather data time step is evaluated independently the reference et eto ref at the well watered irrigated surface is computed from the penman monteith method for the clipped grass reference which utilizes net radiation rn ref and ground heat flux gref for reference conditions the net outgoing longwave component of rn ref rnl ref is computed using a slob style equation where allen and debruin 2008 and asce 2016 demonstrated that net outgoing long wave radiation r

2008 found eq 22 to estimate well at locations in germany the netherlands idaho usa and oklahoma usa for hourly and daily calculation time steps the use of τ sw in the equations automatically accounts for effects of cloud cover on incoming thermal radiation and thus r nl and for effects of sun angle on r nl eq 4 43 of asce 2016 provides means to estimate τ sw for low sun angles and during nighttime the net radiation at reference condition rn ref is calculated as 23 r n ref 1 α r s r nl ref the gref is calculated using the simplified relation from allen et al 1998 and asce 2005 2016 based on rn

are accounted for in the procedure the additional energy provided by advection is important and is common to irrigated areas in semiarid and arid environments allen et al 1998 brutsaert 1982 jensen and allen 2016 under most daytime conditions in a semiarid environment there will be a downward gradient of temperature towards the surface that has been established with the substituted reference surface in addition there will be a counter gradient for vapor in other words warm dry air is transported downward to a well watered surface both of these actions support advection and are captured by the procedure that establishes the scalar profiles 2 2 5 limitations on parameters for numerical stability friction velocity u in eq 31 is calculated during the first two iteration steps by assuming neutral conditions to help the calculation process remain computationally stable and to compensate for the tendency for initial estimates for eto ref to be overstated when used with ambient profiles the overstatement of eto ref can cause strong negative h that creates strong near surface boundary layer stability that creates a physically unrealistic condition allen et al 2016 after the first two iterations buoyancy correction ψsm is included during the iteration process for extrapolating profiles from the blending height values for ts h and rlout tend to pendulum back and forth each iteration with lessened swing with each new iteration the amount of swing can be dampened and convergence quickened by averaging the last two calculations for the three ψs terms calculated from equations 12 13 and 15 allen et al 2016 dhungel et al 2016a values for monin obhukov l in ψsh and ψsm in eqs 32 34 are limited to l 10 m when the calculation for l is greater than zero stable conditions when extrapolating down from the zbl this is done for numerical stability and is a technique used in the metric remote sensing of et process allen et al 2007 2016 in addition ψsm zbl l in eq 34 is calculated using z 10 m if l 0 for numerical stability usually about 10 iterations are required for convergence of all terms in the profile and supporting equations for ta q and u after convergence with 24 hour weather data a final etref estimate is calculated using a daily timestep and standardized reference equation where the conditioned ea and uz in the 24 hour timestep equation are averaged from the two applications at estimated times of tmax and tmin and where tmax and tmin are conditioned air temperature from the daytime and night time periods etref calculation methods are described in allen et al 1998 and asce 2005 2016 in cases where the nighttime for example the 5 a m time with 24 hour data application becomes numerically unstable due to large stability of the near surface boundary layer then conditioning adjustments to tmin amb can be estimated as being the same as those for tmax amb allen et al 1983 ley et al 1994 in other words the difference tmax amb tmax ref is subtracted from tmin amb to produce tmin ref 35 t min ref t min amb t max amb t max ref the conditioning adjustments to ea amb and uamb for the tmax 2 p m application can be assigned to the 24 hour values for ea and uz when conditioning estimation for nighttime becomes numerically unstable 3 results and discussion 3 1 example application 24 hour data an example application of the conditioning procedure is made using paired weather data collected near twin falls idaho during 2008 and 2009 where two electronic weather stations were placed in two targeted environments one in a desert area near balanced rock west of castleford idaho usa and the other at the university of idaho kimberly idaho research and extension center over irrigated alfalfa fig 6 the balanced rock ambient location was surrounded by an extensive distance of rainfed rangeland comprised of sparse dry grass mixed with occasional sagebrush the kimberly location representing reference irrigated conditions was surrounded by an extensive distance of irrigated crops the analysis applied the conditioning procedure on a daily basis where as described in part 1 the 24 hour period was represented using two times of the day representing times of maximum 2 p m and minimum 5 a m air temperature air temperature vapor pressure and wind speed were all adjusted by the conditioning process differences between ambient and irrigated ta ea and uz were similar to those shown in figs 1 and 2 for narr vs reference conditions ambient et for the balanced rock data set was estimated as 0 05 rn due to the very dry conditions during late summer for simplicity rather than taken from the narr data set impacts of conditioning were relatively moderate for air temperature but were quite substantial for humidity fig 7 shows daily values measured for daily maximum air temperature for the reference tmax at kimberly id over irrigated alfalfa and ambient tmax near balanced rock during july and august 2009 as well as the conditioned results where balanced rock data were conditioned adjusted to represent reference tmax the conditioning adjustments were on average successful in matching the kimberly reference data with some variation in the effectiveness of the conditioning from day to day adjustments to the temperature data averaged about 2 c very low values were caused by numerical instability in monin obhukov computations results for all days between august 23 2008 and november 10 2009 are shown in fig 8 for ambient and conditioned tmax data at balanced rock vs measured reference data at kimberly the 1 033 bias slope for ambient rangeland data was reduced to 0 987 bias slope following conditioning and differences between means reduced from an average 0 42 c overestimation using ambient balanced rock data to an average 0 3 c underestimation using the conditioned tmax data over the 448 day period this indicates that some over conditioning took place on some days root mean square error rmse reduced from 1 55 c to 1 34 c r2 values were not changed indicating that covariance of the data was preserved by the conditioning the largest amount of conditioning occurred during the warmest periods of the year which also represent the relatively driest periods this is an expected and desirable outcome where for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock tmax and kimberly tmax averaged 1 43 c and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock tmax and kimberly tmax averaged 0 18 c indicating relatively accurate conditioning during summer months when peak etref occurs rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 1 95 c to 1 22 c appliers of the methodology can utilize multiplier coefficients on the adjustment term of eq 32 to reduce or enlarge the amount of conditioning adjustment to ta amb if they sense over or under conditioning the processing of conditioning for minimum air temperature assigned a time of 5 a m occasionally failed to reach numerical convergence during part 3 when ta q and u profiles were established over a reference surface this was caused by the overestimation of the strength of a stable near surface boundary layer when rn was negative it appears that stronger limits need to be imposed on l and the height over which the stability corrections are employed this is a topic for future research in the example case the procedure switched over to using eq 35 in the 24 hour conditioning example the slope of the tmin comparison to kimberly data reduced from 1 18 to 1 08 and r2 improved from 0 91 to 0 92 over the 448 day period differences between means reduced from an average 1 58 c overestimation using ambient balanced rock data to an average 0 87 c overestimation using the conditioned tmin data this indicates that under conditioning took place on most days for tmin this suggests that the nighttime cooling effect of et over the irrigated surface at kimberly was more pronounced than the conditioning process estimated rmse reduced from 2 88 c to 2 29 c as with tmax the largest amount of conditioning occurred during the warmest periods of the year for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock tmin and kimberly tmin averaged 2 37 c and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock tmin and kimberly tmin averaged 1 11 c therefore the tmin of the desert data set was brought 1 2 c closer to tmin measured in the irrigated environment which was more than 50 of the original difference rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 3 32 c to 2 27 c fig 9 vapor pressure measured at the kimberly and balanced rock desert locations and the balanced rock data conditioned to equilibrium reference conditions is shown in fig 10 for july and august 2009 and in fig 11 for a year and one half period from august 2008 through november 2009 similar to the previous comparison against narr data in figs 2 and 3 vapor content over the irrigated kimberly site was nearly double that measured over the dry rangeland ambient the conditioning of the ambient data did a fairly good job in bringing the desert vapor content expressed as vapor pressure up toward that measured over the irrigated surface by adding vapor from the imposed and moist reference surface into the near surface boundary layer fig 10 shows a gain in ea from 18 understatement ambient to a 6 over statement over the 448 day period differences between means reduced from an average 0 11 kpa underestimation using ambient balanced rock data to an average 0 06 kpa overestimation using the conditioned 2 p m ea data part of the over statement was caused by a few outliers rmse reduced from 0 20 kpa to 0 15 kpa as with tmax and tmin the largest amount of conditioning to ea occurred during the warmest periods of the year when differences between et from the ambient desert surface and irrigated surfaces were greatest for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock 2 p m ea and kimberly ea averaged 0 28 kpa and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock 2 p m ea and kimberly ea averaged 0 03 kpa indicating relatively good performance by the midsummer conditioning of near surface vapor pressure rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 0 35 kpa to 0 19 kpa overall the conditioning of ea at the 2 p m time was successful in producing a conditioned data set that was reflective of measurements over the irrigated setting especially during growing season months conditioning during the dormant winter period may not be necessary since wetness of the two regions is similar and differences in ea are expected to be small however the winter ea was conditioned here to demonstrate the behavior of the process wind speed measured at the kimberly and balanced rock desert locations is shown in fig 12 for a two month period during summer 2008 along with wind speed based on the conditioned balance rock data measured ambient wind speed was about 20 stronger over the desert site than measured over the irrigated site due to lower aerodynamic roughness of the desert and due to impacts of large sensible heat flux and buoyancy over the desert that fostered downward entrainment of higher velocity air from aloft toward the warm surface the entrainment process was moderated at the irrigated kimberly site by the lower sensible heat flux and lower or even negative buoyancy in the near surface boundary layer the use of nonconditioned wind speed adds to the overestimation of etref with nonreference weather data the conditioning process tended to replicate the wind speeds measured at kimberly relatively well by reducing entrainment of higher velocity wind from aloft the conditioning did increase the variance of estimates relative to kimberly by about 6 but it reduced the overstatement of wind speed from 17 to 0 3 fig 13 indicating good performance of the conditioning process for wind speed differences between means over the 448 day period reduced from an average 0 52 m s 1 overestimation at a 3 m height above the surface using ambient balanced rock wind speed data to an average 0 01 m s 1 overestimation using the conditioned 2 pm uz data rmse reduced from 1 08 m s 1 to 0 85 m s 1 as with the other scalers the largest amount of conditioning to uz occurred during the warmest periods of the year when differences between buoyancy of air above the ambient desert surface and irrigated surfaces were greatest for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock 2 p m uz and kimberly uz averaged 0 59 m s 1 and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock 2 p m uz and kimberly uz at 3 m height averaged 0 16 m s 1 indicating relatively effective midsummer conditioning of near surface wind speed rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 0 86 m s 1 to 0 60 m s 1 fig 14 shows reference eto estimated for mid afternoon 2 p m time using the balanced rock desert data before and after conditioning of the weather data for the two month july august period during summer of 2009 the et fluxes reduced by about 10 with the conditioning fig 15 shows grass reference eto in mm day 1 for the 24 hour daily timestep data computed from the weather data collected the balanced rock desert site using the ambient measured tmax tmin vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed and also eto calculated from conditioned reference bal rock tmax vapor pressure and wind speed data the 24 hour timestep form of the standardized fao 56 equation was employed allen et al 1998 asce 2005 the calculations are compared to eto calculated from weather data measured 80 km to the east near kimberly over irrigated alfalfa the impact of the adjustments applied to a daily basis was quite substantial averaging 20 reduction in estimated eto and are in good agreement with the target eto computed from the reference kimberly data twenty four hour eto is plotted in fig 16 for a year and one half period from august 2008 through november 2009 for eto calculated from ambient and conditioned rangeland weather data collected at the balanced rock location vs eto calculated from weather data collected over irrigated alfalfa near kimberly eto with the ambient desert data reduced from 32 greater than the reference data set to 6 greater when using the conditioned desert data set eto estimates were reduced by an average of 25 which is a substantial decrease in the context of water rights management and hydrologic water balances covariance of estimates reduced slightly for the conditioned data set solar radiation data were measured at both the rangeland site and irrigated site and were used in eto calculations with no adjustment differences between means over the 448 day period reduced from an average 0 81 mm d 1 overestimation using ambient balanced rock wind speed data to an average 0 09 mm d 1 overestimation using the conditioned weather data rmse of 24 hour estimates for eto reduced from 1 23 mm d 1 to 0 58 mm d 1 as with the ta ea and uz scalers the largest amount of conditioning to eto occurred during the warmest periods of the year when differences in wetness of the ambient desert surface and irrigated surfaces were greatest for example during the june to august 2009 period mean differences between ambient balanced rock eto and kimberly eto averaged 1 53 mm d 1 and mean differences between conditioned balanced rock eto and kimberly eto averaged 0 41 mm d 1 indicating that conditioning of ta ea and uz data during midsummer removed 73 of the overestimation bias in eto caused by using arid weather data rmse for the comparisons during june to august reduced from 1 80 mm d 1 to 0 74 mm d 1 overall the conditioning of the ambient 24 hour weather data set collected in a very dry nonirrigated setting was largely successful and indicates the benefits and consistencies of using theoretical boundary layer profile mechanics to simulate near surface processes occurring in the presence of evapotranspiration no adjustments were made to the ambient data sets or conditioning process to help direct its outcomes save for limits placed on some buoyancy correction calculations to help foster numerical convergence during iterations this indicates that the primarily theoretical procedure is relatively robust and may not require any localized calibration it also appears that some of the over or under conditioning of ta ea and uz parameters had some cancelling effect during calculation of eto in the example application actual ambient et for the balanced rock data set was estimated as 0 05 rn that simplified assumption did not appear to introduce significant error to the conditioning process future work can explore using actual et taken from a daily soil water balance or taken from a gridded ldas lsm weather data set such as the narr data set where the ldas lsm simulations do not include water inputs from irrigation 3 2 example application hourly data as an example application of the conditioning process to hourly weather data two weather stations in eastern nevada near the utah state line were evaluated the two weather stations represented a desert and an agricultural site that are within 3 km of each other as shown in fig 17 the stations represent a region having a semi arid environment with primarily desert vegetation and with occasional irrigated agriculture areas the agricultural area surrounding the snake valley is composed of mostly a hay pasture mix national land cover dataset nlcd class 81 that is irrigated while the salt desert weather station is surrounded by non irrigated shrub nlcd class 52 the conditioning algorithm requires ambient ta ea uz rs and actual et as inputs the ambient latent heat flux le estimates were acquired from nldas hourly data hydroshare apps n d cosgrove et al 2003 while ta ea uz and rs data were acquired from the two weather stations via the nicenet https nicenet dri edu last accessed july 27 2020 weather data network managed by the desert research institute the near surface air temperature ta can elevate to nearly 40 c in summer over the salt desert site the salt desert wind speed data were measured at a 10 m height so a logarithmic profile relationship was used to translate the wind speed from 10 m to 3 m to be congruent with the snake valley wind speed measurements the data spanned a period from august 2011 to december 2013 which provided the opportunity to observe the seasonal variation between the desert and agriculture environments and the behavior of the conditioning procedure fig 18 shows 7 day moving averages for air temperature based on hourly timesteps where conditioned ta for the salt desert station decreased toward the irrigated data as expected although differences among all three data sets were small the 7 day maximum was about 27 c during this period during all three summers the hottest desert temperatures become cooler following conditioning but still remained about a degree c above the values measured over the irrigation site there were some cases during winter where very cool desert temperatures were not as warm as those measured over the irrigated field although differences were small fig 19 shows ambient and conditioned ea data at the salt desert location and measured ea at the snake valley site during 2011 2013 conditioned and irrigated ea followed each other relatively closely the amount of conditioning increase to ea was largest during midsummer as expected due to dry conditions during summer months even though levels of humidity were higher during that period due to greater capacities of hot desert air the maximum 7 day moving average ea was about 1 5 kpa during the period fig 20 shows the 3 m wind speed for the salt desert station before and after conditioning along with measurements over the irrigated snake valley averaged over 24 hour periods in contrast to the idaho data set that relied on measured weather data for the ambient and irrigated sites the conditioned gridded wind speed at salt desert increased away from wind speed measurements at the irrigated snake valley site during summer periods the zom used to represent the ambient conditions at salt desert during step one of blending height establishment was a relatively rough 0 3 m whereas the zom used to represent the reference surface during conditioning was 0 084 m representing tall alfalfa the smoother roughness for the reference surface increased near surface wind speed for the conditioned data it is possible that a substantial amount of differences between the wind speed measurements at the irrigated site and wind speed estimates in the ambient nldas hourly data set stem from error and representation bias inherent to the nldas data set the nldas lsm data set has an approximately 12 km grid size so that differences in the surface orography used in the model may lead to discrepancies with wind speed observations especially in mixed environments of irrigated agriculture and desert rangeland the snake valley irrigated weather station has a mountain range six km to the west and open desert to the east so that its orography is complex ambient values for hourly ta ea and uz were used to represent the conditioned values during nighttime due to occasional numerical instability in the monin obukhov based boundary layer stability correction this dampened some of the differences shown in the moving averages the use of nonconditioned nighttime values in the eto calculations is not expected to have a major impact on total eto estimates for 24 hour and longer periods since energy availability is relatively low during nighttime hourly conditioned air temperature is plotted against the ambient measurements at the salt desert station and against measurements at the irrigated snake valley station in fig 21 for the 08 2011 12 2013 period the extent of conditioning averaged about 4 c cooling during periods of high daytime temperatures during summer months with occasional substantial conditioning cooling of as much as 20 c for a few periods the conditioning nearly always cooled near surface air temperature left graph of fig 21 the degree of adjustment by the conditioning process was relatively well behaved with little or no new variation introduced into the data set scatter between conditioned ta and ta measured at the irrigated site spanned 10 c at times fig 21 right graph due to differences in logged data between the two data sets that scatter was not due to the conditioning process as evidenced from the left graph overall the r2 was high at 0 95 with slope of 0 98 and rmse shown in the figure as rmsd for conditioned data of 2 7 c as discussed for wind speed a portion of the rmse may reflect differences in the natures of the two data sets gridded vs measured data rather than error introduced by the conditioning process hourly conditioned vapor pressure is plotted against the ambient measurements at the salt desert station and against measurements at the irrigated snake valley station in fig 22 for the 08 2011 12 2013 period the extent of conditioning was relatively substantial for vapor pressure and averaged about 0 3 kpa added to the ambient values the adjustment by conditioning was well behaved for vapor pressure and in nearly all cases humidity was added to the ambient air during the conditioning with some additions doubling the water content of the near surface boundary layer scatter between conditioned ea and ea measured at the irrigated site spanned 0 8 kpa at times fig 22 right graph some of this variation was likely due to differences in logged data between the two stations as evidenced previously for ta the r2 was lower for vapor pressure data than for air temperature data at 0 87 although the slope of the regression was 0 96 with intercept of nearly 0 0 rmse shown as rmsd was 0 12 kpa hourly conditioned wind speed is plotted against the ambient measurements at the salt desert station and against measurements at the irrigated snake valley station in fig 23 for the 08 2011 12 2013 period the conditioning procedure only slightly decreased estimated wind speed for the salt desert site and sometimes increased it the conditioned wind speed was similar to that at the snake valley irrigated site for wind speeds below about 4 m s 1 but with large scatter and was generally below wind speeds measured at the irrigated site for wind speeds above 4 m s 1 fig 23 righthand graph scatter between conditioned uz and uz measured at the irrigated site spanned 2 m s 1 at times the impact of conditioning on wind speed was relatively sensitive to the roughness value used to represent the ambient desert conditions 0 02 m in our case this relatively small value reflects the sparse local vegetation and could have been increased to reflect a mixture of local vegetation and more rough vegetation in the mountain area six km to the west as well as terrain roughness a sensitivity analysis on zom for the desert location showed relatively large sensitivity of wind speed adjustments to zom as its value was varied from 0 02 m to 0 3 m with conditioned wind speeds increasing over measured ambient wind speeds for zom 0 08 m the increase was related to the value for zom used to represent the reference surface that was superimposed to the ambient desert surface where zom 0 084 m simulating a clipped grass weather surface the r2 was lower for wind speed than for vapor pressure and air temperature data at 0 75 and the slope of the regression was only 0 74 with a 0 82 ms 1 intercept the rmse shown as rmsd was 0 79 m s 1 reference eto values for the irrigated snake valley site were computed using the refet software of the university of idaho allen 2010 the ambient and conditioned eto for the salt desert site were computed using the standardized fao 56 penman monteith equation inside the conditioning algorithm as given in eq 25 where the calculations were validated using the refet model hourly calculated eto using conditioned ta ea and uz data is plotted against calculations made using the ambient measurements at the salt desert station and against calculations made using measurements at the irrigated snake valley station in fig 24 for the 08 2011 12 2013 period in general the conditioning process reduced calculated reference eto by about 0 03 0 1 mm hr 1 or about 5 20 some of the lessened impact of overall conditioning was due to the sometimes increase in conditioned wind speed described previously which counteracted cooling of air temperature and humidification of the near surface boundary layer scatter between conditioned eto and eto calculated using measured weather at the irrigated site spanned about 0 2 mm hr 1 at times fig 24 right graph most of this variation was caused by differences in logged data between the two stations as noted previously the r2 was relatively high for eto calculations at 0 98 even though r2 was substantially lower for wind speed and vapor pressure inputs the slope of the regression line was 0 94 with a nearly 0 intercept the rmse was 0 05 mm hr 1 fig 25 shows a plot of sensible heat flux h extracted at the time of daily maximum ta for the snake valley site during july through september 2012 estimated h during the conditioning process was relatively large for the ambient conditions averaging about 200 w m 2 values for h averaged about 0 0 for the conditioned data set having a reference et as the lower boundary which is common for well watered settings fig 26 shows cumulative values for grass reference eto and alfalfa reference etr for the two and one half year simulation period the cumulative ambient eto from august 2011 to december 2013 was 3400 mm and cumulative conditioned eto was 3138 mm with a difference of 7 7 the cumulative irrigated eto at the snake valley site was 3160 mm which was only 0 7 higher than the conditioned eto and 7 lower than the ambient eto from the salt desert location similar differences were noted for cumulative etr which averaged about 27 higher than cumulative eto overall the impact of conditioning on cumulative eto and etr over an extended period was significant at about 8 reduction in estimates as noted for the idaho illustration these differences are considered to be substantial for eto data used in water rights management and in hydrologic studies 4 conclusions meteorological data collected from an arid environment are frequently utilized for many hydrological and remote sensing applications those data and resulting reference et estimates may suffer from an aridity bias relative to reference et estimates that are characteristic of an irrigated setting in this study we developed a weather data conditioning algorithm to quantify the effects of surface aridity on reference evapotranspiration calculations the conditioning algorithm is based on standard surface energy balance equations and flux profile relationships that can be applied to both point weather station data as well as with gridded weather data sets the meteorological variables from the two desert environments illustrated more closely mimicked data from reference agricultural environments after conditioning assumptions of continuity in air masses at a blending height above both dry and reference surfaces within the same climate appear to be valid as does the use of the standard flux profile equations in summary the conditioning of gridded weather data to remove artifacts of aridity using theoretical boundary layer theory appears to be a robust method that should have good transferability to other locations and climates it is noteworthy that weather data collected over a reference well watered surface and that do not exhibit negative effects of local aridity will automatically have little or no conditioning based correction this is a benefit of the flux profile conditioning process as compared to older empirical adjustment methods that applied constant adjustments regardless of the wetting history of the weather measurement site or corrections that needed empirical calibration for each new application the conditioning procedures developed are exploratory in nature and will benefit from future testing and application to various gridded weather data sets and to more climatic regions additional sensitivity analyses on impact of estimated blending layer height land surface roughness and extent and magnitude of boundary layer stability corrections will help to improve robustness and consistency of conditioning based adjustments to arid weather data some linearities might be introduced to simplify and accelerate computations declaration of competing

10257,soil water dynamics are an important part of agricultural irrigation evaluation standards therefore supplying water efficiently has become the focus of agricultural water saving research and different soil water movement models have been developed for various water supply models in this work a parameter inversion model is coupled with the soil water movement equation the richards equation based on the main variable of the head h based richards equation to investigate the dynamics of soil moisture under hole irrigation a mathematical model for hole irrigation with two hole diameters 5 cm or 7 cm and two hole numbers one or two was constructed after verifying the model with field scale soil water content data from different soil profile depths the richards equation based on the gauss newton parameter inversion method was found to accurately simulate the soil moisture dynamics under hole irrigation r 2 0 9 the difference in the water content of the soil profile due to the difference in hole diameter did not exceed 2 7 and the soil water content under single hole irrigation was significantly higher than that under double hole irrigation due to lower evaporation the infiltration distance of the wetting front under single hole irrigation which was mainly distributed on the hole side of the planting ridge was greater than that under double hole irrigation at 378 ml irrigation water per plant and the soil moisture was unevenly distributed at a certain depth however the wetting fronts under double hole irrigation intersected and began to infiltrate the soil evenly within a short time only 6 of the entire irrigation cycle the results for wetting front movement under the different hole settings show that double hole irrigation does not stimulate crop root growth

model algorithms has increased interest in the application of underground soil water dynamics zha et al 2017 dang et al 2020 the underground soil water dynamics model richards equation based on a combination of a continuous equation for water flow and darcy s law is highly nonlinear and is generally universal in mathematical solutions thus it is widely used in the mathematical simulation of water movement from saturated to unsaturated soils zha et al 2013 jambhekar et al 2015 in the richards equation the water head h and the hydraulic conductivity k of soil water are nonlinear functions of soil moisture and the soil hydraulic parameters celia et al 1990 voller 2009 trinh et al 2018 neitsch et al 2011 used to describe this relationship between negative pressure and hydraulic conductivity are empirical or physical constants five independent parameters are included in the relationship between soil water negative pressure and hydraulic conductivity and soil water content in the van genuchten mualem models brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 at present the methods for determining these parameters mainly include the direct test method and the soil transfer function method zha et al 2011 šimůnek et al 2008 however large deviations occur between the simulated and observed values due to the uncertainty of the parameters when the parameters obtained by the above

geza et al 2009 foglia et al 2009 and parameter values obtained by the inversion method tested with the least squares principle against actual observation values have achieved strong correlations with observed data šimůnek et al 2012 soil is a porous medium composed of countless irregularly shaped and intricately arranged solid particles zheng et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 thus the movement of water in soil is complex and changeable as an important factor in meeting the needs of normal crop growth the water content in soil should typically be distributed within a certain range of soil layers to maximize water utilization by the crop strati et al 2018 and can be directly measured or indirectly derived from infiltration models based on infiltration observations latorre et al 2015 the mathematical simulation of soil water movement makes it easier to explore the characteristics of soil water under various irrigation modes therefore it is useful to simulate water management measures by mathematically simulating soil water movement and to adopt different soil water replenishment methods to change the spatial distribution of soil water and soil water storage capacity existing studies have shown that under the same irrigation conditions high frequency irrigation can increase the soil water use efficiency liu et al 2013 hole irrigation is a water saving and fertilizer saving technology adopted by farmers in facility agricultural production it is simple inexpensive and easy to operate and has practical significance for promoting water saving irrigation in arid regions of northwest china at present research on hole irrigation is mostly concentrated on indoor research or small scale field scale research since a complete theoretical system for hole irrigation has not yet been developed more research is needed to provide theoretical guidance for its dissemination and use zheng et al 2019a used hole irrigation with different irrigation frequencies to precisely supply water and nutrients to the root zone of crops in field experiments their results showed that the hole irrigation method did not decrease crop yields and even improved crop quality while using less water than conventional methods there are also studies on the mathematical simulation of the infiltration process of hole irrigation performed indoors with soil boxes and simulation software can generally accurately simulate the movement of the wetting front and the changes in the soil moisture volume under hole irrigation zheng et al 2018 2019b however mathematical simulations of the hole irrigation model have been developed mainly by establishing a set h or a certain flow rate and using indoor soil box experiments to verify the model as will be shown later in this paper the presence of actual evaporation and other related factors can also substantially impact the performance of mathematical simulations this study was performed using gauss newton methods dahiya et al 2007 to invert the parameters of the richards equation k s α and n based on field scale block experiment data then we focused on the performance of the h based richards equation to understand the dynamic changes in soil water under hole irrigation with different hole sizes and numbers and to explore a reasonable hole irrigation mode 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical model 2 1 1 governing equation mathematical models for simulating the movement of water are usually described with the richards equation zha et al 2013 which for a two dimensional vertical flow is given by 1 c h h t x k h h x z k h h z k h z s where h l is the soil water pressure head k l 1 t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity z l is the distance t t is the time c is the soil water capacity where c h θ h and s is the source item the richards equation is solved by combining it with soil hydraulic functions in this paper the van genuchten mvg ippisch et al 2006 model was used to describe the law of soil water infiltration 2 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 k θ k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θ is the soil water content k θ l 1 t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity k s l 1 t 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity s e is the soil water saturation θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual water content respectively and α l 1 and n are parameters that depend on the pore size distribution m 1 1 n 2 1 2 hydraulic parameter inversion as shown in formulas 2 and 3 there are five unknown parameters in the van genuchten mualem model k s θ s θ r α and n θ s can be obtained experimentally and a change in θ r has little influence on the model liu et al 2015 therefore only three parameters were inverted in this paper k s α and n the model was simplified to the following nonlinear expression 4 y f x β e where f is the m dimensional column vector which represents the simulated value of the model x is the independent variable matrix of f β is the n dimensional parameter vector m n e is the error vector of the simulated and observed values and y is the measured value which is composed of the simulated value and the error the central idea of the gauss newton method is to find the optimal parameters that minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals s β the sum of the squares of the residuals is calculated as follows 5 s β e t e i 1 m r i 2 to minimize the sum of squares of the residuals it can be calculated as follows 6 s β β 2 i 1 m r i r i β j 0 where r i y i f x i β i 1 m and j 1 n with the initial parameter a it can be changed to a linear form by taylor expansion 7 f x β f x β 0 j 0 β β 0 where j 0 j i j 0 f i β j β β 0 m n is the sensitivity matrix containing m n sensitivity coefficients by substituting formula 7 into formula 6 for simplicity deriving all parameters separately and making the derivative zero we can obtain the following matrix form 8 j 0 t j 0 δ β j 0 t δ y where δ β β β 0 δ y y f x β 0 based on formula 8 the optimal parameter value that meets certain conditions can be obtained through multiple iterations there is no obvious expression for f in formula 4 and the forward difference or central difference is needed to approximate the sensitivity matrix j 0 in formula 7 although the central difference model often runs once more to obtain the simulation value when the parameter is β δ β the central difference is more accurate than the forward difference therefore the central difference was used to approximate the sensitivity matrix in this study the central difference is expressed as follows 9 δ y δ β y β δ β y β δ β β δ β β δ β where δy is the amount of simulation value change caused by the parameter change and δβ is the change in the parameter the convergence precision of the parameter is defined as y i 1 y i y i ε where y i is the simulation value corresponding to the step i iteration in this study ε 0 01 2 2 mathematical experiment 2 2 1 test design and data collection the experimental area for this study was based on the field size used in tomato planting the soil type in the experimental field is a silty loam and the soil particles are 25 3 sand 64 6 silt and 10 1 clay plastic film mulching with ridge furrow cultivation was used in the experiment with a ridge height of 0 15 m and plant distance of 0 3 m impervious geotextiles were placed at 1 0 m depth between adjacent treatments to prevent the mutual infiltration of water and fertilizer as shown in fig 1 we used hole irrigation as the water supply method the holes were set at a 5 cm distance to the crop row along the ridge and there were holes on both sides of each row with a diameter of 5 cm and a depth of 5 cm in addition a soil moisture detection device was set at the plant roots 5 cm along the vertical direction of the ridge to detect the soil moisture status from the surface to 60 cm soil depth the detection device used was the diviner 2000 portable soil profile moisture rapid detector shown in fig 2b and the soil moisture was measured every four days during the experimental period the root area of the crop was irrigated at different times with an amount of water corresponding to the amount of water that had evaporated the irrigation water was provided every 2days during the whole growth period through the holes on both sides of the plant the water was poured into the hole with a measuring cup with a capacity of 1000 ml an e601 evaporator was used to control the irrigation amount as shown in fig 2a the irrigation amount was determined by the following formula lovelli et al 2007 10 m k p s e p where m is the irrigation water amount ml kp is the evaporator coefficient 0 6 in the paper s is the evaporation area 0 3 m 0 6 m and e p is the evaporation volume of the evaporation pan during the irrigation interval cm the amount of evaporation in the test area as measured by the e601 evaporator and the amount of irrigation water calculated by the corresponding coefficient adjustment are shown in fig 3a the average value of the measured water content of four soil samples was taken as the soil water content at the profile sampling point as shown in fig 3b 2 2 2 mathematical model settings 1 initial and boundary conditions as this experiment used a ridge cultivation method with film mulching evaporation and irrigation from the upper boundary were not considered except for the evaporation and irrigation that occurred through the holes on both sides of the plant as shown in fig 1 because the holes are small the water head of the hole was assumed to be close to the value of the soil water pressure when the soil is saturated during irrigation the settings of the model were as follows 11 θ θ s t t i r r i 0 z 0 05 0 05 x 0 1 0 2 x 0 25 s e 0 z 0 05 0 05 x 0 1 0 2 x 0 25 the analysis of the measured water content data revealed that the soil water content at the lower boundary z 0 6 m fluctuated slightly around a value of 0 191 as shown in fig 3 12 θ z t z 0 6 0 191 in the equation above s is the source item e is the evaporation volume during the irrigation interval cm as shown in formula 9 t is the simulation time d t i r r i is the irrigation time d x is the horizontal coordinate and z is the vertical coordinate since all the plants were planted symmetrically it was assumed that there was no water exchange at the boundaries between plants in the ridge direction therefore the settings of the model were as follows 13 h x l e f t 0 x 0 0 z 0 6 h x r i g h t 0 x 0 3 0 z 0 6 where x left is outside the adjacent boundary of x 0 m and x right is inside the adjacent boundary of x 0 3 m 2 variable settings in the study two modes single and double hole and two hole diameters were tested for a total of 4 variables for simulation table 1 because of the small canopy of the plants at the time scale of 4days after planting plant transpiration aside from surface evaporation was not included in the model and the soil water content on the 4th day of the seedling stage was used for model comparison and verification after model validation the dynamics of soil moisture in each treatment within 24 h 1day were simulated and analyzed zheng et al 2018 obtained the relationship between the infiltration volume and the infiltration time under hole infiltration in laboratory experiments this curve is used to determine the infiltration time for a known infiltration volume 14 t i r r i 5 267 10 4 m 2 0 24306 m 3 62553 1440 where t i r r i is the irrigation time d and m is the irrigation water amount ml as shown in formula 9 2 2 3 model accuracy validation statistical indicators are used to accurately evaluate the fitting accuracy of the simulated values to the observed values the statistical indicators leisenring and moradkhani 2011 commonly used to evaluate fitting accuracy are the determination coefficient r 2 the root mean square error rmse the deviation bias the consistency index ia and others r 2 0 1 r m s e 0 b i a s 0 and i a 0 1 bias represents the ratio of the average error to the observed mean it is a relative index and is dimensionless unlike r 2 and ia rmse has the same dimension as the statistical object because the fitting value in this study is the soil moisture content and rmse is dimensionless 15 r 2 1 s e s e o b s 16 r m s e s e n 1 17 b i a s i 1 n θ o b s i θ s i m i i 1 n θ o b s i 18 i a 1 s e i 1 n θ s i m i θ s i m θ o b s i θ o b s 2 here s e o b s i 1 n θ o b s i θ obs 2 s e i 1 n θ o b s i θ s i m i 2 θ o b s i is the water content measured in the field θ s i m i is the water content simulated by the inverted parameters θ obs and θ s i m are the corresponding average moisture content and n is the number of samples all the above models were developed with c programming 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter estimation using the inversion program the soil parameters were obtained by running the richards equation coupled with the inversion program these obtained parameters were then compared with the soil moisture parameters fitted by forward modeling as shown in table 2 table 2 shows that the parameters obtained with the inversion program were similar to the results from forward modeling the relative errors of the inversion and fitting parameters k s α and n were 19 8 23 4 and 0 98 respectively formulas 2 and 3 indicate that the key to solving the richards equation is to obtain the soil water characteristic curve θ h θ and the hydraulic conductivity curve θ k θ n α and k s are the parameters used to describe these curves as shown in fig 4 the trends of the two curves were very similar and the inversion model was able to correctly obtain the soil water characteristic curve 3 2 model validation model evaluation must be performed to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation generated by the model the soil hydraulic parameters obtained by the parameter inversion and forward fitting method were used as the inputs for the model simulation and the simulated soil profile moisture content results from the two sets of parameters were compared with the measured values based on field experiments as shown in fig 5 in the 20 50 cm soil layer the simulated value from the inversion model was closer to the measured value the relative errors between the simulated and measured values of the inversion parameters k s θ r α and n in each soil layer were 0 56 1 55 3 14 and 5 13 respectively these values are lower than the average relative errors of the forward fitting parameters k s θ s α and n which were 1 87 2 86 4 50 and 3 42 respectively in general the lower the bias and rmse and the higher the r 2 and ia are the better the fitting effect the statistical indicators for the results of the models run with the different sets of parameters are given in table 3 compared with those obtained from the measured values the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves obtained with the parameter inversion model had higher fitting accuracy r 2 and ia were greater than 0 9 ia was greater than 0 97 and bias was greater than 0 03 these results indicate that the inversion parameter algorithm model was able to calculate the parameters correctly and that the optimized parameters reflected the hydraulic characteristics of the soil therefore these parameters can be used as input parameters for the mathematical simulation of soil water movement 3 3 effects of hole settings on soil water content the irrigation method is the main factor influencing soil water dynamics it directly affects the infiltration method and in turn affects the water content of the soil profile the results from the simulations of irrigation with different hole diameters and numbers are shown in figs 6 and 7 after 24 h of infiltration the soil profile water content near the roots of the plants showed some differences due to hole diameter the soil profile water content with a hole diameter of 7 cm was higher than that with a hole diameter of 5 cm from the surface to 50 cm soil depth the water content of each 10 cm profile layer after irrigation with two 7 cm diameter holes was 1 0 1 7 2 4 2 7 and 1 3 higher than that after irrigation with two 5 cm holes and 0 9 1 2 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 higher than that after irrigation with one 7 cm hole with the increase in the hole diameter the saturated area of soil at the bottom of the hole became larger during the irrigation period which was conducive to water infiltration the water content of the soil layer below the depth of the 7 cm hole 5 cm depth was higher than that of the soil layer below the depth of the 5 cm hole compared with irrigation with 5 cm diameter holes irrigation with 7 cm holes was more conducive to water infiltration into lower soil layers however in practical field applications the larger the diameter of the holes in the film on the ridges the larger the evaporation area is the simulation results show that from the surface to 50 cm soil depth the relative error of the soil moisture content in 10 cm soil layers with 5 cm and 7 cm diameter holes under single hole irrigation was 0 88 1 19 1 54 2 01 and 2 02 respectively and 0 99 1 66 2 44 2 69 and 1 35 under double hole irrigation the water content in the soil profile under 7 cm hole irrigation was not more than 2 7 higher than that under 5 cm hole irrigation and the difference due to the change in hole diameter was small fig 6 shows the water content distribution curve for the 0 60 cm soil profile in the plant root area after one day of irrigation and fig 7 shows the soil water distribution in the 0 60 cm soil profile of the entire planting area the water content of the soil profile under single hole irrigation t1 1 and t1 2 was significantly higher than that under double hole irrigation t2 1 and t2 2 with the 5 cm hole diameter the water content under single hole irrigation was 12 2 11 6 12 9 14 6 and 10 8 higher than that in each soil layer respectively under double hole irrigation and 12 1 11 1 11 9 13 9 and 11 5 higher than that with the 7 cm hole diameter this indicates that with the same source item the water content in the soil profile under single hole irrigation will be higher than that under double hole irrigation fig 3b shows that the periodic irrigation amount at the seedling stage increased the soil moisture content in the root zone soil profile according to the principle of water balance this result can be understood as follows water consumption transpiration evaporation irrigation amount because crop transpiration is related to the size of the canopy the larger the leaf area is the higher the transpiration wang et al 2012 moreover at the seedling stage the crop canopy is small and the plants consume little water therefore the main water losses can be attributed to evaporation the disadvantage of hole irrigation is that the film on the ridge is perforated to supply the water this exposes the ground through the holes resulting in an increase in the evaporation area therefore at the same irrigation amount the evaporation from a single hole system is less than that from a double hole system however the actual application of these techniques has shown that the single hole setting increases the irrigation time and increases the management costs for the same water supply amount 3 4 effects of hole settings on soil water dynamics fig 8 shows the movement of the soil water wetting front under the different hole number settings the infiltration times corresponding to 0 cm 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm from the roots of the plants were 172 8 min 345 6 min 518 4 min and 720 0 min respectively according to fig 8b when t 172 8 min the wetting peaks of the double hole irrigation began to converge and to infiltrate evenly however in terms of the water infiltration depth at t 172 8 min 345 6 min 518 4 min and 720 0 min the wetting front depths under single hole irrigation were 0 13 m 0 25 m 0 36 m and 0 40 m respectively and those under double hole irrigation were 0 13 m 0 20 m 0 24 m and 0 28 m the vertical infiltration distance of the single hole system was greater but the water content was unevenly distributed at a certain depth i e distributed mainly on the hole side of the ridge single hole irrigation concentrated the water on the irrigation side of the ridge and the irrigation time for the same irrigation amount under single hole irrigation was longer than that under double hole irrigation during the whole process of infiltration from the irrigation side to the plant side the wetting front also moves down therefore it takes a long time to evenly distribute the water throughout the whole plant growth unit however the vertical infiltration distance of the double hole system was lower than that of the single hole system under double hole irrigation the wetting fronts intersected and water infiltration began earlier but the vertical infiltration distance was shorter than that under single hole irrigation when the infiltration time was 172 8 min the wetting fronts of the double hole irrigation had intersected and begun to gradually infiltrate the soil this time period accounted for 6 of the entire irrigation cycle 2days in this paper the time required for this method to stimulate the crop root growth on both sides for water absorption is much shorter than the entire irrigation cycle the single hole method achieves a greater depth of water infiltration and the water is distributed on one side of the soil profile for a longer time than with the double hole method in practical applications to stimulate the growth of crop roots on both sides of the plant single holes with alternating irrigation can be used to supply water 4 conclusion in this work based on the richards equation and the parameter inversion method a model for hole irrigation with an h based form was established the model was verified with field scale data we focused on the performance of the model in describing the dynamics of soil water in the root zone of crops under irrigation systems with different hole sizes and numbers to provide theoretical guidance for the popularization and application of hole irrigation our conclusions are presented below 1 the values of soil hydraulic parameters k s α and n inverted by gauss newton methods reflected the soil hydraulic characteristics the h based richards equation based on the inversion parameter algorithm accurately simulated the soil moisture dynamics of hole irrigation and the r 2 and ia values for the models were higher than 0 9 2 the differences in the water content in the soil profile due to the change in the hole diameter were small the water content of the soil profile under single hole irrigation was higher than that under double hole irrigation which might be due to the lower evaporation through the single holes 3 double hole irrigation allowed the wetting fronts to intersect and the water to infiltrate evenly within a short time period however the vertical infiltration distance of the wetting front under single hole irrigation was greater than that under double hole irrigation and the water content under single hole irrigation was mainly distributed on the hole side of the ridge the vertical movement distance of the soil wetting front in the crop root zone under single hole irrigation is high and the soil water content is mainly distributed on the irrigation side of the ridge therefore alternating single hole irrigation can be used to stimulate crop roots to absorb water and then to stimulate root growth on both sides of the plant to improve nutrient absorption which is conducive to crop growth declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

10257,soil water dynamics are an important part of agricultural irrigation evaluation standards therefore supplying water efficiently has become the focus of agricultural water saving research and different soil water movement models have been developed for various water supply models in this work a parameter inversion model is coupled with the soil water movement equation the richards equation based on the main variable of the head h based richards equation to investigate the dynamics of soil moisture under hole irrigation a mathematical model for hole irrigation with two hole diameters 5 cm or 7 cm and two hole numbers one or two was constructed after verifying the model with field scale soil water content data from different soil profile depths the richards equation based on the gauss newton parameter inversion method was found to accurately simulate the soil moisture dynamics under hole irrigation r 2 0 9 the difference in the water content of the soil profile due to the difference in hole diameter did not exceed 2 7 and the soil water content under single hole irrigation was significantly higher than that under double hole irrigation due to lower evaporation the infiltration distance of the wetting front under single hole irrigation which was mainly distributed on the hole side of the planting ridge was greater than that under double hole irrigation at 378 ml irrigation water per plant and the soil moisture was unevenly distributed at a certain depth however the wetting fronts under double hole irrigation intersected and began to infiltrate the soil evenly within a short time only 6 of the entire irrigation cycle the results for wetting front movement under the different hole settings show that double hole irrigation does not stimulate crop root growth on both sides of the plant in the long term however this growth pattern can be stimulated by alternating single hole irrigation keywords richards equation parameter inversion soil water dynamics hole

is the amount of simulation value change caused by the parameter change and δβ is the change in the parameter the convergence precision of the parameter is defined as y i 1 y i y i ε where y i is the simulation value corresponding to the step i iteration in this study ε 0 01 2 2 mathematical experiment 2 2 1 test design and data collection the experimental area for this study was based on the field size used in tomato planting the soil type in the experimental field is a silty loam and the soil particles are 25 3 sand 64 6 silt and 10 1 clay plastic film mulching with ridge furrow cultivation was used in the experiment with a ridge height of 0 15 m and plant distance of 0 3 m impervious geotextiles were placed at 1 0 m depth between adjacent treatments to prevent the mutual infiltration of water and fertilizer as shown in fig 1 we used hole irrigation as the water supply method the holes were set at a 5 cm distance to the crop row along the ridge and there were holes on both sides of each row with a diameter of 5 cm and a depth of 5 cm in addition a soil moisture detection device was set at the plant roots 5 cm along the vertical direction of the ridge to detect the soil moisture status from the surface to 60 cm soil depth the detection device used was the diviner 2000 portable soil profile moisture rapid detector shown in fig 2b and the soil moisture was measured every four days during the experimental period the root area of the crop was irrigated at different times with an amount of water corresponding to the amount of water that had evaporated the irrigation water was provided every 2days during the whole growth period through the holes on both sides of the plant the water was poured into the hole with a measuring cup with a capacity of 1000 ml an e601 evaporator was used to control the irrigation amount as shown in fig 2a the irrigation amount was determined by the following formula lovelli et al 2007 10 m k p s e p where m is the irrigation water amount ml kp is the evaporator coefficient 0 6 in the paper s is the evaporation area 0 3 m 0 6 m and e p is the evaporation volume of the evaporation pan during the irrigation interval cm the amount of evaporation in the test area as measured by the e601 evaporator and the amount of irrigation water calculated by the corresponding coefficient adjustment are shown in fig 3a the average value of the measured water content of four soil samples was taken as the soil water content at the profile sampling point as shown in fig 3b 2 2 2 mathematical model settings 1 initial and boundary conditions as this experiment used a ridge cultivation method with film mulching evaporation and irrigation from the upper boundary were not considered except for the evaporation and irrigation that occurred through the holes on both sides of the plant as shown in fig 1 because the holes are small the water head of the hole was assumed to be close to the value of the soil water pressure when the soil is saturated during irrigation the settings of the model were as follows 11 θ θ s t t i r r i 0 z 0 05 0 05 x 0 1 0 2 x 0 25 s e 0 z 0 05 0 05 x 0 1 0 2 x 0 25 the analysis of the measured water content data revealed that the soil water content at the lower boundary z 0 6 m fluctuated slightly around a value of 0 191 as shown in fig 3 12 θ z t z 0 6 0 191 in the equation above s is the source item e is the evaporation volume during the irrigation interval cm as shown in formula 9 t is the simulation time d t i r r i is the irrigation time d x is the horizontal coordinate and z is the vertical coordinate since all the plants were planted symmetrically it was assumed that there was no water exchange at the boundaries between plants in the ridge direction therefore the settings of the model were as follows 13 h x l e f t 0 x 0 0 z 0 6 h x r i g h t 0 x 0 3 0 z 0 6 where x left is outside the adjacent boundary of x 0 m and x right is inside the adjacent boundary of x 0 3 m 2 variable settings in the study two modes single and double hole and two hole diameters were tested for a total of 4 variables for simulation table 1 because of the small canopy of the plants at the time scale of 4days after planting plant transpiration aside from surface evaporation was not included in the model and the soil water content on the 4th day of the seedling stage was used for model comparison and verification after model validation the dynamics of soil moisture in each treatment within 24 h 1day were simulated and analyzed zheng et al 2018 obtained the relationship between the infiltration volume and the infiltration time under hole infiltration in laboratory experiments this curve is used to determine the infiltration time for a known infiltration volume 14 t i r r i 5 267 10 4 m 2 0 24306 m 3 62553 1440 where t i r r i is the irrigation time d and m is the irrigation water amount ml as shown in formula 9 2 2 3 model accuracy validation statistical indicators are used to accurately evaluate the fitting accuracy of the simulated values to the observed values the statistical indicators leisenring and moradkhani 2011 commonly used to evaluate fitting accuracy are the determination coefficient r 2 the root mean square error rmse the deviation bias the consistency index ia and others r 2 0 1 r m s e 0 b i a s 0 and i a 0 1 bias represents the ratio of the average error to the observed mean it is a relative index and is dimensionless unlike r 2 and ia rmse has the same dimension as the statistical object because the fitting value in this study is the soil moisture content and rmse is dimensionless 15 r 2 1 s e s e o b s 16 r m s e s e n 1 17 b i a s i 1 n θ o b s i θ s i m i i 1 n θ o b s i 18 i a 1 s e i 1 n θ s i m i θ

inverted parameters θ obs and θ s i m are the corresponding average moisture content and n is the number of samples all the above models were developed with c programming 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter estimation using the inversion program the soil parameters were obtained by running the richards equation coupled with the inversion program these obtained parameters were then compared with the soil moisture parameters fitted by forward modeling as shown in table 2 table 2 shows that the parameters obtained with the inversion program were similar to the results from forward modeling the relative errors of the inversion and fitting parameters k s α and n were 19 8 23 4 and 0 98 respectively formulas 2 and 3 indicate that the key to solving the richards equation is to obtain the soil water characteristic curve θ h θ and the hydraulic conductivity curve θ k θ n α and k s are the parameters used to describe these curves as shown in fig 4 the trends of the two curves were very similar and the inversion model was able to correctly obtain the soil water characteristic curve 3 2 model validation model evaluation must be performed to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation generated by the model the soil hydraulic parameters obtained by the parameter inversion and forward fitting method were used as the inputs for the model simulation and the simulated soil profile moisture content results from the two sets of parameters were compared with the measured values based on field experiments as shown in fig 5 in the 20 50 cm soil layer the simulated value from the inversion model was closer to the measured value the relative errors between the simulated and measured values of the inversion parameters k s θ r α and n in each soil layer were 0 56 1 55 3 14 and 5 13 respectively these values are lower than the average relative errors of the forward fitting parameters k s θ s α and n which were 1 87 2 86 4 50 and 3 42 respectively in general the lower the bias and rmse and the higher the r 2 and ia are the better the fitting effect the statistical indicators for the results of the models run with the different sets of parameters are given in table 3 compared with those obtained from the measured values the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves obtained with the parameter inversion model had higher fitting accuracy r 2 and ia were greater than 0 9 ia was greater than 0 97 and bias was greater than 0 03 these results indicate that the inversion parameter algorithm model was able to calculate the parameters correctly and that the optimized parameters reflected the hydraulic characteristics of the soil therefore these parameters can be used as input parameters for the mathematical simulation of soil water movement 3 3 effects of hole settings on soil water content the irrigation method is the main factor influencing soil water dynamics it directly affects the infiltration method and in turn affects the water content of the soil profile the results from the simulations of irrigation with different hole diameters and numbers are shown in figs 6 and 7 after 24 h of infiltration the soil profile water content near the roots of the plants showed some differences due to hole diameter the soil profile water content with a hole diameter of 7 cm was higher than that with a hole diameter of 5 cm from the surface to 50 cm soil depth the water content of each 10 cm profile layer after irrigation with two 7 cm diameter holes was 1 0 1 7 2 4 2 7 and 1 3 higher than that after irrigation with two 5 cm holes and 0 9 1 2 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 higher than that after irrigation with one 7 cm hole with the increase in the hole diameter the saturated area of soil at the bottom of the hole became larger during the irrigation period which was conducive to water infiltration the water content of the soil layer below the depth of the 7 cm hole 5 cm depth was higher than that of the soil layer below the depth of the 5 cm hole compared with irrigation with 5 cm diameter holes irrigation with 7 cm holes was more conducive to water infiltration into lower soil layers however in practical field applications the larger the diameter of the holes in the film on the ridges the larger the evaporation area is the simulation results show that from the surface to 50 cm soil depth the relative error of the soil moisture content in 10 cm soil layers with 5 cm and 7 cm diameter holes under single hole irrigation was 0 88 1 19 1 54 2 01 and 2 02 respectively and 0 99 1 66 2 44 2 69 and 1 35 under double hole irrigation the water content in the soil profile under 7 cm hole irrigation was not more than 2 7 higher than that under 5 cm hole irrigation and the difference due to the change in hole diameter was small fig 6 shows the water content distribution curve for the 0 60 cm soil profile in the plant root area after one day of irrigation and fig 7 shows the soil water distribution in the 0 60 cm soil profile of the entire planting area the water content of the soil profile under single hole irrigation t1 1 and t1 2 was significantly higher than that under double hole irrigation t2 1 and t2 2 with the 5 cm hole diameter the water content under single hole irrigation was 12 2 11 6 12 9 14 6 and 10 8 higher than that in each soil layer respectively under double hole irrigation and 12 1 11 1 11 9 13 9 and 11 5 higher than that with the 7 cm hole diameter this indicates that with the same source item the water content in the soil profile under single hole irrigation will be higher than that under double hole irrigation fig 3b shows that the periodic irrigation amount at the seedling stage increased the soil moisture content in the root zone soil profile according to the principle of water balance this result can be understood as follows water consumption transpiration evaporation irrigation amount because crop transpiration is related to the size of the canopy the larger the leaf area is the higher the transpiration wang et al 2012 moreover at the seedling stage the crop canopy is small and the plants consume little water therefore the main water losses can be attributed to evaporation the disadvantage of hole irrigation is that the film on the ridge is perforated to supply the water this exposes the ground through the holes resulting in an increase in the evaporation area therefore at the same irrigation amount the evaporation from a single hole system is less than that from a double hole system however the actual application of these techniques has shown that the single hole setting increases the irrigation time and increases the management costs for the same water supply amount 3 4 effects of hole settings on soil water dynamics fig 8 shows the movement of the soil water wetting front under the different hole number settings the infiltration times corresponding to 0 cm 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm from the roots of the plants were 172 8 min 345 6 min 518 4 min and 720 0 min respectively according to fig 8b when t 172 8 min the wetting peaks of the double hole irrigation began to converge and to infiltrate evenly however in terms of the water infiltration depth at t 172 8 min 345 6 min 518 4 min and 720 0 min the wetting front depths under single hole irrigation were 0 13 m 0 25 m 0 36 m and 0 40 m respectively and those under double hole irrigation were 0 13 m 0 20 m 0 24 m and 0 28 m the vertical infiltration distance of the single hole system was greater but the water content was unevenly distributed at a certain depth i e distributed mainly on the hole side of the ridge single hole irrigation concentrated the water on the irrigation side of the ridge and the irrigation time for the same irrigation amount under single hole irrigation was longer than that under double hole irrigation during the whole process of infiltration from the irrigation side to the plant side the wetting front also moves down therefore it takes a long time to evenly distribute the water throughout the whole plant growth unit however the vertical infiltration distance of the double hole system was lower than that of the single hole system under double hole irrigation the wetting fronts intersected and water infiltration began earlier but the vertical infiltration distance was shorter than that under single hole irrigation when the infiltration time was 172 8 min the wetting fronts of the double hole irrigation had intersected and begun to gradually infiltrate the soil this time period accounted for 6 of the entire irrigation cycle 2days in this paper the time required for this method to stimulate the crop root growth on both sides for water absorption is much shorter than the entire irrigation cycle the single hole method achieves a greater depth of water infiltration and the water is distributed on one side of the soil profile for a longer time than with the double hole method in practical applications to stimulate the growth of crop roots on both sides of the plant single holes with alternating irrigation can be used to supply water 4 conclusion in this work based on the richards equation and the parameter inversion method a model for hole irrigation with an h based form was established the model was verified with field scale data we focused on the performance of the model in describing the dynamics of soil water in the root zone of crops under irrigation systems with different hole sizes and numbers to provide theoretical guidance for the popularization and application of hole irrigation our conclusions are presented below 1 the values of soil hydraulic parameters k s α and n inverted by gauss newton methods reflected the soil hydraulic characteristics the h based richards equation based on the inversion parameter algorithm accurately simulated the soil moisture dynamics of hole irrigation and the r 2 and ia values for the models were higher than 0 9 2 the differences in the water content in the soil profile due to the change in the hole diameter were small the water content of the soil profile under single hole irrigation was higher than that under double hole irrigation which might be due to the lower evaporation through the single holes 3 double hole irrigation allowed the wetting fronts to intersect and the water to infiltrate evenly within a short time period however the vertical infiltration distance of the wetting front under single hole irrigation was greater than that under double hole irrigation and the water content under single hole irrigation was mainly distributed on the hole side of the ridge the vertical movement distance of the soil wetting front in the crop root zone under single hole irrigation is high and the soil water content is mainly distributed on the irrigation side of the ridge therefore alternating single hole irrigation can be used to stimulate crop roots to absorb water and then to stimulate root growth on both sides of the plant to improve nutrient absorption which is conducive to crop growth declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

measurements of t are expensive difficult destructive and time consuming therefore empirical physically based and machine learning models have been widely proposed to estimate t based on its driving variables 1 1 related work empirical and physically based models for estimating t mainly include the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 zheng et al 2020 shuttleworth wallace s w li et al 2013 chen et al 2020 modified jarvis stewart mjs whitley et al 2008 2013 li et al 2016a guyot et al 2017 and multiple linear regression mlr models jiang et al 2016 tu et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 however the applications of these mathematical models are still limited because their parameterization is very complex and need a large number of observation data what s more important estimating t is a complex regression process determined by many variables and it is thus difficult to establish empirical or physically based models representing the underlying processes as an alternative to traditional models machine learning models e g single layer artificial neural networks ann and support vector machines svm models have been proposed for actual et and t estimation across various vegetation types as they do not need the knowledge of internal factors and can provide easy solutions for nonlinear functions fan et al 2018 feng et al 2017 kisi 2015 kumar et al 2011 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2017 jiang et

the novel elm and anfis models could effectively complement the traditional ann and svm models granata et al 2020 evaluated the applicability of random forests rf additive regression of decision stump ards multilayer perceptron mlp and k nearest neighbors knn models for estimating et of wetlands in usa based on climatic variables it was found that rf and knn models slightly outperformed ards and mlp models liu et al 2009 estimated the sap flow of pyrus pyrifolia using ann and mlr models based on meteorological variables and soil water content swc they indicated that the estimation accuracy of the ann model was superior to that of the mlr model whitley et al 2009 estimated daily t of an australian native forest using the ann model and found it was better than pm and mjs models xu et al 2017 also applied ann model for estimating daily t of three desert shrubs which suggested the ann model produced more accurate daily t estimates than the mjs model and a simple process based model tu et al 2019 estimated the sap flow of pinus massoniana using the back propagation ann model by incorporating the phenological index and indicated that it exhibited higher estimation accuracy than models without the index chen et al 2020 partitioned daily et of cabbage using svm and rf models based meteorological variables swc leaf area index lai and plant height the rf model was recommended when sufficient data were available or only lack of soil and plant data while the svm model was preferred when only limited data were available or lack of critical air temperature and radiation data yamaç and todorovic 2020 estimated daily et of potato in southern italy using knn ann and adaptive boosting adaboost models under four input combinations of meteorological data the results indicated that the knn model produced the best et estimates under limited meteorological data conditions while the ann model produced slightly better et estimates when all variables were available feng et al 2017 estimated maize et on the china loess plateau of china using elm and generalized regression neural network grnn models based on meteorological variables lai and plant height they identified that elm and grnn models with both meteorological and crop data as inputs estimated maize et accurately tang et al 2018 estimated maize et using svm and genetic algorithm optimized ann gann models with climatic factors lai and plant height the results indicated that svm and gann models with both meteorological and maize growth inputs gave more accurate et estimates than those with only meteorological data recently advanced deep learning multi layer ann models as an extension of traditional ann models have gained much popularity and attention in imaging recognition audio classification autonomous driving and regression tasks which outperformed the svm or other models in many cases due to their capability of learning the most complex relations over the data using multiple hidden layers kaba et al 2018 chen et al 2019 chen et al 2020 have recently estimated et of irrigated maize using a deep learning model i e temporal convolution network tcn based on meteorological soil and crop factors it was found that the tcn model could estimate maize et with high accuracy 1 2 motivation and main contribution there have been several studies estimating the actual et of vegetables and crops or estimating the t component of et in forests and shrubs based on machine learning models but there is a lack of studies on estimating daily transpiration of crops such as maize using machine learning models particularly novel models like extreme gradient boosting xgboost and increasingly popular deep learning models like deep neural networks dnn have not been evaluated for maize transpiration estimation yet in addition the single and combined effects of meteorological soil and crop variables on daily maize t estimation are still not fully understood therefore the objectives of the present study were to 1 explore the effects various input combinations of meteorological soil and plant variables on daily maize t estimation in northwest china 2

randomized complete block design zheng et al 2020 the experiments were replicated three times with each plot of 15 m2 and 1 5 m apart summer maize was sowed at a planting density of 67 500 plants ha 1 60 cm 25 cm on 15 june 2015 12 june 2016 14 june 2017 and 17 june 2018 and harvested on 30 september 2015 4 october 2016 6 october 2017 and 1 october 2018 respectively urea n 46 180 kg n ha 1 superphosphate p2o5 16 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and potassium chloride k2o 51 60 kg k2o ha 1 was applied as basal fertilizers before sowing all plots received no irrigation and additional fertilizer during the whole growing seasons 2 2 environmental variables and maize transpiration measurement daily maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin relative humidity rh and wind speed u were recorded

intervals which was calibrated and validated periodically using the oven drying method maize growth is largely sensitive to soil water in the 0 50 cm soil layer because most maize fine roots are distributed within the soil layer soil water sensors were arranged at 10 20 30 and 50 cm below the soil surface the mean swc at each depth was calculated from two locations for flat cultivation row

the top 50 cm soil layer was used leaf area index lai was observed every 5 10 days during maize growing seasons three representative plants were randomly selected at each experimental plot and their total green leaf area was attained by summing leaf length multiplied by the maximal leaf width and multiplied by a converting factor of 0 75 mckee 1964 lai was then obtained by dividing the total

maize plants were chosen from each treatment and instrumented with gauges at the second internode of the stems for sap flow measurements from 1 july to harvest over the four growing seasons of 2015 2018 sap flow sensors were insulated using silica gel and covered by aluminum foil for reducing energy exchange with the surrounding air and preventing the entire system against rainfall uninstallation of gauges and reinstallation of gauges on other maize plants were performed every 10 15 days because continuous heating from the heater can cause plant dryness sf rates were obtained every 60 s and 30 min mean values were recorded in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa the measured sap flow rate was corrected using the calibration equation of wang et al 2017 the sap flow rate of individual maize plant was upscaled to stand transpiration t by multiplying the average daily sap flow rate for the three sample plants by average ground area of individual plant 2 3 machine learning models for estimating daily maize transpiration 2 3 1 support vector machines svm the kernel based svm model was established by cortes and vapnik 1995 which is a supervised soft computing algorithm minimizing estimation errors and model complexity at the same time vapnik 1999 chen et al 2013 benimam et al 2020a the svm model predicts the regressions on the basis of several kernel functions implicitly transforming the lower dimensional inputs to a higher dimensional feature space the regression functions in the svm model can be approximated below 1 f x ω φ x b where φ x

extreme gradient boosting xgboost the xgboost model was established by chen and guestrin 2016 which is a scalable machine learning system for tree boosting the xgboost model integrates several weak

networks ann and deep neural networks dnn the single hidden layer ann model simulates the biological brain which is the most broadly applied machine learning model for solving regression and classification problems in many fields whitley et al 2009 xu et al 2017 tu et al 2019 benimam et al 2020b the ann model consists three layers an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the input layer is linked to the hidden layer where the data are processed through weighted connections each neuron in the hidden layer interconnects to all neurons in the output layer the concept of deep learning an emerging field of machine learning was proposed by hinton et al 2006 among which the deep neural networks dnn model has become a fundamental but still powerful deep learning model in recent years montes atenas et al 2016 achieng 2019 unlike the single hidden layer ann model the dnn model usually has multiple hidden layers to learn more complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and output the rectified linear unit relu activation function is commonly employed by the neurons in each hidden layer for establishing inputs output relationships due to its better performance compared with other activation functions xu et al 2015 ghimire et al 2019 9 re l u s x x 0 0 x 0 the loss function in the dnn model is expressed as 10 l o s s 1 2 n i 1 n t i t i 2 where n is the number of observation data and t is the estimated value by the dnn model which can be defined below for a three hidden layer dnn model with the relu activation function 11 t i re l u ϖ 4 re l u ϖ 3 re

divided into three categories meteorological variables tmax tmin rh u and rs soil variable swc and crop variable lai to evaluate the effect of various variables on daily maize transpiration estimation four input combinations were considered in this study i e 1 tmax tmin rh u and rs 2 tmax tmin rh u rs and swc 3 tmax tmin rh u rs and lai and 4 tmax tmin rh u rs swc and lai table 1 the entire dataset during the four growing seasons of summer maize was randomly divided into two subsets 80 for model training 1190 pairs and the remaining 20 for model testing 298 pairs table 2 as seen in table 2 the differences between the input and out variables were minimal in the training and testing stages a five folder cross validation method was applied during training to prevent over fitting the raw input and output data were normalized between 0 and 1 using the maximum minimum normalization method to minimize the effect of absolute scales on the estimation accuracy of machine learning models fan et al 2018 svm and xgboost models were implemented using the r packages e1071 and xgboost while ann and dnn models were implemented using h2o by setting the number of hidden layers as one and three respectively the experimental data were stored at the local ends rather than outsourced to the semi trusted or malicious cloud for model training and testing so the dataset privacy model training and testing privacy were preserved in the present study chen et al 2020 the key parameters of svm xgboost ann and dnn models were identified by the trial and error approach and optimized by the grid search method deo et al 2017 dou and yang 2018 fan et al 2019 al fugara et al 2020 the gaussian radial basis function was used as the kernel function in svm models and the penalty parameter cost and kernel parameter gamma were optimized with them ranging from 0 1 to 1 5 at 0 1 intervals and from 0 1 to 1 5 at 0 1 intervals respectively the maximum depth of trees max depth learning rate eta maximum number of boosting iteration nrounds and subsample ratio of the training instance subsample in xgboost models were optimized with them ranging from 5 to 15 at 1 intervals from 0 1 to 1 0 at 0 1 intervals from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals and from 0 1 to 1 0 at 0 1 intervals respectively rectifier was taken as the activation function in ann and dnn models with one and three hidden layers respectively the number of neurons in the hidden layer nneurons and iteration epochs in ann models were optimized with nneurons and epochs ranging from 10 to 100 at 10 intervals and from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals respectively the number of neurons in the three hidden layers nneurons1 nneurons2 and nneurons3 and iteration epochs in dnn models were optimized with nneurons and epochs ranging from 50 to 350 at 50 intervals and from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals respectively additional parameters were taken as the default values in the r packages the optimized parameters of svm xgboost ann and dnn models under the four input combinations are given in table 3 2 5 model evaluation the performances of svm xgboost ann and dnn models in estimating daily maize transpiration were evaluated by four widely used statistical indicators i e coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 12 r 2 i 1 n t i m t i m t i e t i e 2 i 1

measured estimated average of measured and estimated maize transpiration and observation number respectively high values of r2 and nse closer to 1 and lower values of rmse and mae indicate good prediction accuracy of transpiration models 3 results and discussion 3 1 influences of various model input combinations on daily maize transpiration estimation the statistical results of svm xgboost ann and dnn models for estimating daily t of summer maize under the four input combinations during training and testing are presented in table 4 it was clear that the estimated t values differed among various input combinations and model types svm xgboost ann and dnn models with all meteorological tmax tmin rh u and rs soil swc and crop lai variables exhibited the best estimation accuracy during training r2 0 906 956 rmse 0 326 0 465 mm d 1 mae 0 191 0 356 mm d 1 and nse 0 941 0 976 and testing r2 0 913 0 954 rmse 0 344 0 482 d 1 mae 0 256 0 368 mm d 1 and nse 0 936 0 972 as compared to models with the incomplete inputs that s because transpiration is controlled by all atmospheric demand soil water availability as well as plant growth condition whitley et al 2008 2013 machine

0 941 during testing along with meteorological variables were also capable of estimating daily maize t with satisfactory accuracy however models with only meteorological variables gave the worst daily maize t estimates during training r2 0 725 0 836 rmse 0 569 0 712 mm d 1 mae 0 429 0 538 mm d 1 and nse 0 854 0 922 and testing r2 0 683 0 816 rmse 0 621 0 754 d 1 mae 0 445 0 545 mm d 1 and nse 0 840 0 902 the type of input variables exerted a significant role in the estimation accuracy of machine learning models for predicting daily maize t the performances of the three machine learning models improved by 9 0 14 6 22 3 25 2 and 34 7 43 7 in terms of rmse during training when swc lai and both of them were further incorporated respectively compared to models with only meteorological variables as inputs while the corresponding values were 10 1 13 1 15 7 23 8 and 36 1 46 2 during testing respectively these results indicated that lai was more important than swc in improving the accuracy of svm xgboost ann and dnn models for estimating daily maize t upon commonly used meteorological variables feng et al 2017 and tang et al 2018 have revealed that elm grnn svm and gann models fed with both climatic and crop lai and plant height variables gave more accurate maize et estimates than those with only meteorological data tu et al 2019 found that incorporating vegetation variable phenological index in the back propagation ann model exhibited higher estimation accuracy than models without it for estimating the sap flow of pinus massoniana all these results indicated that vegetation variables like lai are significant influencing factors for plant transpiration estimation however it was also found that incorporating swc data besides meteorological and lai data in svm xgboost ann and dnn models further improved the estimation accuracy of daily maize t in this study therefore both swc and lai are highly recommended to be included in machine learning models besides meteorological variables to obtain more accurate daily maize t estimates however chen et al 2020 found that the inclusion of swc in the tcn model did not improve the estimation accuracy of maize et this can be due to that soil water under plastic film mulch with adequate irrigation was optimal for maize growth in their study making it not an important factor limiting maize et however swc varied greatly over the growing seasons of rainfed maize in our study due to lack of timely irrigation and thus largely restricted the transpiration of maize plants this made swc to be a crucial variable for daily maize t estimation therefore swc and lai or at least one of them should be included in machine learning models for daily maize t estimation otherwise large errors may occur chen et al 2020 3 2 performance of svm xgboost ann and dnn models for daily maize transpiration estimation as shown in table 2 estimated daily maize t values also differed among svm xgboost ann and dnn models dnn models r2 0 836 0 956 rmse 0 326 0 569 mm d 1 mae 0 191 0 429 mm d 1 and nse 0 922 0 976 during training r2 0 816 954 rmse 0 344 0 621 d 1 mae 0 256 0 445 mm d 1 and nse 0 902 0 972 during testing slightly outperformed svm models r2 0 777 0 953 rmse 0 354 0 629 mm d 1 mae 0 267 0 476 mm d 1 and nse 0 898 0 970 during training r2 0 731 0 948 rmse 0 370 0 688 mm d 1 mae 0 286 0 500 mm d 1 and nse 0 880 0 967 during testing under various input combinations followed by xgboost models r2 0 746 0 931 rmse 0 403 0 687 mm d 1 mae 0 310 0 522 mm d 1 and nse 0 866 0 960 during training r2 0 739 0 929 rmse 0 455 0 721 mm d 1 mae 0 355 0 519 mm d 1 and nse 0 872 0 947 during testing and ann models r2 0 725 0 906 rmse 0 465 0 712 mm d 1 mae 0 356 0 538 mm d 1 and nse 0 854 0 941 during training r2 0 683 0 913 rmse 0 482 0 754 mm d 1 mae 0 368 0 545 mm d 1 and nse 0 840 0 936 during testing compared to ann model the estimation accuracy of dnn svm and xgboost models increased by 17 4 29 9 11 7 23 9 and 3 5 13 3 in terms of rmse under vaiours input combinations during training while the corresponding values were 17 6 28 6 8 8 23 2 and 2 1 5 6 respectively obviously the dnn model was more suitable for daily maize t estimation due to its advantage in modeling complex nonlinear relationships between t and its driving variables it was also found that the increase in estimation accuracy of dnn and svm models generally decreased as the number of input variables reduced which indicated that the two models were more useful when more complex relations between the multivariate inputs and output existed the scatter plots of daily maize t values estimated by svm xgboost ann and dnn models against their corresponding measured values under the four input combinations in the testing stage are given in figs 1 4 as seen in the figures machine learning models with complete input variables showed lower dispersion degree of data points as compared with models lack of swc or and lai besides dnn and svm models produced less scattered t estimates around the 1 1 line compared with xgboost and ann models under all the four input combinations to further explore the difference in the distribution of observed and estimated t values box plots of measured and estimated daily t by svm xgboost ann and dnn models under the four input combinations in the testing stage are presented in fig 5 clearly smaller distribution differences of observed and estimated t by dnn models were observed under various input combinations however larger distribution differences of observed and estimated t by xgboost and ann models were identified especially for all percentiles under the first two input combination and the lower fence under the other two input combinations in xgboost models and for the upper fence under the first two input combinations and the 25th percentile and upper fence under the other two input combinations in ann models it can be also seen from the figures that greater daily maize t values 6 mm d 1 were mostly underestimated by all the four models especially ann and xgboost models the frequency distribution of absoute errors between measured and estimated daily maize transpiration obtained by the three models under the four input combinations during testing are also illustrated in fig 6 obviously a lower frequency of large aboslute erros and a higher frequency of small aboslute erros were obtained by the dnn model for estimating daily maize t compared with the other two models especially under the complete input combination all those results confirmed the best estimation accuracy of the dnn model for estimating daily maize t followed by svm xgboost and ann models the best daily maize t was produced by the three layer dnn model as result of its capability of capturing arbitrarily complicated relations between t and its influencing variables through multiple hidden layers and neurons to progressively extract higher level features from the raw inputs kaba et al 2018 chen et al 2019 however highly complex dnn models may overfit the maize transpiration and produce poorly estimated values it was found in this study that the dnn model with three hidden layers was optimal for daily maize transpiration estimation results not shown here this indicated that the dnn model outperformed the ann model when a suitable hidden layer number was used achieng 2019 has also found that the dnn models with four and five hidden layers outperformed svm and single layer ann models for estimating soil moisture retention curves tang et al 2018 found that the gann model slightly outperformed the svm model for maize et estimation which can be attributed to the optimization capability of the genetic algorithm that prevented getting stuck in a local minimum and overtraining of the ann model although advanced deep leaning models e g convolutional neural network cnn and recurrent neural network rnn have been started for application in hydrological and agricultural fields kaba et al 2018 majhi et al 2019 ardabili et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 the cnn model is more efficient for image recognition and the rnn model is more useful for language processing and audio classification nevertheless the simpler deep learning model i e dnn model is more applicable for regression problems alom et al 2019 the xgboost model has been proved as a powerful model in classification applications and also computationally efficient but its estimation accuracy for regression problem seems worse than the svm model fan et al 2018 overall the dnn model was highly recommended for daily maize t estimation due to its advantage in modeling high order complex relationships between t and its driving variables through multiple levels of feature abstraction especially when swc or and lai were incorporated as model inputs 4 conclusions the estimation accuracy of svm xgboost ann and dnn models improved by 10 1 13 2 15 6 24 0 and 36 1 46 2 in terms of rmse during testing when swc lai and both of them were further incorporated compared to models with only meteorological variables dnn models slightly outperformed svm models under various input combinations during testing both of which were superior to xgboost models compared to the ann model the estimation accuracy of dnn svm and xgboost models increased by 17 6 28 6 8 8 23 2 and 2 1 5 6 in terms of rmse under vaiours input combinations during testing the incorporation of swc or and lai in machine learning models is highly recommended for accurate daily maize t estimation the dnn model is more suitable for daily maize t estimation due to its advantage in modeling complex nonlinear relationships between t and its driving variables these findings can contribute to accurate estimation of maize transpiration and thus improve our understanding of the hydrological process in agricultural ecosystems however other advanced machine learning models such as multi view clustering fu et al 2020 and long short term memory somu et al 2020 models may be further tested for daily maize transpiration estimation besides the parameters of svm xgboost ann and dnn models were optimized by the simple grid

evapotranspiration et consists of non productive soil evaporation e and productive plant transpiration t accurate measurement or estimation of et especially its t component is of great significance for understanding crop water use and predicting crop yields in agricultural production chen et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 plant transpiration is closely related to both environmental and biophysical processes at the soil crop atmosphere interface e g meteorological drivers soil factors and crop growth conditions plant transpiration can be directly measured by heat balance based sap flow sensors bethenod et al 2000 jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 fan et al 2018a baiamonte and motisi 2020 and gas exchange chambers dragoni et al 2005 ferraz et al 2015 song et al 2016 nevertheless direct measurements of t are expensive difficult destructive and time consuming therefore empirical physically based and machine learning models have been widely proposed to estimate t based on its driving variables 1 1 related work empirical and physically based models for estimating t mainly include the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 zheng et al 2020 shuttleworth wallace s w li et al 2013 chen et al 2020 modified jarvis stewart mjs whitley et al 2008 2013 li et al 2016a guyot et al 2017 and multiple linear regression mlr models jiang et al 2016 tu et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 however the applications of these mathematical models are still limited because their parameterization is very complex and need a large number of observation data what s more important estimating t is a complex regression process determined by many variables and it is thus difficult to establish empirical or physically based models representing the underlying processes as an alternative to traditional models machine learning models e g single layer artificial neural networks ann and support vector machines svm models have been proposed for actual et and t estimation across various vegetation types as they do not need the knowledge of internal factors and can provide easy solutions for nonlinear functions fan et al 2018 feng et al 2017 kisi 2015 kumar et al 2011 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 dou and yang 2018 estimated et of four terrestrial ecosystems using ann svm extreme learning machines elm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis models and found that the novel elm and anfis models could effectively complement the traditional ann and svm models granata et al 2020 evaluated the applicability of random forests rf additive regression of decision stump ards multilayer perceptron mlp and k nearest neighbors knn models for estimating et of wetlands in usa based on climatic variables it was found that rf and knn models slightly outperformed ards and mlp models liu et al 2009 estimated the sap flow of pyrus pyrifolia using ann and mlr models based on meteorological variables and soil water content swc they indicated that the estimation accuracy of the ann model was superior to that of the mlr model whitley et al 2009 estimated daily t of an australian native forest using the ann model and found it was better than pm and mjs models xu et al 2017 also applied ann model for estimating daily t of three desert shrubs which suggested the ann model produced more accurate daily t estimates than the mjs model and a simple process based model tu et al 2019 estimated the sap flow of pinus massoniana using the back propagation ann model by incorporating the phenological index and indicated that it exhibited higher estimation accuracy than models without the index chen et al 2020 partitioned daily et of cabbage using svm and rf models based meteorological variables swc leaf area index lai and plant height the rf model was recommended when sufficient data were available or only lack of soil and plant data while the svm model was preferred when only limited data were available or lack of critical air temperature and radiation data yamaç and todorovic 2020 estimated daily et of potato in southern italy using knn ann and adaptive boosting adaboost models under four input combinations of meteorological data the results indicated that the knn model produced the best et estimates under limited meteorological data conditions while the ann model produced slightly better et estimates when all variables were available feng et al 2017 estimated maize et on the china loess plateau of china using elm and generalized regression neural network grnn models based on meteorological variables lai and plant height they identified that elm and grnn models with both meteorological and crop data as inputs estimated maize et accurately tang et al 2018 estimated maize et using svm and genetic algorithm optimized ann gann models with climatic factors lai and plant height the results indicated that svm and gann models with both meteorological and maize growth inputs gave more accurate et estimates than those with only meteorological data recently advanced deep learning multi layer ann models as an extension of traditional ann models have gained much popularity and attention in imaging recognition audio classification autonomous driving and regression tasks which outperformed the svm or other models in many cases due to their capability of learning the most complex relations over the data using multiple hidden layers kaba et al 2018 chen et al 2019 chen et al 2020 have recently estimated et of irrigated maize using a deep learning model i e temporal convolution network tcn based on meteorological soil and crop factors it was found that the tcn model could estimate maize et with high accuracy 1 2 motivation and main contribution there have been several studies estimating the actual et of vegetables and crops or estimating the t component of et in forests and shrubs based on machine learning models but there is a lack of studies on estimating daily transpiration of crops such as maize using machine learning models particularly novel models like extreme gradient boosting xgboost and increasingly popular deep learning models like deep neural networks dnn have not been evaluated for maize transpiration estimation yet in addition the single and combined effects of meteorological soil and crop variables on daily maize t estimation are still not fully understood therefore the objectives of the present study were to 1 explore the effects various input combinations of meteorological soil and plant variables on daily maize t estimation in northwest china 2 evaluate the applicability of a traditional svm model a novel xgboost model a single layer ann model and a fundamental deep learning model i e dnn model for estimating daily maize t under various

randomized complete block design zheng et al 2020 the experiments were replicated three times with each plot of 15 m2 and 1 5 m apart summer maize was sowed at a planting density of 67 500 plants ha 1 60 cm 25 cm on 15 june 2015 12 june 2016 14 june 2017 and 17 june 2018 and harvested on 30 september 2015 4 october 2016 6 october 2017 and 1 october 2018 respectively urea n 46 180 kg n ha 1 superphosphate p2o5 16 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and potassium chloride k2o 51 60 kg k2o ha 1 was applied as basal fertilizers before sowing all plots received no irrigation and additional fertilizer during the whole growing seasons 2 2 environmental variables and maize transpiration measurement daily maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin relative humidity rh and wind speed u were recorded by the yangling national meteorological observing station situated 30 m away from our experimental plots which were recorded at hourly intervals global solar radiation rs was acquired every hour with the bowen ratio energy balance system breb campbell scientific inc usa at a distance of 100 m soil water content swc was monitored by soil water sensors ech2o 5te decagon devices usa at 15 min intervals which was calibrated and validated periodically using the oven drying method maize growth is largely sensitive to soil water in the 0 50 cm soil layer because most maize fine roots are distributed within the soil layer soil water sensors were arranged at 10 20 30 and 50 cm below the soil surface the mean swc at each depth was calculated from two locations for flat cultivation row and interrow and three positions for cultivation with ridge and furrow middle of ridge middle of furrow and side of ridge for data analysis presented in the present study average soil water content in the top 50 cm soil layer was used leaf area index lai was observed every 5 10 days during maize growing seasons three representative plants were randomly selected at each experimental plot and their total green leaf area was attained by summing leaf length multiplied by the maximal leaf width and multiplied by a converting factor of 0 75 mckee 1964 lai was then obtained by dividing the total green leaf area of each plant by the soil surface available for each plant continuous daily lai values were determined through nonlinear fitting between observed lai and the day after sowing das lai a dasb exp 0 077 das where a and b are fitting coefficients ding et al 2013 sap flow rates of maize plants were monitored using heat based sap flow sensors dynamax houston tx usa three representative maize plants were chosen from each treatment and instrumented with gauges at the second internode of the stems for sap flow measurements from 1 july to harvest over the four growing seasons of 2015 2018 sap flow sensors were insulated using silica gel and covered by aluminum foil for reducing energy exchange with the surrounding air and preventing the entire system against rainfall uninstallation of gauges and reinstallation of gauges on other maize plants were performed every 10 15 days because continuous heating from the heater can cause plant dryness sf rates were obtained every 60 s and 30 min mean values were recorded in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa the measured sap flow rate was corrected using the calibration equation of wang et al 2017 the sap flow rate of individual maize plant was upscaled to stand transpiration t by multiplying the average daily sap flow rate for the three sample plants by average ground area of individual plant 2 3 machine learning models for estimating daily maize transpiration 2 3 1 support vector machines svm the kernel based svm model was established by cortes and vapnik 1995 which is a supervised soft computing algorithm minimizing estimation errors and model complexity at the same time vapnik 1999 chen et al 2013 benimam et al 2020a the svm model predicts the regressions on the basis of several kernel functions implicitly transforming the lower dimensional inputs to a higher dimensional feature space the regression functions in the svm model can be approximated below 1 f x ω φ x b where φ x is the high dimensional feature space transformed from the input vector x ω is the weighting vector and b is a bias and the regularized risk function below is minimized to determine the two parameters

extreme gradient boosting xgboost the xgboost model was established by chen and guestrin 2016 which is a scalable machine learning system for tree boosting the xgboost model integrates several weak

networks ann and deep neural networks dnn the single hidden layer ann model simulates the biological brain which is the most broadly applied machine learning model for solving regression and classification problems in many fields whitley et al 2009 xu et al 2017 tu et al 2019 benimam et al 2020b the ann model consists three layers an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the input layer is linked to the hidden layer where the data are processed through weighted connections each neuron in the hidden layer interconnects to all neurons in the output layer the concept of deep learning an emerging field of machine learning was proposed by hinton et al 2006 among which the deep neural networks dnn model has become a fundamental but still powerful deep learning model in recent years montes atenas et al 2016 achieng 2019 unlike the single hidden layer ann model the dnn model usually has multiple hidden layers to learn more complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and output the rectified linear unit relu activation function is commonly employed by the neurons in each hidden layer for establishing inputs output relationships due to its better performance compared with other activation functions xu et al 2015 ghimire et al 2019 9 re l u s x x 0 0 x 0 the loss function in the dnn model is expressed as 10 l o s s 1 2 n i 1 n t i t i 2 where n is the

divided into three categories meteorological variables tmax tmin rh u and rs soil variable swc and crop variable lai to evaluate the effect of various variables on daily maize transpiration estimation four input combinations were considered in this study i e 1 tmax tmin rh u and rs 2 tmax tmin rh u rs and swc 3 tmax tmin rh u rs and lai and 4 tmax tmin rh u rs swc and lai table 1 the entire dataset during the four growing seasons of summer maize was randomly divided into two subsets 80 for model training 1190 pairs and the remaining 20 for model testing 298 pairs table 2 as seen in table 2 the differences between the input and out variables were minimal in the training and testing stages a five folder cross validation method was applied during training to prevent over fitting the raw input and output data were normalized between 0 and 1 using the maximum minimum normalization method to minimize the effect of absolute scales on the estimation accuracy of machine learning models fan et al 2018 svm and xgboost models were implemented using the r packages e1071 and xgboost while ann and dnn models were implemented using h2o by setting the number of hidden layers as one and three respectively the experimental data were stored at the local ends rather than outsourced to the semi trusted or malicious cloud for model training and testing so the dataset privacy model training and testing privacy were preserved in the present study chen et al 2020 the key parameters of svm xgboost ann and dnn models were identified by the trial and error approach and optimized by the grid search method deo et al 2017 dou and yang 2018 fan et al 2019 al fugara et al 2020 the gaussian radial basis function was used as the kernel function in svm models and the penalty parameter cost and kernel parameter gamma were optimized with them ranging from 0 1 to 1 5 at 0 1 intervals and from 0 1 to 1 5 at 0 1 intervals respectively the maximum depth of trees max depth learning rate eta maximum number of boosting iteration nrounds and subsample ratio of the training instance subsample in xgboost models were optimized with them ranging from 5 to 15 at 1 intervals from 0 1 to 1 0 at 0 1 intervals from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals and from 0 1 to 1 0 at 0 1 intervals respectively rectifier was taken as the activation function in ann and dnn models with one and three hidden layers respectively the number of neurons in the hidden layer nneurons and iteration epochs in ann models were optimized with nneurons and epochs ranging from 10 to 100 at 10 intervals and from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals respectively the number of neurons in the three hidden layers nneurons1 nneurons2 and nneurons3 and iteration epochs in dnn models were optimized with nneurons and epochs ranging from 50 to 350 at 50 intervals and from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals respectively additional parameters were taken as the default values in the r packages the optimized parameters of svm xgboost ann and dnn models under the four input combinations are given in table 3 2 5 model evaluation the performances of svm xgboost ann and dnn models in estimating daily maize transpiration were evaluated by four widely used statistical indicators i e coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 12 r 2 i 1 n t i m t i m t i e t i e 2 i 1

measured estimated average of measured and estimated maize transpiration and observation number respectively high values of r2 and nse closer to 1 and lower values of rmse and mae indicate good prediction accuracy of transpiration models 3 results and discussion 3 1 influences of various model input combinations on daily maize transpiration estimation the statistical results of svm xgboost ann and dnn models for estimating daily t of summer maize under the four input combinations during training and testing are presented in table 4 it was clear that the estimated t values differed among various input combinations and model types svm xgboost ann and dnn models with all meteorological tmax tmin rh u and rs soil swc and crop lai variables exhibited the best estimation accuracy during training r2 0 906 956 rmse 0 326 0 465 mm d 1 mae 0 191 0 356 mm d 1 and nse 0 941 0 976 and testing r2 0 913 0 954 rmse 0 344 0 482 d 1 mae 0 256 0 368 mm d 1 and nse 0 936 0 972 as compared to

0 941 during testing along with meteorological variables were also capable of estimating daily maize t with satisfactory accuracy however models with only meteorological variables gave the worst daily maize t estimates during training r2 0 725 0 836 rmse 0 569 0 712 mm d 1 mae 0 429 0 538 mm d 1 and nse 0 854 0 922 and testing r2 0 683 0 816 rmse 0 621 0 754 d 1 mae 0 445 0 545 mm d 1 and nse 0 840 0 902 the type of input variables exerted a significant role in the estimation accuracy of machine learning models for predicting daily maize t the performances of the three machine learning models improved by 9 0 14 6 22 3 25 2 and 34 7 43 7 in terms of rmse during training when swc lai and both of them were further incorporated respectively compared to models with only meteorological variables as inputs while the corresponding values were 10 1 13 1 15 7 23 8 and 36 1 46 2 during testing respectively these results indicated that lai was more important than swc in improving the accuracy of svm xgboost ann and dnn models for estimating daily maize t upon commonly used meteorological variables feng et al 2017 and tang et al 2018 have revealed that elm grnn svm and gann models fed with both climatic and crop lai and plant height variables gave more accurate maize et estimates than those with only meteorological data tu et al 2019 found that incorporating vegetation variable phenological index in the back propagation ann model exhibited higher estimation accuracy than models without it for estimating the sap flow of pinus massoniana all these results indicated that vegetation variables like lai are significant influencing factors for plant transpiration estimation however it was also found that incorporating swc data besides meteorological and lai data in svm xgboost ann and dnn models further improved the estimation accuracy of daily maize t in this study therefore both swc and lai are highly recommended to be included in machine learning models besides meteorological variables to obtain more accurate daily maize t estimates however chen et al 2020 found that the inclusion of swc in the tcn model did not improve the estimation accuracy of maize et this can be due to that soil water under plastic film mulch with adequate irrigation was optimal for maize growth in their study making it not an important factor limiting maize et however swc varied greatly over the growing seasons of rainfed maize in our study due to lack of timely irrigation and thus largely restricted the transpiration of maize plants this made swc to be a crucial variable for daily maize t estimation therefore swc and lai or at least one of them should be included in machine learning models for daily maize t estimation otherwise large errors may occur chen et al 2020 3 2 performance of svm xgboost ann and dnn models for daily maize transpiration estimation as shown in table 2 estimated daily maize t values also differed among svm xgboost ann and dnn models dnn models r2 0 836 0 956 rmse 0 326 0 569 mm d 1 mae 0 191 0 429 mm d 1 and nse 0 922 0 976 during training r2 0 816 954 rmse 0 344 0 621 d 1 mae 0 256 0 445 mm d 1 and nse 0 902 0 972 during testing slightly outperformed svm models r2 0 777 0 953 rmse 0 354 0 629 mm d 1 mae 0 267 0 476 mm d 1 and nse 0 898 0 970 during training r2 0 731 0 948 rmse 0 370 0 688 mm d 1 mae 0 286 0 500 mm d 1 and nse 0 880 0 967 during testing under various input combinations followed by xgboost models r2 0 746 0 931 rmse 0 403 0 687 mm d 1 mae 0 310 0 522 mm d 1 and nse 0 866 0 960 during training r2 0 739 0 929 rmse 0 455 0 721 mm d 1 mae 0 355 0 519 mm d 1 and nse 0 872 0 947 during testing and ann models r2 0 725 0 906 rmse 0 465 0 712 mm d 1 mae 0 356 0 538 mm d 1 and nse 0 854 0 941 during training r2 0 683 0 913 rmse 0 482 0 754 mm d 1 mae 0 368 0 545 mm d 1 and nse 0 840 0 936 during testing compared to ann model the estimation accuracy of dnn svm and xgboost models increased by 17 4 29 9 11 7 23 9 and 3 5 13 3 in terms of rmse under vaiours input combinations during training while the corresponding values were 17 6 28 6 8 8 23 2 and 2 1 5 6 respectively obviously the dnn model was more suitable for daily maize t estimation due to its advantage in modeling complex nonlinear relationships between t and its driving variables it was also found that the increase in estimation accuracy of dnn and svm models generally decreased as the number of input variables reduced which indicated that the two models were more useful when more complex relations between the multivariate inputs and output existed the scatter plots of daily maize t values estimated by svm xgboost ann and dnn models against their corresponding measured values under the four input combinations in the testing stage are given in figs 1 4 as seen in the figures machine learning models with complete input variables showed lower dispersion degree of data points as compared with models lack of swc or and lai besides dnn and svm models produced less scattered t estimates around the 1 1 line compared with xgboost and ann models under all the four input combinations to further explore the difference in the distribution of observed and estimated t values box plots of measured and estimated daily t by svm xgboost ann and dnn models under the four input combinations in the testing stage are presented in fig 5 clearly smaller distribution differences of observed and estimated t by dnn models were observed under various input combinations however larger distribution differences of observed and estimated t by xgboost and ann models were identified especially for all percentiles under the first two input combination and the lower fence under the other two input combinations in xgboost models and for the upper fence under the first two input combinations and the 25th percentile and upper fence under the other two input combinations in ann models it can be also seen from the figures that greater daily maize t values 6 mm d 1 were mostly underestimated by all the four models especially ann and xgboost models the frequency distribution of absoute errors between measured and estimated daily maize transpiration obtained by the three models under the four input combinations during testing are also illustrated in fig 6 obviously a lower frequency of large aboslute erros and a higher frequency of small aboslute erros were obtained by the dnn model for estimating daily maize t compared with the other two models especially under the complete input combination all those results confirmed the best estimation accuracy of the dnn model for estimating daily maize t followed by svm xgboost and ann models the best daily maize t was produced by the three layer dnn model as result of its capability of capturing arbitrarily complicated relations between t and its influencing variables through multiple hidden layers and neurons to progressively extract higher level features from the raw inputs kaba et al 2018 chen et al 2019 however highly complex dnn models may overfit the maize transpiration and produce poorly estimated values it was found in this study that the dnn model with three hidden layers was optimal for daily maize transpiration estimation results not shown here this indicated that the dnn model outperformed the ann model when a suitable hidden layer number was used achieng 2019 has also found that the dnn models with four and five hidden layers outperformed svm and single layer ann models for estimating soil moisture retention curves tang et al 2018 found that the gann model slightly outperformed the svm model for maize et estimation which can be attributed to the optimization capability of the genetic algorithm that prevented getting stuck in a local minimum and overtraining of the ann model although advanced deep leaning models e g convolutional neural network cnn and recurrent neural network rnn have been started for application in hydrological and agricultural fields kaba et al 2018 majhi et al 2019 ardabili et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 the cnn model is more efficient for image recognition and the rnn model is more useful for language processing and audio classification nevertheless the simpler deep learning model i e dnn model is more applicable for regression problems alom et al 2019 the xgboost model has been proved as a powerful model in classification applications and also computationally efficient but its estimation accuracy for regression problem seems worse than the svm model fan et al 2018 overall the dnn model was highly recommended for daily maize t estimation due to its advantage in modeling high order complex relationships between t and its driving variables through multiple levels of feature abstraction especially when swc or and lai were incorporated as model inputs 4 conclusions the estimation accuracy of svm xgboost ann and dnn models improved by 10 1 13 2 15 6 24 0 and 36 1 46 2 in terms of rmse during testing when swc lai and both of them were further incorporated compared to models with only meteorological variables dnn models slightly outperformed svm models under various input combinations during testing both of which were superior to xgboost models compared to the ann model the estimation accuracy of dnn svm and xgboost models increased by 17 6 28 6 8 8 23 2 and 2 1 5 6 in terms of rmse under vaiours input combinations during testing the incorporation of swc or and lai in machine learning models is highly recommended for accurate daily maize t estimation the dnn model is more suitable for daily maize t estimation due to its advantage in modeling complex nonlinear relationships between t and its driving variables these findings can contribute to accurate estimation of maize transpiration and thus improve our understanding of the hydrological process in agricultural ecosystems however other advanced machine learning models such as multi view clustering fu et al 2020 and long short term memory somu et al 2020 models may be further tested for daily maize transpiration estimation besides the parameters of svm xgboost ann and dnn models were optimized by the simple grid search method in this study and the hybridization of these models with bio inspired optimization algorithms e g the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm yi et al 2020 whale optimization algorithm amirjalili and lewis 2016 and flower pollination algorithm wu et al 2019 needs to be further explored for estimation accuracy enhancement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

10259,water pricing and reducing the costs of the implementation and maintenance of irrigation systems have been a challenging topic for a long time water pricing issues combine two complex dimensions the first dimension is the economy of the farm and its association with the broader economic system and farming practices the second dimension is the hydrology and interconnection of the plot with the irrigation system the river basin and the underlying water policy framework accordingly this study aimed to investigate how the institutionalization of water applied would affect water productivity through the implementation of a water pricing policy to this end this study formulated a positive mathematical programming pmp model with a gross margin maximizing objective function to assess the data collected from 213 farms in hamadan bahar plain iran the results revealed that a water pricing policy can change the cropping pattern and also irrigation system within the limitations of the case study it can also be a driver to motivate farmers to use a modern and more efficient irrigation system the potential environmental benefits from the improved on farm irrigation efficiency depend on the government s ability to prevent the extension of the irrigated area in absence of such controls the aquifer depletion will be accelerated therefore an appropriate water pricing policy could improve water productivity and also reduce water applied keywords water management water applied positive mathematical programming cropping pattern irrigation systems sustainability 1 introduction in semi arid and arid regions efficient water management is one of the key drivers in successful agricultural production as many of these regions rely on slowly replenishing groundwater resources for supplying their water demands water demand must be adjusted and institutionalized to guarantee the long term stability of the socio ecological system perry 2007 al rubaye 2018 to assess water demand various corporate state or community led infrastructure networks have their temporary phases of institutionalization to continue operating within or outside their technological ambitions putri 2016 consequently the institutionalization of water applied requires representation and negotiated decision making to increase opportunities for community involvement jacob and bernard 2013 yet in regions where no proper institutions are in place coupled with inefficient irrigation technologies and a focus on crops with high water demand fast groundwater depletion is a serious risk garrido and calatrava 2010 al rubaye and al ezzy 2018 an example of such regions is hamadan bahar plain in northwestern iran fig 1 shows the location of this plain the region serves a strong agricultural sector producing mainly alfalfa maize and rape often for export the dominant irrigation system is furrow irrigation a form of surface irrigation which causes high evaporation and loss of runoff therefore the region shows very low water productivity i e the efficiency of water applied as the input in relation to the products as the output the water used for irrigation originates almost entirely from groundwater wells while most of these wells are formally registered and licensed the withdrawal of water is neither measured nor institutionally restricted the current price of irrigation water in the study area is zero balali et al 2011 however farmers still need to pay the extraction costs due to the water crisis in iran the region is considered as a restricted plain in which the agricultural land extension is not allowed moreover the height of the water table is more than 60 m deep on average and even deeper than 100 m in some regions regional water company of hamedan 2017 therefore return flows may not be able to recharge the aquifer or the impact is not considerable in our analysis we present water productivity indices at zero water price which is referred to the current water productivity i e status quo table 1 to highlight other examples on water productivity in the case study seyedan and ghadimi 2019 and mozaffari 2020 calculated water productivity for different crops and different irrigation systems if the charged fees do not cover the irrigation costs sustainability can be jeopardized without ongoing government subsidies al rubaye 2018 based on the allocation law of water equity it is requested to calculate the water tariff by the quantity and quality of consumption in urban rural industrial and other areas tahamipour et al 2014 nabavi 2017 moreover water charges can be a financial instrument for recovering all or part of capital and recurring costs national development reports in iran focus on calculating the costs of building dams and water supply facilities and assessing irrigation water economically as an input to choose the best water sales tariffs for water supply costs in future years tahamipour et al 2014 water charging or disposal is not the ultimate objective however it is a tool for achieving one or more policy goals soto et al 2018 in a way that to save water and increase its productivity the water price can be considered as an economic tool water pricing was selected as a tool to decrease water demand world bank 2003 this is expected that water pricing policies inculcate protection and stimulate a movement to higher value crops venot and molle 2008 this price policy can encourage farmers to invest in technology with the probability of increasing income rather than incurring higher costs expósito and berbel 2016 farmers facing higher water prices might desire to intensify their production changes motivated by high water prices would therefore likely involve technological change and changes in crop patterns and lead to higher productivity of water molle et al 2008 water pricing policies are among various measures designed to improve the productivity and efficient use of water resources renzetti 2000 from the correct assumption that low water prices provide a limited incentive to improve productivity it can be seen that rising prices will improve productivity automatically and should be a prime objective for implementing improvements molle et al 2008 from the right assumption that low water prices provide limited incentives to improve productivity it can be seen that raising prices will automatically improve productivity and should be a prime target for implementing improvements molle et al 2008 improving water productivity is among the top priorities for policymakers in the agricultural sector madani 2014 boazar et al 2019 the economic role of water can be developed by pricing policies ehsani et al 2012 asaadi et al 2019 literature demonstrates that many countries are engaged in such pricing policies dinar 2015 for example shi et al 2014 used a bioeconomic model to analyze the shadow price of water resources and investigate the reaction of farmers to water pricing policies in northwestern china s heihe river basin their findings suggest that farmers in most irrigation zones were not very sensitive to changes in water price since it was well below the shadow price of water supplies a reduction in the demand for agricultural water could only take place with a large increase in the water price galioto et al 2017 investigated the expected impact of changes in pricing policies applied to the use of water resources recently experienced in an agricultural area located in northern italy the results highlight that the change in pricing criteria would not cause substantial variations in water uses this was mainly due to the inelastic demand for water in agriculture water pricing represents a key issue both for developing and developed countries galioto et al 2017 nevertheless outcomes from previous studies comparing the performance of water pricing policies among different countries confirm that there is no best practice that can be suggested to one country iglesias and blanco 2008 the reason is that optimal prices rely on the objectives of the water agency as well as on the types of information available to it galioto et al 2017 in water demand management and its optimal allocation pricing policies play an important role iglesias and blanco 2008 asaadi et al 2019 the determination of an appropriate water price leads to an optimal allocation of water only if there is a process such as a market to facilitate water reallocation from lower to higher value uses particularly in agricultural consumption singh 2016 the application of new subsidy legislation in iran that insists on pricing water on the basis of its supply costs will have a significant impact on the management of water resources in the country s agricultural sector nabavi 2017 tahamipour et al 2014 positive mathematical programming pmp is particularly useful in situations where there are only short time series data available such as in sectoral analyses of developing countries e g iran and environmental economic analyses e g water scarcities hashemy shahdany et al 2017 the pmp is a policy oriented approach to formulate policy recommendations kahil et al 2016 therefore given the growing problems with the water sector in most parts of iran and the need for correcting water prices madani et al 2016 pmp will help policymakers resolve the water issue and improve the productivity of water resources we need a model to simulate the dynamics of water productivity and water pricing policy due to data limitations mathematical programming based models including normative and positive models are considered as appropriate options as discussed earlier positive mathematical programming allows us to calibrate the model according to the base year therefore this model is generally suitable for the current study analysis so far different pmp type models have been applied in the literature graveline 2016 these models are calibrated based on either a non linear yield function or a non linear cost function our model is based on non linear yield function which allows us to capture the changes in yield in response to water pricing gómez limón et al 2016 lee et al 2019 the current study can contribute to both thematic and methodological aspects as follows i focusing on the thematic aspect institutionalization of water applied has been considered in this study the institutionalization of water applied would affect water productivity by using a water pricing tool according to high water applied in arid and semi arid regions the contribution of institutionalized water to improving water productivity is significant in these areas ii focusing on the methodological aspect this study applied the positive mathematical programming pmp method to analyze water pricing policies implementations using this innovative approach of the pmp the methodology can contribute to improving productivity by applying an appropriate pricing scenario moreover the current study aims at i the assessment of current water management strategies with regard to water pricing scenarios in hamadan bahar basin considering the site of the study it should be noted that the hamadan bahar basin climate is semi arid with mean annual precipitation of 324 5 mm and average annual temperature of 11 3 c groundwater is the only source of drinking water available in the region and is widely used by rural and urban communities especially for irrigation balali and viaggi 2015 talebmorad et al 2018 ii the identification of low water cultivation

of iran s territory is located in arid and semi arid regions and is currently facing a severe water crisis gorjian and ghobadian 2015 by 2021 the country s total annual renewable water per capita is projected to reach only about 800 m3 gorjian and ghobadian 2015 in this context seawater desalination has been seen as a possible solution and has been used for a long time however it is argued that this method is no longer feasible and sustainable since it depends on fossil fuels in iran the main freshwater consumer is the agricultural sector 90 93 compared to the domestic and hygiene sector 5 6 and the industrial sector 1 yazdanpanah et al 2014 however since the beginning of 1990 water has become very scarce in iran according to yazdanpanah et al 2014 the water crises have been exacerbated by severe droughts which have affected nearly all sectors in iran leading to large economic losses the collapse of water bodies and relocation of numerous villages 2 2 water productivity in the iranian context water constraints can be more perceptible in agriculture than in industry faramarzi et al 2010 to address current sustainability needs water productivity of agriculture becomes an important index to assess the effect of saving water and irrigation water management kijne et al 2003 developed an approach according to which the productivity of crop water should be assessed in terms of both kilograms of crops per cubic meter of water applied kg m3 and the net or gross value of crops produced per cubic meter of water in general water productivity includes total precipitation the higher utilization ratio of precipitation higher water productivity and at the same time the higher repetitive utilization ratio of water in a region there are a number of researchers faramarzi et al 2010 kijne et al 2003 perry 2007 xu et al 2010 who have summarized the factors affecting water productivity these factors are crop variety irrigation water applied irrigation technique carbon remobilization grain filling rate soil texture soil nutrient and agronomic management there are generally two distinct perspectives regarding water productivity in the agronomy literature see e g molden 1997 perry 2007 it is mainly emphasized on the technical aspects of irrigation water efficiency with a focus on the water consumed by a single crop although this concept could provide precise information on the water used by each crop individually it ignores the interaction between different crops at farm level from an economic perspective it is crucial to find how efficient farmers distribute water between different crops to achieve their productivity at farm level considering their water applied based on the above mentioned studies the main aim of the current study is to find out whether the government can encourage farmers to achieve higher water productivity through the implementation of a water pricing policy 2 3 water pricing policy water used for irrigation shall be managed as an economic commodity that has immense social and environmental values it may be quantified through basic resource availability to ensure sustainable harvesting banihabib et al 2016 habibi davijani et al 2016 water pricing objectives go beyond economic efficiency including sustainability and equity among many other goals al saidi and dehnavi 2019 water prices should also be transparent legitimate easy to administer fair etc rogers et al 2002 the water pricing policy is a major water managing topic to be discussed in countries that are faced with the problem of water scarcity and have a clear understanding that water is a kind of strategical resource with a significant influence on sustainable ecological development which should be allocated reasonably and effectively a way to reduce water demand is to adopt transparent and clear allocation rules ray 2007 compensation for environmental and management costs should be considered when formulating water pricing policies and also deciding within social and national policies pulido velazquez et al 2012 a marginal cost water pricing system is the most efficient option however water rights need to be well defined and water governance issues need to be addressed in technical organizational and political terms fragoso and marques 2013 considered the important role of irrigation in socioeconomic development and aimed to assess the economic impact of water allocation and cost recovery on cropping patterns reduction in water applied is done by changing cropping patterns and introducing less profitable crops that have low water requirements to reduce the use of fertilizers however improved agricultural practices could significantly reduce the environmental impact of fertilizers making it difficult to determine the direct environmental benefits of water pricing julio and jose 2000 a number of researchers mobin ud din et al 2009 jens erik ørum 2010 fragoso and marques 2013 focused on the irrigation water applied and farmers response to water pricing policy and tried to find the relationship between irrigation water demand and water price according to a simple profit maximization problem as farmers cannot reduce costs abandoning unprofitable crops or raising production prices will be the key to get more benefits it means that the farmers will increase the benefit of water used per cubic meter by increasing production prices instead of reducing the demand for water mobin ud din et al 2009 ørum 2010 conducted a study on incentives for farmers to save water by taxing water and concluded that instead of stimulating a shift in water saving technologies and strategies the regulation could lead farmers to pick other crops or stop irrigation entirely by raising the tax on water the cultivation pattern goes to rain fed less water requiring crops such as grass or cereals instead of valuable water requiring crops such as potatoes ørum et al 2010 2 4 the effect of water pricing policies on water productivity according to the definition of water productivity it is obvious that factors influencing crop yield gross margin numerator of the productivity equation and water used denominator of the productivity equation may affect the water productivity e g crop cultivar type water applied soil factor and so on ali et al 2008 how would water pricing influence water applied and crop production a water pricing policy would have an impact on water applied by changing the irrigation pattern of a single crop and or changing the crop pattern in the presence of a water pricing policy farmers may intend to use less water for a single crop which could lead to lower yields the cropping pattern change would further influence crop production and gross margin this is an effect that a large number of researchers have confirmed varela ortega 1998 chebil et al 2010 de fraiture and perry 2002 furthermore the research results also indicate that by using water pricing as a single strategy water applied does not significantly decrease until the price of the water reaches a certain level that negatively affects the income of the farmers chebil 2010 used the pmp model to assess the effects of three scenarios on the agricultural production system the results show that the reduction of water applied happens when the price of water reaches a certain level and the farm income reduction reaches 20 of the current observed income a study by varela ortega 1998 used a dynamic mathematical programming model to analyze the effect of different water pricing policies on water demand and the results show the effect of alternative pricing based on regional and water districts due to the research topic and location and structural and institutional conditions the water demand curve against increasing water prices makes a slight difference fragoso and marques 2013 however the trend of water demand curve against increasing water pricing in most cases is similar which can be summarized in three stages in the first stage the farmers respond only slightly and maintain their crop distribution and demand for water within the second stage the farmers change cropping patterns and reduce their water applied for the third phase if the water price rises to a significantly high level the demand becomes relatively inelastic again and there is no response to a further price increase 3 theoretical background 3 1 water productivity indices water productivity has been defined in diverse ways kijne et al 2003 in the crop production sector water productivity means the relationship between the crop produced and the amount of water used which can be expressed as crop production per unit volume of water or when dealing with different crops the yield can be transformed into monetary units such as gross margin or net benefit in this paper we will use cpd kg m3 bpd rial m3 and nbpd rial m3 indices to assess water productivity the formulas are as follows 1 cpd s i y s i w s i 2 bpd s i p i y s i w s i 3 nbpd s i p i y s i vc s i w s i where p i and y s i denote the price rial and yield kg w s i means water applied m3 and vc s i means the total cost of the crop rial i under irrigation type of s respectively the cpd expresses the crop production obtained by water applied per m3 which from an agricultural viewpoint serves to evaluate the physical productivity of water the higher the index the more efficient the use of water however this index cannot express economic benefits the bpd and nbpd indices measure the economic productivity of water from an economic and monetary viewpoint the indices show the created monetary value of water applied per m3 the nbpd shows that products which have a higher net earning with lower water applied will have higher economic productivity ehsani and khaledi 2003 henry et al 2006 liu et al 2007 compared with cpd and bpd nbpd is considered to be a net benefit therefore if the research purpose is to analyze the efficiency of agricultural water from an economic perspective the nbpd index is more suitable than other indices this is because by using less water which results in lower production costs the nbpd index can provide additional benefit these indices can be used to compare a certain type of crop in different regions or a specific region over time which means that these indices can be applied for an external comparison e g water pricing under water scare condition and also for an internal comparison ehsani and khaledi 2003 fig 1 shows the effect of a water pricing policy on production per cubic meter given the first reaction where farmers show only a slight or no response at all to rising water prices in the first stage cpd and bpd would not change a lot while the decrease in nbpd would be significant since in this stage crop patterns are not modified significantly and water demand remained unchanged the net benefit decreases due to the increasing water pricing in the second reaction substitutions in crop plans take place as an adaption to further increase the water pricing water applied and water cost are both decreased the crop yield is also decreased this means that if the decrease unit of water applied is higher than the decrease unit of crop yield the bpd and cpd will increase otherwise the bpd and cpd will decrease if the decrease unit of water applied is higher than the decrease unit of net benefit the nbpd would increase otherwise the nbpd would decrease for the third stage the change in cpd bpd and nbpd indices would be similar to the first stage since the water demand is relatively inelastic again water applied remained unchanged and crop patterns would not change significantly however the water pricing has risen beyond the economic viability of the agricultural system and the water applied would fall very fast in the end therefore we are not going to discuss its effect on water productivity since pricing would not be suggested as a proper policy in this stage in addition most studies indicate that the increase in water pricing would negatively affect the welfare of farmers and agricultural employment however in the case of iran where water is extremely scarce the water pricing policy could have a positive effect on water saving and environment and fertilizer use might also decrease 4 methodology during the last decades pmp has been implemented frequently for analyzing policies in the agricultural sector and simulating the external effects of such policies on other sectors cortignani and severini 2011 graveline 2016 gómez limón et al 2016 lee et al 2019 the original motivation of pmp is to increase the liability and simulation power of a constrained optimization model by using the observed information in the specification phase the pmp has two distinct advantages firstly the ability to deal with limited and incomplete information secondly the ability to calibrate the farm level model and approximate even roughly implemented farm production plans gómez limón et al 2016 lee et al 2019 in the context of the newly developed farm systems simulator fssim kanellopoulos et al 2010 introduced a modified pmp calibration approach mérel and bucaram 2010 argued that most studies use prior information on supply elasticity which appears to be the most frequently used calibration approach based on our review of the model presented below fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the policy analysis in the current study is formulated through five consecutive steps 1 first decisions on water irrigation pricing policies are taken and proposed by government institutions 2 second the scenarios are designed to reflect common policy decisions on water pricing policies 3 third farmers reactions to water pricing scenarios are simulated using the pmp model and non linear yield functions are estimated for each crop through calibration procedure 4 fourth the scenarios are modeled based on the simulation results for the land use variables cost yield and gross margin and 5 fifth changes in water productivity indices are estimated at the end continuing the loop demand side information on the estimated water productivity indices provides policymakers with a basis for re adjusting the water pricing policy for the following periods the empirical model of the study consists of the non linear objective function and the constraints including water and land following mérel and howitt 2014 and zamani et al 2019 each pmp model is calibrated in three stages 1 a linear base model 2 a maximum entropy yield parameter estimation and 3 a non linear calibrated model based on a study by zamani et al 2019 the model is calibrated on the basis of non linear yield function using generalized maximum entropy gme for the sake of simplicity only the final calibrated pmp model that maximizes the non linear gross margin equation 4 subject to water and land constraints eq 5 is presented in this section as follows 4 max n x s i j nl z s i j p i α s i j nx s i j β s i j nx s i j 2 s i j c s i j nx s i j nonlinear objective function 5 s i a s i j nx s i j b j ϵ land and water land and water constraint where nx s i j is the decision variable indicating the amount of input j which is used for crop i and irrigation system s p i and c sij respectively show the price and the unit cost of input j land irrigation labor machinery fertilizers crop i and irrigation systems a s i j is leontief coefficients technical coefficient indicating the amount of input j used to produce a unit of crop i the right hand side of equation i e b j ϵ land and water presents the maximum available water and agricultural land in the case study the parameters of non linear yield function including α s i j and β s i j are estimated re produced by gme 1 1 for more detail please check mérel and howitt 2014 the calibrated nonlinear model presented by eq 4 5 is able to reproduce the base year information without imposing additional calibration constraints a highlighted feature of the final model s quadratic objective function is to prevent over specialization or so called corner solutions mérel and howitt 2014 accordingly the final calibrated model in the last stage of pmp is more flexible to simulate policy changes including water pricing scenarios lee et al 2019 in order to simulate the impacts of policies more precisely we divided the costs of irrigation into the price of water and variable cost of groundwater extraction per cubic meter respectively the variable cost of irrigation for crop i and irrigation s i e cw i s is presented by eq 6 in this equation cwe i s indicates the unit cost of groundwater extraction and wp is the price of water which is zero at status quo 2 2 which is a stream of scenarios imposed to the mode 6 cw i s cwe i s wp w i s another part of the cost function includes the costs related to fertilizer labor machinery pesticides and manure as mentioned before we focus on hamadan bahar plain located in northwestern iran fig 3 shows the location of this plain we randomly collected our data sample from 213 farms in the study region for three different crop types including rapeseed forage corn and alfalfa and two different irrigation systems table 1 describes the input data for the sample farms we took the average of data over different farm types in terms of irrigation system and crop choice thus the presented data are for one hectare the data on the applied water for individual crops have been extracted from a survey thus for each farmer irrigation system crop we calculated applied water as shown in table 1 water applied for crops decreases as irrigation technology improves this fact goes back to the higher efficiency in water deliveries in the farm additionally the average yield is higher as irrigation technology improves due to a better irrigation management balali et al 2011 barati et al 2019 in the model above the applied water data are presented by technical coefficients i e a s i j while the total available water at farm level is included in the right hand side of the water resource equation i e eq 5 5 results 5 1 baseline to analyze the impact and the changes resulting from the implementation of the water pricing policy this study first assessed the current situation to do so this study focused on the water productivity of the two irrigation systems and analyzed the current crop pattern of the case study as shown in table 1 the average yield of crops under the furrow irrigation system is lower compared to the modern conventional system in fact we can easily assume that losses due to the use of furrow irrigation are important in terms of infiltration along the furrows these losses contribute to the reduction of overall water efficiency of applied water as perry and steduto 2017 and balali et al 2011 stated in their study water applied for crops decreases as irrigation technology improves moreover average yield is higher as irrigation technology improves due to a better irrigation management in this line table 1 shows the higher financial productivity of water for crops with conventional irrigation systems according to the baseline alfalfa has a major share of land use followed only by forage corn this pattern could be due to a higher gross margin defined as revenue variable costs of this crop compared to forage corn and rapeseed although forage corn has higher productivity of water it has a lower share of land use this pattern could be explained by the zero price of irrigation water in the case study 5 2 impact of water pricing on cropping pattern although the value of water or shadow price can be a benchmark for pricing it is normally higher than irrigation water price due to social and economic constraints in the agricultural sector barker et al 2003 in other words water rates for irrigating crops paid by farmers do not reflect the actual value of water that can be expressed solely as a shadow price ziolkowska 2015 page 20 in our analysis we defined different scenarios to assess the effects of water pricing policy by imposing this policy first of all according to microeconomic theory water applied would decrease considering current constraints in the area such as the restriction of expanding agricultural land two possible reactions would be expected including changing cropping patterns and replacing the furrow irrigation system with a modern irrigation system the results of the change in cropping pattern under two irrigation systems are shown in figs 4 and 5 by increasing the water price farmers try to replace crops with a lower nbpd with those that produce more net benefit per water applied under furrow irrigation alfalfa shows an immediate decline and after a price of more than 350 irr m3 it is completely eliminated moreover rapeseed as a high nbpd crop has been expanded it should be mentioned that generally changing cropping patterns under furrow irrigation is more effective compared with the modern one another interesting fact is that in case of modern irrigation the farmers increase the surface of alfalfa before a drastic decrease and also increase the surface of rapeseed more water applied compared with the furrow area up to 13 5 in the furrow irrigation system and up to 20 6 in modern irrigation system this represents the change of price elasticity in different crops regarding the relation of nbpd and water price with a drastic change at the turning point of economic feasibility 5 3 impact of water pricing on irrigation technology changing the irrigation system as a result of the policy is manifested in fig 6 by increasing the price of water farmers are trying to replace the traditional irrigation system with furrows and this change is more significant after the price of water over 500 irr m3 at farm level this is explained by higher cost of furrow irrigation technology for the farmers when the water price is beyond 500 irr m3 essentially by increasing water prices farmers invest in more efficient technologies through which they can maintain the farm gross margin however the changes for individual crops are inconclusive 5 4 impact of water pricing on water productivity as explained in the previous sections we have three indices for water productivity which have been indicated by nbpd 3 3 net benefit per drop bpd 4 4 benefit per drop and cpd 5 5 crop per drop among them we focus on nbpd since it best incorporates the economic incentives of farmers and variable costs as shown in fig 7 water productivity has been indicated for each crop for various water prices the percentage changes in bpd and cpd in response to pricing policy are similar as the only difference between them is defined by crop prices which are assumed exogenous and constant however the percentage change in nbpd is affected not only by water use reduction i e nbpd formula but also by decreases in variable costs i e nbpd formula when water pricing policy is implemented these two opposite effects cause nbpd to react differently to the price changes considering irrigation technologies and crop types the reaction of farmers toward increasing water price and thereby gross margin reduction is to decrease water use or replace inefficient irrigation technology as discussed in the previous section depending on water price level the farmers will re allocate water to more efficient crops or reduce farmland size accordingly the final effect is determined by two factors water applied by each crop individually and the competition between the crops to absorb more water and land at farm level our findings show that water productivity for all indices would increase due to the implementation of a water price but the inclusion of the market price and variable costs are necessary to represent the cropping pattern in a profit maximizing problem another conclusion is that by increasing water prices the water productivity for crops under furrow irrigation would increase more compared to the modern irrigation system this is due to the higher impact of water price in case of more water intensive furrow irrigation additionally this pattern is more pronounced for less water intensive products such as forage corn and it is lower for water intensive crops such as alfalfa tables 2 4 5 5 impact of water pricing on total water demand another important result is the development of total water applied fig 8 shows the changes in the total demand for irrigation water as a sum of all crops at different water prices the overall trend in numbers shows that as expected total water applied will decline as the price of water rises in line with the study by balali and viaggi 2015 changes in water demand are more evident in the range of water prices from 400 to 700 irr m3 conversely the increase in the price of water results in a slight change in water savings as mentioned above this finding is mainly related to crop patterns and land use change 5 6 limiting factors of the chosen methodological approach several limitations have to be considered when looking at the results of our model firstly we have made several simplifications in order to produce results the focus was just on three crops although in reality several more possibilities exist and new plants could be introduced easily furthermore it was assumed that changing the cropping pattern as well as the irrigation system is possible without any additional investment capital and time and independent of soil type even though this is highly unlikely in reality another shortcoming of the model is that it cannot account endogenously for technological changes such as the breeding of new and more water efficient varieties or even better irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation for modeling purposes we also had to assume that the introduction of a water pricing policy would be immediately effective monitoring and enforcement difficulties were completely disregarded last but not least farmers are considered to act fully rationally without constraints of capital know how or other social hindrances such as traditions 6 conclusion the aggregate programming models for agricultural water management are still widely used for policy relevant analysis they have the ability to easily integrate important policy measures such as the traditional irrigation system with furrows and imply consistency during simulations with primary factor constraints these advantages however come at the price of huge data criteria often excluding time series compilation and a typical lack of empirical validation the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of water pricing policy on water productivity by collecting data from 213 farms in hamadan bahar plain in iran this study applied a pmp model with a gross margin maximizing the objective function overall our calculation regarding water productivity is compatible with the literature e g seyedan and ghadimi 2019 mozaffari 2020 rapeseed gives higher economic productivity just followed by alfalfa and forage corn respectively moreover modern irrigation technology generally improves water productivity of crops the results showed that a water pricing policy can change the cropping pattern and also irrigation system within the limitations of our case study it can also be a driver to motivate farmers to use modern and more efficient irrigation systems however iran faces severe water scarcity and unwise water use management particularly in the irrigation sector due to the use of conventional farm techniques has led to a decrease in on farm water efficiency due to the vast quantities of waste water the results of the current study revealed that a water pricing policy could improve water productivity and also decrease water applied the contribution of water pricing to the sustainable management of water resources requires large investments and financial commitments to manage water applied in this study considering the technical aspects of irrigation water efficiency with a focus on the water applied water pricing policy has some potentials to overcome both physical and economic water scarcity when pricing policy is enforced the volume of applied water decreases considering the current ban on the extension of agricultural lands in our case study this mechanism has the same consequence as the restricting water deliveries to the farm or water shortage however restricting water deliveries can be a result of different factors in our case water applied decreases due to the increases in the irrigation water price the results of this study provide a good framework for local regional farmers to improve the management of water resources in their region taking into account sustainable development goals exploring the economic value and impact of water pricing policy on water productivity in different iranian provinces is needed to motivate farmers to use more efficient irrigation technology to advance the highly neglected topic of water prices the proposed methodology of pmp can include more case studies from different regions this study focuses on evaluating water pricing and development policies across the country in this context this study highlights the country s ability to support the monitoring system for water resource management therefore water pricing is a part of the responsibility of national policies and the current policies in the agricultural sector exhibit some shortcomings e g lack of data availability hinders detailed analyses in addition the results of this study capture the different pricing concepts and water demands when offering the pmp method for evaluating irrigation policies by contrasting scarcity cost conditions and various agricultural practices by conducting this study we have shown that i the water pricing is a cross sectoral and multi dimensional policy issue and ii by implementing pmp we will be able to propose strategies for optimizing the use of groundwater resources by farmers and prevent the destruction of these resources it is therefore the government s responsibility to establish rules and processes for efficient and sustainable use of water and protect highly vulnerable water resources in addition this study concluded that farmers need to be encouraged to use modern irrigation methods therefore the government should support these technologies to increase on farm water efficiency and water productivity however this improvement is subject to water accounting verification the potential environmental benefits from the improved on farm irrigation efficiency depend on the government s ability to prevent the extension of the irrigated area in absence of such controls the aquifer depletion will be accelerated further studies should be carried out to fully understand the potential impact of water pricing policy implementation as the model used in this study is based on a purely mathematical model that ignores limited rationality by assuming the farmers perceptions in the comparison period the present study succeeded in providing a theoretical and methodological basis for the evaluation of programming models for agricultural water pricing policies in order to evaluate the suggested hypotheses h1 h4 this paper revealed that 1 the farmers change cropping patterns and reduce their water applied and by increasing water prices farmers will invest in more efficient technologies therefore the first hypothesis is confirmed by the results 2 by increasing water prices the water productivity for crops under furrow irrigation would increase more compared to the modern irrigation system this result also confirms the second hypothesis 3 a water pricing policy based on assessing various prices could improve water productivity and also decrease water applied both hypotheses 3 and 4 have been confirmed accordingly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10259,water pricing and reducing the costs of the implementation and maintenance of irrigation systems have been a challenging topic for a long time water pricing issues combine two complex dimensions the first dimension is the economy of the farm and its association with the broader economic system and farming practices the second dimension is the hydrology and interconnection of the plot with the irrigation system the river basin and the underlying water policy framework accordingly this study aimed to investigate how the institutionalization of water applied would affect water productivity through the implementation of a water pricing policy to this end this study formulated a positive mathematical programming pmp model with a gross margin maximizing objective function to assess the data collected from 213 farms in hamadan bahar plain iran the results revealed that a water pricing policy can change the cropping pattern and also irrigation system within the limitations of the case study it can also be a driver to motivate farmers to use a modern and more efficient irrigation system the potential environmental benefits from the improved on farm irrigation efficiency depend on the government s ability to prevent the extension of the irrigated area in absence of such controls the aquifer depletion will be accelerated therefore an appropriate water pricing policy could improve water productivity and also reduce water applied keywords water management water applied positive mathematical programming cropping pattern irrigation systems sustainability 1 introduction in semi arid and arid regions efficient water management is one of the key drivers in successful agricultural production as many of these regions rely on slowly replenishing groundwater resources for supplying their water demands water demand must be adjusted and institutionalized to guarantee the long term stability of the socio ecological system perry 2007 al rubaye 2018 to assess water demand various corporate state or community led infrastructure networks have their temporary phases of institutionalization to continue operating within or outside their technological ambitions putri 2016 consequently the institutionalization of water applied requires representation and negotiated decision making to increase opportunities for community involvement jacob and bernard 2013 yet in regions where no proper institutions are in place coupled with inefficient irrigation technologies and a focus on crops with high water demand fast groundwater depletion is a serious risk garrido and calatrava 2010 al rubaye and al ezzy 2018 an example of such regions is hamadan bahar plain in northwestern iran fig 1 shows the location of this plain the region serves a strong agricultural sector producing mainly alfalfa maize and rape often for export the dominant irrigation system is furrow irrigation a form of surface irrigation which causes high evaporation and loss of runoff therefore the region shows very low water productivity i e the efficiency of water applied as the input in relation to the products as the output the water used for irrigation originates almost entirely from groundwater wells while most of these wells are formally registered and licensed the withdrawal of water is neither measured nor institutionally restricted the current price of irrigation water in the study area is zero balali et al 2011 however farmers still need to pay the extraction costs due to the water crisis in iran the region is considered as a restricted plain in which the agricultural land extension is not allowed moreover the height of the water table is more than 60 m deep on average and even deeper than 100 m in some regions regional water company of hamedan 2017 therefore return flows may not be able to recharge the aquifer or the impact is not considerable in our analysis we present water productivity indices at zero water price which is referred to the current water productivity i e status quo table 1 to highlight other examples on water productivity in the case study seyedan and ghadimi 2019 and mozaffari 2020 calculated water productivity for different crops and different irrigation systems if the charged fees do not cover the irrigation costs sustainability can be jeopardized without ongoing government subsidies al rubaye 2018 based on the allocation law of water equity it is requested to calculate the water tariff by the quantity and quality of consumption in urban rural industrial and other areas tahamipour et al 2014 nabavi 2017 moreover water charges can be a financial instrument for recovering all or part of capital and recurring costs national development reports in iran focus on calculating the costs of building dams and water supply facilities and assessing irrigation water economically as an input to choose the best water sales tariffs for water supply costs in future years tahamipour et al 2014 water charging or disposal is not the ultimate objective however it is a tool for achieving one or more policy goals soto et al 2018 in a way that to save water and increase its productivity the water price can be considered as an economic tool water pricing was selected as a tool to decrease water demand world bank 2003 this is expected that water pricing policies inculcate protection and stimulate a movement to higher value crops venot and molle 2008 this price policy can encourage farmers to invest in technology with the probability of increasing income rather than incurring higher costs expósito and berbel 2016 farmers facing higher water prices might desire to intensify their production changes motivated by high water prices would therefore likely involve technological change and changes in crop patterns and lead to higher productivity of water molle et al 2008 water pricing policies are among various measures designed to improve the productivity and efficient use of water resources renzetti 2000 from the correct assumption that low water prices provide a limited incentive to improve productivity it can be seen that rising prices will improve productivity automatically and should be a prime objective for implementing improvements molle et al 2008 from the right assumption that low water prices provide limited incentives to improve productivity it can be seen that raising prices will automatically improve productivity and should be a prime target for implementing improvements molle et al 2008 improving water productivity is among the top priorities for policymakers in the agricultural sector madani 2014 boazar et al 2019 the economic role of water can be developed by pricing policies ehsani et al 2012 asaadi et al 2019 literature demonstrates that many countries are engaged in such pricing policies dinar 2015 for example shi et al 2014 used a bioeconomic model to analyze the shadow price of water resources and investigate the reaction of farmers to water pricing policies in northwestern china s heihe river basin their findings suggest that farmers in most irrigation zones were not very sensitive to changes in water price since it was well below the shadow price of water supplies a reduction in the demand for agricultural water could only take place with a large increase in the water price galioto et al 2017 investigated the expected impact of changes in pricing policies applied to the use of water resources recently experienced in an agricultural area located in northern italy the results highlight that the change in pricing criteria would not cause substantial variations in water uses this was mainly due to the inelastic demand for water in agriculture water pricing represents a key issue both for developing and developed countries galioto et al 2017 nevertheless outcomes from previous studies comparing the performance of water pricing policies among different countries confirm that there is no best practice that can be suggested to one country iglesias and blanco 2008 the reason is that optimal prices rely on the objectives of the water agency as well as on the types of information available to it galioto et al 2017 in water demand management and its optimal allocation pricing policies play an important role iglesias and blanco 2008 asaadi et al 2019 the determination of an appropriate water price leads to an optimal allocation of water only if there is a process such as a market to facilitate water reallocation from lower to higher value uses particularly in agricultural consumption singh 2016 the application of new subsidy legislation in iran that insists on pricing water on the basis of its supply costs will have a significant impact on the management of water resources in the country s agricultural sector nabavi 2017 tahamipour et al 2014 positive mathematical programming pmp is particularly useful in situations where there are only short time series data available such as in sectoral analyses of developing countries e g iran and environmental economic analyses e g water scarcities hashemy shahdany et al 2017 the pmp is a policy oriented approach to formulate policy recommendations kahil et al 2016 therefore given the growing problems with the water sector in most parts of iran and the need for correcting water prices madani et al 2016 pmp will help policymakers resolve the water issue and improve the productivity of water resources we need a model to simulate the dynamics of water productivity and water pricing policy due to data limitations mathematical programming based models including normative and positive models are considered as appropriate options as discussed earlier positive mathematical programming allows us to calibrate the model according to the base year therefore this model is generally suitable for the current study analysis so far different pmp type models have been applied in the literature graveline 2016 these models are calibrated based on either a non linear yield function or a non linear cost function our model is based on non linear yield function which allows us to capture the changes in yield in response to water pricing gómez limón et al 2016 lee et al 2019 the current study can contribute to both thematic and methodological aspects as follows i focusing on the thematic aspect institutionalization of water applied has been considered in this study the institutionalization of water applied would affect water productivity by using a water pricing tool according to high water applied in arid and semi arid regions the contribution of institutionalized water to improving water productivity is significant in these areas ii focusing on the methodological aspect this study applied the positive mathematical programming pmp method to analyze water pricing policies implementations using this innovative approach of the pmp the methodology can contribute to improving productivity by applying an appropriate pricing scenario moreover the current study aims at i the assessment of current water management strategies with regard to water pricing scenarios in hamadan bahar basin considering the site of the study it should be noted that the hamadan bahar basin climate is semi arid with mean annual precipitation of 324 5 mm and average annual temperature of 11 3 c groundwater is the only source of drinking water

of iran s territory is located in arid and semi arid regions and is currently facing a severe water crisis gorjian and ghobadian 2015 by 2021 the country s total annual renewable water per capita is projected to reach only about 800 m3 gorjian and ghobadian 2015 in this context seawater desalination has been seen as a possible solution and has been used for a long time however it is argued that this method is no longer feasible and sustainable since it depends on fossil fuels in iran the main freshwater consumer is the agricultural sector 90 93 compared to the domestic and hygiene sector 5 6 and the industrial sector 1 yazdanpanah et al 2014 however since the beginning of 1990 water has become very scarce in iran according to yazdanpanah et al 2014 the water crises have been exacerbated by severe droughts which have affected nearly all sectors in iran leading to large economic losses the collapse of water bodies and relocation of numerous villages 2 2 water productivity in the iranian context water constraints can be more perceptible in agriculture than in industry faramarzi et al 2010 to address current sustainability needs water productivity of agriculture becomes an important index to assess the effect of saving water and irrigation water management kijne et al 2003 developed an approach according to which the productivity of crop water should be assessed in terms of both kilograms of crops per cubic meter of water applied kg m3 and the net or gross value of crops produced per cubic meter of water in general water productivity includes total precipitation the higher utilization ratio of precipitation higher water productivity and at the same time the higher repetitive utilization ratio of water in a region there are a number of researchers faramarzi et al 2010 kijne et al 2003 perry 2007 xu et al 2010 who have summarized the factors affecting water productivity these factors are crop variety irrigation water applied irrigation technique carbon remobilization grain filling rate soil texture soil nutrient and agronomic management there are generally two distinct perspectives regarding water productivity in the agronomy literature see e g molden 1997 perry 2007 it is mainly emphasized on the technical aspects of irrigation water efficiency with a focus on the water consumed by a single crop although this concept could provide precise information on the water used by each crop individually it ignores the interaction between different crops at farm level from an economic perspective it is crucial to find how efficient farmers distribute water between different crops to achieve their productivity at farm level considering their water applied based on the above mentioned studies the main aim of the current study is to find out whether the government can encourage farmers to achieve higher water productivity through the implementation of a water pricing policy 2 3 water pricing policy water used for irrigation shall be managed as an economic commodity that has immense social and environmental values it may be quantified through basic resource availability to ensure sustainable harvesting banihabib et al 2016 habibi davijani et al 2016 water pricing objectives go beyond economic efficiency including sustainability and equity among many other goals al saidi and dehnavi 2019 water prices should also be transparent legitimate easy to administer fair etc rogers et al 2002 the water pricing policy is a major water managing topic to be discussed in countries that are faced with the problem of water scarcity and have a clear understanding that water is a kind of strategical resource with a significant influence on sustainable ecological development which should be allocated reasonably and effectively a way to reduce water demand is to adopt transparent and clear allocation rules ray 2007 compensation for environmental and management costs should be considered when formulating water pricing policies and also deciding within social and national policies pulido velazquez et al 2012 a marginal cost water pricing system is the most efficient option however water rights need to be well defined and water governance issues need to be addressed in technical organizational and political terms fragoso and marques 2013 considered the important role of irrigation in socioeconomic development and aimed to assess the economic impact of water allocation and cost recovery on cropping patterns reduction in water applied is done by changing cropping patterns and introducing less profitable crops that have low water requirements to reduce the use of fertilizers however improved agricultural practices could significantly reduce the environmental impact of fertilizers making it difficult to determine the direct environmental benefits of water pricing julio and jose 2000 a number of researchers mobin ud din et al 2009 jens erik ørum 2010 fragoso and marques 2013 focused on the irrigation water applied and farmers response to water pricing policy and tried to find the relationship between irrigation water demand and water price according to a simple profit maximization problem as farmers cannot reduce costs abandoning unprofitable crops or raising production prices will be the key to get more benefits it means that the farmers will increase the benefit of water used per cubic meter by increasing production prices instead of reducing the demand for water mobin ud din et al 2009 ørum 2010 conducted a study on incentives for farmers to save water by taxing water and concluded that instead of stimulating a shift in water saving technologies and strategies the regulation could lead farmers to pick other crops or stop irrigation entirely by raising the tax on water the cultivation pattern goes to rain fed less water requiring crops such as grass or cereals instead of valuable water requiring crops such as potatoes ørum et al 2010 2 4 the effect of water pricing policies on water productivity according to the definition of water productivity it is obvious that factors influencing crop yield gross margin numerator of the productivity equation and water used denominator of the productivity equation may affect the water productivity e g crop cultivar type water applied soil factor and so on ali et al 2008 how would water pricing influence water applied and crop production a water pricing policy would have an impact on water applied by changing the irrigation pattern of a single crop and or changing the crop pattern in the presence of a water pricing policy farmers may intend to use less water for a single crop which could lead to lower yields the cropping pattern change would further influence crop production and gross margin this is an effect that a large number of researchers have confirmed varela ortega 1998 chebil et al 2010 de fraiture and perry 2002 furthermore the research results also indicate that by using water pricing as a single strategy water applied does not significantly decrease until the price of the water reaches a certain level that negatively affects the income of the farmers chebil 2010 used the pmp model to assess the effects of three scenarios on the agricultural production system the results show that the reduction of water applied happens when the price of water reaches a certain level and the farm income reduction reaches 20 of the current observed income a study by varela ortega 1998 used a dynamic mathematical programming model to analyze the effect of different water pricing policies on water demand and the results show the effect of alternative pricing based on regional and water districts due to the research topic and location and structural and institutional conditions the water demand curve against increasing water prices makes a slight difference fragoso and marques 2013 however the trend of water demand curve against increasing water pricing in most cases is similar which can be summarized in three stages in the first stage the farmers respond only slightly and maintain their crop distribution and demand for water within the second stage the farmers change cropping patterns and reduce their water applied for the third phase if the water price rises to a significantly high level the demand becomes relatively inelastic again and there is no response to a further price increase 3 theoretical background 3 1 water productivity indices water productivity has been defined in diverse ways kijne et al 2003 in the crop production sector water productivity means the relationship between the crop produced and the amount of water used which can be expressed as crop production per unit volume of water or when dealing with different crops the yield can be transformed into monetary units such as gross margin or net benefit in this paper we will use cpd kg m3 bpd rial m3 and nbpd rial m3 indices to assess water productivity the formulas are as follows 1 cpd s i y s i w s i 2 bpd s i p i y s i w s i 3 nbpd s i p i y s i vc s i w s i where p i and y s i denote the price rial and yield kg w s i means water applied m3 and vc s i means the total cost of the crop rial i under irrigation type of s respectively the cpd expresses the crop production obtained by water applied per m3 which from an agricultural viewpoint serves to evaluate the physical productivity of water the higher the index the more efficient the use of water however this index cannot express economic benefits the bpd and nbpd indices measure the economic productivity of water from an economic and monetary viewpoint the indices show the created monetary value of water applied per m3 the nbpd shows that products which have a higher net earning with lower water applied will have higher economic productivity ehsani and khaledi 2003 henry et al 2006 liu et al 2007 compared with cpd and bpd nbpd is considered to be a net benefit therefore if the research purpose is to analyze the efficiency of agricultural water from an economic perspective the nbpd index is more suitable than other indices this is because by using less water which results in lower production costs the nbpd index can provide additional benefit these indices can be used to compare a certain type of crop in different regions or a specific region over time which means that these indices can be applied for an external comparison e g water pricing under water scare condition and also for an internal comparison ehsani and khaledi 2003 fig 1 shows the effect of a water pricing policy on production per cubic meter given the first reaction where farmers show only a slight or no response at all to rising water prices in the first stage cpd and bpd would not change a lot while the decrease in nbpd would be significant since in this stage crop patterns are not modified significantly and water demand remained unchanged the net benefit decreases due to the increasing water pricing in the second reaction substitutions in crop plans take place as an adaption to further increase the water pricing water applied and water cost are both decreased the crop yield is also decreased this means that if the decrease unit of water applied is higher than the decrease unit of crop yield the bpd and cpd will increase otherwise the bpd and cpd will decrease if the decrease unit of water applied is higher than the decrease unit of net benefit the nbpd would increase otherwise the nbpd would decrease for the third stage the change in cpd bpd and nbpd indices would be similar to the first stage since the water demand is relatively inelastic again water applied remained unchanged and crop patterns would not change significantly however the water pricing has risen beyond the economic viability of the agricultural system and the water applied would fall very fast in the end therefore we are not going to discuss its effect on water productivity since pricing would not be suggested as a proper policy in this stage in addition most studies indicate that the increase in water pricing would negatively affect the welfare of farmers and agricultural employment however in the case of iran where water is extremely scarce the water pricing policy could have a positive effect on water saving and environment and fertilizer use might also decrease 4 methodology during the last decades pmp has been implemented frequently for analyzing policies in the agricultural sector and simulating the external effects of such policies on other sectors cortignani and severini 2011 graveline 2016 gómez limón et al 2016 lee et al 2019 the original motivation of pmp is to increase the liability and simulation power of a constrained optimization model by using the observed information in the specification phase the pmp has two distinct advantages firstly the ability to deal with limited and incomplete information secondly the ability to calibrate the farm level model and approximate even roughly implemented farm production plans gómez limón et al 2016 lee et al 2019 in the context of the newly developed farm systems simulator fssim kanellopoulos et al 2010 introduced a modified pmp calibration approach mérel and bucaram 2010 argued that most studies use prior information on supply elasticity which appears to be the most frequently used calibration approach based on our review of the model presented below fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the policy analysis in the current study is formulated through five consecutive steps 1 first decisions on water irrigation pricing policies are taken and proposed by government institutions 2 second the scenarios are designed to reflect common policy decisions on water pricing policies 3 third farmers reactions to water pricing scenarios are simulated using the pmp model and non linear yield functions are estimated for each crop through calibration procedure 4 fourth the scenarios are modeled based on the simulation results for the land use variables cost yield and gross margin and 5 fifth changes in water productivity indices are estimated at the end continuing the loop demand side information on the estimated water productivity indices provides policymakers with a basis for re adjusting the water pricing policy for the following periods the empirical model of the study consists of the non linear objective function and the constraints including water and land following mérel and howitt 2014 and zamani et al 2019 each pmp model is calibrated in three stages 1 a linear base model 2 a maximum entropy yield parameter estimation and 3 a non linear calibrated model based on a study by zamani et al 2019 the model is calibrated on the basis of non linear yield function using generalized maximum entropy gme for the sake of simplicity only the final calibrated pmp model that maximizes the non linear gross margin equation 4 subject to water and land constraints eq 5 is presented in this section as follows 4 max n x s i j nl z s i j p i α s i j nx s i j β s i j nx s i j 2 s i j c s i j nx s i j nonlinear objective function 5 s i a s i j nx s i j b j ϵ land and water land and water constraint where nx s i j is the decision variable indicating the amount of input j which is used for crop i and irrigation system s p i and c sij respectively show the price and the unit cost of input j land irrigation labor machinery fertilizers crop i and irrigation systems a s i j is leontief coefficients technical coefficient indicating the amount of input j used to produce a unit of crop i the right hand side of equation i e b j ϵ land and water presents the maximum available water and agricultural land in the case study the parameters of non linear yield function including α s i j and β s i j are estimated re produced by gme 1 1 for more detail please check mérel and howitt 2014 the calibrated nonlinear model presented by eq 4 5 is able to reproduce the base year information without imposing additional calibration constraints a highlighted feature of the final model s quadratic objective function is to prevent over specialization or so called corner solutions mérel and howitt 2014 accordingly the final calibrated model in the last stage of pmp is more flexible to simulate policy changes including water pricing scenarios lee et al 2019 in order to simulate the impacts of policies more precisely we divided the costs of irrigation into the price of water and variable cost of groundwater extraction per cubic meter respectively the variable cost of irrigation for crop i and irrigation s i e cw i s is presented by eq 6 in this equation cwe i s indicates the unit cost of groundwater extraction and wp is the price of water which is zero at status quo 2 2 which is a stream of scenarios imposed to the mode 6 cw i s cwe i s wp w i s another part of the cost function includes the costs related to fertilizer labor machinery pesticides and manure as mentioned before we focus on hamadan bahar plain located in northwestern iran fig 3 shows the location of this plain we randomly collected our data sample from 213 farms in the study region for three different crop types including rapeseed forage corn and alfalfa and two different irrigation systems table 1 describes the input data for the sample farms we took the average of data over different farm types in terms of irrigation system and crop choice thus the presented data are for one hectare the data on the applied water for individual crops have been extracted from a survey thus for each farmer irrigation system crop we calculated applied water as shown in table 1 water applied for crops decreases as irrigation technology improves this fact goes back to the higher efficiency in water deliveries in the farm additionally the average yield is higher as irrigation technology improves due to a better irrigation management balali et al 2011 barati et al 2019 in the model above the applied water data are presented by technical coefficients i e a s i j while the total available water at farm level is included in the right hand side of the water resource equation i e eq 5 5 results 5 1 baseline to analyze the impact and the changes resulting from the implementation of the water pricing policy this study first assessed the current situation to do so this study focused on the water productivity of the two irrigation systems and analyzed the current crop pattern of the case study as shown in table 1 the average yield of crops under the furrow irrigation system is lower compared to the modern conventional system in fact we can easily assume that losses due to the use of furrow irrigation are important in terms of infiltration along the furrows these losses contribute to the reduction of overall water efficiency of applied water as perry and steduto 2017 and balali et al 2011 stated in their study water applied for crops decreases as irrigation technology improves moreover average yield is higher as irrigation technology improves due to a better irrigation management in this line table 1 shows the higher financial productivity of water for crops with conventional irrigation systems according to the baseline alfalfa has a major share of land use followed only by forage corn this pattern could be due to a higher gross margin defined as revenue variable costs of this crop compared to forage corn and rapeseed although forage corn has higher productivity of water it has a lower share of land use this pattern could be explained by the zero price of irrigation water in the case study 5 2 impact of water pricing on cropping pattern although the value of water or shadow price can be a benchmark for pricing it is normally higher than irrigation water price due to social and economic constraints in the agricultural sector barker et al 2003 in other words water rates for irrigating crops paid by farmers do not reflect the actual value of water that can be expressed solely as a shadow price ziolkowska 2015 page 20 in our analysis we defined different scenarios to assess the effects of water pricing policy by imposing this policy first of all according to microeconomic theory water applied would decrease considering current constraints in the area such as the restriction of expanding agricultural land two possible reactions would be expected including changing cropping patterns and replacing the furrow irrigation system with a modern irrigation system the results of the change in cropping pattern under two irrigation systems are shown in figs 4 and 5 by increasing the water price farmers try to replace crops with a lower nbpd with those that produce more net benefit per water applied under furrow irrigation alfalfa shows an immediate decline and after a price of more than 350 irr m3 it is completely eliminated moreover rapeseed as a high nbpd crop has been expanded it should be mentioned that generally changing cropping patterns under furrow irrigation is more effective compared with the modern one another interesting fact is that in case of modern irrigation the farmers increase the surface of alfalfa before a drastic decrease and also increase the surface of rapeseed more water applied compared with the furrow area up to 13 5 in the furrow irrigation system and up to 20 6 in modern irrigation system this represents the change of price elasticity in different crops regarding the relation of nbpd and water price with a drastic change at the turning point of economic feasibility 5 3 impact of water pricing on irrigation technology changing the irrigation system as a result of the policy is manifested in fig 6 by increasing the price of water farmers are trying to replace the traditional irrigation system with furrows and this change is more significant after the price of water over 500 irr m3 at farm level this is explained by higher cost of furrow irrigation technology for the farmers when the water price is beyond 500 irr m3 essentially by increasing water prices farmers invest in more efficient technologies through which they can maintain the farm gross margin however the changes for individual crops are inconclusive 5 4 impact of water pricing on water productivity as explained in the previous sections we have three indices for water productivity which have been indicated by nbpd 3 3 net benefit per drop bpd 4 4 benefit per drop and cpd 5 5 crop per drop among them we focus on nbpd since it best incorporates the economic incentives of farmers and variable costs as shown in fig 7 water productivity has been indicated for each crop for various water prices the percentage changes in bpd and cpd in response to pricing policy are similar as the only difference between them is defined by crop prices which are assumed exogenous and constant however the percentage change in nbpd is affected not only by water use reduction i e nbpd formula but also by decreases in variable costs i e nbpd formula when water pricing policy is implemented these two opposite effects cause nbpd to react differently to the price changes considering irrigation technologies and crop types the reaction of farmers toward increasing water price and thereby gross margin reduction is to decrease water use or replace inefficient irrigation technology as discussed in the previous section depending on water price level the farmers will re allocate water to more efficient crops or reduce farmland size accordingly the final effect is determined by two factors water applied by each crop individually and the competition between the crops to absorb more water and land at farm level our findings show that water productivity for all indices would increase due to the implementation of a water price but the inclusion of the market price and variable costs are necessary to represent the cropping pattern in a profit maximizing problem another conclusion is that by increasing water prices the water productivity for crops under furrow irrigation would increase more compared to the modern irrigation system this is due to the higher impact of water price in case of more water intensive furrow irrigation additionally this pattern is more pronounced for less water intensive products such as forage corn and it is lower for water intensive crops such as alfalfa tables 2 4 5 5 impact of water pricing on total water demand another important result is the development of total water applied fig 8 shows the changes in the total demand for irrigation water as a sum of all crops at different water prices the overall trend in numbers shows that as expected total water applied will decline as the price of water rises in line with the study by balali and viaggi 2015 changes in water demand are more evident in the range of water prices from 400 to 700 irr m3 conversely the increase in the price of water results in a slight change in water savings as mentioned above this finding is mainly related to crop patterns and land use change 5 6 limiting factors of the chosen methodological approach several limitations have to be considered when looking at the results of our model firstly we have made several simplifications in order to produce results the focus was just on three crops although in reality several more possibilities exist and new plants could be introduced easily furthermore it was assumed that changing the cropping pattern as well as the irrigation system is possible without any additional investment capital and time and independent of soil type even though this is highly unlikely in reality another shortcoming of the model is that it cannot account endogenously for technological changes such as the breeding of new and more water efficient varieties or even better irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation for modeling purposes we also had to assume that the introduction of a water pricing policy would be immediately effective monitoring and enforcement difficulties were completely disregarded last but not least farmers are considered to act fully rationally without constraints of capital know how or other social hindrances such as traditions 6 conclusion the aggregate programming models for agricultural water management are still widely used for policy relevant analysis they have the ability to easily integrate important policy measures such as the traditional irrigation system with furrows and imply consistency during simulations with primary factor constraints these advantages however come at the price of huge data criteria often excluding time series compilation and a typical lack of empirical validation the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of water pricing policy on water productivity by collecting data from 213 farms in hamadan bahar plain in iran this study applied a pmp model with a gross margin maximizing the objective function overall our calculation regarding water productivity is compatible with the literature e g seyedan and ghadimi 2019 mozaffari 2020 rapeseed gives higher economic productivity just followed by alfalfa and forage corn respectively moreover modern irrigation technology generally improves water productivity of crops the results showed that a water pricing policy can change the cropping pattern and also irrigation system within the limitations of our case study it can also be a driver to motivate farmers to use modern and more efficient irrigation systems however iran faces severe water scarcity and unwise water use management particularly in the irrigation sector due to the use of conventional farm techniques has led to a decrease in on farm water efficiency due to the vast quantities of waste water the results of the current study revealed that a water pricing policy could improve water productivity and also decrease water applied the contribution of water pricing to the sustainable management of water resources requires large investments and financial commitments to manage water applied in this study considering the technical aspects of irrigation water efficiency with a focus on the water applied water pricing policy has some potentials to overcome both physical and economic water scarcity when pricing policy is enforced the volume of applied water decreases considering the current ban on the extension of agricultural lands in our case study this mechanism has the same consequence as the restricting water deliveries to the farm or water shortage however restricting water deliveries can be a result of different factors in our case water applied decreases due to the increases in the irrigation water price the results of this study provide a good framework for local regional farmers to improve the management of water resources in their region taking into account sustainable development goals exploring the economic value and impact of water pricing policy on water productivity in different iranian provinces is needed to motivate farmers to use more efficient irrigation technology to advance the highly neglected topic of water prices the proposed methodology of pmp can include more case studies from different regions this study focuses on evaluating water pricing and development policies across the country in this context this study highlights the country s ability to support the monitoring system for water resource management therefore water pricing is a part of the responsibility of national policies and the current policies in the agricultural sector exhibit some shortcomings e g lack of data availability hinders detailed analyses in addition the results of this study capture the different pricing concepts and water demands when offering the pmp method for evaluating irrigation policies by contrasting scarcity cost conditions and various agricultural practices by conducting this study we have shown that i the water pricing is a cross sectoral and multi dimensional policy issue and ii by implementing pmp we will be able to propose strategies for optimizing the use of groundwater resources by farmers and prevent the destruction of these resources it is therefore the government s responsibility to establish rules and processes for efficient and sustainable use of water and protect highly vulnerable water resources in addition this study concluded that farmers need to be encouraged to use modern irrigation methods therefore the government should support these technologies to increase on farm water efficiency and water productivity however this improvement is subject to water accounting verification the potential environmental benefits from the improved on farm irrigation efficiency depend on the government s ability to prevent the extension of the irrigated area in absence of such controls the aquifer depletion will be accelerated further studies should be carried out to fully understand the potential impact of water pricing policy implementation as the model used in this study is based on a purely mathematical model that ignores limited rationality by assuming the farmers perceptions in the comparison period the present study succeeded in providing a theoretical and methodological basis for the evaluation of programming models for agricultural water pricing policies in order to evaluate the suggested hypotheses h1 h4 this paper revealed that 1 the farmers change cropping patterns and reduce their water applied and by increasing water prices farmers will invest in more efficient technologies therefore the first hypothesis is confirmed by the results 2 by increasing water prices the water productivity for crops under furrow irrigation would increase more compared to the modern irrigation system this result also confirms the second hypothesis 3 a water pricing policy based on assessing various prices could improve water productivity and also decrease water applied both hypotheses 3 and 4 have been confirmed accordingly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
