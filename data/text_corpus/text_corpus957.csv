4785,alluvial fans often support ephemeral streams whose flow regimes and sediment dynamics are strongly controlled by fan sedimentary characteristics and interactions with shallow groundwater aquifers the hydrogeology of such fans has most often been documented for large fans located within arid climate zones this research focuses on a small 0 075 km2 alluvial fan situated in a temperate high rainfall climate the lake district north west england an ephemeral stream flowing across this alluvial fan plays a key role in supplying water and sediment to the river ehen which is the focus of a habitat restoration initiative this study combines high spatial resolution near surface geophysics and outcrop data with hydrological data to characterise the hydrogeological properties of the alluvial fan a conceptual hydrogeological model was developed to understand the hydrology across the alluvial fan and how that affects water and sediment supply to the river ehen the alluvial fan is composed predominantly of permeable debris flow deposits and numerous palaeochannels which may provide preferential groundwater flow paths during streamflows partial to full stream aquifer connectivity occurs especially in the distal fan where groundwater discharges back into the stream streamflows occur when the fan apex infiltration rate capacity threshold of approx 60 l s 1 is

introduction ephemeral streams are abundant and widely distributed throughout the world often providing an important source of recharge water for their underlying aquifers whilst also supplying water and sediment to the rivers into which they discharge abdulrazzak morel seytoux 1983 marteau et al 2017 ephemeral streams form diverse ecosystems but are also important for other ecosystems downstream boulton 2014 stubbington et al 2018 a varied range of ephemeral and intermittent streams exist in temperate humid environments stubbington et al 2017 though some of these systems have been studied e g groundwater fed systems in chalk and limestone catchments grapes et al 2005 sefton et al 2019 the functioning of ephemeral streams situated on alluvial fans in these environments has received little attention river restoration to enhance physical ecological or water quality status is an increasingly widespread practice and reconnecting formerly diverted tributaries to their main rivers is one way to help improve main stem integrity england et al 2008 despite their small size and intermittent flow there is growing evidence that ephemeral streams can significantly influence their main stem rivers mcdonough et al 2011 tena et al 2012 marteau et al 2017 marteau 2017 however little is known about reconnecting ephemeral tributaries to restore fluvial processes in main rivers in temperate environments marteau et al 2017 especially when these streams cross alluvial fans where groundwater surface water interactions and stream flow regime are highly controlled by alluvial fan sedimentology bull 1977 1997 understanding the dynamics of such streams is critical when they form part of river restoration efforts to help ensure that project objectives are met and lessons learned can inform better design of similar projects alluvial fans are depositional features often located at the base of a mountain front in areas of high sediment generation where there is a loss of sediment transport capacity or stream power typically in zones of decreased confinement harvey 2010 bowman 2019 hydrological studies reveal the significant storage and buffering capacity of alluvial fans herron wilson 2001 woods et al 2006 often forming important groundwater reservoirs individual fans can host high yield aquifer systems neton et al 1994 hu et al 2010 with hydraulic conductivity distributions controlled by the heterogeneity and variable connectivity of deposits cehrs 1979 weissmann et al 2002 heterogeneity is commonly abrupt and directional neton et al 1994 individual alluvial fans may show distinctly different aquifer properties and hydraulic conductivity can vary over many orders of magnitude depending on composition and facies relationships neton et al 1994 zhu et al 2017 fan apex infiltration exerts a major influence on alluvial fan aquifer recharge blainey pelletier 2008 and this infiltration rate strongly controls hydrological processes on the fan surface ephemeral streams on alluvial fans are typically classified as losing streams as surface water infiltrates into the sub surface and the channel is often disconnected from the saturated aquifer sophocleous 2002 kalbus et al 2006 chen et al 2013 the relationship between alluvial fans and their ephemeral streams is well documented in semi arid and arid regions due to their high importance as a water resource besbes et al 1978 abdulrazzak morel seytoux 1983 cuthbert et al 2016 in contrast alluvial fan ephemeral stream relationships in temperate humid climates are understudied despite significant work on fan formation and evolution wells harvey 1987 coulthard et al 2002 mather et al 2017 alluvial fans in temperate environments often experience continuous aquifer recharge through fan apex infiltration from a perennial stream this may result in a shallower water table and therefore stream aquifer connectivity maybe more frequent in temperate climates the broad goal of this paper is to contribute towards understanding the functioning of ephemeral streams situated on alluvial fans characterised by shallow aquifers in temperate regions it applies a combination of geophysical and hydrological approaches to a recently reconnected ephemeral stream which periodically flows across an alluvial fan transporting water and significant volumes of sediment into a river in nw england the specific objectives of this paper are to i characterise alluvial fan sedimentology and depositional architecture using geophysical methods ii assess the hydrological regime of an alluvial fan and its ephemeral stream and iii integrate alluvial fan hydrogeology with geophysical and geological knowledge to provide a detailed conceptual model of an alluvial fan aquifer focusing on the influence of subsurface hydrological processes on the functioning of the ephemeral channel 2 study area this research focuses on the upper part of the river ehen located in the lake district of nw england fig 1 a the river ehen has a catchment of 126 km2 quinlan et al 2015 and flows from ennerdale water lake south westwards to the irish sea ben gill is a first order ephemeral headwater tributary that naturally joined the river ehen immediately downstream from the outlet of ennerdale water ennerdale water is a natural post glacial lake but its water level and storage capacity were raised by the construction of a 1 3 m high weir in 1902 in 1971 ben gill was diverted away from the river ehen so that it discharged directly into the lake via a culvert fig 1 c the original channel that flowed across the fan a length of approx 300 m was infilled and over time terrestrialised however as part of a range of measures to improve the physical and ecological status of the river ehen ben gill was reconnected to the river in october 2014 this involved blocking off the culvert and re digging the lower 300 m section of channel across the alluvial fan following approximately its original course this effectively reconnected ben gill s headwater zone red area in fig 1 b to the fan further details can be found in marteau et al 2017 2018 ben gill has a steep small catchment area of 0 54 km2 and its response to rainfall is flashy average annual rainfall is 2000 mm y 1 with autumn and winter months typically receiving more rainfall than spring and summer months potential evapotranspiration is estimated at 450 mm y 1 peaking at 75 mm month during june and july ceh 2020 the reconnected channel 15 of ben gill s total length is ephemeral flowing for approximately 20 of the time upper ben gill 85 of ben gill s total length is perennial flowing all year round the ephemeral part of the channel runs across the fan during baseflow all water discharging from the upper catchment infiltrates at the fan apex where the ben gill catchment meets the alluvial fan in fig 1 b the river ehen into which ben gill discharges is a designated site of special scientific interest sssi and special area of conservation sac supporting england s largest remaining population of the endangered freshwater mussel recent ecological surveys showed a lack of juvenile freshwater mussel recruitment in the upper river ehen killeen moorkens 2013 o leary 2013 which was attributed to a lack of suitable river sediment and a lack of geomorphic activity resulting in a heavily paved channel bed substrate quinlan 2014 quinlan et al 2015 concerns over the river s deteriorating habitat provided the impetus for a restoration project which included the reconnection of the ben gill ephemeral tributary which had been disconnected from the upper river ehen for 43 years marteau et al 2020a 2020b 3 methods 3 1 sedimentological data outcrops exposed to 1 2 m depth along the banks of the alluvial fan channel were examined and lithofacies were identified according to grainsize sorting roundness and internal features i e imbrication graded bedding interpretations were based on transportation and depositional processes ten sedimentary logs derived from shallow 4 m sediment cores during piezometer installation provided additional data to tie in with geophysical data these logs described composition grainsize roundness colour and lithological boundary depths for descriptive purposes the alluvial fan was subdivided into three zones the proximal fan zone or fan apex is where the perennial ben gill stream infiltrates and the ephemeral ben gill channel begins the mid fan zone is the middle part of the alluvial fan whilst the distal fan zone incorporates the fan margins close to ennerdale water and the river ehen 3 2 geophysical investigations electrical resistivity tomography ert data from eight profiles total combined length 2 14 km collected on the alluvial fan were used to determine its geometry thickness and lateral extension and the variations in subsurface resistivity associated with its internal sedimentological characteristics profiles were collected with a syscal pro resistivity meter iris instruments orléans france using dipole dipole and multi gradient arrays with 4 cables of 18 electrodes each spaced at 2 5 3 or 5 m the roll along method moving of the first of the four electrode cables to the end of the transect once measurements on that section are completed was used to increase the lengths of some profiles in order to extend the profiles to cover the entire fan measured resistivity values were individually analysed and noise processed through filtering out extreme values associated with poor electrode contacts with the soil they were further inverted with topography using res2dinv ver 3 59 121 using a robust inversion and a horizontal model cell size of half the electrode spacing for the surveys with 2 5 3 or 5 m electrode spacing this resulted respectively in model horizontal resolutions of 1 25 1 5 or 2 5 m vertical resolutions of 1 2 3 95 m 1 2 4 1 m and 1 5 5 25 m and maximum depths of investigation of 20 25 and 50 m the cleaned inverted dipole dipole and multi gradient array data for each transect were then combined in res2dinv and data were contoured using surfer 13 software fan sedimentology was interpreted from resistivity values which in the study site are controlled by sediment porosity associated with grain size and sediment clay content conformably to waxman and smits model waxman smits 1968 interpretations were further calibrated using direct relationships with onsite outcrops sedimentary logs and typical resistivity ranges for unconsolidated sediments see best 2015 ground penetrating radar gpr surveys were undertaken across the fan in grid format and along the ert profiles total combined length of 4 11 km to provide high spatial resolution data on shallow sub surface discontinuities and heterogeneities including sedimentology and depositional characteristics geoscanner gekko 80 geoscanners boden sweden antennas in bistatic mode were used for data collection and gprsoft was used to filter and topographically correct the data radar facies were identified based on distinctive reflection packages observed within the profiles similar to studies carried out on alluvial fans by ékes friele 2003 hornung et al 2010 and franke et al 2015 penetration depths reached 4 7 5 m below which the data became too noisy to interpret 3 3 hydrological data 3 3 1 rainfall data daily and 15 minute rainfall data from 2016 onwards were obtained from the meteorological office s ennerdale telemetry rain gauge station number 591642 situated 500 m west of the ephemeral channel fig 1 records of rainfall were used to help interpret flow observations from time lapse imagery and to aid understanding of ben gill s hydrological functioning 3 3 2 streamflow data flows were monitored using a time lapse camera at the ben gill river ehen confluence from september 2017 to march 2020 enabling visualisation of flow duration and magnitude a flow category scale devised by quinlan et al 2015 was used to classify stream stage in the hourly images 0 no flow 1 low flow 2 moderate flow 3 high flow 4 very high flow for consistency categorisation was undertaken by the same person for the whole dataset streamflow probability associated with rainfall events of increasing magnitudes see fig 6 for details were calculated from time lapse imagery of 143 individual streamflows and the rainfall totals mm preceding each flow individual rainfall events were classified as periods of near continuous rainfall any period of no recorded rainfall exceeding three hours marked the end of an individual event the ephemeral channel had to be visibly dry based on time lapse imagery for at least six hours before the following streamflow to classify flows as separate events no streamflows resulted from rainfall events 3 mm in addition a 0 6 m high 90 degree v notch weir and encased solinst levelogger logging at 15 min intervals was installed in the upper ben gill catchment fig 1 b the water level above the weir crest was converted to discharge l s 1 using the standardised kindsvater shen equation q c 8 15 2 g tan θ 2 h 2 5 where c coefficient 0 578 and θ 90 h represents the height of the water above the weir crest resulting discharge data obtained from june 2019 to march 2020 were used to aid understanding of ben gill s hydrological regime data presented in fig 7 tracking of an advancing floodwave down the ephemeral channel was undertaken to monitor floodwave velocities and time taken for water to flow along the ephemeral reach this involved mapping the advancement from photographed observations and calculating velocities within the three fan zones see shanafield cook 2014 for details on floodwave front tracking river ehen discharge data 15 minute intervals from bleach green weir located 550 m downstream of the ben gill confluence fig 1 b were obtained from the environment agency ea from 2016 onwards ennerdale water lake level data at 15 minute intervals fig 1 b were also obtained through the environment agency 2016 onwards and river levels were logged immediately downstream of the confluence using a river logger inw smart sensor ct2x fixed to the underside of a footbridge see the cross marked in fig 2 from june 2018 to march 2020 3 3 3 groundwater monitoring ten shallow piezometers 4 m depth 0 15 m diameter were installed across the mid fan and distal fan zones using a dando terrier coring rig the piezometers were lined with slotted pvc casing 1 3 m depending on the coring depth at the base and 0 6 1 m of impermeable pvc casing at the top 0 05 m diameter they were sealed using bentonite pellets and capped with metal covers five of these piezometers p1 p5 were instrumented with loggers recording groundwater levels at 15 minute intervals solinst levelogger edge 3001 sondes fig 2 the other five piezometers were periodically monitored using a dip meter though most of these failed to intercept the water table no piezometers were drilled in the proximal fan zone as the drilling technique was unsuitable due to coarse cobble and boulder deposits and deeper piezometers would have been required to intercept the water table piezometric level data extend from june 2018 to march 2020 slug tests were performed on piezometers p1 to p5 see fig 2 during august 2019 to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity values 30 l of water were instantaneously injected into each piezometer and the water level drawdown was recorded over time using a levelogger solinst levelogger edge until levels returned to base level or stabilised each piezometer was tested twice slug test results were interpreted in aqtesolv pro software using the bouwer and rice 1976 and hvorslev 1951 solutions using visual curve matching for an unconfined aquifer model both tests for each piezometer yielded very similar results with low standard deviations ranging 13 27 3 4 integrated hydrogeological conceptual modelling a conceptual hydrogeological model of the fan and its relationship with the ephemeral stream was developed through combining fan sedimentology and depositional architecture interpreted from outcrop sediment cores and geophysical data ert and gpr with hydrological monitoring data piezometric responses rainfall stream data and hydrogeological data k estimates from well test analysis the conceptual model followed the standard bgs aquifer productivity classification and terminology for aquifers with significant intergranular flow in the uk bgs 2020 as such likely aquifer productivity was estimated and classified ranging from low to high although reflecting to relative variability of the site rather than the uk wide classification 4 results 4 1 fan sedimentary structure 4 1 1 sedimentology outcrop observations and sediment cores were used to characterise shallow sub surface alluvial fan sedimentological features relevant to its hydrogeology in channel exposures revealed orange oxidised debris flow deposits ranging from matrix rich gravel poor beds to gravel and cobble rich clast supported beds typically 0 07 0 5 m thick palaeochannel streambed deposits composed of small boulders cobbles and gravels were also observed in the upper fan exposures in the proximal fan zone revealed 1 m thick debris flow deposits with boulder size clasts along with rockfall and colluvium anthropogenic deposits clay soil rubbish 2 m thick in places from the backfilling of the original channel were present around much of the restored ephemeral channel sediment cores revealed silty sandy gravels with some clay whilst matrix rich sandy silty clayey deposits with fewer clasts occurred in the mid fan at depths of 2 4 m fig 5 the ben gill fan mostly comprised of stacked debris flow deposits generally becoming more silty sandy matrix rich with a slight reduction in clast size toward the fan margins 4 1 2 ert insights ert surveys revealed a distinct resistivity contrast between alluvial fan sediments 400 7000 ohm m and the underlying clay rich glacial till 100 ohm m with the basal boundary clearly visible fig 3 fan sediments attained a maximum thickness of 20 m near the apex thinning towards the fan edge resistivity varied laterally and vertically across the alluvial fan fig 4 high resistivity coarse sediments formed most of the alluvial fan including the steep proximal debris cone where resistivity values largely exceeded 2000 ohm m up to over 5000 ohm m this debris cone was predominantly composed of coarse clast rich debris flow deposits in the distal fan zone and at depths of 2 5 7 5 m in the mid fan zone ert data suggested that the sediments were less coarse perhaps with a higher matrix component especially surrounding the present channel these sediments comprised sandy silty clayey debris flow deposits typically between 500 and 2000 ohm m some lower resistivity sediments around the present channel represented anthropogenic infill from the channel diversion works in the 1970 s this sediment frequently exposed in the present channel banks comprised clay and soil as well as waste material metal concrete wood etc away from this anthropogenic infill the zone of less coarse alluvial material was overlain by coarser sediments 4 1 3 gpr insights gpr penetration depths reached 4 7 5 m as wave propagation was limited by saturated ground and clayey soils gpr confirmed the heterogeneity of the fan sedimentology consisting of numerous debris flow transitional sheetflow and palaeochannel deposits proximal debris flow deposits showed features such as relief stacking and occasional erosional contacts high amplitude discontinuous wavy sigmoidal reflections were identified as coarse debris flow deposits whilst low amplitude poorly visible reflections represented clays silty clayey debris flow deposits and anthropogenic debris reflections were typically less chaotic in the distal fan zone with increased continuity suggesting dilute debris flow run out phase fluvial deposits coarse buried palaeochannels were identified across the alluvial fan fig 5 with some traceable across transects 4 1 4 integration of geophysical and sedimentological data sedimentological data acquired from outcrop exposures and sediment cores were correlated with gpr and ert data where possible fig 5 there was general agreement between gpr radar facies interpretations and the observed sedimentology of the uppermost 1 2 m of the exposed fan ert proved useful for identifying the fan s lateral and vertical extent figs 2 3 and large scale structural and sedimentological heterogeneities within which were also visible in the sediment cores gpr data revealed palaeochannels erosive features and the stacked and directional nature of debris flow deposits within the fan a closer study of a gpr and ert transect fig 5 revealed debris flow deposits and an infilled palaeochannel cutting through pre existing fan deposits p2 intercepts this profile and its sediment core showed finer clast poor sediments below 2 3 m this corresponds closely to a reduction in resistivity values at this depth the eastern edge of the profile is partially exposed as an in channel outcrop fig 5 photo revealing matrix supported clast rich debris flow deposits 4 2 hydrology 4 2 1 general hydrology and hydrogeology ben gill and the alluvial fan aquifer responded rapidly to rainfall as did the main stem river ehen fig 7 the river ehen is naturally perennial and though partial hydrological disconnection occurs between the lake and river when the lake level is below weir crest compensation flow released via a fish pass ensures water continues to flow into the river during dry periods the upper river ehen is affected most by ben gill s ephemeral flows following sustained dry periods when lake levels are low and only compensation flow is coming from ennerdale water this scenario is most frequent during the spring and summer months the ephemeral channel was typically activated when discharge in ben gill s upper catchment above the fan apex exceeded 60 l s 1 rainfall and ephemeral flows studied over a three year period march 2017 march 2020 showed that the probability of a flow occurring exceeded 0 5 following a rainfall event of 9 11 mm fig 6 seasonality had an impact on the likelihood of a flow occurring with higher rainfall totals required to trigger a flow in the summer april september compared to the winter october march fig 6 small rainfall events 3 11 mm were more than twice as likely to result in streamflow during the winter months compared to the summer months fig 6 during the study period only one rainfall event exceeding 24 mm failed to result in a channel flow this occurring after a prolonged dry period during rainfall events without a flow groundwater level increases were often observed across the fan e g december 14th fig 7 mean groundwater levels were highest in piezometer 2 p2 fig 7 situated in the mid fan zone compared to mean levels the distal fan zone p1 p3 p5 confirming a groundwater gradient from the fan apex to the distal fan mean groundwater levels in the distal fan were highest in p4 p5 and lowest in p1 suggesting a subsidiary groundwater flow gradient across the distal fan from the south east to the north west groundwater response times to persistent rainfall were typically in the order of a few hours with p2 in the mid fan responding first due to its proximity to the fan apex recharge zone groundwater levels in p2 remained below streambed levels throughout flow events whereas groundwater levels in p3 in the lower fan frequently exceeded streambed levels during flows fig 7 during dry conditions groundwater levels in the lower fan were typically two metres below streambed levels with lake levels exceeding groundwater levels in p1 and p3 despite the steepest channel gradient being situated in the proximal fan zone floodwave front tracking of an advancing flow revealed highest flow velocities in the mid fan zone 0 11 m s compared to velocities in the proximal 0 006 m s and distal fan zones 0 034 m s once the floodwave entered the mid fan zone it took an hour to reach the river ehen 4 2 2 aquifer hydraulic testing hydraulic conductivity k values estimated using the bouwer and rice 1976 and hvorslev 1951 solutions from slug tests were consistent and ranged from 4 6 10 6 to 2 9 10 5 m s table 1 4 3 alluvial fan hydrodynamics the magnitude of individual piezometric responses to rainfall events varied with observed groundwater level increases in p2 and p3 frequently 100 greater over the same period compared to increases in p1 p4 and p5 fig 7 p2 and p3 located within predominantly fine clayey sandy matrix dominated sediments exhibited lower k values in the order of 10 6 m s this contrasted with piezometers p1 p4 and p5 located within coarser clast rich sediments which exhibited lower amplitude groundwater level responses and higher k values 2 5 times higher in the order of 10 5 m s groundwater levels during dry conditions remained below the base of p2 though following rainfall p2 exhibited high amplitude responses the lowest head amplitude responses and highest k values were observed in p5 situated within the coarser gravel rich sediments near the fan margin 5 discussion 5 1 aquifer conceptual model the conceptual hydrogeological model indicates aquifer heterogeneity which would affect groundwater flow paths relative aquifer productivity surface water flow paths and stream aquifer interactions cross sections highlight the important vertical heterogeneity the perennial section of ben gill stream above the fan apex exhibits a flashy response to rainfall events and ephemeral flows typically commence when upper ben gill discharge reaches 60 l s 1 exceeding fan apex infiltrates rates the magnitude of rainfall required to initiate a flow varies depending on the antecedent catchment conditions and time of year though rainfall events exceeding 9 11 mm within a day generally result in a flow catchment conditions typically remain saturated during the winter months due to low evapotranspiration and greater rainfall resulting in increased runoff and more frequent flows groundwater levels in the fan are generally higher during the winter october march compared to the summer april september though there is no clear correlation between preceding groundwater levels and the onset of flows aquifer productivity is highest in the proximal fan zone fig 8 where coarse permeable sediments are predominant this is where perennial ben gill infiltrates continuously recharging the shallow aquifer the model suggests reduced aquifer productivity with lower k values in the distal fan and in parts of the mid fan zone fig 8 b including around the present channel due to the presence of finer matrix rich debris flow deposits and anthropogenic material a major preferential groundwater flow path runs along the south eastern fan margin through coarse debris flow deposits and hillslope colluvium before discharging at a perennial spring at the eastern fan margin fig 8 a location d coarse palaeochannel deposits observed throughout the fan are also likely to form preferential groundwater flow pathways within the aquifer as reported in other studies such as elmahdy and mohamed 2015 and summerell et al 2014 the east of the alluvial fan aquifer extends beneath ennerdale water lake fig 8 where the overall groundwater flow gradient decreases from the aquifer to the lake fig 7 p4 levels are always above lake levels however groundwater levels in p1 and p3 often fall below lake levels suggesting a change in flow gradient with possible recharge from the lake at the northern edge of the aquifer in the distal fan supporting westward groundwater flow sub parallel to the river ehen this probably results from the effect of the weir in creating a sharp decrease in surface water levels between lake and river and therefore a decrease in the fan s groundwater base level boundary condition 5 2 stream aquifer interactions for 80 of the year the ephemeral channel is dry groundwater levels are below streambed levels and there is no direct hydraulic connection between the stream and groundwater figs 7 and 9 during most short lived and low discharge flows groundwater levels remain below the channel bed in ben gill indicating a losing stream however lower groundwater heads do not necessarily signify stream aquifer disconnection batlle aguilar et al 2015 along the ephemeral reach in the proximal fan zone high infiltration rates result in significant losses to groundwater during flow events as observed during floodwave front tracking partial stream aquifer connectivity is likely as sediments underlying the streambed rapidly become saturated in the mid fan zone less permeable clay rich sediments underlying the channel form a clogging layer reducing infiltration a common occurrence within streambeds shanafield et al 2020 lange et al 1998 floodwave velocity increases observed in the mid fan zone support reduced infiltration groundwater levels remain slightly below the streambed in the mid fan zone during flows but stream aquifer connectivity is likely as the transitional zone becomes saturated in the distal fan zone stream aquifer connectivity frequently occurs and the relationship i e gaining vs losing stream depends on groundwater levels there during minor ephemeral streamflow events or at the beginning of major events including during floodwave progression following dry periods i e characterised by low groundwater levels the channel acts as a losing stream fig 7c and fig 9 during following wet periods and associated streamflows the lower channel reach becomes a gaining stream as groundwater rises to or above the streambed level and discharges into the channel fig 9 this was observed during the latter stages of flow events when groundwater levels were near their highest but surface flows had begun to cease e g dec 10 11th fig 7 as the channels gradient and width remain similar the reduction in floodwave velocities in the distal fan zone indicate higher infiltration rates compared to the mid fan zone 5 3 wider implications geophysical investigations provided valuable insights into fan aquifer geometry and heterogeneity including likely groundwater flow paths similar to other geophysical studies on alluvial fans by amaya et al 2018 and boucher et al 2009 geophysics also revealed information on subsurface properties and areas of preferential infiltration underlying the ephemeral streambed ert gpr and other methods including electromagnetic conductivity are being increasingly used to evaluate streambed properties and locate areas of infiltration and groundwater recharge e g shanafield et al 2020 clifford binley 2010 as data collection is fast and straightforward the volume of water entering the alluvial fan apex and the sedimentological properties of the fan which affect streambed infiltration and aquifer recharge control the onset duration and magnitude of ephemeral flows alluvial fan aquifers in humid temperate environments may be constantly recharged by a perennial feeder stream resulting in permanent groundwater recharge at the fan apex with rapid groundwater level response times to rainfall and flows in the case of the ben gill alluvial fan this response time was typically a few hours in contrast alluvial fan aquifer recharge in arid and semi arid regions typically occurs during high intensity storms or seasonal rains resulting in extensive periods of stream aquifer disconnection without significant recharge scanlon et al 2006 abdulrazzak morel seytoux 1983 frequent rainfall and flows throughout the year in temperate humid environments help maintain a shallow water table and relatively high water content in the streambed subsurface vadose unsaturated zone wet antecedent conditions result in rapid and frequent ephemeral stream aquifer hydraulic connectivity compared to slower and infrequent connectivity in arid areas where the vadose zone is typically thicker and less saturated goodrich et al 2018 wang et al 2016 batlle aguilar cook 2012 though stream aquifer connectivity may occur quickly in temperate humid regions a shallow water table limits infiltration rates and creates temporary gaining stream conditions which contrasts with environments where the water table is deeper quichimbo et al 2020 high stream aquifer connectivity and reduced transmission losses along ephemeral channels may prolong flows increasing connectivity to their main rivers especially if groundwater discharges back into the stream in the distal fan as observed in ben gill ephemeral streams on alluvial fans have significant erosive power temporarily transporting large volumes of fine and coarse fan sediment and water downstream to the rivers into which they discharge impacting river geomorphology and flow characteristics marteau et al 2017 the reconnection of the ephemeral section of ben gill has resulted in the development of lateral gravel bars increased bed mobility and more dynamic flow in the uppermost river ehen potentially improving habitat for mussels and salmonid fish marteau et al 2020a 2020b however the reconnection also increased fine sediment in the upper river ehen from erosion of the fan sediments raising concerns over habitat for these species geophysical and sedimentological investigations indicate that most of the highly erodible fine sediments especially anthropogenic sediment are situated within the mid fan zone the mid fan zone channel banks have undergone up to 2 5 m of lateral erosion since october 2014 marteau et al 2017 but it is predicted that as ben gill continues to stabilise these fine sediments will gradually wash out of the system reducing future volumes of fine sediment entering the upper river ehen towards pre 1971 conditions the next research stages will involve further investigations of the ephemeral streambed hydraulic properties such as the methods described in shanafield cook 2014 and the development of numerical hydrogeological models of the fan these models will integrate data on groundwater and streamflow dynamics and associated sediment export from ben gill to help gain a predictive understanding of its flow regime and long term impacts on the river ehen this in turn will help determine the success of the restoration initiative and assist with future river management 6 conclusions alluvial fans and their aquifers in temperate humid climates exert a major control on the flow dynamics of their associated streams even when ephemeral these streams can significantly impact the hydrodynamics and ecosystems of the rivers into which they discharge so understanding their functioning is important from a river management perspective alluvial fan sedimentology characterised using electrical resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar was correlated with hydrological data forming a conceptual hydrogeological model indicating fan aquifer properties and stream aquifer relationships the flow regime of the ben gill ephemeral stream is controlled by the volumes of water entering the fan apex commonly via a perennial stream and fan apex infiltration rates capacity permanent aquifer recharge at the fan apex results in a highly responsive in magnitude and timing and relatively shallow water table ephemeral flows occur once discharge exceeds infiltration rate capacity at the apex which has been quantified to be about 60 l s 1 in upper ben gill with high rainfall and low evaporation throughout the year characterising temperate humid regions flows are frequent and subsurface conditions surrounding these channels remain partially saturated increasing potential stream aquifer connectivity coarse alluvial sediments which typically underly these ephemeral channels enable significant streambed infiltration during flows increasing stream aquifer connectivity in the distal fan zone full stream aquifer connectivity can occur during flows and groundwater may temporarily discharge back into the stream during the latter stages of flows a high degree of connectivity between ephemeral streams and their alluvial fan aquifers in temperate humid regions may prolong flows maintaining regular surface water and sediment supplies to the rivers into which they discharge a hydrogeological conceptual understanding of alluvial fans is a pre requisite to predictions of future flows sediment transport geomorphic adjustments and flow dynamics within the rivers they feed into this study of the ben gill tributary of the river ehen is crucial to help determine whether river restoration project goals are achieved the combined

4785,alluvial fans often support ephemeral streams whose flow regimes and sediment dynamics are strongly controlled by fan sedimentary characteristics and interactions with shallow groundwater aquifers the hydrogeology of such fans has most often been documented for large fans located within arid climate zones this research focuses on a small 0 075 km2 alluvial fan situated in a temperate high rainfall climate the lake district north west england an ephemeral stream flowing across this alluvial fan plays a key role in supplying water and sediment to the river ehen which is the focus of a habitat restoration initiative this study combines high spatial resolution near surface geophysics and outcrop data with hydrological data to characterise the hydrogeological properties of the

composed predominantly of permeable debris flow deposits and numerous palaeochannels which may provide preferential groundwater flow paths during streamflows partial to full stream aquifer

introduction ephemeral streams are abundant and widely distributed throughout the world often providing an important source of recharge water for their underlying aquifers whilst also supplying water and sediment to the rivers into which they discharge abdulrazzak morel seytoux 1983 marteau et al 2017 ephemeral streams form diverse ecosystems but are also important for other ecosystems downstream boulton 2014 stubbington et al 2018 a varied range of ephemeral and intermittent streams exist in temperate humid environments stubbington et al 2017 though some of these systems have been studied e g groundwater fed systems in chalk and limestone catchments grapes et al 2005 sefton et al 2019 the functioning of ephemeral streams situated on alluvial fans in these environments has received little attention river restoration to enhance physical ecological or water quality status is an increasingly widespread practice and reconnecting formerly diverted tributaries to their main rivers is one way to help improve main stem integrity england et al 2008 despite their small size and intermittent flow there is growing evidence that ephemeral streams can significantly influence their main stem rivers mcdonough et al 2011 tena et al 2012 marteau et al 2017 marteau 2017 however little is known about reconnecting ephemeral tributaries to restore fluvial processes in main rivers in temperate environments marteau et al 2017 especially when these streams cross alluvial fans where groundwater surface water interactions and stream flow regime are highly controlled by alluvial fan sedimentology bull 1977 1997 understanding the dynamics of such streams is critical when they form part of river restoration efforts to help ensure that project objectives are met and lessons learned can inform better design of similar projects alluvial fans are depositional features often located at the base of a mountain front in areas of high sediment generation where there is a loss of sediment transport capacity or stream power typically in zones of decreased confinement harvey 2010 bowman 2019 hydrological studies reveal the significant storage and buffering capacity of alluvial fans herron wilson 2001 woods et al 2006 often forming important groundwater reservoirs individual fans can host high yield aquifer systems neton et al 1994 hu et al 2010 with hydraulic conductivity distributions controlled by the heterogeneity and variable connectivity of deposits cehrs 1979 weissmann et al 2002 heterogeneity is commonly abrupt and directional neton et al 1994 individual alluvial fans may show distinctly different aquifer properties and hydraulic conductivity can vary over many orders of magnitude depending on composition and facies relationships neton et al 1994 zhu et al 2017 fan apex infiltration exerts a major influence on alluvial fan aquifer recharge blainey pelletier 2008 and this infiltration rate strongly controls hydrological processes on the fan surface ephemeral streams on alluvial fans are typically classified as losing streams as surface water infiltrates into the sub surface and the channel is often disconnected from the saturated aquifer sophocleous 2002 kalbus et al 2006 chen et al 2013 the relationship between alluvial fans and their ephemeral streams is well documented in semi arid and arid regions due to their high importance as a water resource besbes et al 1978 abdulrazzak morel seytoux 1983 cuthbert et al 2016 in contrast alluvial fan ephemeral stream relationships in temperate humid climates are understudied despite significant work on fan formation and evolution wells harvey 1987 coulthard et al 2002 mather et al 2017 alluvial fans in temperate environments often experience continuous aquifer recharge through fan apex infiltration from a perennial stream this may result in a shallower water table and therefore stream aquifer connectivity maybe more frequent in temperate climates the broad goal of this paper is to contribute towards understanding the functioning of ephemeral streams situated on alluvial fans characterised by shallow aquifers in temperate regions it applies a combination of geophysical and hydrological approaches to a recently reconnected ephemeral stream which periodically flows across an alluvial fan transporting water and significant volumes of sediment into a river in nw england the specific objectives of this paper are to i characterise alluvial fan sedimentology and depositional architecture using geophysical methods ii assess the hydrological regime of an alluvial fan and its ephemeral stream and iii integrate alluvial fan hydrogeology with geophysical and geological knowledge to provide a detailed conceptual model of an alluvial fan aquifer focusing on the influence of subsurface hydrological processes on the functioning of the ephemeral channel 2 study area this research focuses on the upper part of the river ehen located in the lake district of nw england fig 1 a the river ehen has a catchment of 126 km2 quinlan et al 2015 and flows from ennerdale water lake south westwards to the irish sea ben gill is a first order ephemeral headwater tributary that naturally joined the river ehen immediately downstream from the outlet of ennerdale water ennerdale water is a natural post glacial lake but its water level and storage capacity were raised by the construction of a 1 3 m high weir in 1902 in 1971 ben gill was diverted away from the river ehen so that it discharged directly into the lake via a culvert fig 1 c the original channel that flowed across the fan a length of approx 300 m was infilled and over time terrestrialised however as part of a range of measures to improve the physical and ecological status of the river ehen ben gill was reconnected to the river in october 2014 this involved blocking off the culvert and re digging the lower 300 m section of channel across the alluvial fan following approximately its original course this effectively reconnected ben gill s headwater zone red area in fig 1 b to the fan further details can be found in marteau et al 2017 2018 ben gill has a steep small catchment area of 0 54 km2 and its response to rainfall is flashy average annual rainfall is 2000 mm y 1 with autumn and winter months typically receiving more rainfall than spring and summer months potential evapotranspiration is estimated at 450 mm y 1 peaking at 75 mm month during june and july ceh 2020 the reconnected channel 15 of ben gill s total length is ephemeral flowing for approximately 20 of the time upper ben gill 85 of ben gill s total length is perennial flowing all year round the ephemeral part of the channel runs across the fan during baseflow all water discharging from the upper catchment infiltrates at the fan apex where the ben gill catchment meets the alluvial fan in fig 1 b the river ehen into which ben gill discharges is a designated site of special scientific interest sssi and special area of conservation sac supporting england s largest remaining population of the endangered freshwater mussel recent ecological surveys showed a lack of juvenile freshwater mussel recruitment in the upper river ehen killeen moorkens 2013 o leary 2013 which was attributed to a lack of suitable river sediment and a lack of geomorphic activity resulting in a heavily paved channel bed substrate quinlan 2014 quinlan et al 2015 concerns over the river s deteriorating habitat provided the impetus for a restoration project which included the reconnection of the ben gill ephemeral tributary which had been disconnected from the upper river ehen for 43 years marteau et al 2020a 2020b 3 methods 3 1 sedimentological data outcrops exposed to 1 2 m depth along the banks of the alluvial fan channel were examined and lithofacies were identified according to grainsize sorting roundness and internal features i e imbrication graded bedding interpretations were based on transportation and depositional processes ten sedimentary logs derived from shallow 4 m sediment cores during piezometer installation provided additional data to tie in with geophysical data these logs described composition grainsize roundness colour and lithological boundary depths for descriptive purposes the alluvial fan was subdivided into three zones the proximal fan zone or fan apex is where the perennial ben gill stream infiltrates and the ephemeral ben gill channel begins the mid fan zone is the middle part of the alluvial fan whilst the distal fan zone incorporates the fan margins close to ennerdale water and the river ehen 3 2 geophysical investigations electrical resistivity tomography ert data from eight profiles total combined length 2 14 km collected on the alluvial fan were used to determine its geometry thickness and lateral extension and the variations in subsurface resistivity associated with its internal sedimentological characteristics profiles were collected with a syscal pro resistivity meter iris instruments orléans france using dipole dipole and multi gradient arrays with 4 cables of 18 electrodes each spaced at 2 5 3 or 5 m the roll along method moving of the first of the four electrode cables to the end of the transect once measurements on that section are completed was used to increase the lengths of some profiles in order to extend the profiles to cover the entire fan measured resistivity values were individually analysed and noise processed through filtering out extreme values associated with poor electrode contacts with the soil they were further inverted with topography using res2dinv ver 3 59 121 using a robust inversion and a horizontal model cell size of half the electrode spacing for the surveys with 2 5 3 or 5 m electrode spacing this resulted respectively in model horizontal resolutions of 1 25 1 5 or 2 5 m vertical resolutions of 1 2 3 95 m 1 2 4 1 m and 1 5 5 25 m and maximum depths of investigation of 20 25 and 50 m the cleaned inverted dipole dipole and multi gradient array data for each transect were then combined in res2dinv and data were contoured using surfer 13 software fan sedimentology was interpreted from resistivity values which in the study site are controlled by sediment porosity associated with grain size and sediment clay content conformably to waxman and smits model waxman smits 1968 interpretations were further calibrated using direct relationships with onsite outcrops sedimentary logs and typical resistivity ranges for unconsolidated sediments see best 2015 ground penetrating radar gpr surveys were undertaken across the fan in grid format and along the ert profiles total combined length of 4 11 km to provide high spatial resolution data on shallow sub surface discontinuities and heterogeneities including sedimentology and depositional characteristics geoscanner gekko 80 geoscanners boden sweden antennas in bistatic mode were used for data collection and gprsoft was used to filter and topographically correct the data radar facies were identified based on distinctive reflection packages observed within the profiles similar to studies carried out on alluvial fans by ékes friele 2003 hornung et al 2010 and franke et al 2015 penetration depths reached 4 7 5 m below which the data became too noisy to interpret 3 3 hydrological data 3 3 1 rainfall data daily and 15 minute rainfall data from 2016 onwards were obtained from the meteorological office s ennerdale telemetry rain gauge station number 591642 situated 500 m west of the ephemeral channel fig 1 records of rainfall were used to help interpret flow observations from time lapse imagery and to aid understanding of ben gill s hydrological functioning 3 3 2 streamflow data flows were monitored using a time lapse camera at the ben gill river ehen confluence from september 2017 to march 2020 enabling visualisation of flow duration and magnitude a flow category scale devised by quinlan et al 2015 was used to classify stream stage in the hourly images 0 no flow 1 low flow 2 moderate flow 3 high flow 4 very high flow for consistency categorisation was undertaken by the same person for the whole dataset streamflow probability associated with rainfall events of increasing magnitudes see fig 6 for details were calculated from time lapse imagery of 143 individual streamflows and the rainfall totals mm preceding each flow individual rainfall events were classified as periods of near continuous rainfall any period of no recorded rainfall exceeding three hours marked the end of an individual event the ephemeral channel had to be visibly dry based on time lapse imagery for at least six hours before the following streamflow to classify flows as separate events no streamflows resulted from rainfall events 3 mm in addition a 0 6 m high 90 degree v notch weir and encased solinst levelogger logging at 15 min intervals was installed in the upper ben gill catchment fig 1 b the water level above the weir crest was converted to discharge l s 1 using the standardised kindsvater shen equation q c 8 15 2 g tan θ 2 h 2 5 where c coefficient 0 578 and θ 90 h represents the height of the water above the weir crest resulting discharge data obtained from june 2019 to march 2020 were used to aid understanding of ben gill s hydrological regime data presented in fig 7 tracking of an advancing floodwave down the ephemeral channel was undertaken to monitor floodwave velocities and time taken for water to flow along the ephemeral reach this involved mapping the advancement from photographed observations and calculating velocities within the three fan zones see shanafield cook 2014 for details on floodwave front tracking river ehen discharge data 15 minute intervals from bleach green weir located 550 m downstream of the ben gill confluence fig 1 b were obtained from the environment agency ea from 2016 onwards ennerdale water lake level data at 15 minute intervals fig 1 b were also obtained through the environment agency 2016 onwards and river levels were logged immediately downstream of the confluence using a river logger inw smart sensor ct2x fixed to the underside of a footbridge see the cross marked in fig 2 from june 2018 to march 2020 3 3 3 groundwater monitoring ten shallow piezometers 4 m depth 0 15 m diameter were installed across the mid fan and distal fan zones using a dando terrier coring rig the piezometers were lined with slotted pvc casing 1 3 m depending on the coring depth at the base and 0 6 1 m of impermeable pvc casing at the top 0 05 m diameter they were sealed using bentonite pellets and capped with metal covers five of these piezometers p1 p5 were instrumented with loggers recording groundwater levels at 15 minute intervals solinst levelogger edge 3001 sondes fig 2 the other five piezometers were periodically monitored using a dip meter though most of these failed to intercept the water table no piezometers were drilled in the proximal fan zone as the drilling technique was unsuitable due to coarse cobble and boulder deposits and deeper piezometers would have been required to intercept the water table piezometric level data extend from june 2018 to march 2020 slug tests were performed on piezometers p1 to p5 see fig 2 during august 2019 to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity values 30 l of water were instantaneously injected into each piezometer and the water level drawdown was recorded over time using a levelogger solinst levelogger edge until levels returned to base level or stabilised each piezometer was tested twice slug test results were interpreted in aqtesolv pro software using the bouwer and rice 1976 and hvorslev 1951 solutions using visual curve matching for an unconfined aquifer model both tests for each piezometer yielded very similar results with low standard deviations ranging 13 27 3 4 integrated hydrogeological conceptual modelling a conceptual hydrogeological model of the fan and its relationship with the ephemeral stream was developed through combining fan sedimentology and depositional architecture interpreted from outcrop sediment cores and geophysical data ert and gpr with hydrological monitoring data piezometric responses rainfall stream data and hydrogeological data k estimates from well test analysis the conceptual model followed the standard bgs aquifer productivity classification and terminology for aquifers with significant intergranular flow in the uk bgs 2020 as such likely aquifer productivity was estimated and classified ranging from low to high although reflecting to relative variability of the site rather than the uk wide classification 4 results 4 1 fan sedimentary structure 4 1 1 sedimentology outcrop observations and sediment cores were used to characterise shallow sub surface alluvial fan sedimentological features relevant to its hydrogeology in channel exposures revealed orange oxidised debris flow deposits ranging from matrix rich gravel poor beds to gravel and cobble rich clast supported beds typically 0 07 0 5 m thick palaeochannel streambed deposits composed of small boulders cobbles and gravels were also observed in the upper fan exposures in the proximal fan zone revealed 1 m thick debris flow deposits with boulder size clasts along with rockfall and colluvium anthropogenic deposits clay soil rubbish 2 m thick in places from the backfilling of the original channel were present around much of the restored ephemeral channel sediment cores revealed silty sandy gravels with some clay whilst matrix rich sandy silty clayey deposits with fewer clasts occurred in the mid fan at depths of 2 4 m fig 5 the ben gill fan mostly comprised of stacked debris flow deposits generally becoming more silty sandy matrix rich with a slight reduction in clast size toward the fan margins 4 1 2 ert insights ert surveys revealed a distinct resistivity contrast between alluvial fan sediments 400 7000 ohm m and the underlying clay rich glacial till 100 ohm m with the basal boundary clearly visible fig 3 fan sediments attained a maximum thickness of 20 m near the apex thinning towards the fan edge resistivity varied laterally and vertically across the alluvial fan fig 4 high resistivity coarse sediments formed most of the alluvial fan including the steep proximal debris cone where resistivity values largely exceeded 2000 ohm m up to over 5000 ohm m this debris cone was predominantly composed of coarse clast rich debris flow deposits in the distal fan zone and at depths of 2 5 7 5 m in the mid fan zone ert data suggested that the sediments were less coarse perhaps with a higher matrix component especially surrounding the present channel these sediments comprised sandy silty clayey debris flow deposits typically between 500 and 2000 ohm m some lower resistivity sediments around the present channel represented anthropogenic infill from the channel diversion works in the 1970 s this sediment frequently exposed in the present channel banks comprised clay and soil as well as waste material metal concrete wood etc away from this anthropogenic infill the zone of less coarse alluvial material was overlain by coarser sediments 4 1 3 gpr insights gpr penetration depths reached 4 7 5 m as wave propagation was limited by saturated ground and clayey soils gpr confirmed the heterogeneity of the fan sedimentology consisting of numerous debris flow transitional sheetflow and palaeochannel deposits proximal debris flow deposits showed features such as relief stacking and occasional erosional contacts high amplitude discontinuous wavy sigmoidal reflections were identified as coarse debris flow deposits whilst low amplitude poorly visible reflections represented clays silty clayey debris flow deposits and anthropogenic debris reflections were typically less chaotic in the distal fan zone with increased continuity suggesting dilute debris flow run out phase fluvial deposits coarse buried palaeochannels were identified across the alluvial fan fig 5 with some traceable across transects 4 1 4 integration of geophysical and sedimentological data sedimentological data acquired from outcrop exposures and sediment cores were correlated with gpr and ert data where possible fig 5 there was general agreement between gpr radar facies interpretations and the observed sedimentology of the uppermost 1 2 m of the exposed fan ert proved useful for identifying the fan s lateral and vertical extent figs 2 3 and large scale structural and sedimentological heterogeneities within which were also visible in the sediment cores gpr data revealed palaeochannels erosive features and the stacked and directional nature of debris flow deposits within the fan a closer study of a gpr and ert transect fig 5 revealed debris flow deposits and an infilled palaeochannel cutting through pre existing fan deposits p2 intercepts this profile and its sediment core showed finer clast poor sediments below 2 3 m this corresponds closely to a reduction in resistivity values at this depth the eastern edge of the profile is partially exposed as an in channel outcrop fig 5 photo revealing matrix supported clast rich debris flow deposits 4 2 hydrology 4 2 1 general hydrology and hydrogeology ben gill and the alluvial fan aquifer responded rapidly to rainfall as did the main stem river ehen fig 7 the river ehen is naturally perennial and though partial hydrological disconnection occurs between the lake and river when the lake level is below weir crest compensation flow released via a fish pass ensures water continues to flow into the river during dry periods the upper river ehen is affected most by ben gill s ephemeral flows following sustained dry periods when lake levels are low and only compensation flow is coming from ennerdale water this scenario is most frequent during the spring and summer months the ephemeral channel was typically activated when discharge in ben gill s upper catchment above the fan apex exceeded 60 l s 1 rainfall and ephemeral flows studied over a three year period march 2017 march 2020 showed that the probability of a flow occurring exceeded 0 5 following a rainfall event of 9 11 mm fig 6 seasonality had an impact on the likelihood of a flow occurring with higher rainfall totals required to trigger a flow in the summer april september compared to the winter october march fig 6 small rainfall events 3 11 mm were more than twice as likely to result in streamflow during the winter months compared to the summer months fig 6 during the study period only one rainfall event exceeding 24 mm failed to result in a channel flow this occurring after a prolonged dry period during rainfall events without a flow groundwater level increases were often observed across the fan e g december 14th fig 7 mean groundwater levels were highest in piezometer 2 p2 fig 7 situated in the mid fan zone compared to mean levels the distal fan zone p1 p3 p5 confirming a groundwater gradient from the fan apex to the distal fan mean groundwater levels in the distal fan were highest in p4 p5 and lowest in p1 suggesting a subsidiary groundwater flow gradient across the distal fan from the south east to the north west groundwater response times to persistent rainfall were typically in the order of a few hours with p2 in the mid fan responding first due to its proximity to the fan apex recharge zone groundwater levels in p2 remained below streambed levels throughout flow events whereas groundwater levels in p3 in the lower fan frequently exceeded streambed levels during flows fig 7 during dry conditions groundwater levels in the lower fan were typically two metres below streambed levels with lake levels exceeding groundwater levels in p1 and p3 despite the steepest channel gradient being situated in the proximal fan zone floodwave front tracking of an advancing flow revealed highest flow velocities in the mid fan zone 0 11 m s compared to velocities in the proximal 0 006 m s and distal fan zones 0 034 m s once the floodwave entered the mid fan zone it took an hour to reach the river ehen 4 2 2 aquifer hydraulic testing hydraulic conductivity k values estimated using the bouwer and rice 1976 and hvorslev 1951 solutions from slug tests were consistent and ranged from 4 6 10 6 to 2 9 10 5 m s table 1 4 3 alluvial fan hydrodynamics the magnitude of individual piezometric responses to rainfall events varied with observed groundwater level increases in p2 and p3 frequently 100 greater over the same period compared to increases in p1 p4 and p5 fig 7 p2 and p3 located within predominantly fine clayey sandy matrix dominated sediments exhibited lower k values in the order of 10 6 m s this contrasted with piezometers p1 p4 and p5 located within coarser clast rich sediments which exhibited lower amplitude groundwater level responses and higher k values 2 5 times higher in the order of 10 5 m s groundwater levels during dry conditions remained below the base of p2 though following rainfall p2 exhibited high amplitude responses the lowest head amplitude responses and highest k values were observed in p5 situated within the coarser gravel rich sediments near the fan margin 5 discussion 5 1 aquifer conceptual model the conceptual hydrogeological model indicates aquifer heterogeneity which would affect groundwater flow paths relative aquifer productivity surface water flow paths and stream aquifer interactions cross sections highlight the important vertical heterogeneity the perennial section of ben gill stream above the fan apex exhibits a flashy response to rainfall events and ephemeral flows typically commence when upper ben gill discharge reaches 60 l s 1 exceeding fan apex infiltrates rates the magnitude of rainfall required to initiate a flow varies depending on the antecedent catchment conditions and time of year though rainfall events exceeding 9 11 mm within a day generally result in a flow catchment conditions typically remain saturated during the winter months due to low evapotranspiration and greater rainfall resulting in increased runoff and more frequent flows groundwater levels in the fan are generally higher during the winter october march compared to the summer april september though there is no clear correlation between preceding groundwater levels and the onset of flows aquifer productivity is highest in the proximal fan zone fig 8 where coarse permeable sediments are predominant this is where perennial ben gill infiltrates continuously recharging the shallow aquifer the model suggests reduced aquifer productivity with lower k values in the distal fan and in parts of the mid fan zone fig 8 b including around the present channel due to the presence of finer matrix rich debris flow deposits and anthropogenic material a major preferential groundwater flow path runs along the south eastern fan margin through coarse debris flow deposits and hillslope colluvium before discharging at a perennial spring at the eastern fan margin fig 8 a location d coarse palaeochannel deposits observed throughout the fan are also likely to form preferential groundwater flow pathways within the aquifer as reported in other studies such as elmahdy and mohamed 2015 and summerell et al 2014 the east of the alluvial fan aquifer extends beneath ennerdale water lake fig 8 where the overall groundwater flow gradient decreases from the aquifer to the lake fig 7 p4 levels are always above lake levels however groundwater levels in p1 and p3 often fall below lake levels suggesting a change in flow gradient with possible recharge from the lake at the northern edge of the aquifer in the distal fan supporting westward groundwater flow sub parallel to the river ehen this probably results from the effect of the weir in creating a sharp decrease in surface water levels between lake and river and therefore a decrease in the fan s groundwater base level boundary condition 5 2 stream aquifer interactions for 80 of the year the ephemeral channel is dry groundwater levels are below streambed levels and there is no direct hydraulic connection between the stream and groundwater figs 7 and 9 during most short lived and low discharge flows groundwater levels remain below the channel bed in ben gill indicating a losing stream however lower groundwater heads do not necessarily signify stream aquifer disconnection batlle aguilar et al 2015 along the ephemeral reach in the proximal fan zone high infiltration rates result in significant losses to groundwater during flow events as observed during floodwave front tracking partial stream aquifer connectivity is likely as sediments underlying the streambed rapidly become saturated in the mid fan zone less permeable clay rich sediments underlying the channel form a clogging layer reducing infiltration a common occurrence within streambeds shanafield et al 2020 lange et al 1998 floodwave velocity increases observed in the mid fan zone support reduced infiltration groundwater levels remain slightly below the streambed in the mid fan zone during flows but stream aquifer connectivity is likely as the transitional zone becomes saturated in the distal fan zone stream aquifer connectivity frequently occurs and the relationship i e gaining vs losing stream depends on groundwater levels there during minor ephemeral streamflow events or at the beginning of major events including during floodwave progression following dry periods i e characterised by low groundwater levels the channel acts as a losing stream fig 7c and fig 9 during following wet periods and associated streamflows the lower channel reach becomes a gaining stream as groundwater rises to or above the streambed level and discharges into the channel fig 9 this was observed during the latter stages of flow events when groundwater levels were near their highest but surface flows had begun to cease e g dec 10 11th fig 7 as the channels gradient and width remain similar the reduction in floodwave velocities in the distal fan zone indicate higher infiltration rates compared to the mid fan zone 5 3 wider implications geophysical investigations provided valuable insights into fan aquifer geometry and heterogeneity including likely groundwater flow paths similar to other geophysical studies on alluvial fans by amaya et al 2018 and boucher et al 2009 geophysics also revealed information on subsurface properties and areas of preferential infiltration underlying the ephemeral streambed ert gpr and other methods including electromagnetic conductivity are being increasingly used to evaluate streambed properties and locate areas of infiltration and groundwater recharge e g shanafield et al 2020 clifford binley 2010 as data collection is fast and straightforward the volume of water entering the alluvial fan apex and the sedimentological properties of the fan which affect streambed infiltration and aquifer recharge control the onset duration and magnitude of ephemeral flows alluvial fan aquifers in humid temperate environments may be constantly recharged by a perennial feeder stream resulting in permanent groundwater recharge at the fan apex with rapid groundwater level response times to rainfall and flows in the case of the ben gill alluvial fan this response time was typically a few hours in contrast alluvial fan aquifer recharge in arid and semi arid regions typically occurs during high intensity storms or seasonal rains resulting in extensive periods of stream aquifer disconnection without significant recharge scanlon et al 2006 abdulrazzak morel seytoux 1983 frequent rainfall and flows throughout the year in temperate humid environments help maintain a shallow water table and relatively high water content in the streambed subsurface vadose unsaturated zone wet antecedent conditions result in rapid and frequent ephemeral stream aquifer hydraulic connectivity compared to slower and infrequent connectivity in arid areas where the vadose zone is typically thicker and less saturated goodrich et al 2018 wang et al 2016 batlle aguilar cook 2012 though stream aquifer connectivity may occur quickly in temperate humid regions a shallow water table limits infiltration rates and creates temporary gaining stream conditions which contrasts with environments where the water table is deeper quichimbo et al 2020 high stream aquifer connectivity and reduced transmission losses along ephemeral channels may prolong flows increasing connectivity to their main rivers especially if groundwater discharges back into the stream in the distal fan as observed in ben gill ephemeral streams on alluvial fans have significant erosive power temporarily transporting large volumes of fine and coarse fan sediment and water downstream to the rivers into which they discharge impacting river geomorphology and flow characteristics marteau et al 2017 the reconnection of the ephemeral section of ben gill has resulted in the development of lateral gravel bars increased bed mobility and more dynamic flow in the uppermost river ehen potentially improving habitat for mussels and salmonid fish marteau et al 2020a 2020b however the reconnection also increased fine sediment in the upper river ehen from erosion of the fan sediments raising concerns over habitat for these species geophysical and sedimentological investigations indicate that most of the highly erodible fine sediments especially anthropogenic sediment are situated within the mid fan zone the mid fan zone channel banks have undergone up to 2 5 m of lateral erosion since october 2014 marteau et al 2017 but it is predicted that as ben gill continues to stabilise these fine sediments will gradually wash out of the system reducing future volumes of fine sediment entering the upper river ehen towards pre 1971 conditions the next research stages will involve further investigations of the ephemeral streambed hydraulic properties such as the methods described in shanafield cook 2014 and the development of numerical hydrogeological models of the fan these models will integrate data on groundwater and streamflow dynamics and associated sediment export from ben gill to help gain a predictive understanding of its flow regime and long term impacts on the river ehen this in turn will help determine the success of the restoration initiative and assist with future river management 6 conclusions alluvial fans and their aquifers in temperate humid climates exert a major control on the flow dynamics of their associated streams even when ephemeral these streams can significantly impact the hydrodynamics and ecosystems of the rivers into which they discharge so understanding their functioning is important from a river management perspective alluvial fan sedimentology characterised using electrical resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar was correlated with hydrological data forming a conceptual hydrogeological model indicating fan aquifer properties and stream aquifer relationships the flow regime of the ben gill ephemeral stream is controlled by the volumes of water entering the fan apex commonly via a perennial stream and fan apex infiltration rates capacity permanent aquifer recharge at the fan apex results in a highly responsive in magnitude and timing and relatively shallow water table ephemeral flows occur once discharge exceeds infiltration rate capacity at the apex which has been quantified to be about 60 l s 1 in upper ben gill with high rainfall and low evaporation throughout the year characterising temperate humid regions flows are frequent and subsurface conditions surrounding these channels remain partially saturated increasing potential stream aquifer connectivity coarse alluvial sediments which typically underly these ephemeral channels enable significant streambed infiltration during flows increasing stream aquifer connectivity in the distal fan zone full stream aquifer connectivity can occur during flows and groundwater may temporarily discharge back into the stream during the latter stages of flows a high degree of connectivity between ephemeral streams and their alluvial fan aquifers in temperate humid regions may prolong flows maintaining regular surface water and sediment supplies to the rivers into which they discharge a hydrogeological conceptual understanding of alluvial fans is a pre requisite to predictions of future flows sediment transport geomorphic adjustments and flow dynamics within the rivers they feed into this study of the ben gill tributary of the river ehen is crucial to help determine whether river restoration project goals are achieved the combined

4786,land surface models are important tools to represent and predict the spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration which is a key variable in terrestrial water energy and carbon cycles however evapotranspiration estimates from land surface models may suffer from various uncertainties in land surface modeling therefore assessing the performance of evapotranspiration simulation plays a vital role in understanding the deficiencies of land surface modeling most of the evaluation studies of modeled evapotranspiration relied on comparisons with flux site observations point scale and water budget derived evapotranspiration basin scale which have certain drawbacks and limitations thus the evaluation results may be misleading for understanding the performance of land surface models on representing the spatial variability of evapotranspiration in this study a thorough spatial evaluation of the new and reprocessed global land data assimilation system evapotranspiration products is performed across china based on three bias insensitive spatial evaluation methods including the empirical orthogonal function analysis the connectivity analysis and the fractions skill score these evapotranspiration products were estimated from three land surface models namely noah vic and clsm the conventional evapotranspiration evaluation against eddy covariance measurements is also performed the results show that all three products have consistent trends with the observed evapotranspiration series at both daily and monthly time scales noah and vic have comparable performances in terms of different statistic metrics and outperform clsm at both time scales the spatial evaluation methods can provide additional valuable information to diagnose the model errors vic has the worst spatial performance during the warm months despite its inferior performance in late winter and early spring noah overall has the best spatial performance among the three the gained insights of this study can help to improve the spatial performance of these models and further promote the system development keywords evapotranspiration land surface model gldas spatial evaluation china 1 introduction

al 2012 improving water resource management anderson et al 2011 2012 and so on currently there have been various methods developed to estimate et at point or field from regional to global scales these methods can be grouped into five main categories 1 the water balance method liu et al 2016 zeng et al 2014 2 upscaling of eddy covariance ec flux measurements at tower sites jung et al 2011 li et al 2018 xu et al 2018 3 machine learning based et estimation adnan et al 2020 alizamir et al 2020 granata 2019 granata et al 2020 4 satellite remote sensing rs based models martens et al 2017 mu et al 2007 5 land surface model lsm or hydrologic model simulation rodell et al 2004 srivastava et al 2020 sun et al 2017 xia et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 there is no consensus on which method is best as each category has its own advantages and disadvantages actually there are considerable overlaps among the categories for example machine learning methods could serve as one kind of upscaling methods jung et al 2011 while the machine learning methods in the third category are usually served as data driven models to estimate et with input forcing data satellite rs based et estimates rely on empirical or physical equations which use the related satellite observations to calculate et the penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 is a widely used satellite rs based physical model mu et al 2007 2011 and it is also embedded in many lsms and hydrologic models to compute et kumar et al 2017 moreover these empirical or physical equations can be also used alone with climatic forcing data deb et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 among the above mentioned methods lsms simulated et has been receiving increasing attention due to its unique merits sun et al 2017 lsms can produce long term gridded et datasets with relatively higher spatial temporal resolution at regional to global scales in addition to et lsms can be used to provide a consistent set of products of all fluxes and state variables under physical constraints zhang et al 2014 lsms also have the flexibility to use various in situ observations and satellite rs data some intercomparison studies have demonstrated that the offline land surface modeling when forced with high quality observations can provide better et estimates with smaller uncertainties compared to rs based et products and other kinds of et products long et al 2014 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2019 it should be noted that significant progress has been made in the development of regional and global land data assimilation systems ldass based on lsms the ldass aim at producing quality controlled long term spatially and temporally consistent fields of land surface states and fluxes by ingesting the best available observations rodell et al 2004 despite the continuing efforts to improve the accuracy of lsm simulations the errors of lsm based et estimates still cannot be neglected therefore comprehensive evaluations are essential for better understanding the uncertainties expanding their applications and motivating the model development there have been numerous studies bai et al 2018 khan et al 2018 long et al 2014 mueller et al 2011 peters lidard et al 2011 xia et al 2015 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 evaluating lsm based et estimates especially the et products from the north american ldas nldas mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 and the global ldas gldas rodell et al 2004 projects these evaluations are typically conducted at point scale using et from ec measurements and at basin scale using the water balance method derived et however ec systems are susceptible to the energy imbalance problem which could cause errors in the measurements wilson et al 2002 xu et al 2017 in addition the ec sites are usually scarce and the observed data is generally only available for a short time period with quite a few missing records due to the distinct spatial heterogeneity of et the applicability of et site observations is very limited for large scale evaluations the water balance method is regarded as a reliable method to provide accurate long term et estimates at basin scale however it cannot represent the spatial variability of et within the basin and its applicability is limited for small basins and relatively short time scales e g daily in addition uncertainty in water balance method derived et can even be higher than lsm based et long et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition to the limitations of the conventional et evaluation methods mentioned above the distributed process based lsms hardly increase our process understanding if only evaluated at point scale or basin scale moreover the evaluation results may be misleading for understanding the spatial predictability of lsm estimated et in fact the scientific community has been advocating the spatial pattern evaluation of distributed models using spatial observation data for almost two decades beven and feyen 2002 grayson et al 2002 refsgaard 2001 wealands et al 2005 recently some innovative bias insensitive spatial performance metrics have been applied to facilitate meaningful comparisons of spatial patterns of et mendiguren et al 2017 koch et al 2017 and other land surface variables fang et al 2015 koch et al 2015 2016 which could help to better assess and understand the spatial variability of land surface processes china stretches across a vast area covering a variety of climate regions and ecosystems and is facing many water issues the lsms in gldas can produce long term global et products with relatively high resolution up to 0 25 and 3 h in near real time along with et the global land surface fields provided by gldas could serve as important reference to support weather and climate prediction water resources management and water cycle studies in china recently the new and reprocessed gldas version 2 gldas 2 data products have been released even though the old version gldas et products have been evaluated over china in some previous studies bai et al 2018 ma et al 2019 wang et al 2016 the conventional evaluation methods conducted at point scale or basin scale cannot reflect the large spatial heterogeneity of et over china thus reducing the generalizability of the conclusions in another word the traditional evaluation paradigm can no longer keep up with the continues progress of using advanced lsms to develop large scale et estimates to our best knowledge there has been no study on spatial evaluation of lsm modeled et over china yet therefore the core novelty of this study is that for the first time a comprehensive spatial evaluation of the newly released gldas 2 et products is performed over china the spatial evaluation is based on three innovative bias insensitive spatial performance metrics including the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis the connectivity analysis renard and allard 2013 and the fractions skill score fss roberts and lean 2008 in addition this study also uses the ec measurements at 8 flux sites to evaluate the et products the main aims of this study are 1 to assess the performance of the lsms in the upgraded gldas for estimating et and provide reference for further development of model parameterization schemes and calibration methods 2 to investigate the unique advantages of the spatial performance metrics which can enrich the et evaluation approaches of the land surface and hydrological modeling communities the following section describes the gldas 2 et products the ec based et observations and et data used as reference for spatial evaluation section 2 section 3 gives a detailed introduction of the evaluation methods section 4 presents comprehensive evaluations of the et products from three lsms in gldas section 5 presents detailed discussion of potential causes of the model deficiencies diagnosed by the spatial evaluations followed by conclusions in section 6 2 data 2 1 gldas et products gldas was developed jointly by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep the goal of gldas is to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes by ingesting satellite and ground based observational data products using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 gldas drives multiple offline lsms integrates a huge quantity of observation based data and executes globally at high resolutions 2 5 to 1 km enabled by the land information system lis kumar et al 2006 currently gldas includes four lsms noah chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 the catchment lsm clsm koster et al 2000 the community land model clm dai et al 2003 and the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 model gldas 2 has three components gldas 2 0 gldas 2 1 and gldas 2 2 gldas 2 0 is forced entirely with the princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014 gldas 2 1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present gldas 2 2 products use data assimilation whereas the gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 products have no data assimilation the latest gldas 2 has made major adjustments since november 2019 first with the upgraded lsms and updated forcing data sets the gldas 2 1 main production stream serves as a replacement for the old gldas version 1 gldas 1 products which were decommissioned in june 2020 second the gldas 2 0 noah products were reprocessed with updated princeton forcing v2 2 data and an upgraded version of noah model v3 6 in november and december 2019 in september 2020 gldas 2 0 vic and clsm products were publicly released third gldas 2 2 which explores the data assimilation capabilities in the lis is new to the data archive the gldas 2 2 products from clsm f2 5 with the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data assimilation were released in february 2020 the main objective of gldas 2 1 is to provide up to date global land surface model outputs while preserving consistency of the long term climatology i e gldas 2 0 to the extent possible therefore the gldas 2 1 et products from noah 3 6 clsm f2 5 and vic 4 1 2 are evaluated in this study all the gldas 2 1 products extend from 2000 to present with 3 hourly temporal resolution the et product from noah has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 while the other two have spatial resolutions of 1 1 2 2 eddy covariance measurements of et nowadays ec measurements of water vapor exchange and carbon dioxide are being made routinely on each continent since ec measurements can provide relatively accurate estimation of et at a given site the ec based et measurements of 8 flux measurement sites from chinaflux are used for evaluation chinaflux is an observation and research network that applies ec and chamber methods to measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide water vapor and energy between terrestrial ecosystem and atmosphere in china yu et al 2006 chinaflux has become an important part of the global network of flux measurement sites called fluxnet baldocchi et al 2001 and the main part of the regional network asiaflux currently the chinaflux network includes 79 sites consisting of 18 cropland sites 19 grassland sites 23 forest sites 15 wetland sites 2 desert sites 1 urban site and 1 waterbody site which encompass a large range of latitudes altitudes climates and ecosystem types among the 79 sites the flux measurements of the 8 sites used in this study are publicly available from http www chinaflux org the spatial distribution of the 8 stations is shown in fig 1 while table 1 lists their detailed information the provided daily latent heat flux data at the 8 sites are used to derive the actual et in units of water depth following mu et al 2011 in this study we perform the grid site comparison meaning that the et values of the gldas grid and the flux site that locates in that grid are directly compared at the same time scale daily and monthly 2 3 et reference data across china to perform a qualified spatial pattern evaluation of modeled et a reliable et reference dataset is a prerequisite recently ma et al 2019 developed a long term 1982 2017 monthly terrestrial et product with spatial resolution of 0 1 across china this dataset is derived from a recently proposed nonlinear complementary relationship cr formulation szilagyi et al 2017 the cr method as first introduced by bouchet 1963 emphasizes the feedback mechanism between actual et and potential et under the same environmental conditions the cr method has been regarded as an attractive tool for estimating actual et at large scale due to its minimal data requirement of only meteorological input interested readers can refer to ma et al 2019 for detailed information of this dataset which is available from the national tibetan plateau data center doi https doi org 10 11888 atmosphys tpe 249493 file ma et al 2019 conducted independent evaluation based on ec measurements and water balance method estimated et the results indicated that the cr based et product was very reliable further evaluations suggested that it showed improved accuracy over seven other mainstream et products therefore this cr based et product can serve as a suitable reference for our spatial evaluation the gldas 2 1 et products are resampled from its original resolutions to 0 1 through bilinear interpolation to provide consistency with the cr based et product 3 methodology 3 1 common statistic metrics three statistic metrics are used to conduct the grid site evaluations of gldas et products against ec measured et in this study the metrics include relative error re bias adjusted root mean square error armse and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the formulas are given by 1 re i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 2 armse 1 n i 1 n s i μ s o i μ o 2 3 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 β μ s μ o γ σ s σ o where n is the total number of events o i and s i are the i th pairs of ec measured et and gldas et μ o and μ s are their corresponding mean values in the kge equation r represents the linear correlation coefficient β and γ measure the bias and relative variability in the simulated and observed values σ s and σ o are the standard deviation of simulated and observed variables respectively bias measures the average tendency of model simulations to over or under estimate the observations and a value of 0 is perfect the armse is adopted to remove the systematic errors and show only the random errors the kge is designed to measure the euclidian distance from the ideal point in the three dimensional criteria space derived from the decomposition of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the optimal value of kge is 1 3 2 spatial evaluation methods the core content of this study is to perform true spatial evaluations of the gldas et products based on three bias insensitive spatial performance metrics namely eof analysis fss and connectivity analysis these metrics or methods are not novel and were originally developed for other purposes not until recently were they introduced to facilitate meaningful spatial validation of land surface variables in the hydrological and land surface modeling community fang et al 2015 koch et al 2015 2016 2017 to perform spatial evaluation all the gldas 2 1 et products are interpolated to 0 1 the same resolution as the cr based et product the detailed evaluation results are presented in section 4 and some methodology limitations are discussed in section 5 1 empirical orthogonal function eof analysis the method of eof also known as principal component analysis pca in statistics is a decomposition of a dataset in terms of orthogonal basis functions it is often used in atmosphere climate ocean and hydrology science to study possible spatial modes of variability and how they change with time the main feature of the eof analysis is that it seeks structures that explain the maximum amount of variance in a two dimensional dataset typically one dimension in the dataset is the space dimension and the other is the time dimension the eof decomposes a large spatiotemporal dataset into a set of mathematically orthogonal modes structures which are usually called eofs and a set of time series loadings that are related one to one to the eofs and quantify the amplitude of each eof over the period of record the first eof explains the largest amount of the variance more detailed description of the eof method can be referred to björnsson and venegas 1997 while the eof analysis is typically employed for analyzing the spatiotemporal variability of a single filed koch et al 2015 proposed the novel concept of performing a joint eof analysis on a combined data matrix that contains both reference and modeled data by doing so not only do the obtained eof maps represent the spatiotemporal variability of both datasets but also the difference between the loadings at each time step can be used as an indicator of spatial similarity koch et al 2016 to ensure a reliable pattern similarity score the loading deviation must be weighted according to the variance contribution of the corresponding eof the eof based similarity score between a reference dataset and a modeled map at time t can be formulated as 4 s eof t i 1 n w i l o a d i s l o a d i o where w i is the variance contribution of the ith eof n is the total number of orthogonal modes eofs loa d i s and loa d i o are the corresponding loadings of simulated and observed maps respectively in this study the monthly mean is removed from each et map prior to the eof analysis thus the method is based on the spatial anomalies which makes it bias insensitive 2 fractions skill score the fss is a scale selective method developed by roberts and lean 2008 to measure forecast skill of precipitation forecasts against spatial scale for a given threshold it uses the concept of nearest neighbors as the means of selecting the scales of interest this approach calculates the fractional coverage of binary events that have a value of 1 have exceeded the threshold in a given spatial window generally percentile thresholds are used for conversion into a binary field to remove the impact of bias when focusing on the spatial accuracy the main steps to obtain fss are as follows 1 convert the reference and the modeled spatial patterns into binary fields for a certain threshold 2 for each grid in every binary field obtained in the last step compute the fractions of grids with value of 1 within a given square window of length n 3 calculate the mean square error mse between the referenced and modeled fraction fields 4 obtain the final fss by normalizing the mse from last step with the largest possible mse that can be obtained from the modeled and referenced fractions for a certain threshold fss at spatial scale of n is expressed as 5 fs s n 1 1 n i 1 n o n i s n i 2 1 n i 1 n o n i 2 i 1 n s n i 2 where o n and s n are the resultant fields of referenced fractions and modeled fractions respectively n is the total number of valid grids in the domain the fss ranges from 0 complete mismatch to 1 perfect match as the size of the square windows used to compute the fractions becomes larger the fss will reaches an asymptote that depends on the ratio between the modeled and observed frequencies of the event the fss is bias insensitive due to the percentile thresholds used further information can be referred to roberts and lean 2008 3 connectivity analysis connectivity analysis is usually used in hydrogeology to quantify aquifer heterogeneity where the connectivity structure of the heterogeneity is understood as a property that strongly influences groundwater flow and solute transport renard and allard 2013 the studies of western et al 2001 and grayson et al 2002 were the early ones that applied the connectivity analysis to land surface variables connectivity can provide a reliable measure of the general structure and heterogeneity of spatial patterns which can be used to evaluate the spatial performance koch et al 2016 2017 to apply this methodology to a field of continuous variable renard and allard 2013 suggested the following steps 1 decompose the field into a series of binary maps by introducing a set of increasing thresholds 2 perform a cluster analysis on each of the binary map to identify connected clusters 3 use the percolation theory to describe the transition from many disconnected clusters to a large connected cluster hovadik and larue 2007 proposed to use the probability of connection as a suitable metric to quantify how percolated clusters are the metric γ t which is computed for the threshold t is formulated as 6 γ t 1 n t 2 i 1 n x t n i 2 where n t is the total number of grids in the binary map x t n x t represents the total number of distinct clusters and n i is the number of grids in the ith cluster like fss using percentiles makes this method bias insensitive and facilitates separate studies of clusters of a binary map above or below a threshold in this study we use a series of thresholds which move along all percentiles 1 100 of the et range therefore the rmse between the metrics of the reference field and modeled field for all thresholds can be computed to indicate the spatial similarity 7 rms e con t 1 100 γ t o γ t s 2 100 where γ t o and γ t s are the connectivity metrics of the reference and modeled field respectively interested readers can refer to renard and allard 2013 and koch et al 2016 for further details 4 results 4 1 grid site evaluation in this study the three gldas 2 1 et products are first validated against the ec measured et of 8 flux sites on both daily and monthly time scales in general all three gldas products have the consistent trends with the observed et series at all sites figs 2 and 3 moreover the et product from noah performs well in capturing the magnitude at the qyz and dx sites and so does the vic modeled et at the cbs and dhs sites however a closer inspection shows that there are overall overestimations or underestimations for some gldas et products at different sites which are clearly demonstrated in fig 4 specifically noah and clsm modeled et products show systematic positive biases at the four sites of the forest ecosystem and clsm is much worse especially at the xsbn site on the contrast vic shows systematic negative biases at two of the three grassland sites hb and dx the qyz forest site as well as the yc cropland site to further quantitatively evaluate the performances of the three gldas et products we calculate three statistic metrics on both daily and monthly time scales tables 2 and 3 it can be found that no single lsm consistently outperforms the others at all sites overall noah and vic have comparable performances while the former performs more stable and they all outperform clsm noah modeled et product has the highest kge values at more than half of the flux sites while vic modeled et product has the superiority in producing lower armse at more sites noah modeled et product has the leading performance for at least one site of each ecosystem type the highest kge values for each ecosystem type are all higher than 0 6 and 0 7 daily and monthly respectively vic performs better at the sites of the forest ecosystem than those of other ecosystem types while clsm performs better at the grassland sites and the cropland site it s noted that the metrics of armse and kge improve a lot when calculated on monthly time scale for nearly all lsms and sites indicating that the lsms modeled et products are more reliable on monthly time scale 4 2 spatial evaluation of et patterns fig 5 depicts the spatial distributions of multi year 2000 2015 mean annual et of the cr based reference dataset and the three gldas et products in general all of them present a consistent et pattern with the increasing amount gradient from northwest to southeast however there are large differences in the mean annual values among the three gldas products and the reference especially in the southeast china the northwestern tibetan plateau and the yangtze river basin among the three gldas lsms clsm generally produces the highest et values followed by noah and vic fig 6 further presents the seasonal mean et patterns of the reference and the three lsms during 2000 2015 in general the patterns of spring summer and autumn for the four et products can reflect their corresponding mean annual et patterns shown in fig 5 the winter et patterns have the least apparent spatial heterogeneity due to the minimum precipitation and energy in this season among the three lsms vic modeled et patterns have the smallest spatial variability especially for the winter season in addition clsm produces the highest et values across the seasons over vast parts of the northern china whereas vic modeled et products have the lowest et values from the above results we know that the three lsms show different error characteristics nevertheless different products may exhibit similar spatial patterns given their individual biases beck et al 2017 sun et al 2016 further evaluations are based on bias insensitive metrics as the point to point evaluation may not be reliable a eof analysis first we conduct the joint eof analyses for the cr based reference dataset and each of the gldas et product during the period of 2000 2015 therefore each eof analysis is computed based on the decomposition of a concatenated spatiotemporal matrix of 384 monthly et maps with spatial mean removed because of the mean removal the eof analysis is a bias insensitive approach and not affected by the model bias each row in fig 7 shows the first two eofs of the eof analysis for noah vic and clsm respectively the first eofs of noah and clsm can explain about 75 of the total variance while the first eof of vic can explain about 65 of the variance moreover the first two eofs for all the gldas et products can contribute more than 80 of the total variance generally the values of the eof maps do not represent the real amplitude of the original field instead the first few eof modes with large accumulated variance contribution are usually used to analyze the spatial characteristics of the original field as well as covering the major information of the original field the first eof modes of the three gldas et products are very similar and can depict the predominant pattern of the general increasing trend from northwest china to southeast china in addition the second eof modes for the three lsms also show very similar patterns but the spatial variability is much more complex it is notable that multiplying an eof map with its corresponding loading can reflect the et anomaly fields therefore for all three gldas lsms the areas with positive values in eof1 have negative deviations from the spatial mean and vice versa as the loadings corresponding to the first eofs are negative all the time fig 8 this result is consistent with fig 5 in which the lowest et is observed in northwest china moreover the first loadings also demonstrate an obvious characteristic of seasonal variation with peak values in summer and values close to zero in winter this translates to large spatial variability in summer and small spatial variability in winter the loadings for the second eofs also show a strong seasonal signal but the values switch from positive in winter to negative in summer indicating that the pattern of the second eof modes are inverted with seasons fig 8 also reveals that the loadings of the reference and three gldas et products have consistent trends for both the first and the second eof modes the loadings of noah and clsm for the first eof are lower than those of the reference and the situation is opposite for vic this results in small spatial variability of vic modeled et compared to the reference dataset and the other two lsms modeled et products the loadings of the three gldas et products for the second eof all show negative biases compared to those of the reference and vic has the largest biases among them fig 9 further presents the eof based similarity scores for the three gldas et products based on eq 4 low values of the eof based metric are preferred indicating the spatial performances of the modeled et and the reference are very similar all the time series of eof based scores show obvious seasonal signals with peaks in july and august and valleys in january the small spatial variability in winter makes it easier for the lsms to reproduce the referenced spatial pattern fig 9 reveals that the spatial performances of noah and vic are close in winter which are also very similar to the reference however vic provides a significantly worse spatial performance than noah in summer et patterns modeled by clsm are slightly worse than by noah and vic in winter while they are better than those modeled by vic in the hot months overall noah modeled et has the best spatial performance in terms of the eof based metric among the three gldas et products b fss fss is a scale dependent verification method which has been widely used to evaluate precipitation forecasts recently koch et al 2017 first applied this method to hydrological variables and stressed that it could clearly provide more information to a spatial pattern comparison in our study if a threshold percentile is below 50 the method will use the grids that fall below the value low phase on the contrary it will focus on grids exceeding the threshold high phase when it is above 50 fig 10 shows the fss curves for the multi year 2000 2015 mean et patterns of july using different percentile thresholds at all thresholds the fss values increase gradually with the scale used to compute the fractions getting larger this is the essential feature of the method because the numbers of grids with a value of 1 in the binary maps for the reference and model output are more likely to be close within a big square window however the increasing rate differs a lot among the thresholds the differences in the spatial performance of the lsms are clearly demonstrated by fss vic and clsm have very similar skill in capturing the patterns of low et values noah performs much worse than vic and clsm for the 5 and 10 thresholds but it achieves great improvement for the 20th percentile and has comparable spatial performance with the other two models on the contrary noah has the best skill in reproducing the localized features in the regions of high et values and it greatly outperforms vic for modeling the highest 5 and 10 et patterns the reason why all the lsms show a certain degree of improvement as the percentile moves toward the middle is that more localized et features are more difficult to capture accurately fig 11 further depicts the fss time series of the multi year 2000 2015 average monthly et patterns for the three gldas lsms using different percentile thresholds fss is calculated at the predefined critical scale for each threshold following the suggestion of koch et al 2017 we use the critical scales of 65 35 and 15 grids for calculating fss at 5th 20th and 40th percentiles both top and bottom percentiles respectively the selection of critical scales is highly subjective but we found that the results are basically the same with different selections of critical scales for the low phase fsss of noah and clsm show distinct seasonality with lower values in cold months and higher values in warm months vic shows superiority in predicting the patterns of low et in cold months noah produced fss is the worst for the bottom 5th percentile while it surpasses vic in warm months for higher percentiles for the high phase vic performs badly in capturing the localized patterns of the highest 5 et in summer but performs well enough in wintertime noah and clsm produced fsss for the top 5 percentile feature large fluctuations but no obvious seasonality oppositely noah and clsm provide good and consistent spatial performance and outperform vic for the top 20th and 40th percentiles c connectivity analysis the connectivity analysis is then applied to further assess and evaluate the spatial performance of the three lsms fig 12 gives an example of the cluster analysis of the reference and the three gldas et products in july 2000 the first and second rows represent the connected clusters for the highest and the lowest 20 et binary maps for the top 20th percentile the general cluster patterns of the three lsms resemble that of the reference but the differences in size and number of clusters are obvious clsm and noah outperform vic in terms of the spatial similarity of the cluster maps the cluster of vic in northeast china is much smaller than that of the reference whereas vic generates a much bigger cluster in northeast china for the bottom 20th percentile the three lsms all reproduce the main cluster located in northwest china but miss the part in inner mongolia in addition they also fail to identify the small sized clusters fig 12 also shows the connectivity curves which depict the probability of connection γ t at all thresholds for the high grid cells above the threshold and low phase grid cells below the threshold of the referenced and modeled et patterns in july 2000 as the percentile used as threshold increases for the high from right to left in the x axis and low phase from left to right in the x axis the connectivity γ t generally increases as well renard and allard 2013 underlined that the percolation threshold at which the connectivity increases abruptly is a distinct characteristic of a spatial pattern there is large disparity among the three lsms in terms of their shapes of connectivity curves and percolation thresholds for the high phase the connectivity curve of vic shows the earliest percolation indicating the overall large degree of homogeneity in it modeled et pattern however vic modeled et pattern is more heterogeneous than the reference and other two lsms at some thresholds lower than vic s percolation threshold for example the highest 20 et patterns shown in fig 12 noah and clsm simulated connectivity percolates later than the reference and basically shows underestimation this means that their modeled et patterns are too heterogeneous relative to the reference in contrast to the high phase the three lsms generate very similar connectivity curves for the low phase which overestimate the connectivity and show very early percolations compared to the reference to investigate the features of the transition of different et patterns from winter to summer fig 13 illustrates the connectivity curves of the multi year average et patterns of february and august for the reference and the three lsms in general the observed connectivity curves for the high phase show earlier percolations in february than in august which is opposite to the low phase the lsms behave quite differently in terms of their connectivity and their difference is more distinct for the high phase the rmse between the connectivity curves as shown in eq 7 for both the high and low phase is used to quantify the pattern similarity with respect to the reference for each lsm modeled et product fig 14 shows the rmse time series based on the connectivity analyses of the mean monthly et patterns during 2000 2015 for the three lsms vic s spatial performance for the high phase is worse than noah and clsm in warm months noah shows the largest spatial similarity to the reference in terms of the rmse value in summer while clsm has the best spatial performance in winter for the low phase the connectivity of the et clusters shows similar rmse values for the three lsms except that vic significantly outperforms noah and clsm in february and march 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in the evaluation methods this study evaluated three reprocessed and recently released gldas 2 1 et products based on the ec measured et values and the spatial evaluation methods although the ec flux measurements are considered as the most accurate method to provide et estimates at a site a direct grid site comparison always suffers from the issues of spatial scale mismatch for example the highest spatial resolution of gldas et products is 0 25 which is far beyond the spatial representativeness of an ec flux site liu et al 2011 in addition ec systems are susceptible to the energy imbalance problem and the number of ec flux sites is usually very limited therefore the grid site evaluation performed in this study only serves as an auxiliary part to help understand the errors of the new gldas et products in general spatially distributed and process based modeling has been proliferated and regarded as a very important tool to provide predictions of the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial energy water and carbon cycle which can help people to address a variety of environmental problems such as climate change impacts water resources management drought monitoring therefore the comprehensive spatial evaluation is of great importance to give model users and developers an insight into the spatial predictability of the models the core content of this study is to conduct true spatial evaluations of the gldas et products based on three bias insensitive spatial performance metrics namely eof analysis fss and connectivity analysis although these metrics or methods are not novel they were not used and focused on by the hydrological and land surface modeling community until recently the results show that clsm performs worst based on the grid site evaluation whereas its spatial performance is overall better than vic and even outperforms noah sometimes this indicates that the spatial performance of a model for representing the spatial variability of the natural system is not related to the model bias in addition no single method can offer enough information to quantify the spatial performance comprehensively different metrics may indicate opposite results as they provide different interpretations of the spatial similarity for example noah performs the best in winter in terms of the eof based similarity score however the connectivity analysis of the high phase for noah produces the worst rmse performance indicating the patterns are too heterogeneous compared to the reference therefore a combination of metrics is suggested for a reliable spatial evaluation koch et al 2017 underlined that the eof analysis is the best option for a stand alone metric connectivity analysis and fss which compare spatial patterns at threshold percentiles can add unique information to a pattern evaluation besides the eof analysis however one common drawback of the two threshold based methods is that they may artificially increase spatial variability when the pattern is homogeneous for example the connectivity curves in fig 13 indicate that the patterns of low phase for the reference and vic are very heterogeneous in february which do not conform with the direct visual inspection of the et patterns after looking into the original data we found that the connectivity analysis classified the grid cells with zero value and marginal values into different clusters which led to the artificially increased spatial variability especially for the reference and vic 5 2 potential causes of the et simulation errors even though the same meteorological forcing data are used to drive the lsms in the gldas project their et simulations exhibit large differences regardless of the evaluation methods used the differences are mainly attributed to the distinctions in model formulations of et model structures and model parametrizations generally all lsms use the pm approach for potential et pet computations then evaporation and transpiration are calculated by scaling pet kumar et al 2018 the specific scaling method and model parameterizations differ in each lsm a distinct feature of vic is that it does not consider evaporation from soil underlying vegetations in addition the three lsms also present differences in physics components such as soil hydrology soil thermodynamics and snowpack physics kumar et al 2017 it should be noted that vegetation and soil related parameters also have large impacts on the modeled et cuntz et al 2016 ma et al 2019 current gldas approach is to stay with model s default parameters which are indexed based on the soil texture classification and the vegetation classification noah uses the modified international geosphere biosphere programme igbp 20 category vegetation classification based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis vegetation data while vic and clsm use the university of maryland umd land cover classification for the soil texture classification noah uses soil texture map is a hybrid of state soil geographic statsgo over continental united states conus and food and agriculture organization fao soil map elsewhere and the soil texture map for vic and clsm was derived from the soil fractions dataset from reynolds et al 2000 which were also based on the fao soil map although attributing the model deficiencies diagnosed by the spatial evaluations to specific causes is a difficult task we still attempt to qualitatively account for the problems we first looked into the model simulated transpiration soil evaporation and canopy evaporation which are the three components of the modeled et as shown in fig 15 vic modeled soil evaporation is extremely small and shows no spatial variability compared to noah and clsm soil evaporation only accounts for a very small portion of the vic modeled et which is consistent with the result of kumar et al 2018 as for the transpiration fig 16 and canopy evaporation not shown vic does not show significant differences in spatial pattern with noah and clsm because canopy evaporation is not the dominant source of et the spatial performance of vic modeled et is mainly determined by the modeled transpiration which has smaller values and more homogenous patterns compared to noah and clsm modeled transpiration in southeast china especially during summer these factors caused the lack of spatial variability diagnosed by the eof analysis and the poor spatial performance reflected by fss and the connectivity analysis in warm months especially for the patterns of high phase the diagnosed model deficiency of vic is mainly attributed to the big leaf vegetation scheme in the vic 4 1 2 model version which was also indicated by bohn and vivoni 2016 it assumes there are no canopy gaps or exposed soil between plants so soil evaporation only occurs in unvegetated areas since vic 4 2 version the clumped vegetation scheme replaces the big leaf scheme the former one divides each vegetation tile into vegetated and non vegetated area fractions to account for soil evaporation and different wind and radiation attenuation in spaces between individual plants or gaps in the canopy bohn and vivoni 2016 the vic 4 2 and later versions also support optional input of daily timeseries of lai albedo and vegetated area fraction from forcing files instead of using the monthly climatology therefore future gldas system could upgrade vic to version 4 2 to improve the et simulation as for the good performance of vic for the low phase in cold months pointed out by fss and connectivity analysis we know that it is mainly due to the artificially increased spatial variability based on the discussion in section 5 1 the similar phenomenon was also demonstrated by koch et al 2016 for spatial evaluation of vic modeled lst over conus further investigation shows that the identified cluster patterns at extreme low percentiles in cold months are analogous to the snow water equivalent swe pattern not shown which also has high similarity with the albedo pattern in another word vic generates more snow cover areas and larger swe in snow areas than the other two models and the uncommon snow occurrence of vic is strongly related to its extreme low et values which are classified as a unique cluster it s noted that the major update of vic 4 1 2 was related to snowpack related calculations and parameterizations xia et al 2018 but the specific reason behind the phenomenon is worth further analysis the high connectivity of clsm at extreme high percentiles indicates that the patterns of high et values are too homogenous in summer but its latest percolation stresses the overall heterogeneous pattern for the high phase this phenomenon is mainly caused by the strong et gradient across china with large transpiration areas located in southeast china the significant larger transpiration simulated by clsm in humid regions is possibly because clsm develops vigorous upward diffusion of water to its root zone from its groundwater storage during the warm season mitchell et al 2004 which is inherited from its predecessor the mosaic model koster and suarez 1992 in addition to transpiration clsm modeled soil evaporation is generally larger than that modeled by noah and vic the overestimation of clsm modeled et in humid regions were also pointed out by some previous studies bai et al 2018 ma et al 2019 clsm employs a non traditional approach where the subgrid heterogeneity of soil moisture in the root zone is statistically represented by separating the catchment into three distinct and dynamically varying subareas 1 a saturated region where evaporation occurs without the consideration of water stress 2 an unsaturated region where transpiration occurs with limited water stress and 3 a wilting region where transpiration is shut off how this separation scheme impacts the calculation of soil evaporation deserves further study as for the noah model it has overall better performance than vic and clsm in terms of both the grid site evaluation and the spatial evaluations however noah s spatial performance for high phase is inferior to clsm and even slightly worse than vic in late winter and early spring the reason behind this remains ambiguous and needs to be investigated further in the future in addition to the respective deficiencies of the three lsms they all lack consideration of the effects of irrigation on et moreover they do not include a ground water module except clsm these two physical processes are very important for water cycle simulation and the lack of such processes may cause large simulation errors lawston et al 2017 xia et al 2017 2018 another notable thing is that current gldas 2 models stay with their default parameter datasets as much as possible however in many cases the assigned default values based on land surface characteristics e g soil and vegetation types are inappropriate hou et al 2012 huang et al 2013 sun et al 2020 many studies have also highlighted the significant effects of model parameters on terrestrial processes modeling and the need of model calibration to improve them gong et al 2016 xia et al 2018 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2016 among all these potential causes of the differences and spatial deficiencies it is difficult to tell which one plays a dominant role as they all contribute in some way to the uncertainty in modeling et and may even compensate for each other therefore future work is needed to systematically investigate the main drivers of spatial variability of the simulated et and quantify the effects of different sources of uncertainties on land surface modeling spatial evaluation of model is an important step during the process of model development for example mendiguren et al 2017 used the spatial evaluation method to reveal model structural insufficiencies and inconsistencies which further helped to improve the model parameterizations in addition spatial pattern evaluation can also facilitate the development of alternative calibration strategies some recent studies have developed novel calibration methods of incorporating spatial pattern information of et products to improve distributed hydrological modeling dembélé et al 2020a 2020b demirel et al 2018 therefore the gained insights in this study will help us to develop long term high resolution and reliable et products over china using lsms with improved calibration methods and parameterization schemes but it s beyond the scope of this study 6 conclusions by ingesting the ground and satellite based observational datasets as well as taking advantages of the advanced techniques like data assimilation and model calibration lsms can produce long term consistent et products with high spatial temporal resolution at regional to global scales thus benefiting hydrometeorological research and applications this study comprehensively evaluated the recently released gldas 2 1 et products from three lsms over china we first performed a classical evaluation against ec based et observations at 8 sites then three spatial performance metrics which are relatively new to the land surface modeling communities were adopted to conduct the spatial evaluations of the gldas et products the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 evaluations against the ec measurements show that all three gldas products have the consistent trends with the observed et series at both daily and monthly time scales vic tends to underestimate et at most sites while serious overestimations are observed in the simulated et of clsm noah and vic have comparable performances in terms of different statistic metrics and outperform clsm at both time scales 2 the three gldas et products could generally capture the spatial distribution of the et reference dataset well the main et pattern with the increasing amount gradient from northwest to southeast china is consistent throughout the year this dominant pattern is also captured by the joint eof analyses of the referenced and simulated et maps the first eofs of noah and clsm can explain about 75 of the total variance while the first eof of vic can explain about 65 of the variance in addition the first two eofs for all the gldas et products contribute more than 80 of the total variance the agreement between loadings of the reference and the simulated et map is used to reflect the spatial performance quantitively the eof based scores clearly indicate the spatial performances of the three lsms are characterized by evident seasonal variations with the highest similarity in winter noah has the best performance in terms of the eof based score among the three lsms 3 different spatial evaluation methods are not guaranteed to give consistent evaluation results because they focus on different aspects of the spatial performance fss and connectivity analysis which are two spatial evaluation methods based on percentile thresholds allow a separate analysis of the patterns of high phase and low phase vic generally performs the best in winter in terms of better performance of low phase and comparable performance of high phase with noah and clsm during warm months vic fails to reproduce the patterns of high phase due to the low spatial variability indicated by the connectivity analysis in contrast vic s performance for low phase is close to noah and clsm in warm months noah and clsm show very similar spatial performance for representing the patterns of low phase for high phase noah performs slightly better than clsm in summer mainly because that clsm s patterns of high phase are too heterogeneous overall among the three gldas et products noah modeled et product shows certain superiority in matching the et value and pattern thus we recommend it as the first choice of the gldas et products this study shows that models with more accurate et estimates at given sites may have worse spatial performance the spatial evaluation methods thus show certain advantages over the traditional grid site evaluation method of et which is valuable for large scale et estimates especially in the regions and countries where flux measurement sites are very scarce our study also indicates that the spatial evaluation methods can be used as effective tools to diagnose modeling deficiencies thus helping future development and improvement of modeling techniques more importantly these methods are easily transferable to other distributed models and variables therefore we recommend the spatial evaluation should be considered as a new paradigm in land surface and hydrological modeling communities our future works will explore the main drivers of spatial variability of terrestrial ecological and hydrological process modeling moreover further efforts are also needed to improve the model spatial predictability by developing high quality model inputs new

4786,land surface models are important tools to represent and predict the spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration which is a key variable in terrestrial water energy and carbon cycles however evapotranspiration estimates from land surface models may suffer from various uncertainties in land surface modeling therefore assessing the performance of evapotranspiration simulation plays a vital role in understanding the deficiencies of land surface modeling most of the evaluation studies of modeled evapotranspiration relied on comparisons with flux site observations point scale and water budget derived evapotranspiration basin scale which have certain drawbacks and limitations thus the evaluation results may be misleading for understanding the performance of land surface models on representing the spatial variability of evapotranspiration in this study a thorough spatial evaluation of the new and reprocessed global land data assimilation system evapotranspiration products is performed across china based on three bias insensitive spatial evaluation methods including the empirical orthogonal function analysis the connectivity analysis and the fractions skill score these evapotranspiration products were estimated from three land surface models namely noah vic and clsm the conventional evapotranspiration evaluation against eddy covariance measurements is also performed the results show that all three products have consistent trends with the observed evapotranspiration series at both daily and monthly time scales noah and vic have comparable performances in terms of different statistic metrics and outperform clsm at both time scales the spatial evaluation methods can provide additional valuable information to diagnose the model errors vic has the worst spatial performance during the warm months despite its inferior performance in late winter and early spring noah overall has the best spatial performance among the three the gained insights of this study can help to improve the spatial performance of these models and further promote the system development keywords evapotranspiration land surface model gldas spatial evaluation china 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et which consists of evaporation from soil and canopy interception vegetation transpiration and sublimation of ice and snow consumes two thirds of total global land surface precipitation oki and kanae 2006 et plays a critical role in the exchange of water energy and carbon among hydrosphere atmosphere pedosphere and biosphere fisher 2014 katul et al 2012 wang and dickinson 2012 it is also the key variable in linking the ecological and hydrological process fisher et al 2017 therefore reliable and accurate et estimates are vital for understanding the impact on local weather miralles et al 2014 monitoring extreme event droughts anderson et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2018 diagnosing climate variability and change deb et al 2019 mao et al 2015 sheffield et al 2012 improving water resource management anderson et al 2011 2012 and so on currently there have been various methods developed to estimate et at point or field from regional to global scales these methods can be grouped into five main categories 1 the water balance method liu et al 2016 zeng et al 2014 2 upscaling of eddy covariance ec flux measurements at tower sites jung et al 2011 li et al 2018 xu et al 2018 3 machine learning based et estimation adnan et al 2020 alizamir et al 2020 granata 2019 granata et al 2020 4 satellite remote sensing rs based models martens et al 2017 mu et al 2007 5 land surface model lsm or hydrologic model simulation rodell et al 2004 srivastava et al 2020 sun et al 2017 xia et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 there is no consensus on which method is best as each category has its own advantages and disadvantages actually there are considerable overlaps among the categories for example machine learning methods could serve as one kind of upscaling methods jung et al 2011 while the machine learning methods in the third category are usually served as data driven models to estimate et with input forcing data satellite rs based et estimates rely on empirical or physical equations which use the related satellite observations to calculate et the penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 is a widely used satellite rs based physical model mu et al 2007 2011 and it is also embedded in many lsms and hydrologic models to compute et kumar et al 2017 moreover these empirical or physical equations can be also used alone with climatic forcing data deb et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 among the above mentioned methods lsms simulated et has been receiving increasing attention due to its unique merits sun et al 2017 lsms can produce long term gridded et datasets with relatively higher spatial temporal resolution at regional to global scales in addition to et lsms can be used to provide a consistent set of products of all fluxes and state variables under physical constraints zhang et al 2014 lsms also have the flexibility to use various in situ observations and satellite rs data some intercomparison studies have demonstrated that the offline land surface modeling when forced with high quality observations can provide better et estimates with smaller uncertainties compared to rs based et products and other kinds of et products long et al 2014 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2019 it should be noted that significant progress has been made in the development of regional and global land data assimilation systems ldass based on lsms the ldass aim at producing quality controlled long term spatially and temporally consistent fields of land surface states and fluxes by ingesting the best available observations rodell et al 2004 despite the continuing efforts to improve the accuracy of lsm simulations the errors of lsm based et estimates still cannot be neglected therefore comprehensive evaluations are essential for better understanding the uncertainties expanding their applications and motivating the model development there have been numerous studies bai et al 2018 khan et al 2018 long et al 2014 mueller et al 2011 peters lidard et al 2011 xia et al 2015 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 evaluating lsm based et estimates especially the et products from the north american ldas nldas mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 and the global ldas gldas rodell et al 2004 projects these evaluations are typically conducted at point scale using et from ec measurements and at basin scale using the water balance method derived et however ec systems are susceptible to the energy imbalance problem which could cause errors in the measurements wilson et al 2002 xu et al 2017 in addition the ec sites are usually scarce and the observed data is generally only available for a short time period with quite a few missing records due to the distinct spatial heterogeneity of et the applicability of et site observations is very limited for large scale evaluations the water balance method is regarded as a reliable method to provide accurate long term et estimates at basin scale however it cannot represent the spatial variability of et within the basin and its applicability is limited for small basins and relatively short time scales e g daily in addition uncertainty in water balance method derived et can even be higher than lsm based et long et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition to the limitations of the conventional et evaluation methods mentioned above the distributed process based lsms hardly increase our process understanding if only evaluated at point scale or basin scale moreover the evaluation results may be misleading for understanding the spatial predictability of lsm estimated et in fact the scientific community has been advocating the spatial pattern evaluation of distributed models using spatial observation data for almost two decades beven and feyen 2002 grayson et al 2002 refsgaard 2001 wealands et al 2005 recently some innovative bias insensitive spatial performance metrics have been applied to facilitate meaningful comparisons of spatial patterns of et mendiguren et al 2017 koch et al 2017 and other land surface variables fang et al 2015 koch et al 2015 2016 which could help to better assess and understand the spatial variability of land surface processes china stretches across a vast area covering a variety of climate regions and ecosystems and is facing many water issues the lsms in gldas can produce long term global et products with relatively high resolution up to 0 25 and 3 h in near real time along with et the global land surface fields provided by gldas could serve as important reference to support weather and climate prediction water resources management and water cycle studies in china recently the new and reprocessed gldas version 2 gldas 2 data products have been released even though the old version gldas et products have been evaluated over china in some previous studies bai et al 2018 ma et al 2019 wang et al 2016 the conventional evaluation methods conducted at point scale or basin scale cannot reflect the large spatial heterogeneity of et over china thus reducing the generalizability of the conclusions in another word the traditional evaluation paradigm can no longer keep up with the continues progress of using advanced lsms to develop large scale et estimates to our best knowledge there has been no study on spatial evaluation of lsm modeled et over china yet therefore the core novelty of this study is that for the first time a comprehensive spatial evaluation of the newly released gldas 2 et products is performed over china the spatial evaluation is based on three innovative bias insensitive spatial performance metrics including the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis the connectivity analysis renard and allard 2013 and the fractions skill score fss roberts and lean 2008 in addition this study also uses the ec measurements at 8 flux sites to evaluate the et products the main aims of this study are 1 to assess the performance of the lsms in the upgraded gldas for estimating et and provide reference for further development of model parameterization schemes and calibration methods 2 to investigate the unique advantages of the spatial performance metrics which can enrich the et evaluation approaches of the land surface and hydrological modeling communities the following section describes the gldas 2 et products the ec based et observations and et data used as reference for spatial evaluation section 2 section 3 gives a detailed introduction of the evaluation methods section 4 presents comprehensive evaluations of the et products from three lsms in gldas section 5 presents detailed discussion of potential causes of the model deficiencies diagnosed by the spatial evaluations followed by conclusions in section 6 2 data 2 1 gldas et products gldas was developed jointly by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental prediction ncep the goal of gldas is to generate optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes by ingesting satellite and ground based observational data products using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 gldas drives multiple offline lsms integrates a huge quantity of observation based data and executes globally at high resolutions 2 5 to 1 km enabled by the land information system lis kumar et al 2006 currently gldas includes four lsms noah chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 the catchment lsm clsm koster et al 2000 the community land model clm dai et al 2003 and the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 model gldas 2 has three components gldas 2 0 gldas 2 1 and gldas 2 2 gldas 2 0 is forced entirely with the princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014 gldas 2 1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present gldas 2 2 products use data assimilation whereas the gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 products have no data assimilation the latest gldas 2 has made major adjustments since november 2019 first with the upgraded lsms and updated forcing data sets the gldas 2 1 main production stream serves as a replacement for the old gldas version 1 gldas 1 products which were decommissioned in june 2020 second the gldas 2 0 noah products were reprocessed with updated princeton forcing v2 2 data and an upgraded version of noah model v3 6 in november and december 2019 in september 2020 gldas 2 0 vic and clsm products were publicly released third gldas 2 2 which explores the data assimilation capabilities in the lis is new to the data archive the gldas 2 2 products from clsm f2 5 with the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data assimilation were released in february 2020 the main objective of gldas 2 1 is to provide up to date global land surface model outputs while preserving consistency of the long term climatology i e gldas 2 0 to the extent possible therefore the gldas 2 1 et products from noah 3 6 clsm f2 5 and vic 4 1 2 are evaluated in this study all the gldas 2 1 products extend from 2000 to present with 3 hourly temporal resolution the et product from noah has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 while the other two have spatial resolutions of 1 1 2 2 eddy covariance measurements of et nowadays ec measurements of water vapor exchange and carbon dioxide are being made routinely on each continent since ec measurements can provide relatively accurate estimation of et at a given site the ec based et measurements of 8 flux measurement sites from chinaflux are used for evaluation chinaflux is an observation and research network that applies ec and chamber methods to measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide water vapor and energy between terrestrial ecosystem and atmosphere in china yu et al 2006 chinaflux has become an important part of the global network of flux measurement sites called fluxnet baldocchi et al 2001 and the main part of the regional network asiaflux currently the chinaflux network includes 79 sites consisting of 18 cropland sites 19 grassland sites 23 forest sites 15 wetland sites 2 desert sites 1 urban site and 1 waterbody site which encompass a large range of latitudes altitudes climates and ecosystem types among the 79 sites the flux measurements of the 8 sites used in this study are publicly available from http www chinaflux org the spatial distribution of the 8 stations is shown in fig 1 while table 1 lists their detailed information the provided daily latent heat flux data at the 8 sites are used to derive the actual et in units of water depth following mu et al 2011 in this study we perform the grid site comparison meaning that the et values of the gldas grid and the flux site that locates in that grid are directly compared at the same time scale daily and monthly 2 3 et reference data across china to perform a qualified spatial pattern evaluation of modeled et a reliable et reference dataset is a prerequisite recently ma et al 2019 developed a long term 1982 2017 monthly terrestrial et product with spatial resolution of 0 1 across china this dataset is derived from a recently proposed nonlinear complementary relationship cr formulation szilagyi et al 2017 the cr method as first introduced by bouchet 1963 emphasizes the feedback mechanism between actual et and potential et under the same environmental conditions the cr method has been regarded as an attractive tool for estimating actual et at large scale due to its minimal data requirement of only meteorological input interested readers can refer to ma et al 2019 for detailed information of this dataset which is available from the national tibetan plateau data center doi https doi org 10 11888 atmosphys tpe 249493 file ma et al 2019 conducted independent evaluation based on ec measurements and water balance method estimated et the results indicated that the cr based et product was very reliable further evaluations suggested that it showed improved accuracy over seven other mainstream et products therefore this cr based et product can serve as a suitable reference for our spatial evaluation the gldas 2 1 et products are resampled from its original resolutions to 0 1 through bilinear interpolation to provide consistency with the cr based et product 3 methodology 3 1 common statistic metrics three statistic metrics are used to conduct the grid site evaluations of gldas et products against ec measured et in this study the metrics include relative error re bias adjusted root mean square error armse and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the formulas are given by 1 re i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 2 armse 1 n i 1 n s i μ s o i μ o 2 3 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 β μ s μ o γ σ s σ o where n is the total number of events o i and s i are the i th pairs of ec measured et and gldas et μ o and μ s are their corresponding mean values in the kge equation r represents the linear correlation coefficient β and γ measure the bias and relative variability in the simulated and observed values σ s and σ o are the standard deviation of simulated and observed variables respectively bias measures the average tendency of model simulations to over or under estimate the observations and a value of 0 is perfect the armse is adopted to remove the systematic errors and show only the random errors the kge is designed to measure the euclidian distance from the ideal point in the three dimensional criteria space derived from the decomposition of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the optimal value of kge is 1 3 2 spatial evaluation methods the core content of this study is to perform true spatial evaluations of the gldas et products based on three bias insensitive spatial performance metrics namely eof analysis fss and connectivity analysis these metrics or methods are not novel and were originally developed for other purposes not until recently were they introduced to facilitate meaningful spatial validation of land surface variables in the hydrological and land surface modeling community fang et al 2015 koch et al 2015 2016 2017 to perform spatial evaluation all the gldas 2 1 et products are interpolated to 0 1 the same resolution as the cr based et product the detailed evaluation results are presented in section 4 and some methodology limitations are discussed in section 5 1 empirical orthogonal function eof analysis the method of eof also known as principal component analysis pca in statistics is a decomposition of a dataset in terms of orthogonal basis functions it is often used in atmosphere climate ocean and hydrology science to study possible spatial modes of variability and how they change with time the main feature of the eof analysis is that it seeks structures that explain the maximum amount of variance in a two dimensional dataset typically one dimension in the dataset is the space dimension and the other is the time dimension the eof decomposes a large spatiotemporal dataset into a set of mathematically orthogonal modes structures which are usually called eofs and a set of time series loadings that are related one to one to the eofs and quantify the amplitude of each eof over the period of record the first eof explains the largest amount of the variance more detailed description of the eof method can be referred to björnsson and venegas 1997 while the eof analysis is typically employed for analyzing the spatiotemporal variability of a single filed koch et al 2015 proposed the novel concept of performing a joint eof analysis on a combined data matrix that contains both reference and modeled data by doing so not only do the obtained eof maps represent the spatiotemporal variability of both datasets but also the difference between the loadings at each time step can be used as an indicator of spatial similarity koch et al 2016 to ensure a reliable pattern similarity score the loading deviation must be weighted according to the variance contribution of the corresponding eof the eof based similarity score between a reference dataset and a modeled map at time t can be formulated as 4 s eof t i 1 n w i l o a d i s l o a d i o where w i is the variance contribution of the ith eof n is the total number of orthogonal modes eofs loa d i s and loa d i o are the corresponding loadings of simulated and observed maps respectively in this study the monthly mean is removed from each et map prior to the eof analysis thus the method is based on the spatial anomalies which makes it bias insensitive 2 fractions skill score the fss is a scale selective method developed by roberts and lean 2008 to measure forecast skill of precipitation forecasts against spatial scale for a given threshold it uses the concept of nearest neighbors as the means of selecting the scales of interest this approach calculates the fractional coverage of binary events that have a value of 1 have exceeded the threshold in a given spatial window generally percentile thresholds are used for conversion into a binary field to remove the impact of bias when focusing on the spatial accuracy the main steps to obtain fss are as follows 1 convert the reference and the modeled spatial patterns into binary fields for a certain threshold 2 for each grid in every binary field obtained in the last step compute the fractions of grids with value of 1 within a given square window of length n 3 calculate the mean square error mse between the referenced and modeled fraction fields 4 obtain the final fss by normalizing the mse from last step with the largest possible mse that can be obtained from the modeled and referenced fractions for a certain threshold fss at spatial scale of n is expressed as 5 fs s n 1 1 n i 1 n o n i s n i 2 1 n i 1 n o n i 2 i 1 n s n i 2 where o n and s n are the resultant fields of referenced fractions and modeled fractions respectively n is the total number of valid grids in the domain the fss ranges from 0 complete mismatch to 1 perfect match as the size of the square windows used to compute the fractions becomes larger the fss will reaches an asymptote that depends on the ratio between the modeled and observed frequencies of the event the fss is bias insensitive due to the percentile thresholds used further information can be referred to roberts and lean 2008 3 connectivity analysis connectivity analysis is usually used in hydrogeology to quantify aquifer heterogeneity where the connectivity structure of the heterogeneity is understood as a property that strongly influences groundwater flow and solute transport renard and allard 2013 the studies of western et al 2001 and grayson et al 2002 were the early ones that applied the connectivity analysis to land surface variables connectivity can provide a reliable measure of the general structure and heterogeneity of spatial patterns which can be used to evaluate the spatial performance koch et al 2016 2017 to apply this methodology to a field of continuous variable renard and allard 2013 suggested the following steps 1 decompose the field into a series of binary maps by introducing a set of increasing thresholds 2 perform a cluster analysis on each of the binary map to identify connected clusters 3 use the percolation theory to describe the transition from many disconnected clusters to a large connected cluster hovadik and larue 2007 proposed to use the probability of connection as a suitable metric to quantify how percolated clusters are the metric γ t which is computed for the threshold t is formulated as 6 γ t 1 n t 2 i 1 n x t n i 2 where n t is the total number of grids in the binary map x t n x t represents the total number of distinct clusters and n i is the number of grids in the ith cluster like fss using percentiles makes this method bias insensitive and facilitates separate studies of clusters of a binary map above or below a threshold in this study we use a series of thresholds which move along all percentiles 1 100 of the et range therefore the rmse between the metrics of the reference field and modeled field for all thresholds can be computed to indicate the spatial similarity 7 rms e con t 1 100 γ t o γ t s 2 100 where γ t o and γ t s are the connectivity metrics of the reference and modeled field respectively interested readers can refer to renard and allard 2013 and koch et al 2016 for further details 4 results 4 1 grid site evaluation in this study the three gldas 2 1 et products are first validated against the ec measured et of 8 flux sites on both daily and monthly time scales in general all three gldas products have the consistent trends with the observed et series at all sites figs 2 and 3 moreover the et product from noah performs well in capturing the magnitude at the qyz and dx sites and so does the vic modeled et at the cbs and dhs sites however a closer inspection shows that there are overall overestimations or underestimations for some gldas et products at different sites which are clearly demonstrated in fig 4 specifically noah and clsm modeled et products show systematic positive biases at the four sites of the forest ecosystem and clsm is much worse especially at the xsbn site on the contrast vic shows systematic negative biases at two of the three grassland sites hb and dx the qyz forest site as well as the yc cropland site to further quantitatively evaluate the performances of the three gldas et products we calculate three statistic metrics on both daily and monthly time scales tables 2 and 3 it can be found that no single lsm consistently outperforms the others at all sites overall noah and vic have comparable performances while the former performs more stable and they all outperform clsm noah modeled et product has the highest kge values at more than half of the flux sites while vic modeled et product has the superiority in producing lower armse at more sites noah modeled et product has the leading performance for at least one site of each ecosystem type the highest kge values for each ecosystem type are all higher than 0 6 and 0 7 daily and monthly respectively vic performs better at the sites of the forest ecosystem than those of other ecosystem types while clsm performs better at the grassland sites and the cropland site it s noted that the metrics of armse and kge improve a lot when calculated on monthly time scale for nearly all lsms and sites indicating that the lsms modeled et products are more reliable on monthly time scale 4 2 spatial evaluation of et patterns fig 5 depicts the spatial distributions of multi year 2000 2015 mean annual et of the cr based reference dataset and the three gldas et products in general all of them present a consistent et pattern with the increasing amount gradient from northwest to southeast however there are large differences in the mean annual values among the three gldas products and the reference especially in the southeast china the northwestern tibetan plateau and the yangtze river basin among the three gldas lsms clsm generally produces the highest et values followed by noah and vic fig 6 further presents the seasonal mean et patterns of the reference and the three lsms during 2000 2015 in general the patterns of spring summer and autumn for the four et products can reflect their corresponding mean annual et patterns shown in fig 5 the winter et patterns have the least apparent spatial heterogeneity due to the minimum precipitation and energy in this season among the three lsms vic modeled et patterns have the smallest spatial variability especially for the winter season in addition clsm produces the highest et values across the seasons over vast parts of the northern china whereas vic modeled et products have the lowest et values from the above results we know that the three lsms show different error characteristics nevertheless different products may exhibit similar spatial patterns given their individual biases beck et al 2017 sun et al 2016 further evaluations are based on bias insensitive metrics as the point to point evaluation may not be reliable a eof analysis first we conduct the joint eof analyses for the cr based reference dataset and each of the gldas et product during the period of 2000 2015 therefore each eof analysis is computed based on the decomposition of a concatenated spatiotemporal matrix of 384 monthly et maps with spatial mean removed because of the mean removal the eof analysis is a bias insensitive approach and not affected by the model bias each row in fig 7 shows the first two eofs of the eof analysis for noah vic and clsm respectively the first eofs of noah and clsm can explain about 75 of the total variance while the first eof of vic can explain about 65 of the variance moreover the first two eofs for all the gldas et products can contribute more than 80 of the total variance generally the values of the eof maps do not represent the real amplitude of the original field instead the first few eof modes with large accumulated variance contribution are usually used to analyze the spatial characteristics of the original field as well as covering the major information of the original field the first eof modes of the three gldas et products are very similar and can depict the predominant pattern of the general increasing trend from northwest china to southeast china in addition the second eof modes for the three lsms also show very similar patterns but the spatial variability is much more complex it is notable that multiplying an eof map with its corresponding loading can reflect the et anomaly fields therefore for all three gldas lsms the areas with positive values in eof1 have negative deviations from the spatial mean and vice versa as the loadings corresponding to the first eofs are negative all the time fig 8 this result is consistent with fig 5 in which the lowest et is observed in northwest china moreover the first loadings also demonstrate an obvious characteristic of seasonal variation with peak values in summer and values close to zero in winter this translates to large spatial variability in summer and small spatial variability in winter the loadings for the second eofs also show a strong seasonal signal but the values switch from positive in winter to negative in summer indicating that the pattern of the second eof modes are inverted with seasons fig 8 also reveals that the loadings of the reference and three gldas et products have consistent trends for both the first and the second eof modes the loadings of noah and clsm for the first eof are lower than those of the reference and the situation is opposite for vic this results in small spatial variability of vic modeled et compared to the reference dataset and the other two lsms modeled et products the loadings of the three gldas et products for the second eof all show negative biases compared to those of the reference and vic has the largest biases among them fig 9 further presents the eof based similarity scores for the three gldas et products based on eq 4 low values of the eof based metric are preferred indicating the spatial performances of the modeled et and the reference are very similar all the time series of eof based scores show obvious seasonal signals with peaks in july and august and valleys in january the small spatial variability in winter makes it easier for the lsms to reproduce the referenced spatial pattern fig 9 reveals that the spatial performances of noah and vic are close in winter which are also very similar to the reference however vic provides a significantly worse spatial performance than noah in summer et patterns modeled by clsm are slightly worse than by noah and vic in winter while they are better than those modeled by vic in the hot months overall noah modeled et has the best spatial performance in terms of the eof based metric among the three gldas et products b fss fss is a scale dependent verification method which has been widely used to evaluate precipitation forecasts recently koch et al 2017 first applied this method to hydrological variables and stressed that it could clearly provide more information to a spatial pattern comparison in our study if a threshold percentile is below 50 the method will use the grids that fall below the value low phase on the contrary it will focus on grids exceeding the threshold high phase when it is above 50 fig 10 shows the fss curves for the multi year 2000 2015 mean et patterns of july using different percentile thresholds at all thresholds the fss values increase gradually with the scale used to compute the fractions getting larger this is the essential feature of the method because the numbers of grids with a value of 1 in the binary maps for the reference and model output are more likely to be close within a big square window however the increasing rate differs a lot among the thresholds the differences in the spatial performance of the lsms are clearly demonstrated by fss vic and clsm have very similar skill in capturing the patterns of low et values noah performs much worse than vic and clsm for the 5 and 10 thresholds but it achieves great improvement for the 20th percentile and has comparable spatial performance with the other two models on the contrary noah has the best skill in reproducing the localized features in the regions of high et values and it greatly outperforms vic for modeling the highest 5 and 10 et patterns the reason why all the lsms show a certain degree of improvement as the percentile moves toward the middle is that more localized et features are more difficult to capture accurately fig 11 further depicts the fss time series of the multi year 2000 2015 average monthly et patterns for the three gldas lsms using different percentile thresholds fss is calculated at the predefined critical scale for each threshold following the suggestion of koch et al 2017 we use the critical scales of 65 35 and 15 grids for calculating fss at 5th 20th and 40th percentiles both top and bottom percentiles respectively the selection of critical scales is highly subjective but we found that the results are basically the same with different selections of critical scales for the low phase fsss of noah and clsm show distinct seasonality with lower values in cold months and higher values in warm months vic shows superiority in predicting the patterns of low et in cold months noah produced fss is the worst for the bottom 5th percentile while it surpasses vic in warm months for higher percentiles for the high phase vic performs badly in capturing the localized patterns of the highest 5 et in summer but performs well enough in wintertime noah and clsm produced fsss for the top 5 percentile feature large fluctuations but no obvious seasonality oppositely noah and clsm provide good and consistent spatial performance and outperform vic for the top 20th and 40th percentiles c connectivity analysis the connectivity analysis is then applied to further assess and evaluate the spatial performance of the three lsms fig 12 gives an example of the cluster analysis of the reference and the three gldas et products in july 2000 the first and second rows represent the connected clusters for the highest and the lowest 20 et binary maps for the top 20th percentile the general cluster patterns of the three lsms resemble that of the reference but the differences in size and number of clusters are obvious clsm and noah outperform vic in terms of the spatial similarity of the cluster maps the cluster of vic in northeast china is much smaller than that of the reference whereas vic generates a much bigger cluster in northeast china for the bottom 20th percentile the three lsms all reproduce the main cluster located in northwest china but miss the part in inner mongolia in addition they also fail to identify the small sized clusters fig 12 also shows the connectivity curves which depict the probability of connection γ t at all thresholds for the high grid cells above the threshold and low phase grid cells below the threshold of the referenced and modeled et patterns in july 2000 as the percentile used as threshold increases for the high from right to left in the x axis and low phase from left to right in the x axis the connectivity γ t generally increases as well renard and allard 2013 underlined that the percolation threshold at which the connectivity increases abruptly is a distinct characteristic of a spatial pattern there is large disparity among the three lsms in terms of their shapes of connectivity curves and percolation thresholds for the high phase the connectivity curve of vic shows the earliest percolation indicating the overall large degree of homogeneity in it modeled et pattern however vic modeled et pattern is more heterogeneous than the reference and other two lsms at some thresholds lower than vic s percolation threshold for example the highest 20 et patterns shown in fig 12 noah and clsm simulated connectivity percolates later than the reference and basically shows underestimation this means that their modeled et patterns are too heterogeneous relative to the reference in contrast to the high phase the three lsms generate very similar connectivity curves for the low phase which overestimate the connectivity and show very early percolations compared to the reference to investigate the features of the transition of different et patterns from winter to summer fig 13 illustrates the connectivity curves of the multi year average et patterns of february and august for the reference and the three lsms in general the observed connectivity curves for the high phase show earlier percolations in february than in august which is opposite to the low phase the lsms behave quite differently in terms of their connectivity and their difference is more distinct for the high phase the rmse between the connectivity curves as shown in eq 7 for both the high and low phase is used to quantify the pattern similarity with respect to the reference for each lsm modeled et product fig 14 shows the rmse time series based on the connectivity analyses of the mean monthly et patterns during 2000 2015 for the three lsms vic s spatial performance for the high phase is worse than noah and clsm in warm months noah shows the largest spatial similarity to the reference in terms of the rmse value in summer while clsm has the best spatial performance in winter for the low phase the connectivity of the et clusters shows similar rmse values for the three lsms except that vic significantly outperforms noah and clsm in february and march 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in the evaluation methods this study evaluated three reprocessed and recently released gldas 2 1 et products based on the ec measured et values and the spatial evaluation methods although the ec flux measurements are considered as the most accurate method to provide et estimates at a site a direct grid site comparison always suffers from the issues of spatial scale mismatch for example the highest spatial resolution of gldas et products is 0 25 which is far beyond the spatial representativeness of an ec flux site liu et al 2011 in addition ec systems are susceptible to the energy imbalance problem and the number of ec flux sites is usually very limited therefore the grid site evaluation performed in this study only serves as an auxiliary part to help understand the errors of the new gldas et products in general spatially distributed and process based modeling has been proliferated and regarded as a very important tool to provide predictions of the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial energy water and carbon cycle which can help people to address a variety of environmental problems such as climate change impacts water resources management drought monitoring therefore the comprehensive spatial evaluation is of great importance to give model users and developers an insight into the spatial predictability of the models the core content of this study is to conduct true spatial evaluations of the gldas et products based on three bias insensitive spatial performance metrics namely eof analysis fss and connectivity analysis although these metrics or methods are not novel they were not used and focused on by the hydrological and land surface modeling community until recently the results show that clsm performs worst based on the grid site evaluation whereas its spatial performance is overall better than vic and even outperforms noah sometimes this indicates that the spatial performance of a model for representing the spatial variability of the natural system is not related to the model bias in addition no single method can offer enough information to quantify the spatial performance comprehensively different metrics may indicate opposite results as they provide different interpretations of the spatial similarity for example noah performs the best in winter in terms of the eof based similarity score however the connectivity analysis of the high phase for noah produces the worst rmse performance indicating the patterns are too heterogeneous compared to the reference therefore a combination of metrics is suggested for a reliable spatial evaluation koch et al 2017 underlined that the eof analysis is the best option for a stand alone metric connectivity analysis and fss which compare spatial patterns at threshold percentiles can add unique information to a pattern evaluation besides the eof analysis however one common drawback of the two threshold based methods is that they may artificially increase spatial variability when the pattern is homogeneous for example the connectivity curves in fig 13 indicate that the patterns of low phase for the reference and vic are very heterogeneous in february which do not conform with the direct visual inspection of the et patterns after looking into the original data we found that the connectivity analysis classified the grid cells with zero value and marginal values into different clusters which led to the artificially increased spatial variability especially for the reference and vic 5 2 potential causes of the et simulation errors even though the same meteorological forcing data are used to drive the lsms in the gldas project their et simulations exhibit large differences regardless of the evaluation methods used the differences are mainly attributed to the distinctions in model formulations of et model structures and model parametrizations generally all lsms use the pm approach for potential et pet computations then evaporation and transpiration are calculated by scaling pet kumar et al 2018 the specific scaling method and model parameterizations differ in each lsm a distinct feature of vic is that it does not consider evaporation from soil underlying vegetations in addition the three lsms also present differences in physics components such as soil hydrology soil thermodynamics and snowpack physics kumar et al 2017 it should be noted that vegetation and soil related parameters also have large impacts on the modeled et cuntz et al 2016 ma et al 2019 current gldas approach is to stay with model s default parameters which are indexed based on the soil texture classification and the vegetation classification noah uses the modified international geosphere biosphere programme igbp 20 category vegetation classification based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis vegetation data while vic and clsm use the university of maryland umd land cover classification for the soil texture classification noah uses soil texture map is a hybrid of state soil geographic statsgo over continental united states conus and food and agriculture organization fao soil map elsewhere and the soil texture map for vic and clsm was derived from the soil fractions dataset from reynolds et al 2000 which were also based on the fao soil map although attributing the model deficiencies diagnosed by the spatial evaluations to specific causes is a difficult task we still attempt to qualitatively account for the problems we first looked into the model simulated transpiration soil evaporation and canopy evaporation which are the three components of the modeled et as shown in fig 15 vic modeled soil evaporation is extremely small and shows no spatial variability compared to noah and clsm soil evaporation only accounts for a very small portion of the vic modeled et which is consistent with the result of kumar et al 2018 as for the transpiration fig 16 and canopy evaporation not shown vic does not show significant differences in spatial pattern with noah and clsm because canopy evaporation is not the dominant source of et the spatial performance of vic modeled et is mainly determined by the modeled transpiration which has smaller values and more homogenous patterns compared to noah and clsm modeled transpiration in southeast china especially during summer these factors caused the lack of spatial variability diagnosed by the eof analysis and the poor spatial performance reflected by fss and the connectivity analysis in warm months especially for the patterns of high phase the diagnosed model deficiency of vic is mainly attributed to the big leaf vegetation scheme in the vic 4 1 2 model version which was also indicated by bohn and vivoni 2016 it assumes there are no canopy gaps or exposed soil between plants so soil evaporation only occurs in unvegetated areas since vic 4 2 version the clumped vegetation scheme replaces the big leaf scheme the former one divides each vegetation tile into vegetated and non vegetated area fractions to account for soil evaporation and different wind and radiation attenuation in spaces between individual plants or gaps in the canopy bohn and vivoni 2016 the vic 4 2 and later versions also support optional input of daily timeseries of lai albedo and vegetated area fraction from forcing files instead of using the monthly climatology therefore future gldas system could upgrade vic to version 4 2 to improve the et simulation as for the good performance of vic for the low phase in cold months pointed out by fss and connectivity analysis we know that it is mainly due to the artificially increased spatial variability based on the discussion in section 5 1 the similar phenomenon was also demonstrated by koch et al 2016 for spatial evaluation of vic modeled lst over conus further investigation shows that the identified cluster patterns at extreme low percentiles in cold months are analogous to the snow water equivalent swe pattern not shown which also has high similarity with the albedo pattern in another word vic generates more snow cover areas and larger swe in snow areas than the other two models and the uncommon snow occurrence of vic is strongly related to its extreme low et values which are classified as a unique cluster it s noted that the major update of vic 4 1 2 was related to snowpack related calculations and parameterizations xia et al 2018 but the specific reason behind the phenomenon is worth further analysis the high connectivity of clsm at extreme high percentiles indicates that the patterns of high et values are too homogenous in summer but its latest percolation stresses the overall heterogeneous pattern for the high phase this phenomenon is mainly caused by the strong et gradient across china with large transpiration areas located in southeast china the significant larger transpiration simulated by clsm in humid regions is possibly because clsm develops vigorous upward diffusion of water to its root zone from its groundwater storage during the warm season mitchell et al 2004 which is inherited from its predecessor the mosaic model koster and suarez 1992 in addition to transpiration clsm modeled soil evaporation is generally larger than that modeled by noah and vic the overestimation of clsm modeled et in humid regions were also pointed out by some previous studies bai et al 2018 ma et al 2019 clsm employs a non traditional approach where the subgrid heterogeneity of soil moisture in the root zone is statistically represented by separating the catchment into three distinct and dynamically varying subareas 1 a saturated region where evaporation occurs without the consideration of water stress 2 an unsaturated region where transpiration occurs with limited water stress and 3 a wilting region where transpiration is shut off how this separation scheme impacts the calculation of soil evaporation deserves further study as for the noah model it has overall better performance than vic and clsm in terms of both the grid site evaluation and the spatial evaluations however noah s spatial performance for high phase is inferior to clsm and even slightly worse than vic in late winter and early spring the reason behind this remains ambiguous and needs to be investigated further in the future in addition to the respective deficiencies of the three lsms they all lack consideration of the effects of irrigation on et moreover they do not include a ground water module except clsm these two physical processes are very important for water cycle simulation and the lack of such processes may cause large simulation errors lawston et al 2017 xia et al 2017 2018 another notable thing is that current gldas 2 models stay with their default parameter datasets as much as possible however in many cases the assigned default values based on land surface characteristics e g soil and vegetation types are inappropriate hou et al 2012 huang et al 2013 sun et al 2020 many studies have also highlighted the significant effects of model parameters on terrestrial processes modeling and the need of model calibration to improve them gong et al 2016 xia et al 2018 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2016 among all these potential causes of the differences and spatial deficiencies it is difficult to tell which one plays a dominant role as they all contribute in some way to the uncertainty in modeling et and may even compensate for each other therefore future work is needed to systematically investigate the main drivers of spatial variability of the simulated et and quantify the effects of different sources of uncertainties on land surface modeling spatial evaluation of model is an important step during the process of model development for example mendiguren et al 2017 used the spatial evaluation method to reveal model structural insufficiencies and inconsistencies which further helped to improve the model parameterizations in addition spatial pattern evaluation can also facilitate the development of alternative calibration strategies some recent studies have developed novel calibration methods of incorporating spatial pattern information of et products to improve distributed hydrological modeling dembélé et al 2020a 2020b demirel et al 2018 therefore the gained insights in this study will help us to develop long term high resolution and reliable et products over china using lsms with improved calibration methods and parameterization schemes but it s beyond the scope of this study 6 conclusions by ingesting the ground and satellite based observational datasets as well as taking advantages of the advanced techniques like data assimilation and model calibration lsms can produce long term consistent et products with high spatial temporal resolution at regional to global scales thus benefiting hydrometeorological research and applications this study comprehensively evaluated the recently released gldas 2 1 et products from three lsms over china we first performed a classical evaluation against ec based et observations at 8 sites then three spatial performance metrics which are relatively new to the land surface modeling communities were adopted to conduct the spatial evaluations of the gldas et products the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 evaluations against the ec measurements show that all three gldas products have the consistent trends with the observed et series at both daily and monthly time scales vic tends to underestimate et at most sites while serious overestimations are observed in the simulated et of clsm noah and vic have comparable performances in terms of different statistic metrics and outperform clsm at both time scales 2 the three gldas et products could generally capture the spatial distribution of the et reference dataset well the main et pattern with the increasing amount gradient from northwest to southeast china is consistent throughout the year this dominant pattern is also captured by the joint eof analyses of the referenced and simulated et maps the first eofs of noah and clsm can explain about 75 of the total variance while the first eof of vic can explain about 65 of the variance in addition the first two eofs for all the gldas et products contribute more than 80 of the total variance the agreement between loadings of the reference and the simulated et map is used to reflect the spatial performance quantitively the eof based scores clearly indicate the spatial performances of the three lsms are characterized by evident seasonal variations with the highest similarity in winter noah has the best performance in terms of the eof based score among the three lsms 3 different spatial evaluation methods are not guaranteed to give consistent evaluation results because they focus on different aspects of the spatial performance fss and connectivity analysis which are two spatial evaluation methods based on percentile thresholds allow a separate analysis of the patterns of high phase and low phase vic generally performs the best in winter in terms of better performance of low phase and comparable performance of high phase with noah and clsm during warm months vic fails to reproduce the patterns of high phase due to the low spatial variability indicated by the connectivity analysis in contrast vic s performance for low phase is close to noah and clsm in warm months noah and clsm show very similar spatial performance for representing the patterns of low phase for high phase noah performs slightly better than clsm in summer mainly because that clsm s patterns of high phase are too heterogeneous overall among the three gldas et products noah modeled et product shows certain superiority in matching the et value and pattern thus we recommend it as the first choice of the gldas et products this study shows that models with more accurate et estimates at given sites may have worse spatial performance the spatial evaluation methods thus show certain advantages over the traditional grid site evaluation method of et which is valuable for large scale et estimates especially in the regions and countries where flux measurement sites are very scarce our study also indicates that the spatial evaluation methods can be used as effective tools to diagnose modeling deficiencies thus helping future development and improvement of modeling techniques more importantly these methods are easily transferable to other distributed models and variables therefore we recommend the spatial evaluation should be considered as a new paradigm in land surface and hydrological modeling communities our future works will explore the main drivers of spatial variability of terrestrial ecological and hydrological process modeling moreover further efforts are also needed to improve the model spatial predictability by developing high quality model inputs new

4787,bioclogging can significantly reduce the permeability of porous media restricting the application of artificial recharge in this study the quantitative efficiency and mechanism by which rhamnolipid rl biosurfactant prevents bioclogging during artificial recharge were investigated in both batch reactor and column systems the batch experiments indicated that the adsorption of bacteria onto quartz sand surface was significantly reduced in the presence of rl the adsorption isotherm data were well fitted to the freundlich model the freundlich sorption affinities kf of bacteria in the presence of 0 20 40 and 80 mg l rl were 3 20 1 55 0 79 and 1 21 respectively in the microplate biofilm experiments the addition of 40 mg l of rl 40 rl reduced the total biomass to 17 4 the percolation sand column experiments demonstrated the efficacy of rl alleviating bioclogging more time was taken 18 h for the 40 rl group to achieve a relative hydraulic conductivity k of 0 20 compared with the group without the addition of rl 0 rl 12 h meanwhile the accumulation of bacterial cells and the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps which are the main contributors to bioclogging were lower in groups with rl than in those without rl the optimal concentration of rl is 40 mg l the decreasing degree of k in different experimental groups was linearly correlated with rl dependent cell surface hydrophobicity csh the results of both batch and column experiments indicate that the rl reduced the adsorption capacity of bacteria onto the surface of porous media by modifying the hydrophobicity of the bacteria reducing bioclogging in artificial recharging this study therefore provides insights and guidances for reducing bioclogging thereby enhancing the efficiency of artificial recharge keywords bioclogging biosurfactant bacterial adsorption eps cell surface hydrophobicity 1 introduction excessive exploitation of groundwater can lead to many environmental geological problems such as land subsidence seawater intrusion and deterioration in the water quality artificial recharge which refers to the method of replenishing groundwater resources via artificial infiltration with collected surface water into aquifers has been widely used to alleviate these crises as for recharge water the reclaimed water is a limited resource but the use of rain flood water which is carried out in many countries such as japan germany and china yan et al 2013 can reduce the risk of flooding and replenish groundwater rathay et al 2018 however no matter what type of water is used for replenishment one of the main concerns during the recharge process is aquifer clogging it can significantly reduce the injection efficiency and the life of a well due to a decrease in the permeability of the aquifer clogging is usually classified into physical chemical and biological clogging baveye et al 1998 physical clogging mainly includes the infiltration of suspended solids and the release of entrapped air bubbles dror et al 2004 pavelic et al 2011 chemical clogging can stem from chemical precipitation bustos medina et al 2013 excessive microbial biomass can cause fouling of the porous media this is known as bioclogging page et al 2014 thullner 2010 previous studies show that bioclogging occurs in most recharge systems and plays a significant role in the effective operation of these systems cui et al 2018 vandevivere and baveye 1992 the process of bioclogging is complex researchers have demonstrated that bacterial cells are initially adsorbed onto the surface of the porous media where they metabolize secrete extracellular polymeric substances eps and form biofilms occupying pores and resulting in a substantial reduction in permeability jeong et al 2018 wang et al 2020 rubol et al 2014 dutta et al 2015 clogging can be controlled in two ways the first strategy is prevention which aims to delay or minimize clogging shen et al 2010 demonstrated that strategically arranging the supply and injection of water can effectively prevent clogging perujo et al 2019 proved that a bilayer comprised of coarse fine substrate can prevent bioclogging however bioclogging can still occur after a long running period when these methods are used hua et al 2013 the other strategy is restoration which is often applied after clogging occurs the main traditional treatment is to excavate the surface media and backfill with high penetration media nivala et al 2012 although the traditional treatment is relatively effective the operation of both methods is costly and has the potential to destroy the properties of the porous media there are also in situ methods that can be used to remove clogging such as the introduction of earthworms or microbial agents into the porous media thus reducing clogging by biological processes ye et al 2018 however the efficiency of these treatments may be limited by the ability of microorganisms to adapt to the environment another option is using chemical reagents such as hydrogen peroxide sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid or sodium hypochlorite nivala and rousseau 2009 hua et al 2010 this method can effectively reduce the problem of clogging but the introduce of chemicals into the subsurface may cause secondary pollution biosurfactants are a kind of biological compound that are produced by microorganisms because of the low toxicity and biodegradability of biosurfactants they have become more popular for application in the environment than chemical surfactants rhamnolipid rl is one of the most widely studied biosurfactants evidence suggests that rl can modify bacterial surfaces weaken bacterial adsorption and enhance the bacterial transport in porous media when applied for bio augmentation bai et al 1997 chen et al 2004 liu et al 2017 rl has a significant effect on the surface hydrophobicity csh of bacterial cells liu et al 2020 it has been suggested that this effect is due to the adsorption of rl onto the cell surface liu et al 2014 csh plays a significant role in several different bioprocesses such as cell to cell interaction and the formation of biofilm therefore it is considered as an important factor that can affect the adsorption of microbes onto porous media du et al 2016 indicated that rl can solubilize and disperse eps by conducting a solubilization experiment thus it is hypothesized that rl can be used to prevent bioclogging it is already known that rl can be used as an environmentally friendly solvent in soil and groundwater remediation however to the best of our knowledge the quantitative efficiency and mechanisms by which rl prevents biological clogging in aquifers have not been established to date in this study batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of low concentrations of rl biosurfactant on the cell adsorption behavior of quartz sand and biofilm formation column experiments were conducted to investigate the relationship between rl and the reduction of relative hydraulic conductivity k while bacterial cell amount and eps concentrations were also monitored in addition the mechanisms of rl that affect the interaction between bacteria and porous media was investigated by analyzing the spectral changes using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and monitoring the surface properties of cells and porous media such as the csh and the zeta potential 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa cctcc 91095 was obtained from the china center for type culture collection it was maintained in lyophilized stock at 20 c and revived on luria bertani lb solid medium before use the culture was enriched in lb liquid medium at 37 c on a gyratory shaker at 160 rpm for 5 h then 5 ml of the enriched cell suspension was further transferred to 100 ml of mineral salt medium msm 5 0 g l nh4cl 2 5 g l k2hpo4 5 0 g l na2hpo4 0 1 g l mgso4 7h2o ph 6 8 with 20 g l glucose as the

reagent grade with purity sufficient for analytical applications quartz sand sio2 96 loss on ignition 0 40 xiamen iso standard sand co ltd china with particle size of 0 50 0 80 mm was used to simulate porous media before use the sand has to go through a series of treatments xia et al 2018 briefly it was washed with deionized milli q water to remove any clay or silt and soaked in hcl solution 0 25 m and naoh solution 0 25 m for 12 h to remove metal impurities the sand was then washed with milli q water to adjust the ph to 7 0 7 2 and burned in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h to remove any organic matter and sterilized using ultraviolet uv light a synthetic nutrient solution containing glucose as the sole carbon source was used to stimulate bacterial growth in the sand column the

to 7 0 7 2 before being injected into the columns the nutrient solution was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min 2 2 adsorption experiments the linear correlation between the optical density od of cell suspension at the wavelength of 600 nm and the number of colony forming units cfu of c 5 od 600 107 cfu ml was obtained by measuring the formation of a colony in a diluted cell suspension on an agar plate then the od 600 of the cell suspension was measured to obtain the concentration of bacterial cells the cells were harvested after growing to the stationary phase in the msm because the physiological status of cells was comparatively stable at this stage after which they were collected via centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min the precipitated cells were washed twice with normal saline and re suspended in the normal saline solution with different concentrations of rl the cell suspension in normal saline with od 600 of 0 6 standing for 1 h to guarantee full interaction between the rl and cells was used in the adsorption experiments each 40 ml of the cell suspension was then added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 5 g of quartz sand the bacteria rl quartz sand mixtures were then allowed to equilibrate at 160 rpm on a reciprocal shaker at 25 c until adsorption equilibrium was reached after which the mixtures were left to stand for 15 min the quantity of cells was monitored by optical density measurement the number of cells that were adsorbed onto the quartz sand was calculated by the difference in the amount of bacteria in the mixtures before and after adsorption and corrected using the blank adsorption data the adsorption tests were run in triplicate to analyze the competitive adsorption of rl on the surface of bacteria and quartz sand the amount of rl adsorbed on the surface of bacteria and quartz sand was measured at different concentrations of rl briefly the adsorbed bacteria rl quartz sand mixtures was centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min to remove the sand and bacteria the concentration of rl in the aqueous phase was measured according to the phenol sulfuric acid method zhong et al 2007 the amount of rl adsorbed by sand and bacteria was calculated by the difference of rl concentrations in the aqueous phase before and after adsorption in the bacteria rl mixtures the difference of rl concentrations before and after adsorption was the content of rl adsorbed by bacteria then the amount of rl adsorbed separately by quartz sand could be calculated freundlich langmuir and henry equations were used to characterize the adsorption thermodynamics of

polystyrene plates after centrifugation the cells were suspended in msm with glucose containing different concentrations of rl 200 μl of the cell suspension was added to each well in the microplates which were then incubated in a static mode at 30 c for 72 h during this period the medium was replaced every 24 h the biofilms were evaluated using the crystal violet assay method stepanovic et al 2007 firstly the suspended cells were carefully removed by pipette from the 96 well microplates after biofilm cultivation the biofilms were then fixed in 200 μl well of 99 methanol for 15 min and left to dry then 0 1 crystal violet solution was added with 120 μl well to stain the biofilm the excess stain was washed five times with normal saline and the empty plates were left to dry the dye that was bound to the cells was destained with 150 μl well of 95 ethanol then 100 μl dye dissolved in 95 ethanol was transferred to a new microplate in each well the absorbance of the dissolved crystal violet by the biofilms was measured at 570 nm by a microplate reader rt 6000 rayto life and analytical sciences co ltd china to quantify the total biofilm formation ten replicate wells were prepared for each experimental condition and msm not inoculated with bacteria was used as the blank 2 4 column experiments the schematic diagram of the column experiment setup is shown in fig 1 the plexiglass column was 160 mm in height with an internal diameter of 25 mm piezometers were connected to the column at 0 2 4 6 8 and 9 5 cm from the inlet to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity stainless screens 80 mesh were fixed at the bottom as a distributor to support the quartz sand fine stainless steel screens were placed at each end of the columns to prevent sand grains from creeping out the columns were wet packed with the pretreated sand in increments of 2 cm to avoid air entrapment and homogenize every layer a 2 cm thick glass bead diameter 2 3 mm layer was placed on the top of the inlet screen to level out the influent passing through the porous media surface the sterilized milli q water was then injected into the packed column for 12 h under a constant hydraulic head loss δh 8 cm to ensure the column was fully saturated the bacterial inoculum that was cultured in the msm after growing to the stationary phase was collected and diluted with normal saline to an od 600 of 0 08 the microbial

then fed into the column with a peristaltic pump in this study different concentrations of rl 0 20 40 and 80 mg l were prepared in the bacterial suspension and nutrient solutions in addition a group that was not inoculated with bacteria was set as the blank control all the other experimental conditions were consistent with the column experiments described before after a predetermined time interval the flow rates and hydraulic head were measured to calculate the hydraulic conductivity values of different layers ki four seperated sand columns were conducted under each rl concentration

cytometry fcm first the sand samples were pretreated to extract the bacteria sand samples of 3 g were collected in a sterilized centrifuge tube and mixed with 5 ml of phosphate buffer solution pb 10 mm ph 7 4 and 1 g of glass beads the samples were then sonicated three times for 10 s at intervals of 30 s to avoid overheating subsequently the mixtures were vortex oscillated for 1 min the solutions were then filtered through a 300 purpose screen to avoid clogging the machine and were placed in an eppendorf tube the bacteria solution 1 ml was stained with sybr green i 10 μl 1 100 v v of dye s

depicted by liu and fang 2002 with slight modifications xia et al 2014 after extraction the amounts of proteins and polysaccharides were measured and the sum of the two was recorded as eps the polysaccharides μg g sand were measured according to the phenol sulfuric acid method bo et al 1996 and the protein μg g sand assayed by the bradford assay sharma and babitch 1980 the content was measured using ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer sq2800 unico usa 2 5 4 zeta potential the zeta potential of the sand and cells was measured as a function of rl concentration using the zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk prior to this measurement the sand was ground into fine particles using a ball mill and 0 5 g of the particles was suspended in 10 ml of normal saline containing rl at different concentrations 0 20 40 60 80 or 100 mg l respectively the suspension was allowed to stand for 10 h in order to precipitate the large particles and establish a stable suspension the cells were collected by centrifugation after growing to the stationary phase and resuspended in different concentrations of rl for use the zeta potential measurements were determined based on the electrophoretic measurement which was conducted at 25 c hua et al 2007 the effect of rl on the electrostatic interaction between bacteria and quartz sand can be explained by zeta potential the independent sample t test was used to analyze the experimental data of zeta potential this analysis was conducted in ibm spss 24 0 2 5 5 cell surface hydrophobicity analysis the csh with normal saline as the background solution was measured using a modified bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons bath method described by zhong et al 2007 the bath method quantify the hydrophobicity of bacterial cells by portioning of bacterial cells between aqueous and organic solvent phases following this method the collected cells were washed twice with normal saline and then resuspended in different concentrations of rl the suspension was left to stand for 1 h and centrifuged again to remove impurities afterwards resuspended it to an od 400 of 0 6 0 06 4 0 ml of bacterial suspension and 1 0 ml of hexadecane were preincubated for 5 min vortex oscillated for 1 min and allowed to stand for 30 min the aqueous phase was carefully taken out to do the analysis the csh was expressed as the percentage difference between the od 400 of the initial cell suspension and the od 400 of the aqueous phase after preincubation the data of csh were analyzed by the same statistical method as that of zeta potential 2 5 6 ftir analysis ftir was conducted to analyze the changes of functional groups of clogging substances and quartz sand after rl treatment and to reveal the bonding effect between rl and clogging substances or quartz sand 3 g of sand samples from the columns were collected in 5 ml of pb and mixed with 1 g of glass beads the samples were sonicated and then vortex oscillated for 1 min the liquid and solid phases were collected separately in sterile centrifuge tubes the above treatments were carried out to separate the clogging substances from the quartz sand prior to the spectrum analysis all samples were freeze dried at 80 c for 2 3 days the samples were thoroughly ground and mixed with spectral pure kbr at a ratio of 1 99 after pressing into sheets ftir analysis was conducted tensor 27 bruck germany the scanning area was 4000 400 cm 1 and the resolution was 4 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of rl on the bacterial adsorption onto porous media the adsorption of bacteria onto porous media proceeded rapidly over the initial 60 min and reached a plateau thereafter which indicates an equilibrium time of less than 1 h fig 2 the freundlich langmuir and henry models were used to describe the isothermal adsorption with the fitting parameters shown in table 1 it is apparent that the adsorption data fitted well to the freundlich equation followed by the henry equation and finally the langmuir equation this indicates that freundlich equation is more suitable for describing the adsorption behavior of bacteria on quartz sand the freundlich adsorption isotherms are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the 1 n in all the experimental groups was less than 1 indicating that the adsorption isotherm was l type this suggests a relatively strong affinity between the bacteria and the quartz sand under the conditions of this study the kf and 1 n values decreased when the amount of rl increased from 0 to 40 mg l and then increased again with a further increase in the rl concentration this suggests that a certain amount of rl can reduce both the intensity and the capacity for the adsorption of bacteria on quartz sand the kh which was obtained by fitting the data to henry equation had the same trend as kf and 1 n with the addition of different amounts of rl rl may be adsorbed on the surface of quartz sand and compete with bacteria for the adsorption site to reduce the adsorption of bacteria on quartz sand the adsorption amount of rl on the surface of bacteria and quartz sand is shown in fig 4 the results show that with the increase of rl concentrations the adsorption amount of rl on the surface of bacteria and quartz sand increased respectively however it was obvious that the adsorption capacity of bacteria to rl is much greater than that of quartz sand when the concentration of rl increased to 120 mg l the adsorption amount of rl on bacteria was 97 95 mg l which was 4 66 times greater than that on quartz sand this indicates that the adsorption of rl on bacteria is more dominant than that on quartz sand under different rl concentration condition the percentage of rl adsorbed on the quartz sand surface were both less than 15 therefore the effect of rl on bacterial adsorption should be related to changes in bacterial surface properties instead of competitive adsorption the details of the changes in bacterial surface properties will be discussed later 3 2 effect of rl on the formation of biofilm the biofilm biomass in the presence of different rl concentrations after 72 h was examined by crystal violet staining assay as shown in fig 5 the biofilm biomass decreased as the rl concentration increased 0 20 and 40 mg l the biofilm biomass at 40 mg l was 88 1 less than that in the group without rl however the biofilm biomass increased as the rl concentration continued to increase 60 80 and 100 mg l the result shows that adding low concentrations of rl to the medium could reduce the production of biofilm biomass especially at 40 mg l the effect of rl on the biofilm formation is correlated to its modification of csh due to its amphiphilic property csh affects both cell to surface and cell to cell interactions and is an important factor in both bacterial aggregation and the formation of biofilm previous studies have indicated that the adsorption of bacteria on the media is an important stage of biofilm formation camprovin et al 2017 the results discussed in the previous section indicate that rl inhibited the adsorption of bacteria onto the surface of the quartz sand especially at the concentration of 40 mg l therefore it is speculated that rl reduced the biomass of biofilms by weakening the adsorption strength of bacteria 3 3 effect of rl on bioclogging during artificial recharge 3 3 1 effect of rl on relative hydraulic conductivity column experiments were conducted to simulate the process of artificial recharge the ke gradually decreased over time for all groups as shown in fig 6 a the severity of bioclogging was in the following order 0 rl 20 rl 80 rl 40 rl in addition the change rate of ke over time was the largest when no rl was injected and the smallest when 40 rl was injected fig 6b for example when ke decreased to 0 4 the 0 rl 20 rl 40 rl and 80 rl groups required a injection time of 8 5 h 11 h 15 5 h and 11 5 h respectively this indicates that rl alleviated bioclogging however the degree of bioclogging does not change linearly with rl concentration 40 mg l was the optimal concentration of rl for the alleviation of bioclogging this result is consistent with the effect of rl on the adsorption and biofilm formation of bacteria on quartz sand indicating that rl alleviated the bioclogging of the sand columns by inhibiting adsorption which was the first step in biofilm formation the k of the different layers of sand columns all showed a decreasing trend over time but at different rates fig 7 in all experimental groups k1 0 2 cm decreased fastest and the differences between the value of k1 and the k in the other layers gradually augmented over time taking 0 rl as an example fig 7a k1 decreased to 0 75 after an experimental period of 1 5 h with values that were 12 24 21 and 22 smaller than k2 2 4 cm k3 4 6 cm k4 6 8 cm and k5 8 9 5 cm respectively at the end of the recharge 8 h k1 decreased to 0 14 which was 82 85 85 and 82 smaller than k2 k3 k4 and k5 respectively this result indicates that a higher degree of clogging occurred in the surface layer compared to deeper areas which is consistent with the results of previous studies wang et al 2020 xia et al 2016 this study was conducted under homogeneous condition which means the initial permeability of the sand column at different locations has minimal difference as the recharge water was injected from top to bottom the bacteria contacted with the surface layer of the sand column first where dissolved oxygen and nutrients were most abundant therefore the alive bacteria grow and accumulated in the surface layer of columns causing the most serious bioclogging there compared with 0 rl the difference in k1 and k2 in groups with rl was smaller especially for the experiment with 40 rl for example when ke decreased to 0 4 k1 was 45 41 27 and 38 lower than k2 in the groups with 0 rl 20 rl 40 rl and 80 rl respectively this result indicates that the permeability of the second layer 2 4 cm in groups with rl was lower than that of the group without rl although the entire sand column reached the same degree of clogging this is due to the enhancement in the cell transport by rl in the sand column studies conducted by liu et al 2017 also illustrated that low concentrations of rl enhanced the transport of cell in sand columns 3 3 2 effect of rl on bacterial cell amount the bacterial cell amount in the surface layer of the sand columns with different concentrations of rl is shown in fig 8 during the whole process the bacterial cell amount in groups with rl was less than that in the group without rl moreover the growth rate of the 0 rl group was significantly higher than that of other groups so the difference in groups with rl and the group without rl expanded over time the order of bacterial cell amount in the different groups at the same time point was 0 rl 20 rl 80 rl 40 rl the bacterial cell amount in 40 rl was 57 less than that of 0 rl group at 10 h meanwhile the value of k in the 40 rl group decreased slowly with a decrease of only 0 1 after 10 h injection this indicates that the addition of rl reduced the bacterial cell count on the surface layer of the sand columns during clogging especially with the rl concentration of 40 mg l during the period 10 to 16 h the increase rate of bacterial cells in 40 rl was significantly lower than other groups and the decline rate of ke in 40 rl was also lower than that in 0 rl after injected for 16 h the bacterial cell amount decreased due to nutritional and spatial limitations while ke continued to decrease this result indicates that ke was not linearly negatively correlated with the bacterial cell amount therefore bacterial cell amount was not the only reason for the decline of ke our study shows that bacteria did not use rl as the carbon source for growth and metabolism data not shown it is possible that rl reduces the initial adsorption of bacteria onto porous media by reducing the hydrophobicity of the bacteria and thus less bacterial cells in the porous media hence further experiments were conducted to investivate the mechanism of rl affecting bioclogging of porous media 3 3 3 effect of rl on eps concentrations as shown in fig 9 a the eps content in all experimental groups increased gradually over time during the entire injection period the change in the eps content followed the same trend as that of the bacterial cell count which was 0 rl 20 rl 80 rl 40 rl at 10 h the eps content of 0 rl increased to 81 51 ug g sand which was 1 32 2 04 and 1 46 times larger than that of 20 rl 40 rl and 80 rl respectively it should be noted that the eps content in the 40 rl group was the lowest among all groups this result indicates that rl reduced the eps content in the porous media especially at the concentration 40 mg l during the whole seepage process k had significant negative correlation with eps therefore eps plays an important role in decline of k over the whole injection period polysaccharides and proteins are the major components in eps with content that accounts for 70 80 of the eps flemming and wingender 2010 this study therefore measured the polysaccharide and protein contents as shown in fig 9b and c it can be seen that compared with the protein content rl has a greater impact on the polysaccharide content taking 0 rl and 40 rl as examples the polysaccharide content of 0 rl was 2 2 times greater than that of 40 rl at 10 h and protein content of 0 rl was 1 7 times larger than that of 40 rl this indicates that rl caused a greater reduction in the amount of polysaccharide in eps compared to protein eps are slimy or gummy materials secreted by microorganisms which can wrap around the microorganisms and become attached to porous media eps played an important role in the initial adhesion ability of the cells the cohesion and thickness of the biofilm formed and the resistance of the biofilm to external conditions vandevivere and baveye 1992 conducted sand column experiments in which they inoculated both eps producing bacteria and non eps producing bacteria respectively and identified eps as the main reason for the occurrence of bioclogging li et al 2019 reported that lipid polymer nanoparticles that contain rl as a shell can inhibit the formation of the helicobacter pylori biofilm and rl plays an important role in eliminating eps du et al 2016 suggested that rl enhanced the dissolution and dispersion of eps in constructed wetlands therefore rl has an important influence on the morphology and structure of eps which is related to the amphiphilicity of rl it has also been demonstrated that the hydrophobic moieties of rl are connected to eps in porous media and the hydrophilic moieties are connected to water du et al 2016 which may promote the dissolution of eps from porous media moreover rl could reduce the adsorption capacity of bacterial cells on porous media and thus resulting in the reduction of eps produced by bacteria 3 4 mechanism of rl mediated bioclogging the above studies show that rl can inhibit the adsorption of bacteria on quartz sand reduce the amount of biofilm form and significantly alleviate bioclogging during artificial recharge to understand the mechanism of rl in bioclogging the infrared absorption spectra of clogging substances and quartz sand were analyzed fig 10 shows the infrared absorption spectra of the clogging substances under treatment with rl it shows that the infrared peak positions of the two are similar although the intensities are obviously different the band at 3343 3338 cm 1 is related to the stretching vibration of oh groups with intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the addition of 40 mg l rl the absorption strength decreased significantly indicating that the rl destroyed some of the hydrogen bond inside the molecule the bands at 2923 and 2855 cm 1 correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration peaks of methylene the addition of rl weakened the absorption intensity of both and the peak at 2855 cm 1 even disappeared indicating that rl interacts with the methylene in the polysaccharides or the proteins in the bacteria the bands at 1651 cm 1 1537 cm 1 and 1240 cm 1 correspond to the co in amide i the nh cn in amide ⅱ and the ch in amide iii in the protein respectively the intensity of this absorption peak decreased slightly after the addition of rl which indicates that rl reduced the protein content the abundance of polysaccharides is signaled by vibrations at 1058 cm 1 which was caused by the stretching vibration of the co and cc bonds in polysaccharides and the deformation vibrations of coh and coc after adding rl the absorption peak redshifted to 1075 cm 1 and the intensity decreased this indicates that the glycoside bonds inside the polysaccharides were broken and that the rl reduced the content of polysaccharides based on these results we confirmed that rl did not form new bonds with the clogging material but reduced the amount of proteins and polysaccharides caused by other mechanisms during the clogging process the infrared absorption spectra of quartz sand are shown in fig 11 the bends at 1193 cm 1 1108 cm 1 1009 cm 1 and 1087 cm 1 correspond to siosi bond and the bends at 799 cm 1 692 cm 1 and 511 cm 1 are associated with sio bond these are expected because sio2 is the main component of pure quartz sand after the clogging occur the surface of the quartz sand attached to both bacteria and eps comparison of the infrared spectrum of the cleaned quartz sand and the 0 rl group quartz sand indicates that after recharge the peak caused by siosi vibration had narrowed the number of peaks had decreased and the position had shifted which was due to the debris that was adhered to the surface of the quartz sand being removed the infrared spectra of the quartz sand with or without rl showed limited difference overall indicating that rl did not bond with the quartz sand the electrostatic interaction between bacteria and quartz sand is an important factor that affects their interaction the influence of rl on the zeta potential of bacteria and quartz sand is shown in table 2 the zeta potential of quartz sand was found to be approximately 26 4 mv without the addition of rl as the rl concentration gradually increased to 100 mg l the surface zeta potential changed slightly rl is negatively charged due to its carboxyl group therefore the adsorption of rl on quartz sand may increase the negative charge density on the surface thereby reducing its surface zeta potential however the adsorption amount of rl on the quartz sand surface is less this phenomenon illustrates that the effect of rl on the zeta potential of quartz sand is small the zeta potential on the surface of the bacteria decreased with an increase in the rl concentration from the initial 16 8 mv to 25 8 mv this can be explained by the adsorption of negatively charged rl by the bacteria increasing the surface negative charge density of the bacteria reducing the surface zeta potential the effect of rl on bioclogging may be explained by its influence on the electrostatic interactions between cells and porous media however the optimal concentration of rl affecting the zeta potential of bacteria and quartz sand is 100 mg l rather than 40 mg l which is the optimal concentration to alleviate bioclogging this result indicates that the electrostatic interaction is not the dominant mechanism by which low concentrations of rl affect bioclogging the hydrophobicity of bacteria is another factor that affects the interaction between bacteria and medium the relationship between csh and rl concentration is shown in table 2 csh gradually decreased with the increase of rl concentration from 0 to 40 mg l but when the concentration of rl continued to increase to 80 mg l csh began to increase in other words the surface hydrophobicity of bacteria does not change linearly with the concentration of rl the reason for this result is related to the cmc of rl cmc is the minimum concentration at which surfactant molecules combine to form micelles in solvents the main mechanism by which the surface hydrophobicity is modified by the biosurfactant rl is the adsorption of rl onto the surface of the bacteria which changes the surface structure of the bacteria liu et al 2014 the monomer adsorption and micelle adsorption characteristics of biosurfactants on the bacterial surface are different rl monomer adsorption is the interaction of one moiety of rl molecules with the chemical groups on cell surface which is a tight and irreversible binding bai et al 1997 zhong et al 2007 the change of rl monomer on the cell surface hydrophobicity depends on its adsorption orientation on the bacterial surface therefore at low rl concentrations 20 and 40 mg l below cmc rl can be adsorbed tightly on the surface of bacteria through the hydrophobicity between non polar groups or the van der waals force at this point the hydrophilic groups in the rl are exposed to the environment which can reduce the hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface górna et al 2011 zhang and miller 1994 however the micelle adsorption is only the accumulation of micelles on the adsorption site which is easy to be prewashed to remove or destroy zhong et al 2007 therefore as the amount of rl continues to increase to 80 mg l above cmc micelle adsorption of biosurfactants had little effect on the hydrophobicity of bacteria and resulting in an increase in csh in addition rl s adsorption onto the surface of the bacteria may cause the loss of hydrophilic lipids and polysaccharides from the cell surface to be replaced by phospholipids with strong hydrophobicity thus improving the hydrophobicity of the cell surface al tahhan et al 2000 there was no linear correlation between csh and rl concentration but there was an obvious negative correlation between csh and the degree of clogging in the sand columns in addition csh was negatively correlated with bacterial cell amount and eps content rl was found able to reduce csh at a certain concentration and the decrease in csh decreased the adsorption strength of the bacteria onto the surface of the porous media thus reducing bacterial cells amount and eps content in the sand columns therefore the decrease of csh is hypothesized to be the dominant mechanism by which rl affects bioclogging overall during the simulated artificial recharge the alleviation of bioclogging occurred after the addition of rl rl could reduce cell surface hydrophobicity and thus reducing the bacterial adsorption on quartz sand surface the decrease of bacterial adsorption can effectively prevent the biofilm accumulation in the clogging layer of sand column and inhibit the decrease of permeability consequently the bioclogging problems can be alleviated within a certain period of time compared with other methods the introduce of rl in recharging water has considerable advantages to prevent or solve the clogging problem during artificial recharge for example compared with excavating and backfilling of media and backwashing the substrate adding rl has minimal impact on the original substrate and would be easier to operate and maintain compared with other chemical reagent rl won t cause secondary pollution and has been widely used in soil and groundwater remediation although rl treatment is slightly expensive than the commonly used chemical reagents such as hydrogen peroxide sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid or sodium hypochlorite the cost of rl injection is less than excavation and backfill or backwash techniques therefore applying rl to solve clogging is expected to be a cost effective and environmental friendly method 4 conclusions the effect of biosurfactant rl on biological clogging in artificial recharge was experimentally investigated adsorption batch experiments demonstrated that the addition of low concentrations of rl resulted in a decrease in the kf and 1 n which were obtained by fitting data to the freundlich model for the adsorption of bacteria on quartz sand this indicates that rl could reduce the adsorption of bacteria on the quartz sand in addition a certain concentration of rl reduced the production of biofilm biomass column experiments demonstrated that the colonization of bacteria on the surface layer of the sand column caused bioclogging the addition of rl enhances the potential for cell transport and alleviates bioclogging during artificial recharge rl could not form new bonds with clogging material and quartz sand but could decrease the amount of clogging material such as polysaccharides and proteins in eps the degree of bioclogging is linearly correlated with csh but it does not have correlation with zeta potential therefore hydrophobic interaction instead of electrostatic interaction is the dominant mechanism by which rl alleviates bioclogging this study adds insight for understanding the mechanism of rl to alleviate bioclogging of porous media during artificial recharge which is of importance to effectively solve environmental geological problems such as land

4787,bioclogging can significantly reduce the permeability of porous media restricting the application of artificial recharge in this study the quantitative efficiency and mechanism by which rhamnolipid rl biosurfactant prevents bioclogging during artificial recharge were investigated in both batch reactor and column systems the batch experiments indicated that the adsorption of bacteria onto quartz sand surface was significantly reduced in the presence of rl the adsorption isotherm data were well fitted to the freundlich model the freundlich sorption affinities kf of bacteria in the presence of 0 20 40 and 80 mg l rl were 3 20 1 55 0 79 and 1 21 respectively in the microplate biofilm experiments the addition of 40 mg l of rl 40 rl reduced the total biomass to 17 4 the percolation sand column experiments demonstrated the efficacy of rl alleviating bioclogging more time was taken 18 h for the 40 rl group to achieve a relative hydraulic conductivity k of 0 20 compared with the group without the addition of rl 0 rl 12 h meanwhile the accumulation of bacterial cells and the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps which are the main contributors to bioclogging were lower in groups with rl than in those without rl the optimal concentration of rl is 40 mg l the decreasing degree of k in different experimental groups was linearly correlated with rl dependent cell surface hydrophobicity csh the results of both batch and column experiments indicate that the rl reduced the adsorption capacity of bacteria onto the surface of porous media by modifying the hydrophobicity of the bacteria reducing bioclogging in artificial recharging this study therefore provides insights and guidances for reducing bioclogging thereby enhancing the efficiency of artificial recharge keywords bioclogging biosurfactant bacterial adsorption eps cell surface hydrophobicity 1 introduction excessive exploitation of groundwater can lead to many environmental geological problems such as land subsidence seawater intrusion and deterioration in the water quality artificial recharge which refers to the method of replenishing groundwater resources via artificial infiltration with collected surface water into aquifers has been widely used to alleviate these crises as for recharge water the reclaimed water is a limited resource but the use of rain flood water which is carried out in many countries such as japan germany and china yan et al 2013 can reduce the risk of flooding and replenish groundwater rathay et al 2018 however no matter what type of water is used for replenishment one of the main concerns during the recharge process is aquifer clogging it can significantly reduce the injection efficiency and the life of a well due to a decrease in the permeability of the aquifer clogging is usually classified into physical chemical and biological clogging baveye et al 1998 physical clogging mainly includes the infiltration of suspended solids and the release of entrapped air bubbles dror et al 2004 pavelic et al 2011 chemical clogging can stem from chemical precipitation bustos medina et al 2013 excessive microbial biomass can cause fouling of the porous media this is known as bioclogging page et al 2014 thullner 2010 previous studies show that bioclogging occurs in most recharge systems and plays a significant role in the effective operation of these systems cui et al 2018 vandevivere and baveye 1992 the process of bioclogging is complex researchers have demonstrated that bacterial cells are initially adsorbed onto the surface of the porous media where they metabolize secrete extracellular polymeric substances eps and form biofilms occupying pores and resulting in a substantial reduction in permeability jeong et al 2018 wang et al 2020 rubol et al 2014 dutta et al 2015 clogging can be controlled in two ways the first strategy is prevention which aims to delay or minimize clogging shen et al 2010 demonstrated that strategically arranging the supply and injection of water can effectively prevent clogging perujo et al 2019 proved that a bilayer comprised of coarse fine substrate can prevent bioclogging however bioclogging can still occur after a long running period when these methods are used hua et al 2013 the other strategy is restoration which is often applied after clogging occurs the main traditional treatment is to excavate the surface media and backfill with high penetration media nivala et al 2012 although the traditional treatment is relatively effective the operation of both methods is costly and has the potential to destroy the properties of the porous media there are also in situ methods that can be used to remove clogging such as the introduction of earthworms or microbial agents into the porous media thus reducing clogging by biological processes ye et al 2018 however the efficiency of these treatments may be limited by the ability of microorganisms to adapt to the environment another option is using chemical reagents such as hydrogen peroxide sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid or sodium hypochlorite nivala and rousseau 2009 hua et al 2010 this method can effectively reduce the problem of clogging but the introduce of chemicals into the subsurface may cause secondary pollution biosurfactants are a kind of biological compound that are produced by microorganisms because of the low toxicity and biodegradability of biosurfactants they have become more popular for application in the environment than chemical surfactants rhamnolipid rl is one of the most widely studied biosurfactants evidence suggests that rl can modify bacterial surfaces weaken bacterial adsorption and enhance the bacterial transport in porous media when applied for bio augmentation bai et al 1997 chen et al 2004 liu et al 2017 rl has a significant effect on the surface hydrophobicity csh of bacterial cells liu et al 2020 it has been suggested that this effect is due to the adsorption of rl onto the cell surface liu et al 2014 csh plays a significant role in several different bioprocesses such as cell to cell interaction and the formation of biofilm therefore it is considered as an important factor that can affect the adsorption of microbes onto porous media du et al 2016 indicated that rl can solubilize and disperse eps by conducting a solubilization experiment thus it is hypothesized that rl can be used to prevent bioclogging it is already known that rl can be used as an environmentally friendly solvent in soil and groundwater remediation however to the best of our knowledge the quantitative efficiency and mechanisms by which rl prevents biological clogging in aquifers have not been established to date in this study batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of low concentrations of rl biosurfactant on the cell adsorption behavior of quartz sand and biofilm formation column experiments were conducted to investigate the relationship between rl and the reduction of relative hydraulic conductivity k while bacterial cell amount and eps concentrations were also monitored in addition the mechanisms of rl that affect the interaction between bacteria and porous media was investigated by analyzing the spectral changes using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and monitoring the surface properties of cells and porous media such as the csh and the zeta potential 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa cctcc 91095 was obtained from the china center for type culture collection it was maintained in lyophilized stock at 20 c and revived on luria bertani lb solid medium before use the culture was enriched in lb liquid medium at 37 c on a gyratory shaker at 160 rpm for 5 h then

reagent grade with purity sufficient for analytical applications quartz sand sio2 96 loss on ignition 0 40 xiamen iso standard sand co ltd china with particle size of 0 50 0 80 mm was used to simulate porous media before use the sand has to go through a series of treatments xia et al 2018 briefly it was washed with deionized milli q water to remove any clay or silt and soaked in hcl solution 0 25 m and naoh solution 0 25 m for 12 h to remove metal impurities the sand was then washed with milli q water to adjust the ph to 7 0 7 2 and burned in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h to remove any organic matter and sterilized using ultraviolet uv light a synthetic nutrient solution containing glucose as the sole carbon source was used to stimulate bacterial growth in the sand column the nutrient solution consisted of glucose 50 mg l nh4cl 5 mg l k2hpo4 1 mg l nacl 0 5 mg l mgso4 7h2o 45 mg l cacl2 2h2o 20 mg l and 1 ml l of a trace elements solution xia et al 2014 the ph was adjusted to 7 0 7 2 before being injected into the columns the nutrient solution was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min 2 2 adsorption experiments the linear correlation between the optical density od of cell suspension at the wavelength of 600 nm and the number of colony forming units cfu of c 5 od 600 107 cfu ml was obtained by measuring the formation of a colony in a diluted cell suspension on an agar plate then the od 600 of the cell suspension was measured to obtain the concentration of bacterial cells the cells were harvested after growing to the stationary phase in the msm because the physiological status of cells was comparatively stable at this stage after which they were collected via centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min the precipitated cells were washed twice with normal saline and re suspended in the normal saline solution with different concentrations of rl the cell suspension in normal saline with od 600 of 0 6 standing for 1 h to guarantee full interaction between the rl and cells was used in the adsorption experiments each 40 ml of the cell suspension was then added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 5 g of quartz sand the bacteria rl quartz sand mixtures were then allowed to equilibrate at 160 rpm on a reciprocal shaker at 25 c until adsorption equilibrium was reached after which the mixtures were left to stand for 15 min the quantity of cells was monitored by optical density measurement the number of cells that were adsorbed onto the quartz sand was calculated by the difference in the amount of bacteria in the mixtures before and after adsorption and corrected using the blank adsorption data the adsorption tests were run in triplicate to analyze the competitive adsorption of rl on the surface of bacteria and quartz sand the amount of rl adsorbed on the surface of bacteria and quartz sand was measured at different concentrations of rl briefly the adsorbed bacteria rl quartz sand mixtures was centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min to remove the sand and bacteria the concentration of rl in the aqueous phase was measured according to the phenol sulfuric acid method zhong et al 2007 the amount of rl adsorbed by sand and bacteria was calculated by the difference of rl concentrations in the aqueous phase before and after adsorption in the bacteria rl mixtures the difference of rl concentrations before and after adsorption was the content of rl adsorbed by bacteria then the amount of rl adsorbed separately by quartz sand could be calculated freundlich langmuir and henry equations were used to characterize the adsorption thermodynamics of

polystyrene plates after centrifugation the cells were suspended in msm with glucose containing different concentrations of rl 200 μl of the cell suspension was added to each well in the microplates which were then incubated in a static mode at 30 c for 72 h during this period the medium was replaced every 24 h the biofilms were evaluated using the crystal violet assay method stepanovic et al 2007 firstly the suspended cells were carefully removed by pipette from the 96 well microplates after biofilm cultivation the biofilms were then fixed in 200 μl well of 99 methanol for 15 min and left to dry then 0 1 crystal violet solution was added with 120 μl well to stain the biofilm the excess stain was washed five times with normal saline and the empty plates were left to dry the dye that was bound to the cells was destained with 150 μl well of 95 ethanol then 100 μl dye dissolved in 95 ethanol was transferred to a new microplate in each well the absorbance of the dissolved crystal violet by the biofilms was measured at 570 nm by a microplate reader rt 6000 rayto life and analytical sciences co ltd china to quantify the total biofilm formation ten replicate wells were prepared for each experimental condition and msm not inoculated with bacteria was used as the blank 2 4 column experiments the schematic diagram of the column experiment setup is shown in fig 1 the plexiglass column was 160 mm in height with an internal diameter of 25 mm piezometers were connected to the column at 0 2 4 6 8 and 9 5 cm from the inlet to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity stainless screens 80 mesh were fixed at the bottom as a distributor to support the quartz sand fine stainless steel screens were placed at each end of the columns to prevent sand grains from creeping out the columns were wet packed with the pretreated sand in increments of 2 cm to avoid air entrapment and homogenize every layer a 2 cm thick glass bead diameter 2 3 mm layer was placed on the top of the inlet screen to level out the influent passing through the porous media surface the sterilized milli q water was then injected into the packed column for 12 h under a constant hydraulic head loss δh 8 cm to ensure the column was fully saturated the bacterial inoculum that was cultured in the msm after growing to the stationary phase was collected and diluted with normal saline to an od 600 of 0 08 the microbial content in the sample was 4 106 cfu ml by plate counting method the bacterial suspension was injected into the columns for 10 h and then allowed to stand for 12 h the sterilized nutrient solution was then fed into the column with a peristaltic pump in this study different concentrations of rl 0 20 40 and 80 mg l were prepared in the bacterial suspension and nutrient solutions in addition a group that was not inoculated with bacteria was set as the blank control all the other experimental conditions were consistent with the column experiments described before after a predetermined time interval the flow rates and hydraulic head were measured to calculate the hydraulic conductivity values of different layers ki four seperated sand columns were conducted under each rl concentration condition and the columns were dismantled at different times different layers of sand samples were collected for biochemical analysis each sampling was performed in triplicate 2 5 analytical methods 2

cytometry fcm first the sand samples were pretreated to extract the bacteria sand samples of 3 g were collected in a sterilized centrifuge tube and mixed with 5 ml of phosphate buffer solution pb 10 mm ph 7 4 and 1 g of glass beads the samples were then sonicated three times for 10 s at intervals of 30 s to avoid overheating subsequently the mixtures were vortex oscillated for 1 min the solutions were then filtered through a 300 purpose screen to avoid clogging the machine and were placed in an eppendorf tube the bacteria solution 1 ml was stained with sybr green i 10 μl 1 100 v v of dye s stock solution and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and incubated in the dark for 15 min the stained samples were counted using fcm to normalize fluorescence data a bead solution 10 μl of 106 beads ml 1 1 0 μm was added to the samples in a known concentration results are reported as bacterial cells 106 g sand 2 5 3 eps extraction and quantification eps was extracted using the formaldehyde naoh method depicted by liu and fang 2002 with slight modifications xia et al 2014 after extraction the amounts of proteins and polysaccharides were measured and the sum of the two was recorded as eps the polysaccharides μg g sand were measured according to the phenol sulfuric acid method bo et al 1996 and the protein μg g sand assayed by the bradford assay sharma and babitch 1980 the content was measured using ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer sq2800 unico usa 2 5 4 zeta potential the zeta potential of the sand and cells was measured as a function of rl concentration using the zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk prior to this measurement the sand was ground into fine particles using a ball mill and 0 5 g of the particles was suspended in 10 ml of normal saline containing rl at different concentrations 0 20 40 60 80 or 100 mg l respectively the suspension was allowed to stand for 10 h in order to precipitate the large particles and establish a stable suspension the cells were collected by centrifugation after growing to the stationary phase and resuspended in different concentrations of rl for use the zeta potential measurements were determined based on the electrophoretic measurement which was conducted at 25 c hua et al 2007 the effect of rl on the electrostatic interaction between bacteria and quartz sand can be explained by zeta potential the independent sample t test was used to analyze the experimental data of zeta potential this analysis was conducted in ibm spss 24 0 2 5 5 cell surface hydrophobicity analysis the csh with normal saline as the background solution was measured using a modified bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons bath method described by zhong et al 2007 the bath method quantify the hydrophobicity of bacterial cells by portioning of bacterial cells between aqueous and organic solvent phases following this method the collected cells were washed twice with normal saline and then resuspended in different concentrations of rl the suspension was left to stand for 1 h and centrifuged again to remove impurities afterwards resuspended it to an od 400 of 0 6 0 06 4 0 ml of bacterial suspension and 1 0 ml of hexadecane were preincubated for 5 min vortex oscillated for 1 min and allowed to stand for 30 min the aqueous phase was carefully taken out to do the analysis the csh was expressed as the percentage difference between the od 400 of the initial cell suspension and the od 400 of the aqueous phase after preincubation the data of csh were analyzed by the same statistical method as that of zeta potential 2 5 6 ftir analysis ftir was conducted to analyze the changes of functional groups of clogging substances and quartz sand after rl treatment and to reveal the bonding effect between rl and clogging substances or quartz sand 3 g of sand samples from the columns were collected in 5 ml of pb and mixed with 1 g of glass beads the samples were sonicated and then vortex oscillated for 1 min the liquid and solid phases were collected separately in sterile centrifuge tubes the above treatments were carried out to separate the clogging substances from the quartz sand prior to the spectrum analysis all samples were freeze dried at 80 c for 2 3 days the samples were thoroughly ground and mixed with spectral pure kbr at a ratio of 1 99 after pressing into sheets ftir analysis was conducted tensor 27 bruck germany the scanning area was 4000 400 cm 1 and the resolution was 4 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of rl on the bacterial adsorption onto porous media the adsorption of bacteria onto porous media proceeded rapidly over the initial 60 min and reached a plateau thereafter which indicates an equilibrium time of less than 1 h fig 2 the freundlich langmuir and henry models were used to describe the isothermal adsorption with the fitting parameters shown in table 1 it is apparent that the adsorption data fitted well to the freundlich equation followed by the henry equation and finally the langmuir equation this indicates that freundlich equation is more suitable for describing the adsorption behavior of bacteria on quartz sand the freundlich adsorption isotherms are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the 1 n in all the experimental groups was less than 1 indicating that the adsorption isotherm was l type this suggests a relatively strong affinity between the bacteria and the quartz sand under the conditions of this study the kf and 1 n values decreased when the amount of rl increased from 0 to 40 mg l and then increased again with a further increase in the rl concentration this suggests that a certain amount of rl can reduce both the intensity and the capacity for the adsorption of bacteria on quartz sand the kh which was obtained by fitting the data to henry equation had the same trend as kf and 1 n with the addition of different amounts of rl rl may be adsorbed on the surface of quartz sand and compete with bacteria for the adsorption site to reduce the adsorption of bacteria on quartz sand the adsorption amount of rl on the surface of bacteria and quartz sand is shown in fig 4 the results show that with the increase of rl concentrations the adsorption amount of rl on the surface of bacteria and quartz sand increased respectively however it was obvious that the adsorption capacity of bacteria to rl is much greater than that of quartz sand when the concentration of rl increased to 120 mg l the adsorption amount of rl on bacteria was 97 95 mg l which was 4 66 times greater than that on quartz sand this indicates that the adsorption of rl on bacteria is more dominant than that on quartz sand under different rl concentration condition the percentage of rl adsorbed on the quartz sand surface were both less than 15 therefore the effect of rl on bacterial adsorption should be related to changes in bacterial surface properties instead of competitive adsorption the details of the changes in bacterial surface properties will be discussed later 3 2 effect of rl on the formation of biofilm the biofilm biomass in the presence of different rl concentrations after 72 h was examined by crystal violet staining assay as shown in fig 5 the biofilm biomass decreased as the rl concentration increased 0 20 and 40 mg l the biofilm biomass at 40 mg l was 88 1 less than that in the group without rl however the biofilm biomass increased as the rl concentration continued to increase 60 80 and 100 mg l the result shows that adding low concentrations of rl to the medium could reduce the production of biofilm biomass especially at 40 mg l the effect of rl on the biofilm formation is correlated to its modification of csh due to its amphiphilic property csh affects both cell to surface and cell to cell interactions and is an important factor in both bacterial aggregation and the formation of biofilm previous studies have indicated that the adsorption of bacteria on the media is an important stage of biofilm formation camprovin et al 2017 the results discussed in the previous section indicate that rl inhibited the adsorption of bacteria onto the surface of the quartz sand especially at the concentration of 40 mg l therefore it is speculated that rl reduced the biomass of biofilms by weakening the adsorption strength of bacteria 3 3 effect of rl on bioclogging during artificial recharge 3 3 1 effect of rl on relative hydraulic conductivity column experiments were conducted to simulate the process of artificial recharge the ke gradually decreased over time for all groups as shown in fig 6 a the severity of bioclogging was in the following order 0 rl 20 rl 80 rl 40 rl in addition the change rate of ke over time was the largest when no rl was injected and the smallest when 40 rl was injected fig 6b for example when ke decreased to 0 4 the 0 rl 20 rl 40 rl and 80 rl groups required a injection time of 8 5 h 11 h 15 5 h and 11 5 h respectively this indicates that rl alleviated bioclogging however the degree of bioclogging does not change linearly with rl concentration 40 mg l was the optimal concentration of rl for the alleviation of bioclogging this result is consistent with the effect of rl on the adsorption and biofilm formation of bacteria on quartz sand indicating that rl alleviated the bioclogging of the sand columns by inhibiting adsorption which was the first step in biofilm formation the k of the different layers of sand columns all showed a decreasing trend over time but at different rates fig 7 in all experimental groups k1 0 2 cm decreased fastest and the differences between the value of k1 and the k in the other layers gradually augmented over time taking 0 rl as an example fig 7a k1 decreased to 0 75 after an experimental period of 1 5 h with values that were 12 24 21 and 22 smaller than k2 2 4 cm k3 4 6 cm k4 6 8 cm and k5 8 9 5 cm respectively at the end of the recharge 8 h k1 decreased to 0 14 which was 82 85 85 and 82 smaller than k2 k3 k4 and k5 respectively this result indicates that a higher degree of clogging occurred in the surface layer compared to deeper areas which is consistent with the results of previous studies wang et al 2020 xia et al 2016 this study was conducted under homogeneous condition which means the initial permeability of the sand column at different locations has minimal difference as the recharge water was injected from top to bottom the bacteria contacted with the surface layer of the sand column first where dissolved oxygen and nutrients were most abundant therefore the alive bacteria grow and accumulated in the surface layer of columns causing the most serious bioclogging there compared with 0 rl the difference in k1 and k2 in groups with rl was smaller especially for the experiment with 40 rl for example when ke decreased to 0 4 k1 was 45 41 27 and 38 lower than k2 in the groups with 0 rl 20 rl 40 rl and 80 rl respectively this result indicates that the permeability of the second layer 2 4 cm in groups with rl was lower than that of the group without rl although the entire sand column reached the same degree of clogging this is due to the enhancement in the cell transport by rl in the sand column studies conducted by liu et al 2017 also illustrated that low concentrations of rl enhanced the transport of cell in sand columns 3 3 2 effect of rl on bacterial cell amount the bacterial cell amount in the surface layer of the sand columns with different concentrations of rl is shown in fig 8 during the whole process the bacterial cell amount in groups with rl was less than that in the group without rl moreover the growth rate of the 0 rl group was significantly higher than that of other groups so the difference in groups with rl and the group without rl expanded over time the order of bacterial cell amount in the different groups at the same time point was 0 rl 20 rl 80 rl 40 rl the bacterial cell amount in 40 rl was 57 less than that of 0 rl group at 10 h meanwhile the value of k in the 40 rl group decreased slowly with a decrease of only 0 1 after 10 h injection this indicates that the addition of rl reduced the bacterial cell count on the surface layer of the sand columns during clogging especially with the rl concentration of 40 mg l during the period 10 to 16 h the increase rate of bacterial cells in 40 rl was significantly lower than other groups and the decline rate of ke in 40 rl was also lower than that in 0 rl after injected for 16 h the bacterial cell amount decreased due to nutritional and spatial limitations while ke continued to decrease this result indicates that ke was not linearly negatively correlated with the bacterial cell amount therefore bacterial cell amount was not the only reason for the decline of ke our study shows that bacteria did not use rl as the carbon source for growth and metabolism data not shown it is possible that rl reduces the initial adsorption of bacteria onto porous media by reducing the hydrophobicity of the bacteria and thus less bacterial cells in the porous media hence further experiments were conducted to investivate the mechanism of rl affecting bioclogging of porous media 3 3 3 effect of rl on eps concentrations as shown in fig 9 a the eps content in all experimental groups increased gradually over time during the entire injection period the change in the eps content followed the same trend as that of the bacterial cell count which was 0 rl 20 rl 80 rl 40 rl at 10 h the eps content of 0 rl increased to 81 51 ug g sand which was 1 32 2 04 and 1 46 times larger than that of 20 rl 40 rl and 80 rl respectively it should be noted that the eps content in the 40 rl group was the lowest among all groups this result indicates that rl reduced the eps content in the porous media especially at the concentration 40 mg l during the whole seepage process k had significant negative correlation with eps therefore eps plays an important role in decline of k over the whole injection period polysaccharides and proteins are the major components in eps with content that accounts for 70 80 of the eps flemming and wingender 2010 this study therefore measured the polysaccharide and protein contents as shown in fig 9b and c it can be seen that compared with the protein content rl has a greater impact on the polysaccharide content taking 0 rl and 40 rl as examples the polysaccharide content of 0 rl was 2 2 times greater than that of 40 rl at 10 h and protein content of 0 rl was 1 7 times larger than that of 40 rl this indicates that rl caused a greater reduction in the amount of polysaccharide in eps compared to protein eps are slimy or gummy materials secreted by microorganisms which can wrap around the microorganisms and become attached to porous media eps played an important role in the initial adhesion ability of the cells the cohesion and thickness of the biofilm formed and the resistance of the biofilm to external conditions vandevivere and baveye 1992 conducted sand column experiments in which they inoculated both eps producing bacteria and non eps producing bacteria respectively and identified eps as the main reason for the occurrence of bioclogging li et al 2019 reported that lipid polymer nanoparticles that contain rl as a shell can inhibit the formation of the helicobacter pylori biofilm and rl plays an important role in eliminating eps du et al 2016 suggested that rl enhanced the dissolution and dispersion of eps in constructed wetlands therefore rl has an important influence on the morphology and structure of eps which is related to the amphiphilicity of rl it has also been demonstrated that the hydrophobic moieties of rl are connected to eps in porous media and the hydrophilic moieties are connected to water du et al 2016 which may promote the dissolution of eps from porous media moreover rl could reduce the adsorption capacity of bacterial cells on porous media and thus resulting in the reduction of eps produced by bacteria 3 4 mechanism of rl mediated bioclogging the above studies show that rl can inhibit the adsorption of bacteria on quartz sand reduce the amount of biofilm form and significantly alleviate bioclogging during artificial recharge to understand the mechanism of rl in bioclogging the infrared absorption spectra of clogging substances and quartz sand were analyzed fig 10 shows the infrared absorption spectra of the clogging substances under treatment with rl it shows that the infrared peak positions of the two are similar although the intensities are obviously different the band at 3343 3338 cm 1 is related to the stretching vibration of oh groups with intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the addition of 40 mg l rl the absorption strength decreased significantly indicating that the rl destroyed some of the hydrogen bond inside the molecule the bands at 2923 and 2855 cm 1 correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration peaks of methylene the addition of rl weakened the absorption intensity of both and the peak at 2855 cm 1 even disappeared indicating that rl interacts with the methylene in the polysaccharides or the proteins in the bacteria the bands at 1651 cm 1 1537 cm 1 and 1240 cm 1 correspond to the co in amide i the nh cn in amide ⅱ and the ch in amide iii in the protein respectively the intensity of this absorption peak decreased slightly after the addition of rl which indicates that rl reduced the protein content the abundance of polysaccharides is signaled by vibrations at 1058 cm 1 which was caused by the stretching vibration of the co and cc bonds in polysaccharides and the deformation vibrations of coh and coc after adding rl the absorption peak redshifted to 1075 cm 1 and the intensity decreased this indicates that the glycoside bonds inside the polysaccharides were broken and that the rl reduced the content of polysaccharides based on these results we confirmed that rl did not form new bonds with the clogging material but reduced the amount of proteins and polysaccharides caused by other mechanisms during the clogging process the infrared absorption spectra of quartz sand are shown in fig 11 the bends at 1193 cm 1 1108 cm 1 1009 cm 1 and 1087 cm 1 correspond to siosi bond and the bends at 799 cm 1 692 cm 1 and 511 cm 1 are associated with sio bond these are expected because sio2 is the main component of pure quartz sand after the clogging occur the surface of the quartz sand attached to both bacteria and eps comparison of the infrared spectrum of the cleaned quartz sand and the 0 rl group quartz sand indicates that after recharge the peak caused by siosi vibration had narrowed the number of peaks had decreased and the position had shifted which was due to the debris that was adhered to the surface of the quartz sand being removed the infrared spectra of the quartz sand with or without rl showed limited difference overall indicating that rl did not bond with the quartz sand the electrostatic interaction between bacteria and quartz sand is an important factor that affects their interaction the influence of rl on the zeta potential of bacteria and quartz sand is shown in table 2 the zeta potential of quartz sand was found to be approximately 26 4 mv without the addition of rl as the rl concentration gradually increased to 100 mg l the surface zeta potential changed slightly rl is negatively charged due to its carboxyl group therefore the adsorption of rl on quartz sand may increase the negative charge density on the surface thereby reducing its surface zeta potential however the adsorption amount of rl on the quartz sand surface is less this phenomenon illustrates that the effect of rl on the zeta potential of quartz sand is small the zeta potential on the surface of the bacteria decreased with an increase in the rl concentration from the initial 16 8 mv to 25 8 mv this can be explained by the adsorption of negatively charged rl by the bacteria increasing the surface negative charge density of the bacteria reducing the surface zeta potential the effect of rl on bioclogging may be explained by its influence on the electrostatic interactions between cells and porous media however the optimal concentration of rl affecting the zeta potential of bacteria and quartz sand is 100 mg l rather than 40 mg l which is the optimal concentration to alleviate bioclogging this result indicates that the electrostatic interaction is not the dominant mechanism by which low concentrations of rl affect bioclogging the hydrophobicity of bacteria is another factor that affects the interaction between bacteria and medium the relationship between csh and rl concentration is shown in table 2 csh gradually decreased with the increase of rl concentration from 0 to 40 mg l but when the concentration of rl continued to increase to 80 mg l csh began to increase in other words the surface hydrophobicity of bacteria does not change linearly with the concentration of rl the reason for this result is related to the cmc of rl cmc is the minimum concentration at which surfactant molecules combine to form micelles in solvents the main mechanism by which the surface hydrophobicity is modified by the biosurfactant rl is the adsorption of rl onto the surface of the bacteria which changes the surface structure of the bacteria liu et al 2014 the monomer adsorption and micelle adsorption characteristics of biosurfactants on the bacterial surface are different rl monomer adsorption is the interaction of one moiety of rl molecules with the chemical groups on cell surface which is a tight and irreversible binding bai et al 1997 zhong et al 2007 the change of rl monomer on the cell surface hydrophobicity depends on its adsorption orientation on the bacterial surface therefore at low rl concentrations 20 and 40 mg l below cmc rl can be adsorbed tightly on the surface of bacteria through the hydrophobicity between non polar groups or the van der waals force at this point the hydrophilic groups in the rl are exposed to the environment which can reduce the hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface górna et al 2011 zhang and miller 1994 however the micelle adsorption is only the accumulation of micelles on the adsorption site which is easy to be prewashed to remove or destroy zhong et al 2007 therefore as the amount of rl continues to increase to 80 mg l above cmc micelle adsorption of biosurfactants had little effect on the hydrophobicity of bacteria and resulting in an increase in csh in addition rl s adsorption onto the surface of the bacteria may cause the loss of hydrophilic lipids and polysaccharides from the cell surface to be replaced by phospholipids with strong hydrophobicity thus improving the hydrophobicity of the cell surface al tahhan et al 2000 there was no linear correlation between csh and rl concentration but there was an obvious negative correlation between csh and the degree of clogging in the sand columns in addition csh was negatively correlated with bacterial cell amount and eps content rl was found able to reduce csh at a certain concentration and the decrease in csh decreased the adsorption strength of the bacteria onto the surface of the porous media thus reducing bacterial cells amount and eps content in the sand columns therefore the decrease of csh is hypothesized to be the dominant mechanism by which rl affects bioclogging overall during the simulated artificial recharge the alleviation of bioclogging occurred after the addition of rl rl could reduce cell surface hydrophobicity and thus reducing the bacterial adsorption on quartz sand surface the decrease of bacterial adsorption can effectively prevent the biofilm accumulation in the clogging layer of sand column and inhibit the decrease of permeability consequently the bioclogging problems can be alleviated within a certain period of time compared with other methods the introduce of rl in recharging water has considerable advantages to prevent or solve the clogging problem during artificial recharge for example compared with excavating and backfilling of media and backwashing the substrate adding rl has minimal impact on the original substrate and would be easier to operate and maintain compared with other chemical reagent rl won t cause secondary pollution and has been widely used in soil and groundwater remediation although rl treatment is slightly expensive than the commonly used chemical reagents such as hydrogen peroxide sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid or sodium hypochlorite the cost of rl injection is less than excavation and backfill or backwash techniques therefore applying rl to solve clogging is expected to be a cost effective and environmental friendly method 4 conclusions the effect of biosurfactant rl on biological clogging in artificial recharge was experimentally investigated adsorption batch experiments demonstrated that the addition of low concentrations of rl resulted in a decrease in the kf and 1 n which were obtained by fitting data to the freundlich model for the adsorption of bacteria on quartz sand this indicates that rl could reduce the adsorption of bacteria on the quartz sand in addition a certain concentration of rl reduced the production of biofilm biomass column experiments demonstrated that the colonization of bacteria on the surface layer of the sand column caused bioclogging the addition of rl enhances the potential for cell transport and alleviates bioclogging during artificial recharge rl could not form new bonds with clogging material and quartz sand but could decrease the amount of clogging material such as polysaccharides and proteins in eps the degree of bioclogging is linearly correlated with csh but it does not have correlation with zeta potential therefore hydrophobic interaction instead of electrostatic interaction is the dominant mechanism by which rl alleviates bioclogging this study adds insight for understanding the mechanism of rl to alleviate bioclogging of porous media during artificial recharge which is of importance to effectively solve environmental geological problems such as land subsidence and seawater intrusion credit authorship contribution statement xin li investigation methodology validation conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing ni yan writing

4788,california is facing water crisis especially with significant depletion of groundwater resources recently jasechko proposed a method for estimation of the fossil groundwater mass fraction ffossil based on 14c jasechko s method but it did not account for the endogenic carbon source based on carbon isotope and water chemistry balance the ratio of the concentration of endogenic carbon to dissolved inorganic carbon c endogenic dic ratio in groundwater is quantified and the jasechko s method is modified with consideration of endogenic carbon input both jasechko s and modified methods are applied to estimate the ffossil across california where endogenic co2 degases at many locations the results show that averagely the c endogenic takes up 23 4 of dic in groundwater samples with 19 4 of samples owning c endogenic dic ratio exceeding 50 about 8 4 of groundwater samples show smaller ffossil calculated by the modified than jasechko s method with the mean value of ffossil deceasing by 3 1 this indicates obvious mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater across california but it has little influence on the estimation of ffossil even though the process based modified method is more objective than the empirically jasechko s method groundwater samples with high c endogenic dic ratio and mass fraction difference of fossil groundwater between the two methods are mainly located in the mojave desert with wide distribution of main active faults the average ffossil calculated by both methods are 70 demonstrating the dominance of fossil groundwater across california these results are beneficial to better understand the 14c dating method and the groundwater resources in california keywords groundwater resources 14c dating endogenic carbon hydrological cycle geochemistry california 1 introduction california covering about 424000 km2 on the west coast of the united states is the 3rd largest state with the main physiographic feature of the coastal range in the west the central valley in the centre the sierra nevada in the east the cascade mountain ranges in the north and the mojave desert in the southeast visser et al 2016 limestone bodies are thick bowen 1973 and widely situated in central valley southeast california and along the coast region with details on the online geologic map cadoc 2021 it has an increasing trend of mean annual air temperature ranging from 2 in the north to 24 in the southeast but a reverse trend of mean annual precipitation from less than 100 mm in the southeast to over 3000 mm in the northwest visser et al 2016 due to the mismatch between the hydrologic cycle and when and where water is needed california is facing severe water crisis famiglietti 2014 sandoval solis 2020 taylor et al 2013 vicuna and dracup 2007 in california groundwater resources provide approximately 40 of the state s total water supply during a typical year while during dry years this amount increases to 60 or more of the total supply jasechko and perrone 2020 mcclurg and lauer 2017 the groundwater resources serve as a critical buffer against drought and climate change and play a vital role in maintaining california s economic and environmental sustainability gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 however several groundwater basins in california have experienced long term groundwater overdraft famiglietti 2014 kocis and dahlke 2017 russo and lall 2017 for example the annual rate of groundwater depletion in the central valley is estimated to be about 3 1 km3 yr from 2003 to 2010 famiglietti et al 2011 the evaluation of groundwater resources has been examined in several basins in california based on carbon 14 14c and or tritium t concentrations in groundwater manning et al 2015 vengosh et al 2002 visser et al 2019 2016 jasechko 2016 proposed a straight forward mixing model jasechko s method hereafter to quantify the fraction of a groundwater sample that recharged after 1953 based on t or before the past 12000 years based on 14c without requirement of a priori knowledge of age distributions although this approach is less useful in quantifying recharge rates cartwright et al 2017 it may be more realistic and prior to the age dating methods in one or more of the following ways and has been used for estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction globally jasechko et al 2017 this method employs the full time series of precipitation t and 14c variations throughout the quaternary account for radioactive decay prior to sampling and chemical analysis and consider that the groundwater sample could be a mixture of groundwater characterized by smooth or irregular unimodal or multimodal age distributions in addition the 14c based method takes the dissolution of 14c free carbonate mineral into consideration there are large amounts of endogenic co2 degassing from the deep crust and or upper mantle along major zones of seismicity as well as in young orogenic belts and rifting continental areas irwin and barnes 1980 with a minimum estimation of 900 mt yr in total around the world mörner and etiope 2002 the endogenic co2 gas enters into groundwater through faults and fractured rocks and can contribute more than 30 of groundwater dissolve inorganic carbon dic in highly unique settings where co2 degassing rates are atypically high chiodini et al 2004 crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 koh et al 2017 such amount of co2 with no 14c activity will not only increase dic in groundwater but also enhance the dissolution of the 14c free carbonate this endogenic carbon has significant influence on the groundwater 14c apparent age across the united states by reducing the 14c 12c carbon 12 ratio in dic wang et al 2020 endogenic co2 degassing has also been found to occur at many locations in california with wide distributions of travertine and travertine depositing cool springs kulongoski et al 2013 mörner and etiope 2002 newell et al 2005 although jasechko s method considers several physical processes and geochemical reactions that can alter the dic amount and hence the ratio of 14c 12c it does not entirely consider the endogenic carbon mixing in dic of groundwater on the foundation of water chemistry and carbon isotope balance this study aims at 1 quantifying the contribution of endogenic carbon to dic of groundwater 2 modifying the jasechko s method with consideration of endogenic carbon input and 3 estimation of the fossil groundwater mass fraction across the entire california 2 materials and methods 2 1 date collection the isotope 13c 14c and 4he

2005 more than half 793 out of 1567 available sites of groundwater samples own co2 gas concentrations exceeding 10 mg l with 11 1 174 out of 1567 available sites of samples owning the values of co2 gas concentrations larger than 60 mg l these evidences point to significant invasion of deep source co2 into these groundwater samples crossey et al 2006 therefore for comparison analysis both methods are employed to calculate the fossil groundwater mass fraction over california in order to evaluate the influence of endogenic carbon mixture in dic on the estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction 2 2 jasechko s method with the assumption of approximately constant dic concentration over depth the mass fraction ffossil of fossil groundwater older than 12000 yr is given as eq 1 jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 1 f fossil 1 a sample a fossil a holocene a fossil asample is the measured 14c content percent modern value pmc value in a groundwater sample aholocene and afossil is the holocene and fossil 14c content pmc value the holocene and fossil 14c inputs are derived from late quaternary atmospheric 14c time series with correction for radioactive decay based on the qt factor as given by eq 2 the atmospheric 14c time series are obtained from jasechko 2016 2 a t q t a pr t e 0 693 t sample t 5730 t apr t represents 14c activity in meteoric water at time t and tsample is the time when the groundwater sample is analysed aholocene and afossil is represented by at evaluated for the time interval of 0 t sample t 12000 yr and t sample t 12000 yr respectively assuming that the carbon isotopic composition of groundwater is a binary mixture of biogenically derived sedimentary carbon c biogenical and carbonate carbon c carbonate during the water rock interaction the factor qt is calculated based on eq 3 ingerson and pearson 1964 3 q t δ 13 c sample δ 13 c carbonate δ 13 c biogenical δ 13 c carbonate δ 13 c is the 13c carbon 13 isotopic composition per mil with the international standard of pee dee belemnite pdb as shown in eq 4 4 δ 13 c c 13 c 12 c 13 c 12 standard 1 1000 where δ 13 c has a value of zero for pdb standard it can be seen from eq 3 that the qt factor is the ratio of the concentrations of biogenically derived sedimentary carbon cbiogenical to dic csample in a groundwater sample due to the complex carbon sources and water rock interactions the δ 13 cbiogenical is commonly replaced by δ 13 crecharge in eq 3 which is empirically calculated as the average of δ 13 c in groundwater samples with 14c content larger than 100 pmc jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 in this study there are 116 groundwater samples with 14c content exceeding 100 pmc based on which the δ 13 crecharge is calculated as 16 31 this is supported by the general variation of 14c content with δ13 c which is that δ13 c values increase with asample values falling in these groundwater samples fig 2 a assuming that δ 13 ccarbonate 0 a typical value for marine carbonates sharp 2007 the qt factor can be calculated for each sample with the measured value of δ 13 csample the jasechko s fossil groundwater mass fraction ffossil jasechko can be obtained based on eqs 1 and 2 2 3 modified method with consideration of endogenic carbon for jasechko s method the qt factor is obtained from δ 13 c values of two carbon end members with additional mixture of endogenic carbon the modified method includes another carbon end member of endogenic carbon source c endogenic wang et al 2020 the carbon isotope mass balance equations are as follows 5 c biogenical 12 c

13 c carbonate 12 c carbonate δ 13 c endogenic 12 c endogenic δ 13 c sample 12 c sample as the carbon 12 natural abundance is larger than 98 93 rosman and taylor 1999 the 12c concentration is assumed to be equal to total carbon concentration i e 12 csample csample dic 12 cbiogenical cbiogenical 12 cendogenic cendogenic and 12 ccarbonate ccarbonate the 12 csample concentration can be measured as the sum of carbon dioxide co2 aq carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 in a groundwater sample in order to obtain as many samples as available the 12 csample concentration is measured as the concentration of bicarbonate for groundwater samples with carbon dioxide and or carbonate data missing as bicarbonate among the three is dominant in groundwater due to the wide spread of limestone in california dissolution of carbonate minerals are assumed to be the dominant water rock interactions and other processes are negligible such as interactions with silicates redox processes and exchanges of ions and isotopes crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 the dissolution process of carbonate minerals is as eq 9 9 c o 2 h 2 o c a x m g 1 x c o 3 x c a 2 1 x m g 2 2 h c o 3 in addition dissolution of sulfate minerals e g gypsum can also produce ca2 cas o 4 c a 2 s o 4 2 the carbon amount in moles provided by ca mg carbonate sulfate dissolution can be calculated as eq 10 crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 this assumption is supported by the overall strong correlation fig 2b between na k and cl concentrations in groundwater samples crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 10 12 c carbonate c a 2 m g 2 s o 4 2 plants of c3 type for example eriogonum fasciculatum avena fatua baccharis salicifolia and salvia apiana are dominant across california schmitt et al 1993 still et al 2003 and they have a typical δ 13 c value between 22 and 34 robinson and scrimgeour 1995 thus the average value of 28 is used for calculation δ 13 cbiogenical 28 similarly the average value of 6 5 is used for calculation δ 13 cendogenic 6 5 as it is suggested that the chilled margins of mid ocean ridge basalt own δ 13 c from 9 to 4 with an average of 6 5 javoy et al 1986 marty and jambon 1987 pineau and javoy 1983 sano and marty 1995 for eqs 5 and 8 the known variables are 12 csample and δ 13 csample measured from a groundwater sample 12 ccarbonate calculated based on eq 10 and the value of the relative carbon atomic mass of 12 δ 13 cbiogenical 28 δ 13 cendogenic 6 5 and δ 13 ccarbonate 0 as mentioned above therefore combining eqs 5 and 8 the qt factor cbiogenical csample 12 cbiogenical 12 csample and the ratio of the concentrations of endogenic carbon to dic cendogenic dic 12 cendogenic 12 csample can be obtained for each groundwater sample with the 12 cendogenic and 12 cbiogenical eliminated respectively subsequently the modified fossil groundwater mass fraction ffossil modified can be obtained with qt factor substituted into eqs 1 and 2 for comparison analysis the mass fraction difference mfd of fossil groundwater between jasechko s and modified methods is calculated as eq 11 11 mfd f f o s s i l j a s e c h k o f f o s s i l m o d i f i e d 3 results the ratio of the concentrations of endogenic carbon to dic c endogenic dic ratio has a mean value of about 23 4 supplementary dataset about 19 4 305 out of 1574 available sites of groundwater samples have c endogenic dic ratio larger than 50 supplementary dataset the c endogenic dic ratio of the selected groundwater samples increases with depth increasing fig 3 a the fossil groundwater mass fraction ffossil modified calculated by the modified method is obviously smaller than that ffossil jasechko calculated by the jasechko s method in approximately 8 4 132 out of 1574 available sites of groundwater samples fig 3b and supplementary dataset this value has a range between 1 4 22 out of 1574 available sites and 68 0 1070 out of 1574 available sites with consideration of the full time series of precipitation 14c variations throughout the quaternary supplementary dataset the mass fraction difference mfd of fossil groundwater between the two methods has a mean value of approximately 3 1 within the range from 1 2 to 9 8 supplementary dataset groundwater samples with high c endogenic dic ratio are mainly located in the mojave desert fig 4 a where main active faults are widely distributed wesnousky 1986 meanwhile groundwater samples with large values of mfd have a similar spatial distribution with those of high c endogenic dic ratio fig 4b averagely the ffossil jasechko and ffossil modified is about 72 5 70 3 76 7 and 69 4 67 0 71 5 respectively supplementary dataset they are both distributed widely across california in the spatial scale fig 4c and d in terms of depth distribution both the ffossil jasechko and ffossil modified increase with depth increasing fig 5 a and b the mfd firstly rises with depth increasing and then declines with the maximum value of about 6 6 at 250 300 m in depth fig 5c taking the full time series of precipitation 14c variations throughout the quaternary into consideration the distributions of the minimum and maximum values of both ffossil jasechko and ffossil modified with depth are also given in fig 5 as well as the mfd generally the fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by both methods increase with depth increasing while the mfd shows a rising trend with depth increasing before a decline with the maximum value at about 250 300 m in depth 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis there are several chemical and physical processes that will influence the 14c 12c ratio in groundwater sample and thus cause uncertainties when applying the modified method to calculate the fossil groundwater mass fraction firstly it is assumed that ca and mg in groundwater predominantly result from water rock interactions with carbonate and sulfate and it is second order importance of water rock interactions with silicates moreover it is negligible of the isotope exchange processes of dic with carbonates and co2 gases as well as the processes of ion exchange and redox during water rock interactions these may potentially result in non unique solutions there are other processes impacting the 14c 12c ratio in groundwater such as bacterial sulfate reduction and or methanogenesis aravena et al 1995 as dissolved methane is obviously detected in groundwater in the los angeles basin kulongoski et al 2018 kulongoski and mcmahon 2019 additionally some physical processes for example mixture of old and young groundwater during pumping from the wells and water leakage and or exchange between different aquifers can also alter the 14c 12c ratio underwood et al 2018 except for geochemical reactions and physical processes mentioned above the variation of employed parameters can also cause some uncertainties in calculating fossil groundwater mass fraction for both methods it is assumed that δ 13 ccarbonate 0 in addition it is assumed that δ 13 cendogenic 6 5 and δ 13 cbiogenical 28 for the modified method the δ 13 cendogenic has a range between 9 and 4 javoy et al 1986 marty and jambon 1987 pineau and javoy 1983 sano and marty 1995 and δ 13 cbiogenical in c3 plants generally varies from 34 to 22 robinson and scrimgeour 1995 for uncertainty analysis both δ 13 cendogenic and δ 13 cbiogenical are randomly generated 300 values following a normal distribution in the range of 6 5 0 8 mean value standard deviation for δ 13 cendogenic fig 6 a and 28 2 mean value standard deviation for δ 13 cbiogenical fig 6b respectively and then these 90 000 values are used to calculate the modified fossil groundwater mass fraction for the 1574 available groundwater samples on average the calculated modified fossil groundwater mass fraction is about 69 1 1 3 mean value standard deviation fig 6c implying that the average uncertainty of the fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by the modified method is approximately 1 3 larger than that of the jasechko s method 4 2 implications although it is less useful in quantifying the groundwater residence time and renewal rate fossil groundwater mass fraction is an important parameter for groundwater resource estimation with consideration of endogenic carbon mixing in groundwater the c endogenic dic ratio is quantified and the jasechko s method is modified both methods are applied to estimate the fossil groundwater mass fraction in california averagely endogenic carbon accounts for 23 4 of the dic in all groundwater samples and for more than half of the dic in 19 4 of groundwater samples across california this demonstrates the obvious mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater over california this endogenic carbon mixing in dic of groundwater results in smaller fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by the modified than jasechko s method in 8 4 of groundwater samples the average decease of fossil groundwater mass fraction is 3 1 by the modified than jasechko s method this indicates that the mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater has little influence on the estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction across the entire california however the modified method is more objective than jasechko s method in determining the factor qt as the former is a process based analysis on the foundation of mass balance while the latter is based on the empirical δ 13 crecharge groundwater samples with both high c endogenic dic ratio and mfd are mainly located in the mojave desert with wide distribution of main active faults this means more obvious mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater over the mojave desert with atypically high co2 degassing rates this is coincident with the process that endogenic co2 gas prefers to enter into groundwater through faults and fractured rocks chiodini et al 2004 crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 koh et al 2017 and dilutes the 14c 12c ratio thus making the groundwater old bias wang et al 2020 the values of c endogenic dic ratio show a rising trend with depth increasing which is consistent with the fact that deeper groundwater is more likely to be invaded by deeply derived endogenic carbon chiodini et al 2004 crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 koh et al 2017 averagely the fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by jasechko s and modified methods are both 70 without and with consideration of endogenic carbon mixture and they are distributed widely in the spatial scale indicating the dominance of fossil groundwater above 500 m in depth across the entire california jasechko et al 2017 with consideration of the full time series of precipitation 14c variations throughout the quaternary the mass fraction of fossil groundwater calculated by both methods rise with depth increasing coincidence with previous findings manning et al 2015 vengosh et al 2002 visser et al 2016 and common knowledge jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 the mfd shows a rising trend with depth increasing before a decline with the maximum value at about 250 300 m in depth these results provide valuable information for groundwater resources estimation and evaluation and thus are helpful for better understanding the groundwater resources in california 5 conclusions the jasechko s method for estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction does not entirely account for the endogenic carbon source on the basis of carbon isotopes and water chemistry balance the c endogenic dic ratio in groundwater samples is quantified and the jasechko s method is modified accounting for endogenic carbon input both jasechko s and modified methods are applied for estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction above 500 m in depth across the entire california where endogenic co2 degassing is found at many locations the conclusions are as follows 1 averagely endogenic carbon accounts for 23 4 of the dic in groundwater samples across california and 19 4 of groundwater samples owns c endogenic dic ratio exceeding 50 groundwater samples with high c endogenic dic ratio are mainly located in the mojave desert this indicates an obvious mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater in california especially over the mojave desert with atypically high co2 degassing rates 2 there are 8 4 of groundwater samples show smaller modified than jasechko s fossil groundwater mass fraction with the average value of fossil groundwater mass fraction decrease by 3 1 although the mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater has little influence on the estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction across california the process based modified method is more objective than the empirically jasechko s method in determining the factor qt 3 similar to the distribution of groundwater samples with high c endogenic dic ratio groundwater samples with high mfd are mainly located in the mojave desert with wide distribution of main active faults on average the fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by both methods are 70 and they are distributed widely this indicates the dominance of fossil groundwater above 500 m in depth across the entire

4788,california is facing water crisis especially with significant depletion of groundwater resources recently jasechko proposed a method for estimation of the fossil groundwater mass fraction ffossil based on 14c jasechko s method but it did not account for the endogenic carbon source based on carbon isotope and water chemistry balance the ratio of the concentration of endogenic carbon to dissolved inorganic carbon c endogenic dic ratio in groundwater is quantified and the jasechko s method is modified with consideration of endogenic carbon input both jasechko s and modified methods are applied to estimate the ffossil across california where endogenic co2 degases at many locations the results show that averagely the c endogenic takes up 23 4 of dic in groundwater samples with 19 4 of samples owning c endogenic dic ratio exceeding 50 about 8 4 of groundwater samples show smaller ffossil calculated by the modified than jasechko s method with the mean value of ffossil deceasing by 3 1 this indicates obvious mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater across california but it has little influence on the estimation of ffossil even though the process based modified method is more objective than the empirically jasechko s method groundwater samples with high c endogenic dic ratio and mass fraction difference of fossil groundwater between the two methods are mainly located in the mojave desert with wide distribution of main active faults the average ffossil calculated by both methods are 70 demonstrating the dominance of fossil groundwater across california these results are beneficial to better understand the 14c dating method and the groundwater resources in california keywords groundwater resources 14c dating endogenic carbon hydrological cycle geochemistry california 1 introduction california covering about 424000 km2 on the west coast of the united states is the 3rd largest state with the main physiographic feature of the coastal range in the west the central valley in the centre the sierra nevada in the east the cascade mountain ranges in the north and the mojave desert in the southeast visser et al 2016 limestone bodies are thick bowen 1973 and widely situated in central valley southeast california and along the coast region with details on the online geologic map cadoc 2021 it has an increasing trend of mean annual air temperature ranging from 2 in the north to 24 in the southeast but a reverse trend of mean annual precipitation from less than 100 mm in the southeast to over 3000 mm in the northwest visser et al 2016 due to the mismatch between the hydrologic cycle and when and where water is needed california is facing severe water crisis famiglietti 2014 sandoval solis 2020 taylor et al 2013 vicuna and dracup 2007 in california groundwater resources provide approximately 40 of the state s total water supply during a typical year while during dry years this amount increases to 60 or more of the total supply jasechko and perrone 2020 mcclurg and lauer 2017 the groundwater resources serve as a critical buffer against drought and climate change and play a vital role in maintaining california s economic and environmental sustainability gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 however several groundwater basins in california have experienced long term groundwater overdraft famiglietti 2014 kocis and dahlke 2017 russo and lall 2017 for example the annual rate of groundwater depletion in the central valley is estimated to be about 3 1 km3 yr from 2003 to 2010 famiglietti et al 2011 the evaluation of groundwater resources has been examined in several basins in california based on carbon 14 14c and or tritium t concentrations in groundwater manning et al 2015 vengosh et al 2002 visser et al 2019 2016 jasechko 2016 proposed a straight forward mixing model jasechko s method hereafter to quantify the fraction of a groundwater sample that recharged after 1953 based on t or before the past 12000 years based on 14c without requirement of a priori knowledge of age distributions although this approach is less useful in quantifying recharge rates cartwright et al 2017 it may be more realistic and prior to the age dating methods in one or more of the following ways and has been used for estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction globally jasechko et al 2017 this method employs the full time series of precipitation t and 14c variations throughout the quaternary account for radioactive decay prior to sampling and chemical analysis and consider that the groundwater sample could be a mixture of groundwater characterized by smooth or irregular unimodal or multimodal age distributions in addition the 14c based method takes the dissolution of 14c free carbonate mineral into consideration there are large amounts of endogenic co2 degassing from the deep crust and or upper mantle along major zones of seismicity as well as in young orogenic belts and rifting continental areas irwin and barnes 1980 with a minimum estimation of 900 mt yr in total around the world mörner and etiope 2002 the endogenic co2 gas enters into groundwater through faults and fractured rocks and can contribute more than 30 of groundwater dissolve inorganic carbon dic in highly unique settings where co2 degassing rates are atypically high chiodini et al 2004 crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 koh et al 2017 such amount of co2 with no 14c activity will not only increase dic in groundwater but also enhance the dissolution of the 14c free carbonate this endogenic carbon has significant influence on the groundwater 14c apparent age across the united states by reducing the 14c 12c carbon 12 ratio in dic wang et al 2020 endogenic co2 degassing has also been found to occur at many locations in california with wide distributions of travertine and travertine depositing cool springs kulongoski et al 2013 mörner and etiope 2002 newell et al 2005 although jasechko s method considers several physical processes and geochemical reactions that can alter the dic amount and hence the ratio of 14c 12c it does not entirely consider the endogenic carbon mixing in dic of groundwater on the foundation of water chemistry and carbon isotope balance this study aims at 1 quantifying the contribution of endogenic carbon to dic of groundwater 2 modifying the jasechko s method with consideration of endogenic carbon input and 3 estimation of the fossil groundwater mass fraction across the entire california 2 materials and methods 2 1 date collection the isotope 13c 14c and 4he

united states geological survey s water quality portal www waterqualitydata us portal due to the small sample size lower than 500 m fig 1b this study focuses on groundwater samples greater than 500 m in depth among the selected groundwater samples there are 11 samples with 4he concentration data supplementary dataset with the typical 3he concentration value of 10 13 cm3 stp g in groundwater under the standard state 25 c 101 kpa sano and marty 1995 the 3he 4he values for the 11 samples are obtained the 3he 4he value in air is 1 39 10 6 which is taken as 1 ra sano and marty 1995 as the principal reservoir of 3he in the earth the mantle has a typical 3he 4he value of 8 ra while it is 0 025 ra in the earth s crust hoke et al 2000 the 11 groundwater samples have 3he 4he values between 0 1 ra and 7 2 ra with 6 samples of 3he 4he values larger than 1 0 ra supplementary dataset helium does not move alone from the mantle but travels with co2 kennedy et al 1997 kulongoski et al 2013 newell et al 2005 more than half 793 out of 1567 available sites of groundwater samples own co2 gas concentrations exceeding 10 mg l with 11 1 174 out of 1567 available sites of samples owning the values of co2 gas concentrations larger than 60 mg l these evidences point to significant invasion of deep source co2 into these groundwater samples crossey et al 2006 therefore for comparison analysis both methods are employed to calculate the fossil groundwater mass fraction over california in order to evaluate the influence of endogenic carbon mixture in dic on the estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction 2 2 jasechko s method with the assumption of approximately constant dic concentration over depth the mass fraction ffossil of fossil groundwater older than 12000 yr is given as eq 1 jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 1 f fossil 1 a sample a fossil a holocene a fossil asample is the measured 14c content percent modern value pmc value in a groundwater sample aholocene and afossil is the holocene and fossil 14c content pmc value the holocene and fossil 14c inputs are derived from late quaternary atmospheric 14c time series with correction for radioactive decay based on the qt factor as given by eq 2 the atmospheric 14c time series are obtained from jasechko 2016 2 a t q t a pr t e 0 693 t sample t 5730 t apr t represents 14c activity in meteoric water at time t and tsample is the time when the groundwater sample is analysed aholocene and afossil is represented by at evaluated for the time interval of 0 t sample t 12000 yr and t sample t 12000 yr respectively assuming that the carbon isotopic composition of groundwater is a binary mixture of biogenically derived sedimentary carbon c biogenical and carbonate carbon c carbonate during the water rock interaction the factor qt is calculated based on eq 3 ingerson and pearson 1964 3 q t δ 13 c sample δ 13 c carbonate δ 13 c biogenical δ 13 c carbonate δ 13 c is the 13c carbon 13 isotopic composition per mil with the international standard of pee dee belemnite pdb as shown in eq 4 4 δ 13 c c 13 c 12 c 13 c 12 standard 1 1000 where δ 13 c has a value of zero for pdb standard it can be seen from eq 3 that the qt factor is the ratio of the concentrations of biogenically derived sedimentary carbon cbiogenical to dic csample in a groundwater sample due to the complex carbon sources and water rock interactions the δ 13 cbiogenical is commonly replaced by δ 13 crecharge in eq 3 which is empirically calculated as the average of δ 13 c in groundwater samples with 14c content larger than 100 pmc jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 in this study there are 116 groundwater samples with 14c content exceeding 100 pmc based on which the δ 13 crecharge is calculated as 16 31 this is supported by the general variation of 14c content with δ13 c which is that δ13 c values increase with asample values falling in these groundwater samples fig 2 a assuming that δ 13 ccarbonate 0 a typical value for marine carbonates sharp 2007 the qt factor can be calculated for each sample with the measured value of δ 13 csample the jasechko s fossil groundwater mass fraction ffossil jasechko can be obtained based on eqs 1 and 2 2 3 modified method with consideration of endogenic carbon for jasechko s method the qt factor is obtained from δ 13 c values of two carbon end members with additional mixture of endogenic carbon the modified method includes another carbon end member of endogenic carbon source c endogenic wang et al 2020 the carbon isotope mass balance equations are as follows 5 c biogenical 12 c carbonate 12 c endogenic 12 12 c sample 6 13 c biogenical 13 c carbonate 13 c endogenic 13 c sample 12 c and 13 c mean concentrations substituting eq 4 into eq 6 will get eq 7 7 δ 13 c biogenical 1000 12 c biogenical δ 13 c carbonate 1000 12 c carbonate δ 13 c endogenic 1000 12 c endogenic δ 13 c sample 1000 12 c sample substituting eq 5 into eq 7 will get eq 8 8 δ 13 c biogenical 12 c biogenical δ 13 c carbonate 12 c carbonate δ 13 c endogenic 12 c endogenic δ 13 c sample 12 c sample as the carbon 12 natural abundance is larger than 98 93 rosman and taylor 1999 the 12c concentration is assumed to be equal to total carbon concentration i e 12 csample csample dic 12 cbiogenical cbiogenical 12 cendogenic cendogenic and 12 ccarbonate ccarbonate the 12 csample concentration can be measured as the sum of carbon dioxide co2 aq carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 in a groundwater sample in order to obtain as many samples as available the 12 csample concentration is measured as the concentration of bicarbonate for groundwater samples with carbon dioxide and or carbonate data missing as bicarbonate among the three is dominant in groundwater due to the wide spread of limestone in california dissolution of carbonate minerals are assumed to be the dominant water rock interactions and other processes are negligible such as interactions with silicates redox processes and exchanges of ions and isotopes crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 the dissolution process of carbonate minerals is as eq 9 9 c o 2 h 2 o c a x m g 1 x c o 3 x c a 2 1 x m g 2 2 h c o 3 in addition dissolution of sulfate minerals e g gypsum can also produce ca2 cas o 4 c a 2 s o 4 2 the carbon amount in moles provided by ca mg carbonate sulfate dissolution can be calculated as eq 10 crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 this assumption is supported by the overall strong correlation fig 2b between na k and cl concentrations in groundwater samples crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 10 12 c carbonate c a 2 m g 2 s o 4 2 plants of c3 type for example eriogonum fasciculatum avena fatua baccharis salicifolia and salvia apiana are dominant across california schmitt et al 1993 still et al 2003 and they have a typical δ 13 c value between 22 and 34 robinson and scrimgeour 1995 thus the average value of 28 is used for calculation δ 13 cbiogenical 28 similarly the average value of 6 5 is used for calculation δ 13 cendogenic 6 5 as it is suggested that the chilled margins of mid ocean ridge basalt own δ 13 c from 9 to 4 with an average of 6 5 javoy et al 1986 marty and jambon 1987 pineau and javoy 1983 sano and marty 1995 for eqs 5 and 8 the known variables are 12 csample and δ 13 csample measured from a groundwater sample 12 ccarbonate calculated based on eq 10 and the value of the relative carbon atomic mass of 12 δ 13 cbiogenical 28 δ 13 cendogenic 6 5 and δ 13 ccarbonate 0 as mentioned above therefore combining eqs 5 and 8 the qt factor cbiogenical csample 12 cbiogenical 12 csample and the ratio of the concentrations of endogenic carbon to dic cendogenic dic 12 cendogenic 12 csample can be obtained for each groundwater sample with the 12 cendogenic and 12 cbiogenical eliminated respectively subsequently the modified fossil groundwater mass fraction ffossil modified can be obtained with qt factor substituted into eqs 1 and 2 for comparison analysis the mass fraction difference mfd of fossil groundwater between jasechko s and modified methods is calculated as eq 11 11 mfd f f o s s i l j a s e c h k o f f o s s i l m o d i f i e d 3 results the ratio of the concentrations of endogenic carbon to dic c endogenic dic ratio has a mean value of about 23 4 supplementary dataset about 19 4 305 out of 1574 available sites of groundwater samples have c endogenic dic ratio larger than 50 supplementary dataset the c endogenic dic ratio of the selected groundwater samples increases with depth increasing fig 3 a the fossil groundwater mass fraction ffossil modified calculated by the modified method is obviously smaller than that ffossil jasechko calculated by the jasechko s method in approximately 8 4 132 out of 1574 available sites of groundwater samples fig 3b and supplementary dataset this value has a range between 1 4 22 out of 1574 available sites and 68 0 1070 out of 1574 available sites with consideration of the full time series of precipitation 14c variations throughout the quaternary supplementary dataset the mass fraction difference mfd of fossil groundwater between the two methods has a mean value of approximately 3 1 within the range from 1 2 to 9 8 supplementary dataset groundwater samples with high c endogenic dic ratio are mainly located in the mojave desert fig 4 a where main active faults are widely distributed wesnousky 1986 meanwhile groundwater samples with large values of mfd have a similar spatial distribution with those of high c endogenic dic ratio fig 4b averagely the ffossil jasechko and ffossil modified is about 72 5 70 3 76 7 and 69 4 67 0 71 5 respectively supplementary dataset they are both distributed widely across california in the spatial scale fig 4c and d in terms of depth distribution both the ffossil jasechko and ffossil modified increase with depth increasing fig 5 a and b the mfd firstly rises with depth increasing and then declines with the maximum value of about 6 6 at 250 300 m in depth fig 5c taking the full time series of precipitation 14c variations throughout the quaternary into consideration the distributions of the minimum and maximum values of both ffossil jasechko and ffossil modified with depth are also given in fig 5 as well as the mfd generally the fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by both methods increase with depth increasing while the mfd shows a rising trend with depth increasing before a decline with the maximum value at about 250 300 m in depth 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis there are several chemical and physical processes that will influence the 14c 12c ratio in groundwater sample and thus cause uncertainties when applying the modified method to calculate the fossil groundwater mass fraction firstly it is assumed that ca and mg in groundwater predominantly result from water rock interactions with carbonate and sulfate and it is second order importance of water rock interactions with silicates moreover it is negligible of the isotope exchange processes of dic with carbonates and co2 gases as well as the processes of ion exchange and redox during water rock interactions these may potentially result in non unique solutions there are other processes impacting the 14c 12c ratio in groundwater such as bacterial sulfate reduction and or methanogenesis aravena et al 1995 as dissolved methane is obviously detected in groundwater in the los angeles basin kulongoski et al 2018 kulongoski and mcmahon 2019 additionally some physical processes for example mixture of old and young groundwater during pumping from the wells and water leakage and or exchange between different aquifers can also alter the 14c 12c ratio underwood et al 2018 except for geochemical reactions and physical processes mentioned above the variation of employed parameters can also cause some uncertainties in calculating fossil groundwater mass fraction for both methods it is assumed that δ 13 ccarbonate 0 in addition it is assumed that δ 13 cendogenic 6 5 and δ 13 cbiogenical 28 for the modified method the δ 13 cendogenic has a range between 9 and 4 javoy et al 1986 marty and jambon 1987 pineau and javoy 1983 sano and marty 1995 and δ 13 cbiogenical in c3 plants generally varies from 34 to 22 robinson and scrimgeour 1995 for uncertainty analysis both δ 13 cendogenic and δ 13 cbiogenical are randomly generated 300 values following a normal distribution in the range of 6 5 0 8 mean value standard deviation for δ 13 cendogenic fig 6 a and 28 2 mean value standard deviation for δ 13 cbiogenical fig 6b respectively and then these 90 000 values are used to calculate the modified fossil groundwater mass fraction for the 1574 available groundwater samples on average the calculated modified fossil groundwater mass fraction is about 69 1 1 3 mean value standard deviation fig 6c implying that the average uncertainty of the fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by the modified method is approximately 1 3 larger than that of the jasechko s method 4 2 implications although it is less useful in quantifying the groundwater residence time and renewal rate fossil groundwater mass fraction is an important parameter for groundwater resource estimation with consideration of endogenic carbon mixing in groundwater the c endogenic dic ratio is quantified and the jasechko s method is modified both methods are applied to estimate the fossil groundwater mass fraction in california averagely endogenic carbon accounts for 23 4 of the dic in all groundwater samples and for more than half of the dic in 19 4 of groundwater samples across california this demonstrates the obvious mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater over california this endogenic carbon mixing in dic of groundwater results in smaller fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by the modified than jasechko s method in 8 4 of groundwater samples the average decease of fossil groundwater mass fraction is 3 1 by the modified than jasechko s method this indicates that the mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater has little influence on the estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction across the entire california however the modified method is more objective than jasechko s method in determining the factor qt as the former is a process based analysis on the foundation of mass balance while the latter is based on the empirical δ 13 crecharge groundwater samples with both high c endogenic dic ratio and mfd are mainly located in the mojave desert with wide distribution of main active faults this means more obvious mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater over the mojave desert with atypically high co2 degassing rates this is coincident with the process that endogenic co2 gas prefers to enter into groundwater through faults and fractured rocks chiodini et al 2004 crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 koh et al 2017 and dilutes the 14c 12c ratio thus making the groundwater old bias wang et al 2020 the values of c endogenic dic ratio show a rising trend with depth increasing which is consistent with the fact that deeper groundwater is more likely to be invaded by deeply derived endogenic carbon chiodini et al 2004 crossey et al 2009 karlstrom et al 2013 koh et al 2017 averagely the fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by jasechko s and modified methods are both 70 without and with consideration of endogenic carbon mixture and they are distributed widely in the spatial scale indicating the dominance of fossil groundwater above 500 m in depth across the entire california jasechko et al 2017 with consideration of the full time series of precipitation 14c variations throughout the quaternary the mass fraction of fossil groundwater calculated by both methods rise with depth increasing coincidence with previous findings manning et al 2015 vengosh et al 2002 visser et al 2016 and common knowledge jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 the mfd shows a rising trend with depth increasing before a decline with the maximum value at about 250 300 m in depth these results provide valuable information for groundwater resources estimation and evaluation and thus are helpful for better understanding the groundwater resources in california 5 conclusions the jasechko s method for estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction does not entirely account for the endogenic carbon source on the basis of carbon isotopes and water chemistry balance the c endogenic dic ratio in groundwater samples is quantified and the jasechko s method is modified accounting for endogenic carbon input both jasechko s and modified methods are applied for estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction above 500 m in depth across the entire california where endogenic co2 degassing is found at many locations the conclusions are as follows 1 averagely endogenic carbon accounts for 23 4 of the dic in groundwater samples across california and 19 4 of groundwater samples owns c endogenic dic ratio exceeding 50 groundwater samples with high c endogenic dic ratio are mainly located in the mojave desert this indicates an obvious mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater in california especially over the mojave desert with atypically high co2 degassing rates 2 there are 8 4 of groundwater samples show smaller modified than jasechko s fossil groundwater mass fraction with the average value of fossil groundwater mass fraction decrease by 3 1 although the mixture of endogenic carbon in dic of groundwater has little influence on the estimation of fossil groundwater mass fraction across california the process based modified method is more objective than the empirically jasechko s method in determining the factor qt 3 similar to the distribution of groundwater samples with high c endogenic dic ratio groundwater samples with high mfd are mainly located in the mojave desert with wide distribution of main active faults on average the fossil groundwater mass fraction calculated by both methods are 70 and they are distributed widely this indicates the dominance of fossil groundwater above 500 m in depth across the entire

4789,evapotranspiration et is one of the most important variables in terrestrial ecosystems linking the carbon water energy cycles in this study we first analyze the spatial patterns of annual et changes during 1980 2010 across china using four et products i the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 0a gleamv3 0 ii the earth2observe ensemble earth2observe en iii the global land data assimilation system version 2 0 with noah model gldas2 0 noah and iv the modern era retrospective analysis for research and application land merra land the results show that the spatial distribution of annual mean et values and long term changes derived from these four et products are similar overall large scale increases in et are observed in southeastern china while decreases in et over the northeast furthermore we apply a newly developed separation method with the budyko framework to quantify the individual contribution of five climatic factors to et changes including precipitation p net radiation rn air temperature t vapour pressure deficit vpd and wind speed u it is found that the dynamics of p rn and vpd are all strongly correlated with et suggesting that they are the major climatic factors influencing et changes specifically precipitation is the dominant factor for et in water limited regions while et changes in energy limited regions are dominated by vpd according to all et products except the earth2observe en in which rn and vpd have comparable performance our study highlights the importance of vpd in et changes across energy limited regions of china and suggests that the role of vpd in land surface atmosphere interactions should be considered in future studies keywords multi source et products et changes attributed method vpd 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an essential component in regional and global hydrological processes zhang et al 2016a which links the water energy and carbon cycles and thus plays a key role in the land atmosphere interactions koster et al 2006 wang et al 2011 miralles et al 2018 it has widespread applications in disaster monitoring of hydrology e g floods and droughts agricultural productivity and water availability for human purposes duethmann and blöschl 2018 sheffield et al 2012 sun et al 2017 ground measurements are often used to obtain actual et e g eddy covariance porometry and lysimeters and scintillometry allen et al 1991 everson et al 2009 monteith and unsworth 1990 but these methods have inherent limitations due to the sparse distribution of the observation sites and the short time spans of observation recently a number of long term et products were developed using remote sensing land surface models and data assimilation which can overcome the limitations of ground measurements su 2002 miralles et al 2011ab mu et al 2011 onogi et al 2007 dee et al 2011 reichle et al 2017 bosilovich et al 2017 haddeland et al 2011 schellekens et al 2017 jung et al 2009 the quality of those et products is notably influenced by the differences of model algorithms and parameterizations as well as the forcing data used some researchers have attempted to demonstrate how the estimated et responds to these differences by running different models with the same forcing data or running a common model with different forcing data vinukollu et al 2011 badgley et al 2015 miralles et al 2016 michel et al 2016 for example to understand the impact of model algorithms on et estimates miralles et al 2016 run three et models with different algorithms using the same forcing data and found that the gleam the global land evaporation amsterdam model product has relatively better performance in most land cover types and climate regimes of the world badgley et al 2015 run the priestly taylor jet propulsion laboratory model using 19 different combinations of forcings finding that different forcings may cause an average error of 20 of the global et and the net radiation makes the largest difference besides the results from those global et products have indicated significant et changes exist in many regions of the world as warming climate may intensify the global water cycle huntington 2006 wentz et al 2007 in recent years many studies have tried to explain the et change in response to a warming climate zeng cai 2016 rigden and salvucci 2016 wang et al 2011 martens et al 2018 miralles et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 zeng cai 2016 applied a variance decomposition method to study the et changes at different time scales over 32 large river basins in the world and found that precipitation potential et and terrestrial water storage played different roles rigden and salvucci 2016 estimated daily et based on historical meteorological datasets from 236 weather stations over us and attributed the decline of et mostly to a decrease in surface conductance based on the factorial experiments zhang et al 2015 have assessed the contributions of water supply available energy and atmospheric water demand to the global et trends and these factors are found to account for 49 32 and 19 of the et variance respectively it is also expected that some climatic modes such as the el niño southern oscillation and north atlantic oscillation affect in the et variability over global in a teleconnection pattern martens et al 2018 used 16 climate indices to study the teleconnections of et changes indicating that these remote climatic modes can explain up to 40 of the et trends in some hotspot regions of the world miralles et al 2013 found that during el niño the et declines in southern africa eastern south america as well as eastern and central australia as limited terrestrial moisture supply may lead to increasing vegetation water stress there are two major gaps in the existing studies first many studies focused on et dynamic only considering one model algorithms forced with a certain forcing data but few has been done considering both uncertainties of model algorithms and forcing data second generally the used methods for studying responses of et to climatic factors are statistical tools like correlation coefficient and regression model the correlation values can t reflect certain factor is causal to et and the regression assumes there are linear relations between et and climatic factors while the relation is nonlinear hagan et al 2019 there are few studies focusing on how climate affects long term trends of et over china in the recent decades in this paper we use four et products to attribute their long term trends which have been validated using eddy covariance measurements showing relatively good performances li et al 2018 as the budyko framework links water balance component i e runoff et and precipitation to climatic conditions it has been widely used in investigating the interactions between hydrological processes and climate variability yokoo et al 2008 yang et al 2009 liu et al 2011 nevertheless limited studies focus on how climate factors influencing et zeng cai 2016 the objective of this study is two fold firstly we build the linkage among et precipitation and potential et based on budyko theory secondly contribution of each climate factor to the long term et trends is quantified by a separation method 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china is located in the east asia with a territory of more than 9 6 million square kilometers its topography is characterized by a three trapezoidal distribution with highest mountains in the west and lowest plains in the east the annual precipitation over china varies from 50 mm in the arid northwest to 2000 mm in the humid southeast the climate is dominated by changes in winter and summer monsoons which are significantly influenced by enso ding et al 2014a in summer warm and humid south wind blows however in winter mainly cold and dry northerly wind prevails ge et al 2017 according to the köppen climate classification kottek et al 2006 china can be divided into six climatic zones including arid bb semi arid sa qinghai tibet plateau qtp cold semi humid dw temperate semi humid cw and temperate humid cf fig 1 2 2 et products in this study four long term et products are used including 1 the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 0a hereafter referred to as gleam3 0a 2 the earth2observe ensemble earth2observe en 3 the global land data assimilation system version 2 0 with noah model gldas noah and 4 the modern era retrospective analysis for research and application land merra land 2 2 1 gleam et gleam is a remote sensing based product comprising several algorithms forced by a lot of satellite observations and reanalysis data sets the basic concept is to maximize the recovery of information on et which is contained in current satellite observations of climate and environment martens et al 2017 within each grid cell it separately estimates three main sources of et i e soil evaporation transpiration and interception for bare soil short and tall vegetation the gash analytical model forced with precipitation data is used to calculate interception losses meanwhile the remaining components are obtained by potential evapotranspiration priestley taylor equation which is constrained by a multiplicative stress factor miralles et al 2011b martens et al 2017 the new generation daily et product gleam version 3 0a has been produced with temporal span of 1980 2014 and spatial scale at 0 25 when simulating gleam3 0a martens et al 2017 used multi source weighted ensemble precipitation e g mswep v1 0 surface incident shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature from era interim as main forcings see table 1 at the same time other auxiliary data sets were used in the estimated process such as snow water equivalent vegetation optical depth and soil moisture 2 2 2 earth2observe ensemble et to develop a global water resources reanalysis product the earth2observe project decided to use several models forced with state of the art meteorological reanalysis datasets the models contain five hydrological models four land surface models lsms and a simple water balance model the detailed information of these models have been provided by dutra et al 2015 or their respective model introduction papers by using these models some of the errors and uncertainties introduced in individual models would be mitigated gosling et al 2010 moreover schellekens et al 2017 have confirmed that the output result of the ensemble mean outperformed individual model s performance and thus we selected the ten model arithmetic mean i e ensemble mean and named earth2observe en in this paper the monthly simulation outputs for the period 1979 2012 have a spatial resolution with one half degree those models run offline and are forced by the watch water and global change fp7 project forcing dataset era interim i e wfdei weedon et al 2015 and based on the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 wfdei are adjusted with several bias corrections using gridded observations and the climatic research unit dataset the forcing data sets mainly contain precipitation surface incident shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m near the surface wind speed at 10 m and pressure at the surface 2 2 3 gldas2 0 noah et based on the north american land data assimilation system nldas the global land data assimilation system gldas is developed by national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc from america gldas has produced fields of land surface states and fluxes e g soil moisture latent and sensible heat flux by running offline lsms together with data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 recently gldas coupled with the noah lsm released two versions i e gldas 2 0 with the period of 1948 to 2010 and gldas 2 1 with temporal span of 2000 present considering the starting year of others et products is 1980 thus we select the gldas 2 0 with 0 25 0 25 and monthly temporal coverage the gldas 2 0 is forced by the three hour meteorological forcing dataset from princeton university i e pumfd sheffield et al 2006 the variables in pumfd are the same as wfdei of earth2observe en at the same time the simulation use land surface parameters from modis based products e g land water mask mod44w the noah model static land cover modified igbp modis 20 category vegetation 2 2 4 merra land et the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra is produced by global modeling and assimilation office gmao in nasa it is a state of the art reanalysis data providing long term land surface hydrology products e g soil moisture latent and sensible heat fluxes along with atmospheric fields rienecker et al 2011 as described by reichle et al 2011 the data set with only land component of the system i e merra land has better performance in the surface hydrology study when compared to original merra estimates the monthly merra land with the period of 1980 present is used in the work the spatial resolution is 0 5 latitude by 0 67 in longitude except precipitation the forcing data sets of merra land were merra version 1 0 outputs mainly including surface incident shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature specific humidity and wind speed at 2 m near the surface as for precipitation merra land used cpc u climate prediction center unified which was processed by the precipitation correction algorithm reichle et al 2011 2 3 climate data five climatic variables i e precipitation net radiation air temperature specific humidity and wind speed are used in the attribution analysis in which their individual contribution to et changes is quantified et in each product is partly determined by their forcing data to minimize the uncertainties associated with different forcing datasets the attribution analysis is conducted between the et products and their own forcing data see table 1 for example the wfdei forcing datasets are used in the attribution analysis of the earth2observe en et product unlike the other three et products gleam3 0a does not use specific humidity and wind speed in their calculations considering that gleam3 0a uses radiation and air temperature from era interim we use the specific humidity and wind speed also from era interim in this study to keep the consistency of data source 2 4 data pre processing in this study all et products are first aggregated into annual average for each grid cell as for the spatial resolution merra land et and associated forcing datasets are resampled from 0 5 0 67 to 0 5 0 5 by interpolation we keep the original spatial resolution of the other three et products and their forcings i e 0 25 for gleam3 0a and gldas noah and 0 5 for earth2observe en all analysis is conducted in the period 1980 2010 which is the overlapping period of all four et products 3 method 3 1 trends in et and climatic variables we first examine the spatial distribution of annual mean et trends in annual et and trends in climatic variables during the period 1980 2010 in this study long term trends are derived using the non parametric theil sen s slope method which can provide more accurate estimation for skewed data than the linear regression approach wilcox 2010 it has been widely employed to estimate the trend in meteorology and hydrology variables su et al 2015 wang et al 2018b meanwhile the non parametric mann kendall method mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to determine the significance level of the derived trends in et and climatic variables the mann kendall test has been widely used for determining the significance of long term trends shan et al 2015 shi et al 2016 3 2 attribution of et trends the attribution method to quantify the individual contribution of different climatic variables to the trends in et consists of two steps first we establish a quantitative relationship between et and the five climatic variables abovementioned using budyko and modified penman monteith equations second based on the established relationship we conduct sensitivity analysis to determine the individual contribution of these five climatic variables to et changes during 1980 2010 accordingly the climatic factor dominating the long term et trends is identified for each grid cell below is the detailed description of this attribution method 3 2 1 establishing relationship between et and climatic variables we first build the linkage among actual et precipitation and potential et using the budyko equation eq 1 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 2019 teuling et al 2019 1 et p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω where et is annual actual evapotranspiration p is annual actual precipitation pet is annual potential evapotranspiration and ω denotes a parameter reflecting landscape characteristics e g vegetation cover soil properties and topography within one catchment here we use the modified fao penman monteith equation eq 2 to estimate pet allen et al 1998 2 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u where pet is the potential evapotranspiration mm yr rn mj m2 yr is the difference between net incoming shortwave and net outgoing longwave radiation g mj m2 yr is the soil heat flux density γ kpa and δ kpa are the psychometric constant and slope of vapor pressure curve respectively tem is the mean daily air temperature at 2 meter u indicates m s is the wind speed at 2 meter vpd means vapour pressure deficit i e es ea ea kpa is the actual vapour pressure es kpa is the saturation vapour pressure detailed information of δ rn γ t u and vpd can be referred to allen et al 1998 by combining eqs 1 and 2 we can obtain eq 3 which links et and the five climatic variables abovementioned 3 et p 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u p 1 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u v p d p δ γ 1 0 34 u ω 1 ω the fitting of this equation is conducted on a pixel by pixel basis between et products left hand side of equ 3 and associated forcing data right hand side of equ 3 this is done for each of four et products separately accordingly we can obtain a time series of annual et estimate during 1980 2010 based on the climatic variables and fitted eq 3 hereafter referred to as equation derived et estimate we then compare the long term trends in equation derived et estimates and et products during 1980 2010 for each grid cell over china to examine their spatiotemporal agreement 3 2 2 quantifying individual contribution of climatic variables to trends in et based on fitted eq 3 we first run one control experiment exper ctl using the actual values of climatic variables from 1980 through 2010 and obtain the exper ctl et which is essentially the same as equation derived et estimate mentioned above then we run five sensitivity experiments one for each climatic variable which are referred to as exper p exper rn exper t exper vpd and exper u respectively in each sensitivity experiment the climatic variable under test is kept constant at its value in the year 1980 while everything else is the same as the control experiment again this is done on a pixel by pixel basis for each of four et products separately basically the difference in et trends between control experiment and each sensitivity experiment is considered as the contribution of that particular climatic variable to et trends here we use the separation method recently developed by sun et al 2016 and sun et al 2017 which can minimize the errors caused by interactions of climatic variables 4 k i n c k e e x p e r i where k i n c k is the total contribution to the trend in exper ctl et from all climatic variables except for the ith factor n denotes the number of sensitivity experiments n 5 in this study and eexper i represents the et trend in each experiment respectively by solving the above equation we can obtain the contribution of each driving factor to the respective et trend in each experiment using the equation 5 c i k i n e e x p e r k n 2 e e x p e r i n 1 4 results 4 1 trends in et and climatic variables 4 1 1 trends in et all four et products show a similar spatial pattern of the time series of annual et during 1980 2010 over china fig 2 with a distinct decreasing gradient from the humid southeast china to the arid northwest china but apparent differences in the absolute values are observed among these four et products particularly over the temperate humid cf region in the southeast over the cf region the merra land product has the highest annual et greater than 900 mm yr fig 2d while the earth2observe en has the lowest 600 to 750 mm yr fig 2b in terms of the spatial distribution of long term trends in annual et during 1980 2010 there are apparent differences and similarities among these four products fig 3 strong upward trends amounting to 2 4 mm yr are found over the temperate semi humid and humid regions in the gleam3 0a fig 3a the gldas2 0 noah fig 3c and the merra land fig 3d products however such upward trend is rarely observed in the earth2observe en product fig 3b moderate increases in annual et are generally found over the western part of china including the qinghai tibet plateau the arid region and a small part of the cold semi humid regions in all four et products in addition all products show moderate decreases in et during 1980 2010 over the northeast 4 1 2 trends in climatic variables although the climatic variables used to drive these four et products are from different data sources the spatial distribution of their long term trends during 1980 2010 is generally in agreement with the strongest discrepancy observed in radiation fig 4 while increases in precipitation are commonly observed over most of western china in four precipitation products fig 4 a1 a4 there are apparent differences over the eastern part of china the precipitation product used for gleam3 0 shows generally decreasing trends but merra land shows increasing trends over most of the east part when it comes to the long term trends in radiation the discrepancies are so strong that no common regional trend can be found among these four products in any of six climatic zones fig 4 b1 b4 the radiation product used for earth2observe en shows strong decreases over the entire eastern part of china and increases over most of the west the opposite is observed in gldas2 0 noah gleam3 0a and merra land are both characterized by increases in radiation over the temperate humid region in the southeast fig 4 c1 c4 illustrate the spatial distribution of long term temperature changes despite slightly differences in the absolute values all four products show overwhelmingly increasing trends over china with most regions passing the significance test p 0 05 similar patterns are also observed in the long term trends in vpd fig 4 d1 d4 as for wind speed gleam3 0a and earth2observe en have the same change as they both use the era interim wind speed product fig 4 e1 and e2 these three wind speed products show strong differences in long term changes except over the northeast part of china 4 2 attributions of et trends 4 2 1 establishing relationship between et and climatic variables using fitted eq 3 and five climatic variables from different data sources we obtain the equation derived et estimates for each grid cell over china during 1980 2010 fig 5 compares the long term trends in four et products and equation derived et estimates on a pixel by pixel basis the high r2 values between 0 5 and 0 85 suggest that the spatio temporal characteristics of equation derived et estimates reasonably agree with et products and give us some confidence in using the equation derived et estimates to quantify the individual contribution of climatic variables to long term et changes 4 2 2 quantifying individual contribution of climatic variables to trends in et spatial distribution of the contribution of each climatic variable to long term et changes during 1980 2010 is shown in fig 6 which is closely related to the long term trends in these climatic variables fig 4 to better illustrate their relationship we make scatterplots between trends in climatic variables and their contributions to et trends stratified by climatic zones fig 7 fig 7 shows that precipitation and vpd have a significant contribution to et in terms of magnitudes while the contribution of temperature is not clearly highlighted in the contribution of t it is nonetheless found to contribute when expressed as a relation to relative humidity vpd wind speed on the other hand is here found to be limited in its contribution to et for precipitation more than 86 grid cells fall in the first and third quadrants fig 7a which means increasing precipitation mostly makes positive contribution to et changes while decreases in et are associated with decreasing precipitation this pattern is also observed in radiation fig 7b vpd fig 7d and wind speed fig 7e the exception is detected in the air temperature fig 7c a large number of grid cells from the water limited northern part of china occupying 24 08 to 52 08 of the territory fall in the fourth quadrant which suggests that increasing air temperature is associated with decreases in et fig 4c and 6c from the perspective of major climatic factor driving et changes in each climatic zone figs 7 and 8 precipitation is clearly the dominant factor over the arid semi arid and qinghai tibet plateau regions vpd becomes more important over the cold and temperate semi humid regions over the humid region in the southeast vpd plays the most important role according to gleam3 0a gldas2 0 noah and merra land while radiation and vpd are equally important according to earth2observe en 5 discussion 5 1 validation of et products li et al 2018 indicated these four et products have relatively good performances over china basing on 12 eddy covariance sites across multiple land cover types but the confidence level of validation results in grid scale is limited due to just a few sites and mismatched spatial scale on the catchment scale wang et al 2018a validated these products with a water balance method in the yellow river basin of china and their results indicated the et products were of high accuracy we have further evaluated the performances of these products in yangtze river with the water balance method the selected hydrological stationss and their contribution subbasins refer to table s1 and fig s1 respectively we calculate multiyear average et etw of 1980 2000 by precipitation minus runoff assuming no change in the terrestrial water storage during the period the scatter comparison results in each subbasin between each product and etw are illustrated in fig s2 a d suggesting good performances of these products 5 2 results comparison multi source et products i e gleam3 0a earth2observe en gldas2 0 noah and merra land indicate most regions of china have consistent results in et changes during 1980 2010 for example middle part of qinghai tibet plateau qtp for all products found et values significantly increase while significant increases of et are found in the east of cold semi humid dw region meanwhile there are opposite conclusions for example gleam3 0a gldas2 0 noah and merra land show et significantly increase in most temperate humid cf and temperate semi humid cw regions while downward trend is found in west cf region and middle cw region for earth2observe en the differences in et changes closely depend on diversities of forcing data sets the abnormal decreasing rn in earth2observe en over west cf region and middle cw fig 4 results in negative contribution to et changes fig 6 when compared to the others product the results directly limit et increase or even lead to et decrease over these regions for explaining the responses of et changes to climatic factors p rn t vpd and u we have designed an attributed method by using respective forcing data of each model based on scatterplots results of fig 7 we can conclude that there are existing positive relationships between et and p rn vpd and u over different climate regions over china the positive feedbacks of et to p and rn have been verified in several zones with typical climate characteristics e g yangtze river basin by lu et al 2019 yellow river basin by wang et al 2018a and east part of inner mongolia li et al 2016 as for t totally opposite feedback results on et are in different regions that rising t in energy limited regions i e cf west of cw qtp and east of dw leads to increased et but it hinders et process over water supply regions i e arid bb semi arid sa and west of dw jung et al 2010 and zhang et al 2019 have explained why there is a negative correlation between t and et of water limited regions due to plants in here being a self protection state resulting in stomatal closure of leaf the results of positive contribution of vpd are confirmed in many studies across different climate regions hogg and hurdle 1997 admiral et al 2006 sottocornola and kiely 2010 kochendorfer et al 2011 yang et al 2019 wang and dickinson 2012 high vpd values act like a water pump in air which absorb water from land surface soil and vegetation it increases water loss from bare soil dai 2013 however vpd s effect on vegetation is very complex high vpd triggers a self projection mechanism in plants so that their stomata would be closed to reduce water loss running 1976 interestingly the closure in pores of plant does not limit transpiration rate but increases transpiration franks et al 1997 moreover vpd has been becoming a major determinant of controlling global water resources and water relations in plant grossiord et al 2020 numerous studies often ignore vpd s effect on vegetation or replace it with high temperature lindner et al 2010 way oren 2010 grossiord et al 2020 explored independent physiological influences in high vpd on vegetation dynamics they used nine stomatal models to study how vpd affects transpiration and found high vpd leads to decreasing stomatal conductance but increases transpiration for multiple land covers under a given vpd threshold vpd is the function of air temperature and relative humidity decreasing results in relative humidity during past decades are also observed over china ding and liu 2014b rising air temperature fig 4c 1 4 and decreasing relative humidity both contribute to increasing vpd over china there is a closely relationship between t and vpd in the sensitivity experiment of the study when t alone is prescribed exper t its contribution is not fully realized however when t is prescribed as it relates to relative humidity in vpd exper vpd its contribution becomes more emphasized t is important but just itself the contribution to et in this region is not clearly seen however when it is expressed with as it relates to changes in relative humidity vpd its contribution is clearly highlighted moreover we found that although rising air temperature definitely results in increasing vpd contribution in vpd doesn t increase correspondingly fig 9 the threshold is 15 in annual average for all products except merra land when air temperature is more than 15 vpd contribution evidently increases when air temperature is less than 15 rising temperature does not result in increasing contribution in vpd fig 8 shows that pixel wise distributions of climatic factor dominating et changes for all products p is the primary factor for controlling et over water limited regions while rn and vpd are responsible for et changes over energy limited regions the results in dominating et are consistent with budyko theory budyko 1974 related energy factors mainly include t vpd and rn but few studies can decompose et changes into the contributions by t vpd and rn for example zhang et al 2020 pointed to relative contribution of air temperature to annual et changes during 1982 2016 is more than 50 over 110 humid catchments of china for both numerical experiment and sensitivity method while rn only accounts for about 10 they just pay more attentions to how t and rn influence et changes but ignoring vpd as a vital factor of controlling transpiration yang et al 2019 reported vpd over limited energy regions was about twice as much as rn accounting for the percentages of et future changes using several earth system models output in this study we identify vpd as one of energy factors is playing an increasingly important role in controlling et changes 5 3 uncertainties to validate the accuracy of budyko theory applied in here we compare pixel wise et values in each product with estimated et values with budyko theory using pet and p as input fig s3 a d the high r2 vaules between 0 86 and 0 94 indicate the all products conform to the budyko theory we have also assessed uncertainties of the attributed method driven by forcing data of each model in section 4 2 1 the validation results show equation derived et estimates can reproduce spatio temporal characteristics of all products to quantify the possible uncertainties from the choice of pet estimation methods we have made comparisons of the et estimations and their attributions using the penman monteith and the penman equations firstly we compare the pet values by the fao penman monteith equation in here with the penman method and the results in fig s4 show very small et differences between them furthermore we have made the same analysis with pet calculated by penman method to attribute the et changes to climatic factors following the designed sensitivity experiments in this study and the derived results are shown in fig s5 comparing fig s5 and fig 8 we can find that the choice of penman monteith or penman equation has little impact on the final results the parameter ω at the grid scale is fitted with yearly precipitation et and calculated pet during 1980 2010 in each product it is a constant value in each grid besides the fitted parameter ω of each model can incorporate unique characteristic information of that model into the attributed method xu et al 2013 the information mainly includes each model s auxiliary input data e g land cover types soil properties and topography and structure parameters e g potential et scheme numerous studies has confirmed that these surface parameters e g vegetation greening have evident impacts on hydrological components e g river flow runoff et and water level gashaw et al 2018 xi et al 2018 piao et al 2015 forzieri et al 2020 meanwhile anthropogenic perturbations such as co2 concentrations human activities to et changes should not been ignored yang et al 2019 ainsworth and rogers 2007 feng et al 2013 lv et al 2017 5 3 1 the influences of vegetation and co2 numerous studies have reported the greening of the earth in the recent decades zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2019a and the vegetation biophysical feedbacks would affect global energy flux partitions forzieri et al 2020 zeng et al 2017 global vegetation transpiration accounts for about 60 of the total terrestrial et lian et al 2018 it is also confirmed vegetation is the primary driver of spatial variations of ratio of transpiration to the total terrestrial et suggesting that vegetation greening may increase this ratio however soil evaporation would be reduced due to global vegetation greening partly hindering et increase zhang et al 2016b in the humid regions of china zhang et al 2020 has indicated that vegetation greening actually changes the proportions of et components i e result in 59 0 62 0 increase of the ratio but vegetation greening hasn t synchronously increased the total et mo et al 2018 simulated the spatiotemporal variations of et over china with a process based vegetation interface processes model indicating that the et variability at annual scales is principally determined by precipitation similarly zhang et al 2020 used numerical experiment approach and sensitivity method to quantify the contributions of climate variables and vegetation greening to the et changes during 1982 2016 in 110 humid catchments of china and found that the climate variables has accounted for more than 90 of the et changes as for the water limited regions a number of studies have also confirmed that precipitation controls the interannual et changes at long time scale over loess plateau and haihe river basin ning et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 he et al 2019 wang et al 2021 anyway although there are studies suggesting significant vegetation impact on the terrestrial et the vegetation variations of interest are believed to have already contained the signal of precipitation variations which is essence for vegetation growth furthermore the four et datasets in our study are produced without considering the vegetation impact using appropriate algorithms and model parameterizations therefore this study focuses only on climatic factors affecting interannual et changes and does not consider the vegetation impacts which are not imbedded in the production algorithms the influences of co2 on et over china during 1980 2010 are limited even though it increases stomatal resistance we used an idealized reference crop surface vegetation height is 0 12 m surface albedo is 0 25 as an example pet considering co2 is called petco2 in which rising co2 would increase surface resistance and reduce pet yang et al 2019 the yearly ratio i e pet petco2 pet over china is showed in fig s6 the results indicate that the ratio in most years of the period is below 0 01 for different pet forced by forcing data in each product 5 3 2 human activities human activities have been playing an important role in affecting hydrological components such as et run off and groundwater feng et al 2013 2018 khandelwal et al 2017 pekel et al 2016 ashraf et al 2017 chen et al 2019b for example north china has been becoming one of the global largest irrigation regions and resulted in groundwater level dropping by an average rate of 2 0 cm per year during 2003 2010 to agriculture crop irrigation feng et al 2013 furthermore lv et al 2017 reconstructed et values over the yellow river basin and yangtze river basin by considering the irrigation water into the gldas 1 land surface models and found this result was improved with little absolute relative errors 1 9 validated by the reference et by water balance method however these selected et products except earth2observe en do not consider anthropogenic effects on et changes assuming climate change is totally responsible for et changes as for earth2observe en six models at least consider one of groundwater reservoir and water use see table s2 but we found earth2observe en with the highest r2 values from fig 5 and fig s3 when compared to the others products suggesting influences of climate change can account for most et changes in earth2observe en nonetheless the effect of human activities i e irrigation and reservoir construction on et changes over china shouldn t been ignored due to the limits of remote sensing products land surface models and reanalysis products in quantifying human activities it is very necessary to couple with some hydrological models to more accurately evaluate et changes in the future 6 conclusions in this manuscript we first investigated et trends across china using four different et products i e gleamv3 0 earth2observe en gldas2 0 noah and merra land then examined the respective impacts of five climatic factors precipitation radiation temperature vpd and wind speed on et changes over china by a newly developed attribution method with budyko framework and accordingly identified the dominant factors controlling et changes for each grid cell over china our major findings are summarized below a et trends the strongest increase in et is generally observed over the temperate humid and semi humid regions in the southeast china while the strongest decrease over the cold semi humid region in the northeast in addition moderate increases in et in the western part of china are detected in all four et products b contributions of climatic factors increasing precipitation radiation temperature vpd and wind speed make positive contributions to et changes except for temperature over the arid region in the northwest where temperature increases but it makes negative contribution to et changes that is if everything else is kept the same increasing temperature is corresponding with decreasing et there the magnitudes in et changes are more sensitive to changes in precipitation radiation and vpd the influence of temperature and wind speed on et changes is much weaker c dominant factors precipitation is the major factor controlling et changes over the entire water limited regions i e arid semi arid and qinghai tibet plateau and a large part of the cold and temperate semi humid regions over the humid and a small part of semi humid regions vpd is the dominating factor according to gleamv3 0 gldas noah and merra land while radiation and vpd have comparable contributions based on earth2observe en credit authorship contribution statement shijie li conceptualization methodology

4789,evapotranspiration et is one of the most important variables in terrestrial ecosystems linking the carbon water energy cycles in this study we first analyze the spatial patterns of annual et changes during 1980 2010 across china using four et products i the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 0a gleamv3 0 ii the earth2observe ensemble earth2observe en iii the global land data assimilation system version 2 0 with noah model gldas2 0 noah and iv the modern era retrospective analysis for research and application land merra land the results show that the spatial distribution of annual mean et values and long term changes derived from these four et products are similar overall large scale increases in et are observed in southeastern china while decreases in et over the northeast furthermore we apply a newly developed separation method with the budyko framework to quantify the individual contribution of five climatic factors to et changes including precipitation p net radiation rn air temperature t vapour pressure deficit vpd and wind speed u it is found that the dynamics of p rn and vpd are all strongly correlated with et suggesting that they are the major climatic factors influencing et changes specifically precipitation is the dominant factor for et in water limited regions while et changes in energy limited regions are dominated by vpd according to all et products except the earth2observe en in which rn and vpd have comparable performance our study highlights the importance of vpd in et changes across energy limited regions of china and suggests that the role of vpd in land surface atmosphere interactions should be considered in future studies keywords multi source et products et changes attributed method vpd 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an essential component in regional and global hydrological processes zhang et al 2016a which links the water energy and carbon cycles and thus plays a key role in the land

and scintillometry allen et al 1991 everson et al 2009 monteith and unsworth 1990 but these methods have inherent limitations due to the sparse distribution of the observation sites and the short time spans of observation recently a number of long term et products were developed using remote sensing land surface models and data assimilation which can overcome the limitations of ground measurements su 2002 miralles et al 2011ab mu et al 2011 onogi et al 2007 dee et al 2011 reichle et al 2017 bosilovich et al 2017 haddeland et al 2011 schellekens et al 2017 jung et al 2009 the quality of those et products is notably influenced by the differences of model algorithms and parameterizations as well as the forcing data used some researchers have attempted to demonstrate how the estimated et responds to these differences by running different models with the same forcing data or running a common model with different forcing data vinukollu et al 2011 badgley et al 2015 miralles et al 2016 michel et al 2016 for example to understand the impact of model algorithms on et estimates miralles et al 2016 run three et models with different algorithms using the same forcing data and found that the gleam the global land evaporation amsterdam model product has relatively better performance in most land cover types and climate regimes of the world badgley et al 2015 run the priestly taylor jet propulsion laboratory model using 19 different combinations of forcings finding that different forcings may cause an average error of 20 of the global et and the net radiation makes the largest difference besides the results from those global et products have indicated significant et changes exist in many regions of the world as warming climate may intensify the global water cycle huntington 2006 wentz et al 2007 in recent years many studies have tried to explain the et change in response to a warming climate zeng cai 2016 rigden and salvucci 2016 wang et al 2011 martens et al 2018 miralles et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 zeng cai 2016 applied a variance decomposition method to study the et changes at different time scales over 32 large river basins in the world and found that precipitation potential et and terrestrial water storage played different roles rigden and salvucci 2016 estimated daily et based on historical meteorological datasets from 236 weather stations over us and attributed the decline of et mostly to a decrease in surface conductance based on the factorial experiments zhang et al 2015 have assessed the contributions of water supply available energy and atmospheric water demand to the global et trends and these factors are found to account for 49 32 and 19 of the et variance respectively it is also expected that some climatic modes such as the el niño southern oscillation and north atlantic oscillation affect in the et variability over global in a teleconnection pattern martens et al 2018 used 16 climate indices to study the teleconnections of et changes indicating that these remote climatic modes can explain up to 40 of the et trends in some hotspot regions of the world miralles et al 2013 found that during el niño the et declines in southern africa eastern south america as well as eastern and central australia as limited terrestrial moisture supply may lead to increasing vegetation water stress there are two major gaps in the existing studies first many studies focused on et dynamic only considering one model algorithms forced with a certain forcing data but few has been done considering both uncertainties of model algorithms and forcing data second generally the used methods for studying responses of et to climatic factors are statistical tools like correlation coefficient and regression model the correlation values can t reflect certain factor is causal to et and the regression assumes there are linear relations between et and climatic factors while the relation is nonlinear hagan et al 2019 there are few studies focusing on how climate affects long term trends of et over china in the recent decades in this paper we use four et products to attribute their long term trends which have been validated using eddy covariance measurements showing relatively good performances li et al 2018 as the budyko framework links water balance component i e runoff et and precipitation to climatic conditions it has been widely used in investigating the interactions between hydrological processes and climate variability yokoo et al 2008 yang et al 2009 liu et al 2011 nevertheless limited studies focus on how climate factors influencing et zeng cai 2016 the objective of this study is two fold firstly we build the linkage among et precipitation and potential et based on budyko theory secondly contribution of each climate factor to the long term et trends is quantified by a separation method 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china is located in the east asia with a territory of more than 9 6 million square kilometers its topography is characterized by a three trapezoidal distribution with highest mountains in the west and lowest plains in the east the annual precipitation over china varies from 50 mm in the arid northwest to 2000 mm in the humid southeast the climate is dominated by changes in winter and summer monsoons which are significantly influenced by enso ding et al 2014a in summer warm and humid south wind blows however in winter mainly cold and dry northerly wind prevails ge et al 2017 according to the köppen climate classification kottek et al 2006 china can be divided into six climatic zones including arid bb semi arid sa qinghai tibet plateau qtp cold semi humid dw temperate semi humid cw and temperate humid cf fig 1 2 2 et products in this study four long term et products are used including 1 the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 0a hereafter referred to as gleam3 0a 2 the earth2observe ensemble earth2observe en 3 the global land data assimilation system version 2 0 with noah model gldas noah and 4 the modern era retrospective analysis for research and application land merra land 2 2 1 gleam et gleam is a remote sensing based product comprising several algorithms forced by a lot of satellite observations and reanalysis data sets the basic concept is to maximize the recovery of information on et which is contained in current satellite observations of climate and environment martens et al 2017 within each grid cell it separately estimates three main sources of et i e soil evaporation transpiration and interception for bare soil short and tall vegetation the gash analytical model forced with precipitation data is used to calculate interception losses meanwhile the remaining components are obtained by potential evapotranspiration priestley taylor equation which is constrained by a multiplicative stress factor miralles et al 2011b martens et al 2017 the new generation daily et product gleam version 3 0a has been produced with temporal span of 1980 2014 and spatial scale at 0 25 when simulating gleam3 0a martens et al 2017 used multi source weighted ensemble precipitation e g mswep v1 0 surface incident shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature from era interim as main forcings see table 1 at the same time other auxiliary data sets were used in the estimated process such as snow water equivalent vegetation optical depth and soil moisture 2 2 2 earth2observe ensemble et to develop a global water resources reanalysis product the earth2observe project decided to use several models forced with state of the art meteorological reanalysis datasets the models contain five hydrological models four land surface models lsms and a simple water balance model the detailed information of these models have been provided by dutra et al 2015 or their respective model introduction papers by using these models some of the errors and uncertainties introduced in individual models would be mitigated gosling et al 2010 moreover schellekens et al 2017 have confirmed that the output result of the ensemble mean outperformed individual model s performance and thus we selected the ten model arithmetic mean i e ensemble mean and named earth2observe en in this paper the monthly simulation outputs for the period 1979 2012 have a spatial resolution with one half degree those models run offline and are forced by the watch water and global change fp7 project forcing dataset era interim i e wfdei weedon et al 2015 and based on the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 wfdei are adjusted with several bias corrections using gridded observations and the climatic research unit dataset the forcing data sets mainly contain precipitation surface incident shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m near the surface wind speed at 10 m and pressure at the surface 2 2 3 gldas2 0 noah et based on the north american land data assimilation system nldas the global land data assimilation system gldas is developed by national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc from america gldas has produced fields of land surface states and fluxes e g soil moisture latent and sensible heat flux by running offline lsms together with data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 recently gldas coupled with the noah lsm released two versions i e gldas 2 0 with the period of 1948 to 2010 and gldas 2 1 with temporal span of 2000 present considering the starting year of others et products is 1980 thus we select the gldas 2 0 with 0 25 0 25 and monthly temporal coverage the gldas 2 0 is forced by the three hour meteorological forcing dataset from princeton university i e pumfd sheffield et al 2006 the variables in pumfd are the same as wfdei of earth2observe en at the same time the simulation use land surface parameters from modis based products e g land water mask mod44w the noah model static land cover modified igbp modis 20 category vegetation 2 2 4 merra land et the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra is produced by global modeling and assimilation office gmao in nasa it is a state of the art reanalysis data providing long term land surface hydrology products e g soil moisture latent and sensible heat fluxes along with atmospheric fields rienecker et al 2011 as described by reichle et al 2011 the data set with only land component of the system i e merra land has better performance in the surface hydrology study when compared to original merra estimates the monthly merra land with the period of 1980 present is used in the work the spatial resolution is 0 5 latitude by 0 67 in longitude except precipitation the forcing data sets of merra land were merra version 1 0 outputs mainly including surface incident shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature specific humidity and wind speed at 2 m near the surface as for precipitation merra land used cpc u climate prediction center unified which was processed by the precipitation correction algorithm reichle et al 2011 2 3 climate data five climatic variables i e precipitation net radiation air temperature specific humidity and wind speed are used in the attribution analysis in which their individual contribution to et changes is quantified et in each product is partly determined by their forcing data to minimize the uncertainties associated with different forcing datasets the attribution analysis is conducted between the et products and their own forcing data see table 1 for example the wfdei forcing datasets are used in the attribution analysis of the earth2observe en et product unlike the other three et products gleam3 0a does not use specific humidity and wind speed in their calculations considering that gleam3 0a uses radiation and air temperature from era interim we use the specific humidity and wind speed also from era interim in this study to keep the consistency of data source 2 4 data pre processing in this study all et products are first aggregated into annual average for each grid cell as for the spatial resolution merra land et and associated forcing datasets are resampled from 0 5 0 67 to 0 5 0 5 by interpolation we keep the original spatial resolution of the other three et products and their forcings i e 0 25 for gleam3 0a and gldas noah and 0 5 for earth2observe en all analysis is conducted in the period 1980 2010 which is the overlapping period of all four et products 3 method 3 1 trends in et and climatic variables we first examine the spatial distribution of annual mean et trends in annual et and trends in climatic variables during the period 1980 2010 in this study long term trends are derived using the non parametric theil sen s slope method which can provide more accurate estimation for skewed data than the linear regression approach wilcox 2010 it has been widely employed to estimate the trend in meteorology and hydrology variables su et al 2015 wang et al 2018b meanwhile the non parametric mann kendall method mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to determine the significance level of the derived trends in et and climatic variables the mann kendall test has been widely used for determining the significance of long term trends shan et al 2015 shi et al 2016 3 2 attribution of et trends the attribution method to quantify the individual contribution of different climatic variables to the trends in et consists of two steps first we establish a quantitative relationship between et and the five climatic variables abovementioned using budyko and modified penman monteith equations second based on the established relationship we conduct sensitivity analysis to determine the individual contribution of these five climatic variables to et changes during 1980 2010 accordingly the climatic factor dominating the long term et trends is identified for each grid cell below is the detailed description of this attribution method 3 2 1 establishing relationship between et and climatic variables we first build the linkage among actual et precipitation and potential et using the budyko equation eq 1 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 2019 teuling et al 2019 1 et p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω where et is annual actual evapotranspiration p is annual actual precipitation pet is annual potential evapotranspiration and ω denotes a parameter reflecting landscape characteristics e g vegetation cover soil properties and topography within one catchment here we use the modified fao penman monteith equation eq 2 to estimate pet allen et al 1998 2 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u where pet is the potential evapotranspiration mm yr rn mj m2 yr is the difference between net incoming shortwave and net outgoing longwave radiation g mj m2 yr is the soil heat flux density γ kpa and δ kpa are the psychometric constant and slope of vapor pressure curve respectively tem is the mean daily air temperature at 2 meter u indicates m s is the wind speed at 2 meter vpd means vapour pressure deficit i e es ea ea kpa is the actual vapour pressure es kpa is the saturation vapour pressure detailed information of δ rn γ t u and vpd can be referred to allen et al 1998 by combining eqs 1 and 2 we can obtain eq 3 which links et and the five climatic variables abovementioned 3 et p 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u p 1 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u v p d p δ γ 1 0 34 u ω 1 ω the fitting of this equation is conducted on a pixel by pixel basis between et products left hand side of equ 3 and associated forcing data right hand side of equ 3 this is done for each of four et products separately accordingly we can obtain a time series of annual et estimate during 1980 2010 based on the climatic variables and fitted eq 3 hereafter referred to as equation derived et estimate we then compare the long term trends in equation derived et estimates and et products during 1980 2010 for each grid cell over china to examine their spatiotemporal agreement 3 2 2 quantifying individual contribution of climatic variables to trends in et based on fitted eq 3 we first run one control experiment exper ctl using the actual values of climatic variables from 1980 through 2010 and obtain the exper ctl et which is essentially the same as equation derived et estimate mentioned above then we run five sensitivity experiments one for each climatic variable which are referred to as exper p exper rn exper t exper vpd and exper u respectively in each sensitivity experiment the climatic variable under test is kept constant at its value in the year 1980 while everything else is the same as the control experiment again this is done on a pixel by pixel basis for each of four et products separately basically the difference in et trends between control experiment and each sensitivity experiment is considered as the contribution of that particular climatic variable to et trends here we use the separation method recently developed by sun et al 2016 and sun et al 2017 which can minimize the errors caused by interactions of climatic variables 4 k i n c k e e x p e r i where k i n c k is the total contribution to the trend in exper ctl et from all climatic variables except for the ith factor n denotes the number of sensitivity experiments n 5 in this study and eexper i represents the et trend in each experiment respectively by solving the above equation we can obtain the contribution of each driving factor to the respective et trend in each experiment using the equation 5 c i k i n e e x p e r k n 2 e e x p e r i n 1 4 results 4 1 trends in et and climatic variables 4 1 1 trends in et all four et products show a similar spatial pattern of the time series of annual et during 1980 2010 over china fig 2 with a distinct decreasing gradient from the humid southeast china to the arid northwest china but apparent differences in the absolute values are observed among these four et products particularly over the temperate humid cf region in the southeast over the cf region the merra land product has the highest annual et greater than 900 mm yr fig 2d while the earth2observe en has the lowest 600 to 750 mm yr fig 2b in terms of the spatial distribution of long term trends in annual et during 1980 2010 there are apparent differences and similarities among these four products fig 3 strong upward trends amounting to 2 4 mm yr are found over the temperate semi humid and humid regions in the gleam3 0a fig 3a the gldas2 0 noah fig 3c and the merra land fig 3d products however such upward trend is rarely observed in the earth2observe en product fig 3b moderate increases in annual et are generally found over the western part of china including the qinghai tibet plateau the arid region and a small part of the cold semi humid regions in all four et products in addition all products show moderate decreases in et during 1980 2010 over the northeast 4 1 2 trends in climatic variables although the climatic variables used to drive these four et products are from different data sources the spatial distribution of their long term trends during 1980 2010 is generally in agreement with the strongest discrepancy observed in radiation fig 4 while increases in precipitation are commonly observed over most of western china in four precipitation products fig 4 a1 a4 there are apparent differences over the eastern part of china the precipitation product used for gleam3 0 shows generally decreasing trends but merra land shows increasing trends over most of the east part when it comes to the long term trends in radiation the discrepancies are so strong that no common regional trend can be found among these four products in any of six climatic zones fig 4 b1 b4 the radiation product used for earth2observe en shows strong decreases over the entire eastern part of china and increases over most of the west the opposite is observed in gldas2 0 noah gleam3 0a and merra land are both characterized by increases in radiation over the temperate humid region in the southeast fig 4 c1 c4 illustrate the spatial distribution of long term temperature changes despite slightly differences in the absolute values all four products show overwhelmingly increasing trends over china with most regions passing the significance test p 0 05 similar patterns are also observed in the long term trends in vpd fig 4 d1 d4 as for wind speed gleam3 0a and earth2observe en have the same change as they both use the era interim wind speed product fig 4 e1 and e2 these three wind speed products show strong differences in long term changes except over the northeast part of china 4 2 attributions of et trends 4 2 1 establishing relationship between et and climatic variables using fitted eq 3 and five climatic variables from different data sources we obtain the equation derived et estimates for each grid cell over china during 1980 2010 fig 5 compares the long term trends in four et products and equation derived et estimates on a pixel by pixel basis the high r2 values between 0 5 and 0 85 suggest that the spatio temporal characteristics of equation derived et estimates reasonably agree with et products and give us some confidence in using the equation derived et estimates to quantify the individual contribution of climatic variables to long term et changes 4 2 2 quantifying individual contribution of climatic variables to trends in et spatial distribution of the contribution of each climatic variable to long term et changes during 1980 2010 is shown in fig 6 which is closely related to the long term trends in these climatic variables fig 4 to better illustrate their relationship we make scatterplots between trends in climatic variables and their contributions to et trends stratified by climatic zones fig 7 fig 7 shows that precipitation and vpd have a significant contribution to et in terms of magnitudes while the contribution of temperature is not clearly highlighted in the contribution of t it is nonetheless found to contribute when expressed as a relation to relative humidity vpd wind speed on the other hand is here found to be limited in its contribution to et for precipitation more than 86 grid cells fall in the first and third quadrants fig 7a which means increasing precipitation mostly makes positive contribution to et changes while decreases in et are associated with decreasing precipitation this pattern is also observed in radiation fig 7b vpd fig 7d and wind speed fig 7e the exception is detected in the air temperature fig 7c a large number of grid cells from the water limited northern part of china occupying 24 08 to 52 08 of the territory fall in the fourth quadrant which suggests that increasing air temperature is associated with decreases in et fig 4c and 6c from the perspective of major climatic factor driving et changes in each climatic zone figs 7 and 8 precipitation is clearly the dominant factor over the arid semi arid and qinghai tibet plateau regions vpd becomes more important over the cold and temperate semi humid regions over the humid region in the southeast vpd plays the most important role according to gleam3 0a gldas2 0 noah and merra land while radiation and vpd are equally important according to earth2observe en 5 discussion 5 1 validation of et products li et al 2018 indicated these four et products have relatively good performances over china basing on 12 eddy covariance sites across multiple land cover types but the confidence level of validation results in grid scale is limited due to just a few sites and mismatched spatial scale on the catchment scale wang et al 2018a validated these products with a water balance method in the yellow river basin of china and their results indicated the et products were of high accuracy we have further evaluated the performances of these products in yangtze river with the water balance method the selected hydrological stationss and their contribution subbasins refer to table s1 and fig s1 respectively we calculate multiyear average et etw of 1980 2000 by precipitation minus runoff assuming no change in the terrestrial water storage during the period the scatter comparison results in each subbasin between each product and etw are illustrated in fig s2 a d suggesting good performances of these products 5 2 results comparison multi source et products i e gleam3 0a earth2observe en gldas2 0 noah and merra land indicate most regions of china have consistent results in et changes during 1980 2010 for example middle part of qinghai tibet plateau qtp for all products found et values significantly increase while significant increases of et are found in the east of cold semi humid dw region meanwhile there are opposite conclusions for example gleam3 0a gldas2 0 noah and merra land show et significantly increase in most temperate humid cf and temperate semi humid cw regions while downward trend is found in west cf region and middle cw region for earth2observe en the differences in et changes closely depend on diversities of forcing data sets the abnormal decreasing rn in earth2observe en over west cf region and middle cw fig 4 results in negative contribution to et changes fig 6 when compared to the others product the results directly limit et increase or even lead to et decrease over these regions for explaining the responses of et changes to climatic factors p rn t vpd and u we have designed an attributed method by using respective forcing data of each model based on scatterplots results of fig 7 we can conclude that there are existing positive relationships between et and p rn vpd and u over different climate regions over china the positive feedbacks of et to p and rn have been verified in several zones with typical climate characteristics e g yangtze river basin by lu et al 2019 yellow river basin by wang et al 2018a and east part of inner mongolia li et al 2016 as for t totally opposite feedback results on et are in different regions that rising t in energy limited regions i e cf west of cw qtp and east of dw leads to increased et but it hinders et process over water supply regions i e arid bb semi arid sa and west of dw jung et al 2010 and zhang et al 2019 have explained why there is a negative correlation between t and et of water limited regions due to plants in here being a self protection state resulting in stomatal closure of leaf the results of positive contribution of vpd are confirmed in many studies across different climate regions hogg and hurdle 1997 admiral et al 2006 sottocornola and kiely 2010 kochendorfer et al 2011 yang et al 2019 wang and dickinson 2012 high vpd values act like a water pump in air which absorb water from land surface soil and vegetation it increases water loss from bare soil dai 2013 however vpd s effect on vegetation is very complex high vpd triggers a self projection mechanism in plants so that their stomata would be closed to reduce water loss running 1976 interestingly the closure in pores of plant does not limit transpiration rate but increases transpiration franks et al 1997 moreover vpd has been becoming a major determinant of controlling global water resources and water relations in plant grossiord et al 2020 numerous studies often ignore vpd s effect on vegetation or replace it with high temperature lindner et al 2010 way oren 2010 grossiord et al 2020 explored independent physiological influences in high vpd on vegetation dynamics they used nine stomatal models to study how vpd affects transpiration and found high vpd leads to decreasing stomatal conductance but increases transpiration for multiple land covers under a given vpd threshold vpd is the function of air temperature and relative humidity decreasing results in relative humidity during past decades are also observed over china ding and liu 2014b rising air temperature fig 4c 1 4 and decreasing relative humidity both contribute to increasing vpd over china there is a closely relationship between t and vpd in the sensitivity experiment of the study when t alone is prescribed exper t its contribution is not fully realized however when t is prescribed as it relates to relative humidity in vpd exper vpd its contribution becomes more emphasized t is important but just itself the contribution to et in this region is not clearly seen however when it is expressed with as it relates to changes in relative humidity vpd its contribution is clearly highlighted moreover we found that although rising air temperature definitely results in increasing vpd contribution in vpd doesn t increase correspondingly fig 9 the threshold is 15 in annual average for all products except merra land when air temperature is more than 15 vpd contribution evidently increases when air temperature is less than 15 rising temperature does not result in increasing contribution in vpd fig 8 shows that pixel wise distributions of climatic factor dominating et changes for all products p is the primary factor for controlling et over water limited regions while rn and vpd are responsible for et changes over energy limited regions the results in dominating et are consistent with budyko theory budyko 1974 related energy factors mainly include t vpd and rn but few studies can decompose et changes into the contributions by t vpd and rn for example zhang et al 2020 pointed to relative contribution of air temperature to annual et changes during 1982 2016 is more than 50 over 110 humid catchments of china for both numerical experiment and sensitivity method while rn only accounts for about 10 they just pay more attentions to how t and rn influence et changes but ignoring vpd as a vital factor of controlling transpiration yang et al 2019 reported vpd over limited energy regions was about twice as much as rn accounting for the percentages of et future changes using several earth system models output in this study we identify vpd as one of energy factors is playing an increasingly important role in controlling et changes 5 3 uncertainties to validate the accuracy of budyko theory applied in here we compare pixel wise et values in each product with estimated et values with budyko theory using pet and p as input fig s3 a d the high r2 vaules between 0 86 and 0 94 indicate the all products conform to the budyko theory we have also assessed uncertainties of the attributed method driven by forcing data of each model in section 4 2 1 the validation results show equation derived et estimates can reproduce spatio temporal characteristics of all products to quantify the possible uncertainties from the choice of pet estimation methods we have made comparisons of the et estimations and their attributions using the penman monteith and the penman equations firstly we compare the pet values by the fao penman monteith equation in here with the penman method and the results in fig s4 show very small et differences between them furthermore we have made the same analysis with pet calculated by penman method to attribute the et changes to climatic factors following the designed sensitivity experiments in this study and the derived results are shown in fig s5 comparing fig s5 and fig 8 we can find that the choice of penman monteith or penman equation has little impact on the final results the parameter ω at the grid scale is fitted with yearly precipitation et and calculated pet during 1980 2010 in each product it is a constant value in each grid besides the fitted parameter ω of each model can incorporate unique characteristic information of that model into the attributed method xu et al 2013 the information mainly includes each model s auxiliary input data e g land cover types soil properties and topography and structure parameters e g potential et scheme numerous studies has confirmed that these surface parameters e g vegetation greening have evident impacts on hydrological components e g river flow runoff et and water level gashaw et al 2018 xi et al 2018 piao et al 2015 forzieri et al 2020 meanwhile anthropogenic perturbations such as co2 concentrations human activities to et changes should not been ignored yang et al 2019 ainsworth and rogers 2007 feng et al 2013 lv et al 2017 5 3 1 the influences of vegetation and co2 numerous studies have reported the greening of the earth in the recent decades zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2019a and the vegetation biophysical feedbacks would affect global energy flux partitions forzieri et al 2020 zeng et al 2017 global vegetation transpiration accounts for about 60 of the total terrestrial et lian et al 2018 it is also confirmed vegetation is the primary driver of spatial variations of ratio of transpiration to the total terrestrial et suggesting that vegetation greening may increase this ratio however soil evaporation would be reduced due to global vegetation greening partly hindering et increase zhang et al 2016b in the humid regions of china zhang et al 2020 has indicated that vegetation greening actually changes the proportions of et components i e result in 59 0 62 0 increase of the ratio but vegetation greening hasn t synchronously increased the total et mo et al 2018 simulated the spatiotemporal variations of et over china with a process based vegetation interface processes model indicating that the et variability at annual scales is principally determined by precipitation similarly zhang et al 2020 used numerical experiment approach and sensitivity method to quantify the contributions of climate variables and vegetation greening to the et changes during 1982 2016 in 110 humid catchments of china and found that the climate variables has accounted for more than 90 of the et changes as for the water limited regions a number of studies have also confirmed that precipitation controls the interannual et changes at long time scale over loess plateau and haihe river basin ning et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 he et al 2019 wang et al 2021 anyway although there are studies suggesting significant vegetation impact on the terrestrial et the vegetation variations of interest are believed to have already contained the signal of precipitation variations which is essence for vegetation growth furthermore the four et datasets in our study are produced without considering the vegetation impact using appropriate algorithms and model parameterizations therefore this study focuses only on climatic factors affecting interannual et changes and does not consider the vegetation impacts which are not imbedded in the production algorithms the influences of co2 on et over china during 1980 2010 are limited even though it increases stomatal resistance we used an idealized reference crop surface vegetation height is 0 12 m surface albedo is 0 25 as an example pet considering co2 is called petco2 in which rising co2 would increase surface resistance and reduce pet yang et al 2019 the yearly ratio i e pet petco2 pet over china is showed in fig s6 the results indicate that the ratio in most years of the period is below 0 01 for different pet forced by forcing data in each product 5 3 2 human activities human activities have been playing an important role in affecting hydrological components such as et run off and groundwater feng et al 2013 2018 khandelwal et al 2017 pekel et al 2016 ashraf et al 2017 chen et al 2019b for example north china has been becoming one of the global largest irrigation regions and resulted in groundwater level dropping by an average rate of 2 0 cm per year during 2003 2010 to agriculture crop irrigation feng et al 2013 furthermore lv et al 2017 reconstructed et values over the yellow river basin and yangtze river basin by considering the irrigation water into the gldas 1 land surface models and found this result was improved with little absolute relative errors 1 9 validated by the reference et by water balance method however these selected et products except earth2observe en do not consider anthropogenic effects on et changes assuming climate change is totally responsible for et changes as for earth2observe en six models at least consider one of groundwater reservoir and water use see table s2 but we found earth2observe en with the highest r2 values from fig 5 and fig s3 when compared to the others products suggesting influences of climate change can account for most et changes in earth2observe en nonetheless the effect of human activities i e irrigation and reservoir construction on et changes over china shouldn t been ignored due to the limits of remote sensing products land surface models and reanalysis products in quantifying human activities it is very necessary to couple with some hydrological models to more accurately evaluate et changes in the future 6 conclusions in this manuscript we first investigated et trends across china using four different et products i e gleamv3 0 earth2observe en gldas2 0 noah and merra land then examined the respective impacts of five climatic factors precipitation radiation temperature vpd and wind speed on et changes over china by a newly developed attribution method with budyko framework and accordingly identified the dominant factors controlling et changes for each grid cell over china our major findings are summarized below a et trends the strongest increase in et is generally observed over the temperate humid and semi humid regions in the southeast china while the strongest decrease over the cold semi humid region in the northeast in addition moderate increases in et in the western part of china are detected in all four et products b contributions of climatic factors increasing precipitation radiation temperature vpd and wind speed make positive contributions to et changes except for temperature over the arid region in the northwest where temperature increases but it makes negative contribution to et changes that is if everything else is kept the same increasing temperature is corresponding with decreasing et there the magnitudes in et changes are more sensitive to changes in precipitation radiation and vpd the influence of temperature and wind speed on et changes is much weaker c dominant factors precipitation is the major factor controlling et changes over the entire water limited regions i e arid semi arid and qinghai tibet plateau and a large part of the cold and temperate semi humid regions over the humid and a small part of semi humid regions vpd is the dominating factor according to gleamv3 0 gldas noah and merra land while radiation and vpd have comparable contributions based on earth2observe en credit authorship contribution statement shijie li conceptualization methodology
