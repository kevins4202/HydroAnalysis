8290,study region central america study focus knowledge of the mean recharge elevation mre of water resources is important where water resources are vulnerable the purpose of this study was to develop and apply a bayesian approach which incorporates isotopic uncertainties and evaporative effects on isotopic compositions to determine the mre of 680 surface water sources from central america differences were assessed between results from our approach and those from other isotope based methods that do not account for these factors new hydrological insights for the region different mre patterns were identified for pacific and caribbean basins which were characterized by distinct isotopic signatures 1 the pacific slope had recharge occurring at higher elevations relative to the source mean catchment elevation mce and 2 the caribbean slope had recharge largely occurring at elevations lower than the mce these relationships were quantified mrep 1 072 mce 45 65 pacific r2 0 93

region s population bayesian mre estimates were on average lower than mres obtained using other methods and may better approximate the actual recharge weighed mre suggesting that the inclusion of isotopic uncertainties evaporative corrections and recharge likelihoods all positively effect mre estimations keywords central america bayesian approach mean catchment elevation mean recharge elevation isotopic fractionation water resource 1 introduction information regarding spatial distributions of recharge and the factors that control these distributions is essential for water managers in the face of expanding populations rapid urbanization and changes in land use and climate these stressors affect the quantity and quality of water available and therefore can have long lasting social political and environmental implications cosgrove and loucks 2015 mountainous regions are particularly sensitive to hydrologic modifications alexander et al 2007 diaz et al 2003 dodds and oakes 2008 and are often overlooked in policy and management plans due to their complicated topography and hydrological uncertainties such as those associated with runoff and recharge processes and how these processes respond to disturbances ariza et al 2013 křeček and haigh 2019 however these regions contain headwaters distinguished for their role in recharging surface water and groundwater resources křeček and haigh 2000 they supply freshwater to a large portion of the world s population through discharge transported to lower lying areas contributing 20 50 of the total discharge in humid areas and 50 90 in arid regions viviroli and weingartner 2004 and also support approximately one quarter of the world s terrestrial biological diversity spehn et al 2010 as such the characterization of recharge patterns across mountainous regions can help inform conservation and protection practices to ensure adequate freshwater supply and ecosystem services maintenance topographic relief produces distinct gradients in the isotopic signatures of precipitation resulting from the altitude effect or the phenomenon of δ 18o and δ 2h becoming more depleted with increasing elevation dansgaard 1964 consequently stable isotopic lapse rates have been leveraged to provide insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of recharge elevation in many mountainous regions ambach et al 1968 bhat and jeelani 2015 eastoe and towne 2018 gat and dansgaard 1972 gonfiantini et al 2001 jeelani et al 2018 jung et al 2019 koeniger et al 2017 2016 longinelli and selmo 2003 matiatos and alexopoulos 2011 o driscoll et al 2005 paternoster et al 2008 sánchez murillo et al 2016 sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 sappa et al 2018 saravanakumar et al 2010 saylor et al 2009 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 vespasiano et al 2015 winckel et al 2002 yamanaka et al 2015 yamanaka and yamada 2017 zhu et al 2018 the lapse rates are typically determined based on the 18o 16o δ18o and 2h 1h δ2h ratios of precipitation collected at different elevations in the study area as 18o and 2h can vary widely between rainfall events clark and fritz 1997 this method requires sampling over a long period of time at least four years putman et al 2019 and therefore can be inhibited by financial or logistical constraints longinelli and selmo 2003 an alternative approach described as the small spring method vespasiano et al 2015 involves sampling shallow groundwater from springs instead the seasonal changes exhibited by groundwaters are minor so they can be used to constrain the lapse rate in a shorter timeframe i e one year or less sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 however this method is only valid where the groundwater is immature the springs have small upstream catchments and there are small differences between the spring and the recharge elevations further studies have conducted spatial analysis of stable isotopes using geographic information systems gis isoscapes i e isotope landscape mapping bowen 2010 have been shown to provide fairly accurate predictions when derived from the interpolation of geographically distributed isotopic observations or developed by process level models to predict the isotopic composition at a given location bowen and good 2015 models that include parameters relating isotopic compositions to climatic and or geographic variables often outperform space only interpolations e g nearest neighbor inverse distance weighting etc with errors reduced by 10 15 bowen and revenaugh 2003 yamanaka and yamada 2017 thus used multiple regression to construct hydrogen and oxygen precipitation isoscapes for central japan where δ18o and δ2h were functions of latitude longitude and elevation then the models were used to estimate the mean recharge elevations mres of tap water sources unrestricted to mountainous settings different combinations of stable water isotopes δ18o and δ2h other geochemical tracers including 3h 14c and the noble gases he ne ar kr and xe hydrochemical data and physical data have frequently been used together to inform geostatistical techniques lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 machine learning algorithms pourghasemi et al 2020 and simulation models da costa et al 2019 meredith et al 2011 mosase et al 2019 to constrain the spatial distribution of actual or potential groundwater recharge within catchments similar datasets have been combined to characterize factors which influence stream network discharge by identifying sources and seasonal dynamics of surface runoff tetzlaff et al 2007 and river recharge guo et al 2017 and to assess catchment water balances karim and veizer 2002 these combined approaches are often preferable to a single dataset approach because each tracer and physically based method is associated with significant uncertainties hall et al 2020 for example the current methods using stable isotopes do not consider uncertainties in measured isotopic compositions and as these methods have mainly been applied to study groundwater sources secondary processes occurring after precipitation are assumed to be insignificant however evaporative fractionation can occur in the soil during infiltration and affect original isotopic compositions sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 sprenger et al 2017 vespasiano et al 2015 winckel et al 2002 our primary objective was to develop a probabilistic interpretation of the approach outlined in yamanaka and yamada 2017 that captures both the uncertainties in isotopic values as well as potential isotope fractionation due to evaporation first we developed a statistical method for estimating the mre of groundwater and surface water sources by incorporating stable isotopic compositions within a bayesian framework in the surface water context mean recharge elevation refers to instances where precipitation is directly contributing water to streams second we applied our approach to estimate the mre of surface water samples collected from streams in panama costa rica nicaragua honduras and el salvador and examined regional mre patterns as well as relationships between mre and catchment properties third we compared resulting mres to those obtained using simpler isotope based methods the differences between estimated mres and sample elevations were also calculated as justification for improved management of mountainous regions the results can inform governmental institutions and non governmental organizations in central america and raise awareness regarding conservation and protection of critical recharge zones the methods developed here may also contribute to the understanding of recharge dynamics in other regions where isotopically informed geospatial models are becoming robust and more widely applied to improve water resources planning dehaspe et al 2018 jasechko and taylor 2015 taylor et al 2012 villegas et al 2018 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the central american countries of panama costa rica nicaragua honduras and el salvador are located between 7 and 16 n latitude and 77 and 90 w longitude fig 1 these countries constitute 74 87 of the total land area and 65 of the total population of central america central america has a total land area just over 524 000 km2 and is home to more than 47 million people over 27 million people currently live in urban areas mainly in the pacific domain but at modern rates of population growth and urbanization an additional 25 million are predicted to live in cities by 2050 maria et al 2017 although there have always been restrictions on certain high risk activities in recharge areas deliberations to regulate urban expansion in these areas are incipient many of the region s surface water resources are already degraded due to indiscriminate urban and industrial waste disposal as well as uncontrolled agricultural related activities such as deforestation castillo et al 1997 parello et al 2008 silva et al 2015 as a result the region is highly dependent on groundwater extraction estimated at 1 9 1010 m3yr 1 however virtually all of the aquifers supplying central american metropolitan areas indicate overexploitation ballestero et al 2007 the region is also characterized by an unequal distribution of water both spatially and temporally a volcanic arc that extends north to south across the region divides central america into pacific and caribbean draining basins the caribbean slope drains 70 of the region and has the largest rivers and watersheds however 70 of the population lives on the pacific slope where there is higher economic activity leonard 1987 on the pacific slope heavy rains and river flows occur mainly between may and november the beginning of the rainy season in may is associated with the latitudinal migration of the intertropical convergence zone itcz over the central america region which leads to the development of convective activity and cyclonic circulation by july and august the itcz has moved north of the region causing precipitation to decrease along the pacific coast known as the mid summer drought or msd at the same time precipitation increases to a maximum along the caribbean slope resulting from orographic forcing of caribbean sourced moisture transported directly across the region by the northeast trade winds magaña et al 1999 the caribbean sea provides the dominant source of moisture to the region durán quesada et al 2010 so that the caribbean slope experiences a relatively homogeneous precipitation regime throughout the year it receives greater annual rainfall than the pacific slope which experiences a rain shadow effect due to the presence of the central mountain range these contrasting precipitation modes reflect the interaction of sea surface temperatures ssts air circulation processes and topography which are the primary controls on regional climate sáenz and durán quesada 2015 taylor and alfaro 2005 temperature varies from the coastal lowlands to the mountains but seasonal fluctuations in temperature are low 3 c regional climate projections suggest the following changes by 2050 1 a rainfall decrease 10 25 during the wet season i e may to november imbach et al 2018 2 a spatial extension of the area affected by the msd magaña et al 1999 maldonado et al 2013 maurer et al 2017 and 3 positive trends in temperature and dry extreme events resulting in a net decrease of water availability imbach et al 2018 2 2 stable isotope datasets stable isotope archives comprised of averaged annual amount weighted precipitation ratios from 73 sites and averaged surface water ratios from 677 sites across costa rica nicaragua honduras el salvador and panama were compiled from recent studies sánchez murillo et al 2020 2016 2013 sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 a detailed description of these archives was provided by sánchez murillo et al 2020 new stable isotope data of precipitation n 54 monthly composite samples from 5 sites and surface waters n 37 monthly samples from 3 sites were collected in panama from july 2017 to july 2018 rainfall totalizers were crafted to collect and preserve rainfall within the monthly period iaea 2014 each totalizer consisted of a 6 cm radius funnel and a 1 l high density polyethylene hdpe collection bottle calculated d excess values were in agreement with the archived data values which range from 2 9 to 14 4 collection bottles were emptied into 5 l hdpe accumulation bottles which were stored at room temperature until the end of the month then a portion of the cumulative rainfall was transferred to a 16 ml glass e c borosilicate sample bottle wheaton science products usa sample bottles were sealed with parafilm and labeled with the site s name and the amount of precipitation collected for that month calculated as ppt mm 10 v πrf 2 where v is water volume collected ml and rf is funnel radius cm the annual amount weighted ratio δ p a w for each new precipitation site was calculated as 1 δ p a w i 1 n p i δ x p i i 1 n p i where n is the number of months pi is the monthly precipitation and δxp i is the δ2h or δ18o composition of precipitation for the i th month surface water samples were collected from streams only at flowing sections to circumvent evaporative signals and base flow conditions were targeted to ensure that the sample was representative of cumulative upstream outflow sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 the annual amount weighted precipitation isotope ratio for each surface water site was calculated fig 1 indicates the locations of precipitation and surface water sites within the study area there were 56 precipitation and 408 surface water sampling sites in the pacific domain and 22 precipitation and 272 surface water sampling sites in the caribbean domain isotopic signatures at each site were tested against the standard normal distribution fig 2 illustrates the distributions of δ18o in precipitation a and surface waters b as well as the relationships between δ18o and δ2h in precipitation c and surface waters d for both slopes i e pacific and caribbean the new samples from panama were analyzed at oregon state university using a cavity ring down spectroscopy crds isotope analyzer l2120 i picarro usa all isotopic compositions were expressed in δ notation δ r rstd 1 where r is the ratio of rare to abundant isotopes in the sample and rstd is the ratio of rare to abundant isotopes in vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow all δ values were reported in per mil parts per thousand laboratory standards established using mass spectrometer measurements of florida δ2h 3 56 δ18o 0 95 and boulder δ2h 120 68 δ18o 16 00 tap waters were used to normalize the results to the vsmow vslap scale each sample was injected six times to compensate for memory effects and the final three injections were averaged after correction to provide the measurement the average analytical precision was 0 20 1σ for δ2h and 0 05 1σ for δ18o 2 3 precipitation isotope ratio model multivariate regression models were constructed for δ2h and δ18o using the annual amount weighted precipitation isotope ratios following yamanaka and yamada 2017 the models included longitude x latitude y and elevation z of precipitation sites as potential explanatory variables for δ polynomial forms of the longitude latitude and elevation terms x x 2 x 3 y y 2 y 3 z z 2 z 3 were evaluated because the relationship between these variables and δ is not always linear yamanaka et al 2015 interaction terms xy xz yz were also assessed to gain an understanding of variable inter relationships and their effect on δ 2 4 catchment extraction catchments for each surface water sample were obtained using 30 arc second grid cells of approximately 1 km2 hydrosheds data lehner et al 2008 within pysheds 0 2 6 a python package designed for watershed delimitation stream network extraction and determination of flow direction and accumulation the longitude and latitude of each surface water site was employed as an outlet point to delineate the total upstream area contributing water flow to that point the coordinates were directed to snap to the nearest cell having more than 20 upstream places this criterion was included to adjust for any inaccuracies associated with input data i e sample longitude latitude and elevation that could result in an outlet point input not intersecting an actual water source once a catchment was delineated all of the locations lj composed of xj yj and zj within it were extracted and catchment properties including a mean catchment longitude xj latitude yj and elevation zj were calculated then for each catchment location lj xj yj zj an annual amount weighted precipitation isotopic composition δ ˆ p a w j was predicted using the precipitation model 2 5 assumptions in the mean recharge elevation assessment 2 5 1 steady state evaporation the likelihood that the measured isotopic composition of a surface water sample was consistent with the isotopic composition of precipitation predicted at each location in its catchment was assessed within a bayesian framework good et al 2014 following yamanaka and yamada 2017 it was assumed that the isotopic composition of surface water samples taken from different sources reflects approximately that of precipitation at their recharge areas plus δ which represents the isotope fractionation that occurs as a result of phase changes δs δp δ when there is a phase change the heavy and light isotopes are partitioned relatively between the two phases during evaporation the light h and o isotopes are lost from the liquid water body preferentially and the remaining water becomes enriched in the heavier isotopes this evaporative enrichment occurs along a slope which deviates from that of the global meteoric water line gibson et al 2008 the evaporation line g was defined as a function providing the δ2h value for a given δ18o value of t 2 g t x p j y p j x j y j y j y p j x j x p j t x p j y p j where the first parenthesized term on the right hand side of the equation is the slope xp j and yp j are the δ18o and δ2h values of predicted precipitation at location j and x j and y j are the limiting δ18o and δ2h values of an evaporating water body under local climatological conditions e g the final isotopic composition of the water sample as its volume approaches zero at location j the limiting isotopic composition was calculated as 3 δ h δ a ε h ε 10 3 where ε is the total isotopic separation factor that includes both equilibrium and kinetic components h is often assumed to be the relative humidity and δ a is the atmospheric composition of vapor gibson et al 2016 gibson and edwards 2002 values for δ a were estimated assuming isotopic equilibrium between atmospheric vapor and precipitation since global scale isotopic measurements of water vapor at ground level have revealed for most cases vapor precipitation equilibrium is maintained over continental masses araguás araguás et al 2000 4 δ a δ p ε 1 10 3 ε 1000 δ p α 1000 where ε is the equilibrium isotopic separation α is the equilibrium fractionation and ε is related to α by ε α 1 1000 gibson et al 2016 gibson and edwards 2002 if the vapor and precipitation are in equilibrium their isotopic exchange reaction rates are well known for a given temperature the ε h and δ a parameters used to determine limiting isotopic compositions were calculated using gridded worldclim 2 data of average and minimum temperature at a 30 arc second resolution fick and hijmans 2017 given the humid conditions of the region minimum temperature could be used as a proxy for dew point in h calculations gunawardhana et al 2017 2 5 2 precipitation precipitation and its limiting composition at each

δ18o and δ2h values predicted by the precipitation model at that location in the catchment and σ2 δ18o p σ2 δ2h p and σ δ18o δ2h p were fixed according to the model uncertainty 0 75 52 18 and 5 97 respectively the terms μ δ18o j and μ δ2h j are the δ18o and δ2h values of the limiting composition with associated uncertainties σ2 δ18o σ2 δ2h and σ δ18o δ2h since it was assumed that the atmospheric vapor is in equilibrium with local precipitation the same variance and covariance values associated with the precipitation model were utilized 2 5 3 surface waters similarly each surface water sample was assumed to be from a normal distribution ds ms ss with a mean ms and covariance matrix ss 6a m s μ δ 18 o s μ δ 2 h s 6b s s σ 2 δ 18 o s 0 0 σ 2 δ 2 h s where μ δ18o s is the measured δ18o value of the surface water sample with analytical uncertainty σ2 δ18o s and μ δ2h s is the measured δ2h value of the surface water sample with analytical uncertainty σ2 δ2h s uncertainties were fixed at 0 05 and 0 20 respectively based on the uncertainty of the crds analysis 2 6 bayesian likelihood assessment in statistics and probability theory bayes law is used to determine the conditional probability of events based on prior knowledge of the conditions that might be relevant to the event as it shows the relationship between a conditional probability and its reverse form it can be used to invert a conditional probability in this study the likelihood that a surface water sample recharged at a particular location within its catchment was assessed through an approach modified from good et al 2014 and kennedy et al 2011 7 p l j δ s p δ s l j p l j p δ s l j p l j where the posterior distribution p l j δ s expresses the probability that a particular catchment location l j with a normal predicted precipitation distribution dpj served as the location of recharge for a collected surface water sample δs with a normal sample distribution ds the prior probability distribution p lj defines the probability of that location within the catchment in this case prior knowledge assumed that every location has equal likelihood of occurrence the conditional probability p δ s l j is the probability of obtaining the surface water sample δs with a normal sample distribution ds given the location l j with a normal predicted precipitation distribution dpj the conditional probability was determined by integrating the sample distribution f ds along potential evaporation lines g t and multiplying these integrated values by the probability that a particular evaporation line occurs f dpj 8 p δ s l j f d p j x p j y p j x j y j x p j x j g t f d s t g t d t d x p j d y p j d x j d y j this approach integrates t from xp j to x j examining all possible

approach was executed using a python script included in the supplementary material for an illustration of this approach see fig 4 of good et al 2014 assuming that the prior probability distribution p lj is uniform the form of bayes law was simplified as 11 p l j δ s p δ s l j x 1 j p δ s l j and the relative likelihood that a particular location within the surface water sample catchment l j served as the location of recharge for a given sample δs was determined by normalizing the conditional probability fig 3 demonstrates likelihood throughout a single catchment using the sixaola river basin in southern costa rica as an example 2 7 calculation of mean recharge elevations the mre of the surface water sample was then calculated by weighting each catchment elevation by its respective probability and summing these products 12 mre p l j δ s z j similarly the standard deviation of the recharge elevation sdre is calculated as 13 sdre p l j δ s z j 2 p l j δ s z j 2 and the difference between the mre and the surface water site elevation swse or zmin the contributing catchment s minimum elevation was also calculated i e z mre swse mre z m i n 3 results 3 1 precipitation isotope

masses are mainly carried from the caribbean sea in a south west direction by the trade winds both the x and y terms can represent the continental effect where δ18o and δ2h decrease inland from the coast no latitude effect has been reported in the humid tropics however in panama a pseudo latitude effect results from the collinearity of latitude with distance from the caribbean sea lachniet and patterson 2006 fit model term coefficients are shown in table 1 these models can estimate the isotopic composition of regional precipitation with mean absolute errors of 6 60 for δ2h r2 adjusted 0 54 and 0 80 for δ18o r2 adjusted 0 57 the most significant errors 2 0 for δ18o are associated with sites located in nw costa rica along the pacific slope of the mountainous divide fig 4 a region characterized by relatively small precipitation events and large secondary evaporation processes in order to further examine the performance of our precipitation model the online isotopes in precipitation calculator oipc bowen 2017 bowen and revenaugh 2003 was also used to determine mean annual δ18o and δ2h values for the locations associated with precipitation samples and model errors were compared the oipc estimates δ18o and δ2h based on the interpolation of global data derived primarily from the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip database iaea wmo 2015 and the interpolation is based on a composite model that includes latitude and altitude parameters to represent temperature effects as well as a distance weighting parameter to account for variability in δ18o and δ2h not resolved by the other parameters bowen and revenaugh 2003 the opic predicted regional precipitation compositions with mean absolute errors of 11 11 for δ2h and 1 37 for δ18o 3 2 mean recharge elevations the model predicted δ18o and δ2h values for the locations in a sample s catchment were used to evaluate the probabilities that each location served as a location of recharge enabling the calculation of the sample s mre fig 5 the mre for 46 5 316 of the surface water samples was higher than 1000 m asl of the 316 samples recharged above 1000 m asl 235 74 4 were derived from a pacific catchment additionally the mre for 13 1 89 of the surface water samples was higher than 2000 m asl with 72 of the 89 80 9 having been derived from a pacific catchment those surface water sources recharged above 2000 m asl were all located in the mountainous interior of northeast panama and costa rica and along the pacific coast of costa rica the elevational distribution of mre for surface water sources by slope is shown in fig 6 while the mre of pacific samples was widely distributed across different elevations 50 4 137 of the caribbean samples representing 20 1 of all 680 samples recharged at an elevation below 500 m asl the distributions of mre swse and the differences between mre and swse zmre swse by slope are compared in fig 7 mres and swses were higher on the pacific slope and the average difference between mres and swses on the pacific slope 531 2 m was 78 7 m higher than on the caribbean slope 452 5 m 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of mre uncertainties one advantage of the bayesian approach implemented in this study was the ability to assess the uncertainties associated with the mre estimates the standard deviations of the recharge elevations sdres range from 0 to 823 m with a mean value of 241 m the lowest sdres generally 241 m were associated with the mre estimates of samples from el salvador σmean 158 m honduras σmean 187 m nicaragua σmean 178 m and panama σmean 198 m meanwhile the mre estimates of samples from both pacific and caribbean domains of costa rica are associated with higher sdres σmean 286 m fig 8 significant trends p 0 0001 of sdre with mean catchment elevation and catchment relief defined as zmax zmin were found for both slopes across the region suggesting that the complex topography may help explain the observed spatial variability in sdre it is possible our precipitation model s assumption of a spatially uniform isotopic lapse rate could be a cause of greater sdre altitude effects have been found to differ for pacific versus caribbean domains in countries within and near the study area with isotopic lapse rates varying between 0 50 to 1 9 km 1 on the pacific slope while increasing up to 2 4 km 1 on the caribbean slope lachniet et al 2007 lachniet and patterson 2009 perez et al 2015 sánchez murillo et al 2020 wassenaar et al 2009 as sdre was found to correlate strongly with sampling elevation only on the caribbean slope and with catchment size only on the pacific slope the mechanisms responsible for spatial variations in mre uncertainty may ultimately vary depending on domain and warrant further investigation 4 2 cross validation of mre estimates in order to examine how mres have changed with the incorporation of bayesian probabilities the mres of surface water samples were also estimated using the isoscape approach presented in yamanaka and yamada 2017 hereafter yy17 the yy17 approach estimates mres using a regional isotopic lapse rate γ km 1 corresponding to the c0 model parameter in eq 14 and isotopic shift δ 15 mr e yy 17 10 3 δ s w δ p δ γ where δ s w is the measured δ18o or δ2h of the surface water sample and δ p is the sea level δ18o or δ2h value of precipitation at given coordinates the δ p parameter is derived from the precipitation model 16 δ p δ ˆ p a w γz 10 3 c 1 y 3 c 2 y 2 c 3 y c 4 x 2 c 5 x c 6 x y c 7 and the δ parameter is optimized via iteration so as to minimize the differences between annual precipitation weighted mean catchment elevations mcepw and estimated mres although the optimized case only improved the differences by 15 50 m relative to the case assuming δ 0 in the yy17 study mcepw is used as a proxy for recharge weighted mre where recharge flux precipitation minus evapotranspiration cannot be determined due to uncertainties associated with estimating evapotranspiration bayesian mre values are on average 503 δ18o based and 391 δ2h based m lower than mres resulting from the yy17 approach assuming no isotopic shift occurred and 539 δ18o based and 425 δ2h based m lower than the yy17 approach with optimized δ values the incorporation of regional δ values for δ18o and δ2h in the yy17 approach only affected the differences between samples mre estimates and mcepw by 6 67 m however the differences between yy17 derived mres and mcepws were generally much larger than those between bayesian derived mres and mcepws fig 9 the bayesian approach produces estimates of mre that are on average 69 m higher than sample mcepw s together these trends illustrate how regional isotope data will yield mres that are higher than samples mcepw they further demonstrate how an isotopic lapse rate based method that does not also consider probabilities across a sample s catchment in the process of mre determination will result in estimates less proximate to the sample s mcepw bayesian mre estimates for surface water samples from the pacific slope of costa rica nicaragua honduras and el salvador were also compared on a broad scale to those from sanchez murillo et al 2020 where mres for pacific ground water samples were calculated using a simple isotopic lapse rate method with no account for the potential effects of evaporative enrichment on isotopic compositions of the water samples since surface water samples for this study were collected from streams during base flow conditions the patterns observed here can be representative of regional groundwater recharge as well sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 median mres for the pacific domain of each country using the bayesian and lapse rate based approaches are compared in table 2 with the exception of honduras countries median mres are again much lower according to the bayesian approach supporting the notion that the bayesian statistical analysis will result in lower mre estimates relative to the other isotope based approaches assessed here the δ18o isotopic lapse rate of 1 48 km 1 derived from the precipitation model and used here in the probabilistic assessment of mres was similar to the regional isotopic lapse rate of 1 0 km 1 which was used to estimate mres in sánchez murillo et al 2020 it should be noted since the lapse rate from sánchez murillo et al 2020 was partially constructed using isotope data from historical rainfall stations it is possible some of the ratios were affected by improper collection therefore the lapse rate of 1 0 km 1 is likely lower than it would be based solely on more recent and robust monitoring sites and it can be inferred that the additional constraints provided by the incorporation of isotopic uncertainties and evaporative effects are significant 4 3 mre and catchment properties in this study patterns of mre were interpreted by assessing the relationship between mre and catchment properties including mean catchment longitude mean catchment latitude mean catchment elevation minimum catchment elevation swse catchment relief and catchment size changes in mre with mean catchment longitude and latitude appear to reflect changes in swse i e larger smaller mres are associated with sampling locations of higher lower elevations p 0 001 for both slopes a comparison of mre and mean catchment elevation mce demonstrates that samples collected from the pacific slope generally have a mre close to or above the mce while samples collected from the caribbean slope tend to have a mre near or below the mce fig 10 it is likely that these different relationships between mre and mce for the pacific and caribbean slopes are related to the distinct precipitation regimes characterizing them previous studies have identified two main sources of moisture for central america durán quesada et al 2010 lachniet et al 2007 maldonado 2017 the caribbean sea is the dominant contributor of moisture while southern central america specifically pacific coastal sites in costa rica and panama also receive moisture originating from the eastern equatorial pacific in the form of intense convective rainfall when the northeast trade winds are weak the majority of the moisture that leaves the pacific is lost over the ocean so its contributions to the region are low relative to the caribbean sea the trade winds transport moisture directly from the caribbean sea over the caribbean slope and the moisture undergoes orographic uplift and rainout consequently the caribbean slope experiences a relatively homogeneous precipitation regime and recharge may occur largely below the mce on the pacific slope air masses become progressively warmer and drier as they advance westward and descend so that what little moisture remains once the air masses have traversed the mountains can be expected to precipitate and recharge water sources at an elevation higher than the mce the orographic effect on mre can be quantified as simple linear regressions 17a m r e p 1 072 m c e 45 65 17b m r e c 0 9493 m c e 28 24 with coefficients of determination r2 0 93 pacific and 0 83 caribbean and mean absolute errors maes 144 m pacific and 190 m caribbean including another catchment property catchment size minimum catchment elevation catchment relief as an additional predictor variable in the models yields improvement in mre projections but including more than one additional predictor variable beyond mce does not relief was the catchment property that most improved the models 18a m r e p 1 016 m c e 0 2693 r e l i e f 151 49 18b m r e c 1 110 m c e 0 1311 r e l i e f 64 25 with r2 adjusted 0 97 mae 97 m pacific and r2 adjusted 0 90 mae 137 m caribbean the improvement is greater on the caribbean slope since rainfall is more evenly distributed across the caribbean slope catchment properties may play a more substantial role in the determination of mre than on the pacific slope where precipitation is relatively limited to the mountainous interior and decreases westward this is evident by the general increase of mre with swse on the caribbean slope while samples along the central pacific coast of costa rica with swses 100 m asl have some of the highest mres in the region 2000 m asl fig 5 the mre and mce relationship was further examined by assessing potential correlations between the mre mce ratio and other catchment properties the ratio of mre to mce trends positively on the pacific slope but negatively on the caribbean slope with catchment size swse and relief α 0 05 suggesting that catchment properties strongly influence the mre mce relationship likely because these variables are directly related to the mce p 0 05 size and 0 001 swse relief for both slopes in any case the mechanisms underlying the relationships observed here merit additional consideration beyond this study 5 conclusions this research investigated the utility of implementing isotopic comparisons of surface water samples and interpolated precipitation within a bayesian framework which considered both the uncertainty in isotopic compositions as well as the potential for evaporative enrichment of the samples to estimate the mre of water sources in central america bayesian mre estimates were found to be on average lower than estimates provided by the more simple isoscape approach yamanaka and yamada 2017 and the traditional isotopic lapse rate method sánchez murillo et al 2020 neither of which account for isotopic uncertainties or deviations caused by fractionating phase changes all isotope based methods resulted in mres higher than samples precipitation weighted mean catchment elevations cmepw which can approximate the actual mre but the differences between mre estimates and cmepw are on average smaller when mres are estimated using the bayesian approach these results demonstrate that the effects of isotopic uncertainty incorporation and evaporative correction in isotope based mre determination are significant mres demonstrate a clear difference in patterns of recharge for the pacific and caribbean slopes surface water sources on the pacific slope are generally recharged at higher elevations relative to the source mce while those on the caribbean slope are largely recharged at elevations lower than the source mce the difference is attributed to the westward direction of moisture transport from the caribbean sea orographic uplift and rainout on the caribbean slope and rain shadow on the pacific slope the orographic effect on recharge was quantified and can be used to estimate the mre of other regional water sources based only on knowledge of the source mce although including information regarding another catchment property such as catchment size minimum catchment elevation swse or catchment relief improves estimations because these variables influence the mre mce relationship the disparities between mre and swse were higher on the pacific slope where most of the region s population is concentrated confirming the importance of protecting upland areas as critical recharge zones while this study revealed meaningful patterns that can contribute to the current understanding of recharge in the central america region some factors in the developed approach to mre estimation had the potential to introduce errors interpolation errors associated with the precipitation model are one important factor to consider since the most significant model errors are all associated with sites on the pacific slope fig 4 one possible explanation could be that the model does not directly account for the precipitation amount effect the amount effect has been identified as a dominant control on isotopic compositions of rainfall in the region particularly on the pacific slope of costa rica sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 and panama lachniet and patterson 2006 still the model performed reasonably well with maes smaller than those resulting from the global oipc model bowen 2017 bowen and revenaugh 2003 and similar to those of other regional models over complex terrain yamanaka et al 2015 yamanaka and yamada 2017 another limitation of this study is the disproportionate distribution of regional data with the exception of costa rica data from central american countries is sparse and largely constrained to the pacific slope sampling efforts have historically been concentrated on the pacific slope according to population distributions but given that the caribbean sea is the primary moisture source to the region isotope data from the caribbean slope is also relevant sánchez murillo et al 2020 in this case additional caribbean data would facilitate a more robust comparison between recharge patterns and controls of the two domains it is therefore reasonable to argue that further sampling efforts from both domains are needed as additional data from the pacific domain could help resolve precipitation model error finally there are a number of other factors beyond evaporation that could potentially affect the isotopic compositions of water sources and should be considered when applying the methods developed here these include seawater intrusion especially where coastal aquifers are overdrawn to provide for urban populations ballestero et al 2007 ferguson and gleeson 2012 as well as the large scale movement of groundwaters grasby and chen 2005 in this study samples that were collected within 1 km of coastlines were removed prior to analysis to avoid potential impacts of seawater intrusion overall the findings of this study have contributed to an enhanced understanding of recharge in central america estimated mres may be incorporated into gis based analyses or runoff or groundwater flow models to chart recharge areas with greater reliability yamanaka and yamada 2017 furthermore these flow models could be coupled with downscaled global climate models to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on the region s water resources scibek and allen 2006 the quantified mre catchment property relationships may be used by governmental institutions to extrapolate the mre of other water resources in the region ultimately leading to enhanced water resources management however future research should aim to further validate these models when more isotope data especially from the caribbean domain are available a comparison of bayesian mre estimates with recharge weighted mre would be informative in this regard and et mapping for the determination of recharge flux may be facilitated via the coupling of process based models with remote sensing data liu et al 2003 finally the higher recharge elevations and larger differences between mre and swse on the pacific slope where the majority of the population lives imply that this information can be used to promote awareness among people of their dependence on mountains for water supply and clarify the importance of establishing protections for the mountainous areas the methods in the assessment presented here can also be applied to other regions where water isotope data are available or can be obtained and can serve as an example of the effectiveness of using spatial models within a bayesian probabilistic framework data availability statement the data that supports the

8290,study region central america study focus knowledge of the mean recharge elevation mre of water resources is important where water resources are vulnerable the purpose of this study was to develop and apply a bayesian approach which incorporates isotopic uncertainties and evaporative effects on isotopic compositions to determine the mre of 680 surface water sources from central america differences were assessed between results from our approach and those from other isotope based methods that do not account for these factors new hydrological insights for the region different mre patterns were identified for pacific and caribbean basins which were characterized by distinct isotopic signatures 1 the pacific slope had recharge occurring at higher elevations relative to the source mean catchment elevation mce and 2 the caribbean slope had recharge largely occurring at elevations lower than the mce these relationships were quantified mrep 1 072 mce 45 65 pacific r2 0 93

elevation isotopic fractionation water resource 1 introduction information regarding spatial distributions of recharge and the factors that control these distributions is essential for water managers in the face of expanding populations rapid urbanization and changes in land use and climate these stressors affect the quantity and quality of water available and therefore can have long lasting social political and environmental implications cosgrove and loucks 2015 mountainous regions are particularly sensitive to hydrologic modifications alexander et al 2007 diaz et al 2003 dodds and oakes 2008 and are often overlooked in policy and management plans due to their complicated topography and hydrological uncertainties such as those associated with runoff and recharge processes and how these processes respond to disturbances ariza et al 2013 křeček and haigh 2019 however these regions contain headwaters distinguished for their role in recharging surface water and groundwater resources křeček and haigh 2000 they supply freshwater to a large portion of the world s population through discharge transported to lower lying areas contributing 20 50 of the total discharge in humid areas and 50 90 in arid regions viviroli and weingartner 2004 and also support approximately one quarter of the world s terrestrial biological diversity spehn et al 2010 as such the characterization of recharge patterns across mountainous regions can help inform conservation and protection practices to ensure adequate freshwater supply and ecosystem services maintenance topographic relief produces distinct gradients in the isotopic signatures of precipitation resulting from the altitude effect or the phenomenon of δ 18o and δ 2h becoming more depleted with increasing elevation dansgaard 1964 consequently stable isotopic lapse rates have been leveraged to provide insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of recharge elevation in many mountainous regions ambach et al 1968 bhat and jeelani 2015 eastoe and towne 2018 gat and dansgaard 1972 gonfiantini et al 2001 jeelani et al 2018 jung et al 2019 koeniger et al 2017 2016 longinelli and selmo 2003 matiatos and alexopoulos 2011 o driscoll et al 2005 paternoster et al 2008 sánchez murillo et al 2016 sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 sappa et al 2018 saravanakumar et al 2010 saylor et al 2009 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 vespasiano et al 2015 winckel et al 2002 yamanaka et al 2015 yamanaka and yamada 2017 zhu et al 2018 the lapse rates are typically determined based on the 18o 16o δ18o and 2h 1h δ2h ratios of precipitation collected at different elevations in the study area as 18o and 2h can vary widely between rainfall events clark and fritz 1997 this method requires sampling over a long period of time at least four years putman et al 2019 and therefore can be inhibited by financial or logistical constraints longinelli and selmo 2003 an alternative approach described as the small spring method vespasiano et al 2015 involves sampling shallow groundwater from springs instead the seasonal changes exhibited by groundwaters are minor so they can be used to constrain the lapse rate in a shorter timeframe i e one year or less sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 however this method is only valid where the groundwater is immature the springs have small upstream catchments and there are small differences between the spring and the recharge elevations further studies have conducted spatial analysis of stable isotopes using geographic information systems gis isoscapes i e isotope landscape mapping bowen 2010 have been shown to provide fairly accurate predictions when derived from the interpolation of geographically distributed isotopic observations or developed by process level models to predict the isotopic composition at a given location bowen and good 2015 models that include parameters relating isotopic compositions to climatic and or geographic variables often outperform space only interpolations e g nearest neighbor inverse distance weighting etc with errors reduced by 10 15 bowen and revenaugh 2003 yamanaka and yamada 2017 thus used multiple regression to construct hydrogen and oxygen precipitation isoscapes for central japan where δ18o and δ2h were functions of latitude longitude and elevation then the models were used to estimate the mean recharge elevations mres of tap water sources unrestricted to mountainous settings different combinations of stable water isotopes δ18o and δ2h other geochemical tracers including 3h 14c and the noble gases he ne ar kr and xe hydrochemical data and physical data have frequently been used together to inform geostatistical techniques lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 machine learning algorithms pourghasemi et al 2020 and simulation models da costa et al 2019 meredith et al 2011 mosase et al 2019 to constrain the spatial distribution of actual or potential groundwater recharge within catchments similar datasets have been combined to characterize factors which influence stream network discharge by identifying sources and seasonal dynamics of surface runoff tetzlaff et al 2007 and river recharge guo et al 2017 and to assess catchment water balances karim and veizer 2002 these combined approaches are often preferable to a single dataset approach because each tracer and physically based method is associated with significant uncertainties hall et al 2020 for example the current methods using stable isotopes do not consider uncertainties in measured isotopic compositions and as these methods have mainly been applied to study groundwater sources secondary processes occurring after precipitation are assumed to be insignificant however evaporative fractionation can occur in the soil during infiltration and affect original isotopic compositions sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 sprenger et al 2017 vespasiano et al 2015 winckel et al 2002 our primary objective was to develop a probabilistic interpretation of the approach outlined in yamanaka and yamada 2017 that captures both the uncertainties in isotopic values as well as potential isotope fractionation due to evaporation first we developed a statistical method for estimating the mre of groundwater and surface water sources by incorporating stable isotopic compositions within a bayesian framework in the surface water context mean recharge elevation refers to instances where precipitation is directly contributing water to streams second we applied our approach to estimate the mre of surface water samples collected from streams in panama costa rica nicaragua honduras and el salvador and examined regional mre patterns as well as relationships between mre and catchment properties third we compared resulting mres to those obtained using simpler isotope based methods the differences between estimated mres and sample elevations were also calculated as justification for improved management of mountainous regions the results can inform governmental institutions and non governmental organizations in central america and raise awareness regarding conservation and protection of critical recharge zones the methods developed here may also contribute to the understanding of recharge dynamics in other regions where isotopically informed geospatial models are becoming robust and more widely applied to improve water resources planning dehaspe et al 2018 jasechko and taylor 2015 taylor et al 2012 villegas et al 2018 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the central american countries of panama costa rica nicaragua honduras and el salvador are located between 7 and 16 n latitude and 77 and 90 w longitude fig 1 these countries constitute 74 87 of the total land area and 65 of the total population of central america central america has a total land area just over 524 000 km2 and is home to more than 47 million people over 27 million people currently live in urban areas mainly in the pacific domain but at modern rates of population growth and urbanization an additional 25 million are predicted to live in cities by 2050 maria et al 2017 although there have always been restrictions on certain high risk activities in recharge areas deliberations to regulate urban expansion in these areas are incipient many of the region s surface water resources are already degraded due to indiscriminate urban and industrial waste disposal as well as uncontrolled agricultural related activities such as deforestation castillo et al 1997 parello et al 2008 silva et al 2015 as a result the region is highly dependent on groundwater extraction estimated at 1 9 1010 m3yr 1 however virtually all of the aquifers supplying central american metropolitan areas indicate overexploitation ballestero et al 2007 the region is also characterized by an unequal distribution of water both spatially and temporally a volcanic arc that extends north to south across the region divides central america into pacific and caribbean draining basins the caribbean slope drains 70 of the region and has the largest rivers and watersheds however 70 of the population lives on the pacific slope where there is higher economic activity leonard 1987 on the pacific slope heavy rains and river flows occur mainly between may and november the beginning of the rainy season in may is associated with the latitudinal migration of the intertropical convergence zone itcz over the central america region which leads to the development of convective activity and cyclonic circulation by july and august the itcz has moved north of the region causing precipitation to decrease along the pacific coast known as the mid summer drought or msd at the same time precipitation increases to a maximum along the caribbean slope resulting from orographic forcing of caribbean sourced moisture transported directly across the region by the northeast trade winds magaña et al 1999 the caribbean sea provides the dominant source of moisture to the region durán quesada et al 2010 so that the caribbean slope experiences a relatively homogeneous precipitation regime throughout the year it receives greater annual rainfall than the pacific slope which experiences a rain shadow effect due to the presence of the central mountain range these contrasting precipitation modes reflect the interaction of sea surface temperatures ssts air circulation processes and topography which are the primary controls on regional climate sáenz and durán quesada 2015 taylor and alfaro 2005 temperature varies from the coastal lowlands to the mountains but seasonal fluctuations in temperature are low 3 c regional climate projections suggest the following changes by 2050 1 a rainfall decrease 10 25 during the wet season i e may to november imbach et al 2018 2 a spatial extension of the area affected by the msd magaña et al 1999 maldonado et al 2013 maurer et al 2017 and 3 positive trends in temperature and dry extreme events resulting in a net decrease of water availability imbach et al 2018 2 2 stable isotope datasets stable isotope archives comprised of averaged annual amount weighted precipitation ratios from 73 sites and averaged surface water ratios from 677 sites across costa rica nicaragua honduras el salvador and panama were compiled from recent studies sánchez murillo et al 2020 2016 2013 sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 a detailed description of these archives was provided by sánchez murillo et al 2020 new stable isotope data of precipitation n 54 monthly composite samples from 5 sites and surface waters n 37 monthly samples from 3 sites were collected in panama from july 2017 to july 2018 rainfall totalizers were crafted to collect and preserve rainfall within the monthly period iaea 2014 each totalizer consisted of a 6 cm radius funnel and a 1 l high density polyethylene hdpe collection bottle calculated d excess values were in agreement with the archived data values which range from 2 9 to 14 4 collection bottles were emptied into 5 l hdpe accumulation bottles which were stored at room temperature until the end of the month then a portion of the cumulative rainfall was transferred to a 16 ml glass e c borosilicate sample bottle wheaton science products usa sample bottles were sealed with parafilm and labeled with the site s name and the amount of precipitation collected for that month calculated as ppt mm 10 v πrf 2 where v is water volume collected ml and rf is funnel radius cm the annual amount weighted ratio δ p a w for each new precipitation site was calculated as 1 δ p a w i 1 n p i δ x p i i 1 n p i where n is the number of months pi is the monthly precipitation and δxp i is the δ2h or δ18o composition of precipitation for the i th month surface water samples were collected from streams only at flowing sections to circumvent evaporative signals and base flow conditions were targeted to ensure that the sample was representative of cumulative upstream outflow sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 the annual amount weighted precipitation isotope ratio for each surface water site was calculated fig 1 indicates the locations of precipitation and surface water sites within the study area there were 56 precipitation and 408 surface water sampling sites in the pacific domain and 22 precipitation and 272 surface water sampling sites in the caribbean domain isotopic signatures at each site were tested against the standard normal distribution fig 2 illustrates the distributions of δ18o in precipitation a and surface waters b as well as the relationships between δ18o and δ2h in precipitation c and surface waters d for both slopes i e pacific and caribbean the new samples from panama were analyzed at oregon state university using a cavity ring down spectroscopy crds isotope analyzer l2120 i picarro usa all isotopic compositions were expressed in δ notation δ r rstd 1 where r is the ratio of rare to abundant isotopes in the sample and rstd is the ratio of rare to abundant isotopes in vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow all δ values were reported in per mil parts per thousand laboratory standards established using mass spectrometer measurements of florida δ2h 3 56 δ18o 0 95 and boulder δ2h 120 68 δ18o 16 00 tap waters were used to normalize the results to the vsmow vslap scale each sample was injected six times to compensate for memory effects and the final three injections were averaged after correction to provide the measurement the average analytical precision was 0 20 1σ for δ2h and 0 05 1σ for δ18o 2 3 precipitation isotope ratio model multivariate regression models were constructed for δ2h and δ18o using the annual amount weighted precipitation isotope ratios following yamanaka and yamada 2017 the models included longitude x latitude y and elevation z of precipitation sites as potential explanatory variables for δ polynomial forms of the longitude latitude and elevation terms x x 2 x 3 y y 2 y 3 z z 2 z 3 were evaluated because the relationship between these variables and δ is not always linear yamanaka et al 2015 interaction terms xy xz yz were also assessed to gain an understanding of variable inter relationships and their effect on δ 2 4 catchment extraction catchments for each surface water sample were obtained using 30 arc second grid cells of approximately 1 km2 hydrosheds data lehner et al 2008 within pysheds 0 2 6 a python package designed for watershed delimitation stream network extraction and determination of flow direction and accumulation the longitude and latitude of each surface water site was employed as an outlet point to delineate the total upstream area contributing water flow to that point the coordinates were directed to snap to the nearest cell having more than 20 upstream places this criterion was included to adjust for any inaccuracies associated with input data i e sample longitude latitude and elevation that could result in an outlet point input not intersecting an actual water source once a catchment was delineated all of the locations lj composed of xj yj and zj within it were extracted and catchment properties including a mean catchment longitude xj latitude yj and elevation zj were calculated then for each catchment location lj xj yj zj an annual amount weighted precipitation isotopic composition δ ˆ p a w j was predicted using the precipitation model 2 5 assumptions in the mean recharge elevation assessment 2 5 1 steady state evaporation the likelihood that the measured isotopic composition of a surface water sample was consistent with the isotopic composition of precipitation predicted at each location in its catchment was assessed within a bayesian framework good et al 2014 following yamanaka and yamada 2017 it was assumed that the isotopic composition of surface water samples taken from different sources reflects approximately that of precipitation at their recharge areas plus δ which represents the isotope fractionation that occurs as a result of phase changes δs δp δ when there is a phase change the heavy and light isotopes are partitioned relatively between the two phases during evaporation the light h and o isotopes are lost from the liquid water body preferentially and the remaining water becomes enriched in the heavier isotopes this evaporative enrichment occurs along a slope which deviates from that of the global meteoric water line gibson et al 2008 the evaporation line g was defined as a function providing the δ2h value for a given δ18o value of t 2 g t x p j y p j x j y j y j y p j x j x p j t x p j y p j where the first parenthesized term on the right hand side of the equation is the slope xp j and yp j are the δ18o and δ2h values of predicted precipitation at location j and x j and y j are the limiting δ18o and δ2h values of an evaporating water body under local climatological conditions e g the final isotopic composition of the water sample as its volume approaches zero at location j the limiting isotopic composition was calculated as 3 δ h δ a ε h ε 10 3 where ε is the total isotopic separation factor that includes both equilibrium and kinetic components h is often assumed to be the relative humidity and δ a is the atmospheric composition of vapor gibson et al 2016 gibson and edwards 2002 values for δ a were estimated assuming isotopic equilibrium between atmospheric vapor and precipitation since global scale isotopic measurements of water vapor at ground level have revealed for most cases vapor precipitation equilibrium is maintained over continental masses araguás araguás et al 2000 4 δ a δ p ε 1 10 3 ε 1000 δ p α 1000 where ε is the equilibrium isotopic separation α is the equilibrium fractionation and ε is related to α by ε α 1 1000 gibson et al 2016 gibson and edwards 2002 if the vapor and precipitation are in equilibrium their isotopic exchange reaction rates are well known for a given temperature the ε h and δ a parameters used to determine limiting isotopic compositions were calculated using gridded worldclim 2 data of average and minimum temperature at a 30 arc second resolution fick and hijmans 2017 given the humid conditions of the region minimum temperature could be used as a proxy for dew point in h calculations gunawardhana et al 2017 2 5 2 precipitation precipitation and its limiting composition at each

determine the conditional probability of events based on prior knowledge of the conditions that might be relevant to the event as it shows the relationship between a conditional probability and its reverse form it can be used to invert a conditional probability in this study the likelihood that a surface water sample recharged at a particular location within its catchment was assessed through an approach modified from good et al 2014 and kennedy et al 2011 7 p l j δ s p δ s l j p l j p δ s l j p l j where the posterior distribution p l j δ s expresses the probability that a particular catchment location l j with a normal predicted precipitation distribution dpj served as the location of recharge for a collected surface water sample δs with a normal sample distribution ds the prior probability distribution p lj defines the probability of that location within the catchment in this case prior knowledge assumed that every location has equal likelihood of occurrence the conditional probability p δ s l j is the probability of obtaining the surface water sample δs with a normal sample distribution ds given the location l j with a normal predicted precipitation distribution dpj the

masses are mainly carried from the caribbean sea in a south west direction by the trade winds both the x and y terms can represent the continental effect where δ18o and δ2h decrease inland from the coast no latitude effect has been reported in the humid tropics however in panama a pseudo latitude effect results from the collinearity of latitude with distance from the caribbean sea lachniet and patterson 2006 fit model term coefficients are shown in table 1 these models can estimate the isotopic composition of regional precipitation with mean absolute errors of 6 60 for δ2h r2 adjusted 0 54 and 0 80 for δ18o r2 adjusted 0 57 the most significant errors 2 0 for δ18o are associated with sites located in nw costa rica along the pacific slope of the mountainous divide fig 4 a region characterized by relatively small precipitation events and large secondary evaporation processes in order to further examine the performance of our precipitation model the online isotopes in precipitation calculator oipc bowen 2017 bowen and revenaugh 2003 was also used to determine mean annual δ18o and δ2h values for the locations associated with precipitation samples and model errors were compared the oipc estimates δ18o and δ2h based on the interpolation of global data derived primarily from the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip database iaea wmo 2015 and the interpolation is based on a composite model that includes latitude and altitude parameters to represent temperature effects as well as a distance weighting parameter to account for variability in δ18o and δ2h not resolved by the other parameters bowen and revenaugh 2003 the opic predicted regional precipitation compositions with mean absolute errors of 11 11 for δ2h and 1 37 for δ18o 3 2 mean recharge elevations the model predicted δ18o and δ2h values for the locations in a sample s catchment were used to evaluate the probabilities that each location served as a location of recharge enabling the calculation of the sample s mre fig 5 the mre for 46 5 316 of the surface water samples was higher than 1000 m asl of the 316 samples recharged above 1000 m asl 235 74 4 were derived from a pacific catchment additionally the mre for 13 1 89 of the surface water samples was higher than 2000 m asl with 72 of the 89 80 9 having been derived from a pacific catchment those surface water sources recharged above 2000 m asl were all located in the mountainous interior of northeast panama and costa rica and along the pacific coast of costa rica the elevational distribution of mre for surface water sources by slope is shown in fig 6 while the mre of pacific samples was widely distributed across different elevations 50 4 137 of the caribbean samples representing 20 1 of all 680 samples recharged at an elevation below 500 m asl the distributions of mre swse and the differences between mre and swse zmre swse by slope are compared in fig 7 mres and swses were higher on the pacific slope and the average difference between mres and swses on the pacific slope 531 2 m was 78 7 m higher than on the caribbean slope 452 5 m 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of mre uncertainties one advantage of the bayesian approach implemented in this study was the ability to assess the uncertainties associated with the mre estimates the standard deviations of the recharge elevations sdres range from 0 to 823 m with a mean value of 241 m the lowest sdres generally 241 m were associated with the mre estimates of samples from el salvador σmean 158 m honduras σmean 187 m nicaragua σmean 178 m and panama σmean 198 m meanwhile the mre estimates of samples from both pacific and caribbean domains of costa rica are associated with higher sdres σmean 286 m fig 8 significant trends p 0 0001 of sdre with mean catchment elevation and catchment relief defined as zmax zmin were found for both slopes across the region suggesting that the complex topography may help explain the observed spatial variability in sdre it is possible our precipitation model s assumption of a spatially uniform isotopic lapse rate could be a cause of greater sdre altitude effects have been found to differ for pacific versus caribbean domains in countries within and near the study area with isotopic lapse rates varying between 0 50 to 1 9 km 1 on the pacific slope while increasing up to 2 4 km 1 on the caribbean slope lachniet et al 2007 lachniet and patterson 2009 perez et al 2015 sánchez murillo et al 2020 wassenaar et al 2009 as sdre was found to correlate strongly with sampling elevation only on the caribbean slope and with catchment size only on the pacific slope the mechanisms responsible for spatial variations in mre uncertainty may ultimately vary depending on domain and warrant further investigation 4 2 cross validation of mre estimates in order to examine how mres have changed with the incorporation of bayesian probabilities the mres of surface water samples were also estimated using the isoscape approach presented in yamanaka and yamada 2017 hereafter yy17 the yy17 approach estimates mres using a regional isotopic lapse rate γ km 1 corresponding to the c0 model parameter in eq 14 and isotopic shift δ 15 mr e yy 17 10 3 δ s w δ p δ γ where δ s w is the measured δ18o or δ2h of the surface water sample and δ p is the sea level δ18o or δ2h value of precipitation at given coordinates the δ p parameter is derived from the precipitation model 16 δ p δ ˆ p a w γz 10 3 c 1 y 3 c 2 y 2 c 3 y c 4 x 2 c 5 x c 6 x y c 7 and the δ parameter is optimized via iteration so as to minimize the differences between annual precipitation weighted mean catchment elevations mcepw and estimated mres although the optimized case only improved the differences by 15 50 m relative to the case assuming δ 0 in the yy17 study mcepw is used as a proxy for recharge weighted mre where recharge flux precipitation minus evapotranspiration cannot be determined due to uncertainties associated with estimating evapotranspiration bayesian mre values are on average 503 δ18o based and 391 δ2h based m lower than mres resulting from the yy17 approach assuming no isotopic shift occurred and 539 δ18o based and 425 δ2h based m lower than the yy17 approach with optimized δ values the incorporation of regional δ values for δ18o and δ2h in the yy17 approach only affected the differences between samples mre estimates and mcepw by 6 67 m however the differences between yy17 derived mres and mcepws were generally much larger than those between bayesian derived mres and mcepws fig 9 the bayesian approach produces estimates of mre that are on average 69 m higher than sample mcepw s together these trends illustrate how regional isotope data will yield mres that are higher than samples mcepw they further demonstrate how an isotopic lapse rate based method that does not also consider probabilities across a sample s catchment in the process of mre determination will result in estimates less proximate to the sample s mcepw bayesian mre estimates for surface water samples from the pacific slope of costa rica nicaragua honduras and el salvador were also compared on a broad scale to those from sanchez murillo et al 2020 where mres for pacific ground water samples were calculated using a simple isotopic lapse rate method with no account for the potential effects of evaporative enrichment on isotopic compositions of the water samples since surface water samples for this study were collected from streams during base flow conditions the patterns observed here can be representative of regional groundwater recharge as well sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 median mres for the pacific domain of each country using the bayesian and lapse rate based approaches are compared in table 2 with the exception of honduras countries median mres are again much lower according to the bayesian approach supporting the notion that the bayesian statistical analysis will result in lower mre estimates relative to the other isotope based approaches assessed here the δ18o isotopic lapse rate of 1 48 km 1 derived from the precipitation model and used here in the probabilistic assessment of mres was similar to the regional isotopic lapse rate of 1 0 km 1 which was used to estimate mres in sánchez murillo et al 2020 it should be noted since the lapse rate from sánchez murillo et al 2020 was partially constructed using isotope data from historical rainfall stations it is possible some of the ratios were affected by improper collection therefore the lapse rate of 1 0 km 1 is likely lower than it would be based solely on more recent and robust monitoring sites and it can be inferred that the additional constraints provided by the incorporation of isotopic uncertainties and evaporative effects are significant 4 3 mre and catchment properties in this study patterns of mre were interpreted by assessing the relationship between mre and catchment properties including mean catchment longitude mean catchment latitude mean catchment elevation minimum catchment elevation swse catchment relief and catchment size changes in mre with mean catchment longitude and latitude appear to reflect changes in swse i e larger smaller mres are associated with sampling locations of higher lower elevations p 0 001 for both slopes a comparison of mre and mean catchment elevation mce demonstrates that samples collected from the pacific slope generally have a mre close to or above the mce while samples collected from the caribbean slope tend to have a mre near or below the mce fig 10 it is likely that these different relationships between mre and mce for the pacific and caribbean slopes are related to the distinct precipitation regimes characterizing them previous studies have identified two main sources of moisture for central america durán quesada et al 2010 lachniet et al 2007 maldonado 2017 the caribbean sea is the dominant contributor of moisture while southern central america specifically pacific coastal sites in costa rica and panama also receive moisture originating from the eastern equatorial pacific in the form of intense convective rainfall when the northeast trade winds are weak the majority of the moisture that leaves the pacific is lost over the ocean so its contributions to the region are low relative to the caribbean sea the trade winds transport moisture directly from the caribbean sea over the caribbean slope and the moisture undergoes orographic uplift and rainout consequently the caribbean slope experiences a relatively homogeneous precipitation regime and recharge may occur largely below the mce on the pacific slope air masses become progressively warmer and drier as they advance westward and descend so that what little moisture remains once the air masses have traversed the mountains can be expected to precipitate and recharge water sources at an elevation higher than the mce the orographic effect on mre can be quantified as simple linear regressions 17a m r e p 1 072 m c e 45 65 17b m r e c 0 9493 m c e 28 24 with coefficients of determination r2 0 93 pacific and 0 83 caribbean and mean absolute errors maes 144 m pacific and 190 m caribbean including another catchment property catchment size minimum catchment elevation catchment relief as an additional predictor variable in the models yields improvement in mre projections but including more than one additional predictor variable beyond mce does not relief was the catchment property that most improved the models 18a m r e p 1 016 m c e 0 2693 r e l i e f 151 49 18b m r e c 1 110 m c e 0 1311 r e l i e f 64 25 with r2 adjusted 0 97 mae 97 m pacific and r2 adjusted 0 90 mae 137 m caribbean the improvement is greater on the caribbean slope since rainfall is more evenly distributed across the caribbean slope catchment properties may play a more substantial role in the determination of mre than on the pacific slope where precipitation is relatively limited to the mountainous interior and decreases westward this is evident by the general increase of mre with swse on the caribbean slope while samples along the central pacific coast of costa rica with swses 100 m asl have some of the highest mres in the region 2000 m asl fig 5 the mre and mce relationship was further examined by assessing potential correlations between the mre mce ratio and other catchment properties the ratio of mre to mce trends positively on the pacific slope but negatively on the caribbean slope with catchment size swse and relief α 0 05 suggesting that catchment properties strongly influence the mre mce relationship likely because these variables are directly related to the mce p 0 05 size and 0 001 swse relief for both slopes in any case the mechanisms underlying the relationships observed here merit additional consideration beyond this study 5 conclusions this research investigated the utility of implementing isotopic comparisons of surface water samples and interpolated precipitation within a bayesian framework which considered both the uncertainty in isotopic compositions as well as the potential for evaporative enrichment of the samples to estimate the mre of water sources in central america bayesian mre estimates were found to be on average lower than estimates provided by the more simple isoscape approach yamanaka and yamada 2017 and the traditional isotopic lapse rate method sánchez murillo et al 2020 neither of which account for isotopic uncertainties or deviations caused by fractionating phase changes all isotope based methods resulted in mres higher than samples precipitation weighted mean catchment elevations cmepw which can approximate the actual mre but the differences between mre estimates and cmepw are on average smaller when mres are estimated using the bayesian approach these results demonstrate that the effects of isotopic uncertainty incorporation and evaporative correction in isotope based mre determination are significant mres demonstrate a clear difference in patterns of recharge for the pacific and caribbean slopes surface water sources on the pacific slope are generally recharged at higher elevations relative to the source mce while those on the caribbean slope are largely recharged at elevations lower than the source mce the difference is attributed to the westward direction of moisture transport from the caribbean sea orographic uplift and rainout on the caribbean slope and rain shadow on the pacific slope the orographic effect on recharge was quantified and can be used to estimate the mre of other regional water sources based only on knowledge of the source mce although including information regarding another catchment property such as catchment size minimum catchment elevation swse or catchment relief improves estimations because these variables influence the mre mce relationship the disparities between mre and swse were higher on the pacific slope where most of the region s population is concentrated confirming the importance of protecting upland areas as critical recharge zones while this study revealed meaningful patterns that can contribute to the current understanding of recharge in the central america region some factors in the developed approach to mre estimation had the potential to introduce errors interpolation errors associated with the precipitation model are one important factor to consider since the most significant model errors are all associated with sites on the pacific slope fig 4 one possible explanation could be that the model does not directly account for the precipitation amount effect the amount effect has been identified as a dominant control on isotopic compositions of rainfall in the region particularly on the pacific slope of costa rica sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 and panama lachniet and patterson 2006 still the model performed reasonably well with maes smaller than those resulting from the global oipc model bowen 2017 bowen and revenaugh 2003 and similar to those of other regional models over complex terrain yamanaka et al 2015 yamanaka and yamada 2017 another limitation of this study is the disproportionate distribution of regional data with the exception of costa rica data from central american countries is sparse and largely constrained to the pacific slope sampling efforts have historically been concentrated on the pacific slope according to population distributions but given that the caribbean sea is the primary moisture source to the region isotope data from the caribbean slope is also relevant sánchez murillo et al 2020 in this case additional caribbean data would facilitate a more robust comparison between recharge patterns and controls of the two domains it is therefore reasonable to argue that further sampling efforts from both domains are needed as additional data from the pacific domain could help resolve precipitation model error finally there are a number of other factors beyond evaporation that could potentially affect the isotopic compositions of water sources and should be considered when applying the methods developed here these include seawater intrusion especially where coastal aquifers are overdrawn to provide for urban populations ballestero et al 2007 ferguson and gleeson 2012 as well as the large scale movement of groundwaters grasby and chen 2005 in this study samples that were collected within 1 km of coastlines were removed prior to analysis to avoid potential impacts of seawater intrusion overall the findings of this study have contributed to an enhanced understanding of recharge in central america estimated mres may be incorporated into gis based analyses or runoff or groundwater flow models to chart recharge areas with greater reliability yamanaka and yamada 2017 furthermore these flow models could be coupled with downscaled global climate models to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on the region s water resources scibek and allen 2006 the quantified mre catchment property relationships may be used by governmental institutions to extrapolate the mre of other water resources in the region ultimately leading to enhanced water resources management however future research should aim to further validate these models when more isotope data especially from the caribbean domain are available a comparison of bayesian mre estimates with recharge weighted mre would be informative in this regard and et mapping for the determination of recharge flux may be facilitated via the coupling of process based models with remote sensing data liu et al 2003 finally the higher recharge elevations and larger differences between mre and swse on the pacific slope where the majority of the population lives imply that this information can be used to promote awareness among people of their dependence on mountains for water supply and clarify the importance of establishing protections for the mountainous areas the methods in the assessment presented here can also be applied to other regions where water isotope data are available or can be obtained and can serve as an example of the effectiveness of using spatial models within a bayesian probabilistic framework data availability statement the data that supports the

the predictive ability of streamflow rate no demand to carry out merging mswep with sparsely located gauged rainfall rather bias correction of mswep in the simulation of crest improves the performance to capture the observed streamflow of the upper blue nile basin keywords crest satellite precipitation merging bias correction mswep upper blue nile 1 introduction precipitation is a key process in the hydrological cycle the quality of precipitation data is of high importance to hydrologists as precipitation uncertainty is the most influential cause of uncertainty in hydrological simulation as such it is significant to accurately quantify the precipitation rate for reliable hydrological applications abera et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the accurate measurement of precipitation is using rain gauges at the ground however the gauges are sparsely located with poor network coverage to measure the precipitation on the ground especially the network and the quality of data is very poor in africa including ethiopia acpc 2011 to overcome this problem different global satellite and the recently released reanalysis precipitation products have been emerged with high spatial and temporal resolutions these high spatial temporal resolution satellite based precipitation estimates spe and reanalysis are becoming valuable alternative rainfall data for hydrologic and climatic studies these global products are now available from various agencies and institutions for example climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi sensor precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf from reanalysis products persson and grazzini 2007 and multi sources weighted ensemble precipitation beck et al 2017 due to the indirect nature of satellite measurements these products are subject to considerable uncertainty and have gaps to estimate the observed rainfall measured at the ground as well they have their errors in reproducing streamflow hydrographs it is also well known that satellite rainfall values are estimates that are subject to a variety of error sources e g gaps in revisit times a poor direct relationship between remotely sensed signals and rainfall rate and atmospheric effects that modify the radiation field and require a thorough validation dinku et al 2007 hirpa et al 2010 the validation of the global precipitation products can be grouped into two categories bitew and gebremichael 2011 hirpa et al 2010 the first is the direct comparison of the satellite rainfall estimates to the rain gauge networks the second is the evaluation of satellite rainfall estimates based on their predictive ability of streamflow rate in a hydrological modelling framework has two advantages one since the evaluation is performed at the watershed scale it is not subject to the scale discrepancy problem that arises when using rain gauge data for validation two the satellite rainfall estimates are evaluated with respect to a specific application such as a driving input variable in a hydrologic model hirpa et al 2010 the validation of the global products research result shows that different remotely sensed products perform differently in several regions globally and needs improvement to estimate the actual measured rainfall on the ground various researches are carried out to evaluate satellite and reanalysis precipitation products for the hydrological simulation for the last 2 decades globally the performance of mswep product is evaluated using hydrological modelling for 9011 catchments 50 000 km2 across the globe the quality of mswep is compared against four state of the art gauge adjusted precipitation p datasets wfdei cru gpcp 1dd tmpa 3b42 and cpc unified mswep obtained a median calibration nsce of 0 52 versus 0 29 0 39 for the other p datasets beck et al 2017 these satellite and reanalysis products are also evaluated in the

product tmpa 3b42 and persiann are assessed in the upper blue nile basin gilgel abbay watershed using the semi distributed swat hydrological model for a short period the result shows that the satellite only product 3b42rt performs much better than the satellite gauge product 3b42 indicating that the algorithm used to incorporate rain gauge information with the goal of improving the accuracy of the satellite rainfall products is actually making the products worse pointing to problems in the algorithm bitew et al 2012 both satellite and reanalysis products are also evaluated at the same watershed of gilgel abbay in the upper blue nile basin lakew et al 2017 three precipitation products of gauge adjusted corrected cmorph trmm tmpa 3b42v7 and ecmwf reanalysis products are

that the mswep precipitation shows consistently better performance than from the rest of precipitation products though different researches are carried out globally to evaluate the precipitation products findings that can improve the performance of precipitation products for the predictive ability of the streamflow magnitude should be encouraged to improve the performance of remotely sensed precipitation to estimate the observed rainfall on the ground remotely sensed precipitations are being merged with observed rainfall effective merging of spe and ground based gauge measurements may help to improve precipitation estimation in both better resolution and accuracy since the late 1990s researchers started to put efforts into combining satellite gauge precipitation data the early successful work was the global precipitation climatology project gpcp which constructed a relatively coarse resolution monthly 2 5 2 5 global precipitation dataset adler et al 2003 huffman et al 2007 this research mainly aims to investigate the effectiveness of bias correction and merging mswep precipitation product using gauged rainfall and streamflow data for the hydrological modelling of the upper blue nile basin a framework for merging mswep precipitation with the gauge observation is developed to improve the quality of mswep precipitation data for hydrological simulation besides mswep is bias corrected using rainfall factor adjustment by tweaking the rainfall adjustment factor parameter during the simulation the bias correction of mswep precipitation using streamflow doing hydrology backwards approach kirchner 2009 is performed here by tweaking the rainfall adjustment factor parameter of the crest hydrology model this method is practised and applied in different studies using different global precipitation products for the hydrological simulation beck et al 2020 henn et al 2018 2015 krier et al 2012 the comparison made between the two simulated flows obtained from the merged and bias correction of mswep global precipitation product specifically to investigate the effectiveness of merging and bias correction of mswep precipitation product using gauged rainfall

the nile river as it contributes about 60 of the annual total nile discharge di baldassarre et al 2011 jung et al 2017 the basin is considered as the lifeline for 250 million people and contributes 50 gm3 year 1 of water to the nile river dile et al 2018 it is also the most important basin in the country by most criteria as it contributes about 45 of the country s surface water resources

plain flatter area on the north west part and highly elevated mountains on the other parts of the basin with elevation ranging between 503 and 4176 m the mean annual streamflow of eldiem at the outlet

magnitude generally peak in july and august its inter annual variability is greatest at the beginning and end of the rainy season in june and september the proximal driver of rainfall in the headwaters of the blue nile is the northward and southward movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz the itcz s migration to the north in the summer months brings convective activity to the basin with moist air masses from the south and the west conway 2000 and potentially the north and the east as well viste and sorteberg 2011 to the east and southeast southwest monsoon winds over the arabian sea a strong cross equatorial flow along the east african coast and over the adjacent ocean and southeasterly trade winds in the southern hemisphere dominate lower atmosphere circulations di

temporal and 0 25 spatial resolutions beck et al 2017 the dataset is unique in that it takes advantage of a wide range of data sources including gauges satellites and atmospheric reanalysis models to obtain the best possible precipitation estimates at a global scale mswep 3 hly 0 25 global gridded precipitation data used 13 762 stations with high quality and consistent observed set of data across the globe for the bias correction beck et al 2017 in ethiopia especially in the upper blue nile basin almost insignificant number of stations were only considered for the global bias correction that is due to the sparse nature of the stations as well as the length of the data needed 1979 2015 for this study the 3 hly precipitation data are aggregated into a daily temporal scale for the simulation of daily flow and 126 gauging stations were used for the investigation of the merging techniques and bias correction from 2000 to 2012 2 3 bias adjustment and merging techniques the qm gw approach is carried out based on a quantile mapping qm technique and a gaussian weighting gw interpolation scheme for the bias adjustment and merging procedures which is based mainly on qm yang et al 2016 quantile mapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climate models and they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations cannon et al 2015 the method and procedure of the qm gw approach used in this study are directly taken and found in yang et al 2016 the qm approach is used to primarily correct the original ori mswep precipitation estimates using cumulative distribution function cdfs calculated from the gauge and mswep estimation at every 0 25 0 25 box area the gw interpolation aims to grid the adjusted mswep adj rainfall series at satellite pixels 0 25 0 25 based on the bias corrected estimates the adj mswep daily rainfall 0 25 0 25 r i t from daily satellite estimation is calculated from daily ori mswep rainfall r i t at a given satellite pixel i at 0 25 0 25 resolution and time t as follows yang et al 2016 1 r i t j ω i w i j c d f g j 1 c d f m s w e p j r i t j ω i

boxes near pixel i j ω i are used to obtain bias corrected estimates r i j t based on the nonparametric qm approach the irmse weighting approach is developed to merge the bias adjusted and gridded precipitation datasets based principally on the root mean square errors rmses quantifying uncertainties of the datasets as detailed below yang et al 2017 merged mswep gauge precipitation mer sg is calculated using the following equations 2 r i m e r w s i r s i a d j w g i r g i g r i 3 w s i 1 r m s e s i 1 r m s e s i 1 r m s e g i 4 w g i 1 r m s e g i 1 r m s e s i 1 r m s e g i where r i m

storage crest distributed hydrological model simulates the spatio temporal variation of water and energy fluxes and storages on a regular grid with the grid cell resolution being user defined thereby enabling global and regional scale applications wang et al 2011 crest s distinguishing characteristics include 1 distributed rainfall runoff generation and cell to cell routing 2 coupled runoff generation and routing via three feedback mechanisms including rainfall runoff generation evapotranspiration and sub grid cell routing and 3 representation of sub grid cell variability of soil moisture storage capacity and sub grid cell routing via linear reservoirs the coupling between the runoff generation and routing mechanisms allows detailed and realistic treatment of hydrological variables such as soil moisture furthermore the representation of soil moisture variability and routing processes at the sub grid scale enables the crest model to be readily scalable to multi scale modelling research in this study crest v 2 1 which involves coupled routing scheme based on a fully distributed linear reservoir fdlrr scheme xinyi shen and hong 2014 has been applied for the calibration and simulation of the precipitation product the crest 2 1 has been widely applied and has been proved to be easy and effective however with the development of remote sensing technology crest 2 1 is faced with some new challenges the major drawbacks of the model include i it has some limitations which prevent further and deeper applications of remotely sensed products to assist model calibration simulation and validation ii it supports only one soil layer to describe the tension water storage iii it does not also consider the free water storage and ignores the runoff generation and flow concentration processes of the groundwater this limits the effectiveness of model application to watersheds in which the groundwater plays an important role kan et al 2017 2 4 1 model setup the requirements of data to setup the crest hydrological model is discussed below two types of datasets are required i the geospatial input data which are static in nature and ii the hydrometeorological input data which are dynamic time series the geospatial data with the resolution of 1 km by 1 km resolution digital elevation model dem is extracted from the united states geological survey usgs national elevation dataset ned https www usgs gov the dem is used to derive the geospatial data for crest model such as slope flow direction and flow accumulation and drainage area of the case study the second input consists of the dynamic hydrometeorological datasets lakew et al 2020 the meteorological datasets rainfall pet are geo referenced with the geographic location of the upper blue nile and gridded to the resolution that is consistent with the mswep resolution of 0 25 the process of geo referencing and gridding is carried out using matlab daily time series observed streamflow hydrological dataset is used at the outlet of the basin to calibrate model parameters 2 4 2 calibration and parameters many of the parameters in the crest model are physical and can in principle be estimated from field surveyed data such as soil texture land cover maps and vegetation coverage however in many large basins worldwide and particularly in the african context it is much more difficult to estimate model parameters from ancillary data models need to be trained through calibrated either manually automatically or using combined approaches given observations of rainfall and streamflow wang et al 2011 crest has 12 parameters and the model is calibrated using daily gauged rainfall data sources the observed streamflow data is used as one source of input for the calibration as well as to setup the distributed hydrological model calibration is done from 2000 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2012 automatic calibration has been implemented to estimate the model parameters crest uses shuffle complex evolution university of arizona sce ua automatic kernel algorithm for calibration of the model using in situ gauged rainfall crest directly uses the screen output of sce ua codes in matlab written by duan et al 1992 the objective function value is the nsce of each simulation the parameters that are calibrated using the gauged rainfall except the rainfact are used for the simulation forcing the merged and unmerged mswep global precipitation products table 1 besides another strategy of bias correction for unmerged mswep is carried out this is made by tweaking the rainfact parameter during simulation flow using crest model and evaluation framework to assess the performance is carried out the rainfact tweaked values for both merged and unmerged mswep are 0 71 and 0 78 respectively 2 5 performance evaluation in this study the daily streamflow of gauge observation is used as reference data to evaluate the simulated flow of both gauge merged mswep and the simulated flow by tweaking the rainfall factor bias correction of the unmerged mswep product to evaluate the performance of the simulated flows with the observed flow three statistical metrics are used eq s 7 to 9 as follows first for statistical goodness of fit of simulated streamflow the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 is utilized 7 n s c e 1 q i o q i c 2 q i o q o 2 where q i o is the observed streamflow of the ith day q i c is the global streamflow of ith day and q o is the average of all the daily observed streamflow values if nsce 0 then the model provides no skill in relation to using the observed mean as a predictor and values greater than zero indicating better agreement second the correlation coefficient hereafter cc is used to assess the agreement between the simulated flows and the observed streamflow the value of cc is such that 1 cc 1 8 c c q i o q o q i c q c q i o q o 2 q i c q c 2 where q c is the average of all daily simulated streamflow values third relative bias ratio assesses the systematic bias of the simulated discharge bias is defined as the average difference between the simulated flows and the observed streamflow the value of bias can be positive as well as negative a positive bias indicates overestimation of the observed streamflow amount while a negative bias indicates underestimation of it 9 b i a s q i c q i o q i o 100 3 result and discussion 3 1 rainfall to assess the effectiveness of merging techniques of the global mswep data with the gauged rainfall for the hydrological simulation of the upper blue nile basin the areal rainfall of gauge merged mswep and the unmerged mswep is plotted with the reference of the gauged rainfall for the study period from 2000 to 2012 and shown in fig 2 the result manifests that the areal rainfall of the gauge merged rainfall tries to capture the shape and the magnitude of the gauged rainfall the merging techniques show significant improvement from the unmerged areal rainfall for the hydrological simulation for data scare region however the merged areal rainfall shows a slight underestimation of the gauged rainfall and still needs enhancement to capture the magnitude of the gauged rainfall that is attributable to the sparsely located or less density of the rain gauge stations in the upper blue nile basin to improve the performance of the simulated flow and to minimize the gap to capture the magnitude of gauged rainfall tweaking the rainfact parameter bias correction is carried out for the hydrological simulation the rainfact parameter sensitive which is the multiplier on the precipitation field and the adjustment factor of the precipitation either due to canopy interception or bias increasing the value of the rainfact result in increasing streamflow and vice versa and has a value of greater than zero if the parameter value is greater than one it shows that the average areal rainfall amount that is taken for that watershed underestimate the actual average areal rainfall of the region to capture the observed flow and vice versa lakew et al 2017 the rainfact parameter value is 0 67 table 1 it means the measured rainfall overestimates the actual rainfall because in this study more gauging stations are taken from highlands that have a high amount of rainfall fig 1 and would have the tendency to overestimate the actual rainfall of the basin 3 2 streamflow simulation the simulated streamflow of both merged mswep and the unmerged with rainfall factor adjustment bias correction are compared with the observed streamflow measured data for daily monthly and wet season temporal resolutions the daily comparison result manifests that the simulated flow using rain factor adjustment bias correction shows better performance skill than the gauge merged mswep product as shown in table 2 the nsce performance shows 0 89 and 0 81 for unmerged with rain factor adjustment bias correction and gauge merged of mswep products respectively the bias has a negative value for both simulated flows that indicates that the simulated flows cannot to capture the total volume flow of the basin with an underestimation of the observed streamflow magnitude especially the gauge merged flow has high bias value of 33 2 relative to the bias corrected 12 the bias result manifest that tweaking the rainfall factor for unmerged mswep performs better skill to capture the total flow volume of the basin relative to the merged mswep product for the upper blue nile the cc values show excellent performance for both simulated flows 0 95 these results manifest that for the daily simulated flow the unmerged applying bias correction shows better performance than the gauge merged simulated flow of the mswep product based on nsce and bias performance evaluation criteria the areal mean annual rainfall of the upper blue nile basin for the different rainfall products including unmerged merged and unmerged with bias correction of the mswep precipitation product compared with the observed rainfall during the simulation flow of the basin applying the distributed hydrological model crest the result manifests that from the various products of mswep product the unmerged with bias correction rainfact during simulation improves the performance to capture the observed rainfall than the rest mswep products including the merged mswep product as shown in fig 3 merging mswep product 1230 mm year shows improvement compared to the unmerged mswep 920 mm year product to capture the gauged rainfall 1280 mm year however still the merged mswep product needs further improvement to estimate the gauged rainfall this gap improved by adjusting the rainfall factor during simulation flow applying the crest model by tweaking the rainfact parameter bias correction and shows high performance 1260 mm year to capture the gauged rainfall as compared to the rest mswep products these indicate that in the data scarce region of the upper blue nile basin merging the sparsely located rain gauges rainfall with the global product of mswep doesn t improve the performance for the predictive ability of streamflow rate compared with the bias correction during simulation flow for the daily time series analysis the daily flows for the different precipitation products are plotted using hydrograph including the merged and unmerged mswep bias corrected with the observed streamflow of the upper blue nile basin and shown in fig 4 both merged and unmerged with the bias correction of mswep products strive to capture the shape and the magnitude of the observed streamflow the unmerged with the bias correction rainfact shows better performance form the merged mswep precipitation product the daily hydrograph shows and confirms that tweaking the rainfall factor bias correction during simulation applying crest model is more applicable to estimate the streamflow magnitude and to capture the shape of the hydrograph than merging the sparsely located gauged rainfall with the global mswep product the same with the daily simulated flow the monthly temporal resolution flow is simulated for both merged and unmerged mswep global precipitation product for the upper blue nile basin the result shows that the same with the daily temporal scale the monthly simulated flow of the unmerged simulated flow bias correction provides better performance than the gauge merged mswep global product based on nsce and bias performances evaluation as shown in table 3 the bias result of the monthly simulated flow shows an underestimation of the observed streamflow magnitude with a negative value the merged mswep has high bias value of 33 23 relative to the bias of the unmerged with bias correction 13 1 this indicates that the bias correction simulation of the unmerged mswep performs better skill to estimate the total flow volume of the basin relative to the gauge merged mswep product for the upper blue nile basin the monthly cc performance shows a similar presentation for both simulated flows corresponding to the daily temporal scale 0 95 the result of daily and monthly temporal resolutions performance manifests that the gauge merged mswep shows relatively less performance compared with the simulated flow applying rain factor adjustment bias correction during the simulation this suggests that tweaking the rainfall factor parameter bias correction during simulation is more applicable than merging the gauged rainfall with mswep for both daily and monthly temporal resolutions for the hydrological simulation for the data scare region of the upper blue nile basin for large reservoirs simulations and operations the wet season streamflow computation has significant importance for the analysis and release decision of the reservoirs the flows of the upper blue nile and its tributaries are marked by a mono modal flow pattern with the peak flow in july and august the rainfall is characterized by a highly seasonal pattern with more than 70 falling in 4 months june to september jjas and the peak event occurring in july or august elshamy et al 2009 the streamflow magnitude is directly related to the amount of rainfall and the flow is expected to be a peak at the same time with the peak rainfall is recorded jjas the mean annual streamflow of abbay basin at eldiem varies between 1249 and 1981 m3s 1 and the seasonal mean streamflow in the wet season jjas varies between 2412 and 3344 m3s 1 this indicates that the highest flow of the basin is measured during the four months of jjas and it accounts for 75 of the total annual flow of the river using the data record from 2000 to 2012 therefore it is vital to compute the wet season simulated flow of the upper blue nile basin for different water resources applications especially for reservoir operations based on this the wet season of the four months jjas simulated flow comparison of both merged and bias corrected of mswep global product is carried out the nsce performance result shows that the unmerged mswep applying rainfall factor adjustment during the simulation bias correction shows the better skill of performance 0 80 by far from the gauge merged mswep product 0 43 the same with the nsce performance the bias performance of the gauge merged shows less performance 26 7 relative to the bias corrected mswep applying the rainfall factor adjustment 7 55 as shown in table 4 the negative bias result of the simulated flows indicates an underestimation of the total volume flow magnitude of the basin especially the gauge merged underestimate the basin observed streamflow relative to the bias corrected mswep the wet season cc metric index shows excellent performance skills 0 90 for both simulated flows similar to the daily and monthly temporal resolutions the wet season performance indicates that for reservoir simulation and operation of the upper blue nile basin tweaking the rain factor during the simulation bias correction of the mswep product shows better skill performance and applicable by far from the gauge merged mswep product 4 quantile quantile evaluation the quantile quantile q q plot is a graphical technique for determining if two data sets come from populations with a common distribution a 45 degree reference line is also plotted if the two sets come from a population with the same distribution the points should fall approximately along this reference line wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 the greater the departure from this reference line the greater the evidence for the conclusion that the two data sets come from populations with different distributions or with the same distribution but biased or shifted with the mean fig 5 shows the q q plots of the simulated flow of the gauge merged and bias corrected mswep with a reference line of the observed streamflow for the three temporal resolutions of daily monthly and the wet season of the upper blue nile basin the plot shows that the unmerged mswep simulated flow by tweaking the rainfact parameter bias correction outperforms to estimate the flow quantiles relative to the merged mswep product for the three temporal resolutions as shown in fig 5 generally the q q plot result confirms that for the hydrological simulation of the upper blue nile basin bias correction during simulation shows better performance skill than merging the sparsely located gauging stations with the mswe product for daily monthly and wet seasons temporal resolutions 5 conclusion this research mainly aims to investigate the effectiveness of merging and the bias correction of mswep precipitation product using gauged rainfall data and streamflow for the hydrological modelling of the upper blue nile basin fully distributed hydrological model crest is calibrated from 2000 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2012 the crest model is setup for the upper blue nile basin by calibrating the model parameters using the observed streamflow data at the outlet of the basin between ethiopia and the sudan border two simulated flows are generated using the merged mswep and the bias corrected mswep by tweaking the rainfall factor parameter rainfact applying the setup crest model for the upper blue nile basin the result manifests that the bias correction by tweaking the rainfall factor parameter rainfact during simulation shows better performance than the gauge based merged mswep precipitation product for daily monthly and wet season temporal resolutions especially for wet season flow jjas the bias corrected simulated flow of mswep shows high performance by far from the merged mswep product the wet season nsce performance shows 0 80 and 0 43 for the rain factor adjusted simulated flow bias correction of mswep and merged mswep products respectively this is attributable to the rainfall gauging station is located sparsely throughout the basin the overall result suggests that to improve the simulated performance of the upper blue nile no demand to carry out merging mswep with sparsely located gauged rainfall rather carrying out bias correction by tweaking the rain factor in the simulation of crest improves the performance to

of the merged mswep are 0 81 and 33 2 respectively as well the bias correction for the unmerged mswep shows 0 89 and 12 of nsce and bias performances for daily simulation this suggests that to improve the predictive ability of streamflow rate no demand to carry out merging mswep with sparsely located gauged rainfall rather bias correction of mswep in the simulation of crest improves the performance to capture the observed streamflow of the upper blue nile basin keywords crest satellite precipitation merging bias correction mswep upper blue nile 1 introduction precipitation is a key process in the hydrological cycle the quality of precipitation data is of high importance to hydrologists as precipitation uncertainty is the most influential cause of uncertainty in hydrological simulation as such it is significant to accurately quantify the precipitation rate for reliable hydrological applications abera et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the accurate measurement of precipitation is using rain gauges at the ground however the gauges are sparsely located with poor network coverage to measure the precipitation on the ground especially the network and the quality of data is very poor in africa including ethiopia acpc 2011 to overcome this problem different global satellite and the recently released reanalysis precipitation products have been emerged with high spatial and temporal resolutions these high spatial temporal resolution satellite based precipitation estimates spe and reanalysis are becoming valuable alternative rainfall data for hydrologic and climatic studies these global products are now available from various agencies and institutions for example climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi sensor precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf from reanalysis products persson and grazzini 2007 and multi sources weighted ensemble precipitation beck et al 2017 due to the indirect nature of satellite measurements these products are subject to considerable uncertainty and have gaps to estimate the observed rainfall measured at the ground as well they have their errors in reproducing streamflow hydrographs it is also well known that satellite rainfall values are estimates that are subject to a variety of error sources e g gaps in revisit times a poor direct relationship between remotely sensed signals and rainfall rate and atmospheric effects that modify the radiation field and require a thorough validation dinku et al 2007 hirpa et al 2010 the validation of the global precipitation products can be grouped into two categories bitew and gebremichael 2011 hirpa et al 2010 the first is the direct comparison of the satellite rainfall estimates to the rain gauge networks the second is the evaluation of satellite rainfall estimates based on their predictive ability of streamflow rate in a hydrological modelling framework has two advantages one since the evaluation is performed at the watershed scale it is not subject to the scale discrepancy problem that arises when using rain gauge data for validation two the satellite rainfall estimates are evaluated with respect to a specific application such as a driving input variable in a hydrologic model hirpa et al 2010 the validation of the global products research result shows that different remotely sensed products perform differently in several regions globally and needs improvement to estimate the actual measured rainfall on the ground various researches are carried out to evaluate satellite and reanalysis precipitation products for the hydrological simulation for the last 2 decades globally the performance of mswep product is evaluated using hydrological modelling for 9011 catchments 50 000 km2 across the globe the quality of mswep is compared against four state of the art gauge adjusted precipitation p datasets wfdei cru gpcp 1dd tmpa 3b42 and cpc unified mswep obtained a median calibration nsce of 0 52 versus 0 29 0 39 for the other p datasets beck et al 2017 these satellite and reanalysis products are also evaluated in the

product tmpa 3b42 and persiann are assessed in the upper blue nile basin gilgel abbay watershed using the semi distributed swat hydrological model for a short period the result shows that the satellite only product 3b42rt performs much better than the satellite gauge product 3b42 indicating that the algorithm used to incorporate rain gauge information with the goal of improving the accuracy of the satellite rainfall products is actually making the products worse pointing to problems in the algorithm bitew et al 2012 both satellite and reanalysis products are also evaluated at the same watershed of gilgel abbay in the upper blue nile basin lakew et al 2017 three precipitation products of gauge adjusted corrected cmorph trmm tmpa 3b42v7 and ecmwf reanalysis products are

global precipitation products can provide enough information for water resource management in data scarce regions of upper blue nile basin in addition to the gilgel abbay watershed multiple globally available precipitation products are evaluated over multi scales 1656 199 812 km2 focusing on multi year 2000 2012 are evaluated in the data scarce region of the upper blue nile basin for daily

that the mswep precipitation shows consistently better performance than from the rest of precipitation products though different researches are carried out globally to evaluate the precipitation products findings that can improve the performance of precipitation products for the predictive ability of the streamflow magnitude should be encouraged to improve the performance of remotely sensed precipitation to estimate the observed rainfall on the ground remotely sensed precipitations are being merged with observed rainfall effective merging of spe and ground based gauge measurements may help to improve precipitation estimation in both better resolution and accuracy since the late 1990s researchers started to put efforts into combining satellite gauge precipitation data the early successful work was the global precipitation climatology project gpcp which constructed a relatively coarse resolution monthly 2 5 2 5 global precipitation dataset adler et al 2003 huffman et al 2007 this research mainly aims to investigate the effectiveness of bias correction and merging mswep precipitation product using gauged rainfall and streamflow data for the hydrological modelling of the upper blue nile basin a framework for merging mswep precipitation with the gauge observation is developed to improve the quality of mswep precipitation data for hydrological simulation besides mswep is bias corrected using rainfall factor adjustment by tweaking the rainfall adjustment factor parameter during the simulation the bias correction of mswep precipitation using streamflow doing hydrology backwards approach kirchner 2009 is performed here by tweaking the rainfall adjustment factor parameter of the crest hydrology model this method is practised and applied in different studies using different global precipitation products for the hydrological simulation beck et al 2020 henn et al 2018 2015 krier et al 2012 the comparison made between the two simulated flows obtained from the merged and bias correction of mswep global precipitation product specifically to investigate the effectiveness of merging and bias correction of mswep precipitation product using gauged rainfall

2000 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2012 for the upper blue nile river the eldiem streamflow station at the outlet of upper blue nile abbay basin between the border of ethiopia and sudan is used for the calibration to tune the parameters applying the ground based rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area upper blue nile locally known as abbay is one of the most important tributaries of the nile river as it contributes about 60 of the annual total nile discharge di baldassarre et al 2011 jung et al 2017 the basin is considered as the lifeline for 250 million people and contributes 50 gm3 year 1 of water to the nile river dile et al 2018 it is also the most important basin in the country by most criteria as it contributes about 45 of the country s surface water resources accommodates 25 of the population 20 of the landmass 40 of the nations agricultural product and most of the hydropower and a significant portion of irrigation potential of the country erkossa et al

plain flatter area on the north west part and highly elevated mountains on the other parts of the basin with elevation ranging between 503 and 4176 m the mean annual streamflow of eldiem at the outlet of the basin varies between 1249 and 1981 m3s 1 and the seasonal mean flow in the wet season of the four months jjas varies between 2412 and 3344 m3s 1 notably precipitation and the river streamflow magnitude generally peak in july and august its inter annual variability is greatest at the beginning and end of the rainy season in june and september the proximal driver of rainfall in the headwaters of the blue nile is the northward and southward movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz the itcz s migration to the north in the summer months brings convective activity to the basin with moist air masses from the south and the west conway 2000 and potentially the north and the east as well viste and sorteberg 2011 to the east and southeast southwest monsoon winds over the arabian sea a strong cross equatorial flow along the east african coast and over the adjacent ocean and southeasterly trade winds in the southern hemisphere dominate lower atmosphere circulations di baldassarre et al 2011 pollock et al 2018 while to the west and southwest moist air from the equatorial atlantic ocean and the gulf of guinea is advected across the sahel and the congo into the blue nile basin by low level westerly winds from october through may the itcz shifts southward and dry conditions prevail berhane et al 2014 segele et al 2009 2 2 hydrometeorological data sets 2 2 1 in

obtain the best possible precipitation estimates at a global scale mswep 3 hly 0 25 global gridded precipitation data used 13 762 stations with high quality and consistent observed set of data across the globe for the bias correction beck et al 2017 in ethiopia especially in the upper blue nile basin almost insignificant number of stations were only considered for the global bias correction that is due to the sparse nature of the stations as well as the length of the data needed 1979 2015 for this study the 3 hly precipitation data are aggregated into a daily temporal scale for the simulation of daily flow and 126 gauging stations were used for the investigation of the merging techniques and bias correction from 2000 to 2012 2 3 bias adjustment and merging techniques the qm gw approach is carried out based on a quantile mapping qm technique and a gaussian weighting gw interpolation scheme for the bias adjustment and merging procedures which is based mainly on qm yang et al 2016 quantile mapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climate models and they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations cannon et al 2015 the method and procedure of the qm gw approach used in this study are directly taken and found in yang et al 2016 the qm approach is used to primarily correct the original ori mswep precipitation estimates using cumulative distribution function cdfs calculated from the gauge and mswep estimation at every 0 25 0 25 box area the gw interpolation aims to grid the adjusted mswep adj rainfall series at satellite pixels 0 25 0 25 based on the bias corrected estimates the adj mswep daily rainfall 0 25 0 25 r i t from daily satellite estimation is calculated from daily ori mswep rainfall r i t at a given satellite pixel i at 0 25 0 25 resolution and time t as follows yang et al 2016 1 r i t j ω i w i j c d f g j 1 c d f m s w e p j r i t j ω i

boxes near pixel i j ω i are used to obtain bias corrected estimates r i j t based on the nonparametric qm approach the irmse weighting approach is developed to merge the bias adjusted and gridded precipitation datasets based principally on the root mean square errors rmses quantifying uncertainties of the datasets as detailed below yang et al 2017 merged mswep gauge precipitation mer sg is calculated using the following equations 2 r i m e r w s i r s i a d j w g i r g i g r i 3 w s i 1 r m s e s i 1 r m s e s i 1 r m s e g i 4 w g i 1 r m s e g i 1 r m s e s i 1 r m s e g i where r i m

storage crest distributed hydrological model simulates the spatio temporal variation of water and energy fluxes and storages on a regular grid with the grid cell resolution being user defined thereby enabling global and regional scale applications wang et al 2011 crest s distinguishing characteristics include 1 distributed rainfall runoff generation and cell to cell routing 2 coupled runoff generation and routing via three feedback mechanisms including rainfall runoff generation evapotranspiration and sub grid cell routing and 3 representation of sub grid cell variability of soil moisture storage capacity and sub grid cell routing via linear reservoirs the coupling between the runoff generation and routing mechanisms allows detailed and realistic treatment of hydrological variables such as soil moisture furthermore the representation of soil moisture variability and routing processes at the sub grid scale enables the crest model to be readily scalable to multi scale modelling research in this study crest v 2 1 which involves coupled routing scheme based on a fully distributed linear reservoir fdlrr scheme xinyi shen and hong 2014 has been applied for the calibration and simulation of the precipitation product the crest 2 1 has been widely applied and has been proved to be easy and effective however with the development of remote sensing technology crest 2 1 is faced with some new challenges the major drawbacks of the model include i it has some limitations which prevent further and deeper applications of remotely sensed products to assist model calibration simulation and validation ii it supports only one soil layer to describe the tension water storage iii it does not also consider the free water storage and ignores the runoff generation and flow concentration processes of the groundwater this limits the effectiveness of model application to watersheds in which the groundwater plays an important role kan et al 2017 2 4 1 model setup the requirements of data to setup the crest hydrological model is discussed below two types of datasets are required i the geospatial input data which are static in nature and ii the hydrometeorological input data which are dynamic time series the geospatial data with the resolution of 1 km by 1 km resolution digital elevation model dem is extracted from the united states geological survey usgs national elevation dataset ned https www usgs gov the dem is used to derive the geospatial data for crest model such as slope flow direction and flow accumulation and drainage area of the case study the second input consists of the dynamic hydrometeorological datasets lakew et al 2020 the meteorological datasets rainfall pet are geo referenced with the geographic location of the upper blue nile and gridded to the resolution that is consistent with the mswep resolution of 0 25 the process of geo referencing and gridding is carried out using matlab daily time series observed streamflow hydrological dataset is used at the outlet of the basin to calibrate model parameters 2 4 2 calibration and parameters many of the parameters in the crest model are physical and can in principle be estimated from field surveyed data such as soil texture land cover maps and vegetation coverage however in many large basins worldwide and particularly in the african context it is much more difficult to estimate model parameters from ancillary data models need to be trained through calibrated either manually automatically or using combined approaches given observations of rainfall and streamflow wang et al 2011 crest has 12 parameters and the model is calibrated using daily gauged rainfall data sources the observed streamflow data is used as one source of input for the calibration as well as to setup the distributed hydrological model calibration is done from 2000 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2012 automatic calibration has been implemented to estimate the model parameters crest uses shuffle complex evolution university of arizona sce ua automatic kernel algorithm for calibration of the model using in situ gauged rainfall crest directly uses the screen output of sce ua codes in matlab written by duan et al 1992 the objective function value is the nsce of each simulation the parameters that are calibrated using the gauged rainfall except the rainfact are used for the simulation forcing the merged and unmerged mswep global precipitation products table 1 besides another strategy of bias correction for unmerged mswep is carried out this is made by tweaking the rainfact parameter during simulation flow using crest model and evaluation framework to assess the performance is carried out the rainfact tweaked values for both merged and unmerged mswep are 0 71 and 0 78 respectively 2 5 performance evaluation in this study the daily streamflow of gauge observation is used as reference data to evaluate the simulated flow of both gauge merged mswep and the simulated flow by tweaking the rainfall factor bias correction of the unmerged mswep product to evaluate the performance of the simulated flows with the observed flow three statistical metrics are used eq s 7 to 9 as follows first for statistical goodness of fit of simulated streamflow the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 is utilized 7 n s c e 1 q i o q i c 2 q i o q o 2 where q i o is the observed streamflow of the ith day q i c is the global streamflow of ith day and q o is the average of all the daily observed streamflow values if nsce 0 then the model provides no skill in relation to using the observed mean as a predictor and values greater than zero indicating better agreement second the correlation coefficient hereafter cc is used to assess the agreement between the simulated flows and the observed streamflow the value of cc is such that 1 cc 1 8 c c q i o q o q i c q c q i o q o 2 q i c q c 2 where q c is the average of all daily simulated streamflow values third relative bias ratio assesses the systematic bias of the simulated discharge bias is defined as the average difference between the simulated flows and the observed streamflow the value of bias can be positive as well as negative a positive bias indicates overestimation of the observed streamflow amount while a negative bias indicates underestimation of it 9 b i a s q i c q i o q i o 100 3 result and discussion 3 1 rainfall to assess the effectiveness of merging techniques of the global mswep data with the gauged rainfall for the hydrological simulation of the upper blue nile basin the areal rainfall of gauge merged mswep and the unmerged mswep is plotted with the reference of the gauged rainfall for the study period from 2000 to 2012 and shown in fig 2 the result manifests that the areal rainfall of the gauge merged rainfall tries to capture the shape and the magnitude of the gauged rainfall the merging techniques show significant improvement from the unmerged areal rainfall for the hydrological simulation for data scare region however the merged areal rainfall shows a slight underestimation of the gauged rainfall and still needs enhancement to capture the magnitude of the gauged rainfall that is attributable to the sparsely located or less density of the rain gauge stations in the upper blue nile basin to improve the performance of the simulated flow and to minimize the gap to capture the magnitude of gauged rainfall tweaking the rainfact parameter bias correction is carried out for the hydrological simulation the rainfact parameter sensitive which is the multiplier on the precipitation field and the adjustment factor of the precipitation either due to canopy interception or bias increasing the value of the rainfact result in increasing streamflow and vice versa and has a value of greater than zero if the parameter value is greater than one it shows that the average areal rainfall amount that is taken for that watershed underestimate the actual average areal rainfall of the region to capture the observed flow and vice versa lakew et al 2017 the rainfact parameter value is 0 67 table 1 it means the measured rainfall overestimates the actual rainfall because in this study more gauging stations are taken from highlands that have a high amount of rainfall fig 1 and would have the tendency to overestimate the actual rainfall of the basin 3 2 streamflow simulation the simulated streamflow of both merged mswep and the unmerged with rainfall factor adjustment bias correction are compared with the observed streamflow measured data for daily monthly and wet season temporal resolutions the daily comparison result manifests that the simulated flow using rain factor adjustment bias correction shows better performance skill than the gauge merged mswep product as shown in table 2 the nsce performance shows 0 89 and 0 81 for unmerged with rain factor adjustment bias correction and gauge merged of mswep products respectively the bias has a negative value for both simulated flows that indicates that the simulated flows cannot to capture the total volume flow of the basin with an underestimation of the observed streamflow magnitude especially the gauge merged flow has high bias value of 33 2 relative to the bias corrected 12 the bias result manifest that tweaking the rainfall factor for unmerged mswep performs better skill to capture the total flow volume of the basin relative to the merged mswep product for the upper blue nile the cc values show excellent performance for both simulated flows 0 95 these results manifest that for the daily simulated flow the unmerged applying bias correction shows better performance than the gauge merged simulated flow of the mswep product based on nsce and bias performance evaluation criteria the areal mean annual rainfall of the upper blue nile basin for the different rainfall products including unmerged merged and unmerged with bias correction of the mswep precipitation product compared with the observed rainfall during the simulation flow of the basin applying the distributed hydrological model crest the result manifests that from the various products of mswep product the unmerged with bias correction rainfact during simulation improves the performance to capture the observed rainfall than the rest mswep products including the merged mswep product as shown in fig 3 merging mswep product 1230 mm year shows improvement compared to the unmerged mswep 920 mm year product to capture the gauged rainfall 1280 mm year however still the merged mswep product needs further improvement to estimate the gauged rainfall this gap improved by adjusting the rainfall factor during simulation flow applying the crest model by tweaking the rainfact parameter bias correction and shows high performance 1260 mm year to capture the gauged rainfall as compared to the rest mswep products these indicate that in the data scarce region of the upper blue nile basin merging the sparsely located rain gauges rainfall with the global product of mswep doesn t improve the performance for the predictive ability of streamflow rate compared with the bias correction during simulation flow for the daily time series analysis the daily flows for the different precipitation products are plotted using hydrograph including the merged and unmerged mswep bias corrected with the observed streamflow of the upper blue nile basin and shown in fig 4 both merged and unmerged with the bias correction of mswep products strive to capture the shape and the magnitude of the observed streamflow the unmerged with the bias correction rainfact shows better performance form the merged mswep precipitation product the daily hydrograph shows and confirms that tweaking the rainfall factor bias correction during simulation applying crest model is more applicable to estimate the streamflow magnitude and to capture the shape of the hydrograph than merging the sparsely located gauged rainfall with the global mswep product the same with the daily simulated flow the monthly temporal resolution flow is simulated for both merged and unmerged mswep global precipitation product for the upper blue nile basin the result shows that the same with the daily temporal scale the monthly simulated flow of the unmerged simulated flow bias correction provides better performance than the gauge merged mswep global product based on nsce and bias performances evaluation as shown in table 3 the bias result of the monthly simulated flow shows an underestimation of the observed streamflow magnitude with a negative value the merged mswep has high bias value of 33 23 relative to the bias of the unmerged with bias correction 13 1 this indicates that the bias correction simulation of the unmerged mswep performs better skill to estimate the total flow volume of the basin relative to the gauge merged mswep product for the upper blue nile basin the monthly cc performance shows a similar presentation for both simulated flows corresponding to the daily temporal scale 0 95 the result of daily and monthly temporal resolutions performance manifests that the gauge merged mswep shows relatively less performance compared with the simulated flow applying rain factor adjustment bias correction during the simulation this suggests that tweaking the rainfall factor parameter bias correction during simulation is more applicable than merging the gauged rainfall with mswep for both daily and monthly temporal resolutions for the hydrological simulation for the data scare region of the upper blue nile basin for large reservoirs simulations and operations the wet season streamflow computation has significant importance for the analysis and release decision of the reservoirs the flows of the upper blue nile and its tributaries are marked by a mono modal flow pattern with the peak flow in july and august the rainfall is characterized by a highly seasonal pattern with more than 70 falling in 4 months june to september jjas and the peak event occurring in july or august elshamy et al 2009 the streamflow magnitude is directly related to the amount of rainfall and the flow is expected to be a peak at the same time with the peak rainfall is recorded jjas the mean annual streamflow of abbay basin at eldiem varies between 1249 and 1981 m3s 1 and the seasonal mean streamflow in the wet season jjas varies between 2412 and 3344 m3s 1 this indicates that the highest flow of the basin is measured during the four months of jjas and it accounts for 75 of the total annual flow of the river using the data record from 2000 to 2012 therefore it is vital to compute the wet season simulated flow of the upper blue nile basin for different water resources applications especially for reservoir operations based on this the wet season of the four months jjas simulated flow comparison of both merged and bias corrected of mswep global product is carried out the nsce performance result shows that the unmerged mswep applying rainfall factor adjustment during the simulation bias correction shows the better skill of performance 0 80 by far from the gauge merged mswep product 0 43 the same with the nsce performance the bias performance of the gauge merged shows less performance 26 7 relative to the bias corrected mswep applying the rainfall factor adjustment 7 55 as shown in table 4 the negative bias result of the simulated flows indicates an underestimation of the total volume flow magnitude of the basin especially the gauge merged underestimate the basin observed streamflow relative to the bias corrected mswep the wet season cc metric index shows excellent performance skills 0 90 for both simulated flows similar to the daily and monthly temporal resolutions the wet season performance indicates that for reservoir simulation and operation of the upper blue nile basin tweaking the rain factor during the simulation bias correction of the mswep product shows better skill performance and applicable by far from the gauge merged mswep product 4 quantile quantile evaluation the quantile quantile q q plot is a graphical technique for determining if two data sets come from populations with a common distribution a 45 degree reference line is also plotted if the two sets come from a population with the same distribution the points should fall approximately along this reference line wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 the greater the departure from this reference line the greater the evidence for the conclusion that the two data sets come from populations with different distributions or with the same distribution but biased or shifted with the mean fig 5 shows the q q plots of the simulated flow of the gauge merged and bias corrected mswep with a reference line of the observed streamflow for the three temporal resolutions of daily monthly and the wet season of the upper blue nile basin the plot shows that the unmerged mswep simulated flow by tweaking the rainfact parameter bias correction outperforms to estimate the flow quantiles relative to the merged mswep product for the three temporal resolutions as shown in fig 5 generally the q q plot result confirms that for the hydrological simulation of the upper blue nile basin bias correction during simulation shows better performance skill than merging the sparsely located gauging stations with the mswe product for daily monthly and wet seasons temporal resolutions 5 conclusion this research mainly aims to investigate the effectiveness of merging and the bias correction of mswep precipitation product using gauged rainfall data and streamflow for the hydrological modelling of the upper blue nile basin fully distributed hydrological model crest is calibrated from 2000 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2012 the crest model is setup for the upper blue nile basin by calibrating the model parameters using the observed streamflow data at the outlet of the basin between ethiopia and the sudan border two simulated flows are generated using the merged mswep and the bias corrected mswep by tweaking the rainfall factor parameter rainfact applying the setup crest model for the upper blue nile basin the result manifests that the bias correction by tweaking the rainfall factor parameter rainfact during simulation shows better performance than the gauge based merged mswep precipitation product for daily monthly and wet season temporal resolutions especially for wet season flow jjas the bias corrected simulated flow of mswep shows high performance by far from the merged mswep product the wet season nsce performance shows 0 80 and 0 43 for the rain factor adjusted simulated flow bias correction of mswep and merged mswep products respectively this is attributable to the rainfall gauging station is located sparsely throughout the basin the overall result suggests that to improve the simulated performance of the upper blue nile no demand to carry out merging mswep with sparsely located gauged rainfall rather carrying out bias correction by tweaking the rain factor in the simulation of crest improves the performance to

8292,study region the study area slovakia is to a great extent a part of the carpathian mountainous system where lowlands dominate the southwest and southeast of the region and are part of the pannonian basin study focus rainwater harvesting can reduce vulnerability of urban areas to climate change by storing water for rainless periods and by reducing surface runoff the efficiency and reliability of water harvesting systems depends on the local climate analysing rainfall characteristics is therefore essential for a proper sizing of any rainwater collecting project a total of 84 rainfall records from climatologically distinct regions of slovakia were separated into statistically independent episodes to derive event based statistical characteristics new hydrological insights for the region a considerable spatial and seasonal variability has been observed in the statistics of rainfall events inter event times decrease with elevation whereas event volume and annual incidence of rainfall events increase with elevation the applicability of the derived rainfall statistics was illustrated by simulations for a typical residential house using the analytical probabilistic approach empirical relationships between tank size and site elevation have been a developed to estimate tank sizes for un gauged locations the simulations show that rain barrels in the southern parts of slovakia require larger storage capacities than those located in the mountainous regions the presented annual and seasonal estimates of rainfall characteristics are published for the first time keywords rainwater harvesting rain barrels design values inter event time analytical probabilistic model 1 introduction water resources are under severe pressure imposed by demographic and economic development environmental degradation and climate change yannopoulos et al 2019 although most of europe is still considered to have adequate water resources water scarcity and drought are becoming increasingly frequent and widespread phenomena recent projections of meteorological and agricultural drought for europe suggest that under the emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 droughts are likely to become more frequent more severe everywhere in europe by 2070 spinoni et al 2018 rainwater harvesting rwh can contribute to a reduction of the amount of water abstracted from public mains which makes rwh attractive particularly for economic and environmental reasons raimondi and becciu 2014 mattos et al 2019 seo et al 2013 rahman et al 2014 cain 2010 in addition to flood control rwh systems are often optimized to achieve lower discharge of uncontrolled pollutants into streams and ground water becciu and raimondi 2015a 2015b in general rwh systems are based on collecting rainwater from rooftop catchments temporarily storing it in tanks in order to provide water for different uses such as irrigation laundry washing or toilet flushing in europe the first rwh systems can be traced back to the roman times when whole municipalities took advantage of rain as the principal source of potable water other examples of harvesting rain water come from israel where runoff from hillsides is stored for both domestic and agricultural purposes the tradition of storing rain water has a long history also in egypt and asia for instance in the western rajasthan india traditional technologies are designed to collect and store water in underground cisterns known as taanka that are used as a major source of drinking water hussain et al 2014 the world s largest rainwater tank is probably the basilica cistern in istanbul turkey constructed during the rule of caesar justinian a d 527 565 rainwater harvesting has many applications in the modern society for example in urbanized areas rain water may be used for irrigating urban green spaces parece et al 2016 other uses of rainwater include flushing toilets and in washing machines because rainwater can be considered as one of the cleanest sources of water on earth tammaddun et al 2018 it can be used under very strict hygienic conditions even for drinking purposes in the developed world water from roofs is used by households for irrigation in gardens to save the cost of water and to protect the available water resources however in the developing world rain water is used for basic survival including drinking cooking and hygiene there are several approaches used in modeling rwh systems in cities semaan et al 2020 raimondi and becciu 2014 empirical relationship methods regress the sizing of rain water tanks to parameters such as rainfall depth water demand and roof area lash et al 2014 on the other hand stochastic parametric and non parametric models or probabilistic analytical models belong to the second group of methods that use various stochastic techniques to simulate parameters in rainwater tank design guo and baetz 2007 raimondi et al 2020 raimondi and becciu 2014 the third group of methods is based on continuous mass balance simulations of the tank inflow and outflow rahman et al 2014 semaan et al 2020 the analytical probabilistic approach is used in this paper the estimation of storage capacity is a key issue in the design of rwh systems becciu et al 2018 semaan et al 2020 the operation of a rainwater tank can be described as altering filling and emptying phases becciu et al 2018 the size of rainwater collecting tanks is affected by the degree of security required semaan et al 2020 although water is the most abundant substance on earth its distribution is not the same everywhere variations in rainfall patterns depend on geographical location defining the position within climate zones of the continent elevation and additional geomorphological factors affecting its availability intuitively the storage volume of rainfall collecting tanks or rain barrels has to be able to maintain water supply under a broad range of conditions including extended dry spells in this paper we focus on the calculation procedure of adequate sizes of rain barrels using rain barrels to harvest rainwater in the investigated region of slovakia is not an entirely new idea in fact almost every homeowner owns a tank to store rain water however despite the widespread use of rain barrels in slovakia the optimal sizing of rain barrels is often anecdotal to our best knowledge no regional research has been undertaken yet that would deal with the sizing of rain barrels across the whole country this paper attempts to fill this gap the goals of this paper are threefold i to analyze high resolution time series of rainfall and estimate the minimum inter event time that is necessary to separate statistically independent rainfall events ii to analyze the statistical properties on an event basis mean values of event depth event duration and inter event time iii to simulate required tank storage volumes and daily use rates for typical residential conditions 2 methods 2 1 source data and local climate the rainfall data analyzed in this paper were obtained from the internal climatological databases of the slovak hydrometeorological institute in this study 19 years of pluviographic records 1 minute data measured at 84 rain gauges in slovakia between 1991 and 2009 were analyzed the rain gauges are located at a wide range of altitudes ranging from 97 m a s l to 1322 m a s l table s1 data quality checks were performed to remove suspicious outliers in the time series the rainfall data cover the warm part of the year when precipitation predominantly falls in liquid form april october rainfall in the cold season december february was not measured since the network of rain gauges used in this study self registering rain gauge metra 890 iba was operated only in the warm part of the year to avoid freezing of the instruments nevertheless local rainfall characteristics affect the sizing of rainwater tanks only throughout the warm part of the year during which rain barrels are operated operation of rain barrels in the winter months is not possible due to higher risk of freezing conditions although liquid precipitation may be observed especially at lower altitudes the territory of the study area slovakia is to a great extent a part of the carpathian mountainous system lowlands dominate only the southwest and southeast portions of the country and are part of the pannonian basin kozak et al 2013 the average annual rainfall varies from less than 500 mm in the south west leeward side of the little carpathians mts to approximately 2000 mm in the high tatra mountains relatively low precipitation is observed in rain shadows i e areas located on the leeward side of a mountain that are blocking the passage of rain producing weather for this reason the eastern part is relatively dry protected from the southwest to northwest by the high and low tatras the amount of precipitation in slovakia generally increases with altitude by approximately 50 60 mm per 100 m the mountains in the northwest are generally richer in atmospheric precipitation than the rest of the country due to a greater exposure of these mountains to the prevailing northwestern winds caring a large portion of moisture from the atlantic ocean precipitation in this region is affected by atmospheric systems coming from the atlantic ocean western direction mostly in the winter and spring and from the mediterranean southern direction mostly in the fall however cyclones passing the baltic sea play a significant role determining precipitation occurrence and rainfall totals as well moist air coming from the area of the black sea during retrograde weather situations is also a significant factor especially in the summer when heavy storms are more frequent in the eastern portion of the country the aforementioned factors together with local effects give rise to three different precipitation regimes in slovakia i continental regime with low precipitation in winter and the highest in summer ii atlantic regime with equally distributed precipitation all year round and iii mediterranean regime with the highest precipitation in june or may with a secondary maximum in october december the mediterranean regime is more pronounced in the southern part of central slovakia while the continental regime is pronounced in the northeastern part of slovakia pokorna et al 2013 2 2 rain event separation and event characteristics estimation of statistical characteristics of rainfall on an event basis requires a prior identification of minimum inter event time mit definition of mit is an essential step in separating statistically independent rainfall events from a time series as originally defined by restrepo and eagleson 1982 mit refers to a rainless period between two successive rains events wang et al 2019 joo et al 2014 two successive rains can be considered as a single event if the rainless period between two rains is shorted than the mit value fig 1 on the other hand if the rainless period lasts longer than the mit value the successive rain events are considered as statistically independent events the procedure of event selection is based on the premise that the inter event times are exponentially distributed restrepo and eagleson 1982 if the duration of event is much shorter than the inter event time the arrival of independent events is thought to follow a poisson process the intrinsic property of exponential distribution is that the mean and standard deviation are equal in value therefore the estimated coefficient of variation of inter events times must converge to unity because by definition coefficient of variation is a ratio of the sample standard deviation and the sample mean the whole procedure of identifying mit value for a time series of rainfall data is based on the use of trial values of mit until the coefficient of variation is equal or as close as possible to unity bedient et al 2008 in this paper the trial mit values ranged from 2 h to 48 h with 20 minute increments each independent rainfall event can be characterized by a set of statistical characteristics e g event depth event duration inter event time time to peak and maximum intensity wang et al 2019 dunkerley 2008 2015 for the purposes of this paper we calculated event characteristics that are used as parametric inputs in various probabilistic analytical models e g becciu et al 2018 raimondi and becciu 2017 guo 2016 becciu and raimondi 2015a 2015b zhang and guo 2014 raimondi and becciu 2014 basinger et al 2010 balistrocchi et al 2009 bacchi et al 2008 guo and baetz 2007 guo and hughes 2001 guo and adams 1998 i e the mean event duration mean event depth and mean inter event time and incidence of events were calculated for each rain gauge from the series of previously separated rainfall events the length of the inter event time is in this paper defined as the time that elapsed between the previous rain episode and the start of the current rain episode event duration is defined as the length of time an event lasts event depth is the cumulative amount of rain depth that was registered in a rain gauge during an event the event based statistics was calculated on both annual and seasonal bases the seasonal statistics was calculated for three seasons of the warm part of the year the spring season spanning over the months march april may the summer season spanning over june july august and finally the fall season spanning over the months september october november 2 3 estimation of tank sizing and maximum water use rate the applicability of the derived rainfall statistics is presented on an example where the analytical probabilistic model proposed by guo and baetz 2007 was applied however it has to be noted that there are several other models described in the literature that were proposed to calculate the storage volumes of rain water tanks e g becciu et al 2018 raimondi and becciu 2014 the choice to use the model described in guo and baetz 2007 is based only on our personal preference it was not our intention to repeat all mathematical formulations published in the work of guo and baetz 2007 here we restrict our investigation only to the equations that we used to calculate the required tank size eq 1 and maximum daily water use rates eq 2 the required tank size is defined as 1 b a ϕ g ζ g a ϕ ψ l n a ϕ ψ e ζ ν f f a ϕ ψ e ζ ν f f r a ϕ ψ ζ g the daily maximum use rate g is defined as 2 g a ϕ ψ ζ e ζ ν f f r 1 where a is the rooftop catchment area m2 b is the volume of storage tank l r is the desired reliability of tank in supplying water g is the maximum use rate defined for reliability r l day ζ is the distribution parameter of event depth ν 1 mm ψ is the distribution parameter of inter event

rooftop catchment areas and reliability factors we used quantile regression with site altitude as an independent predictor variable the quantile regression was first described by koenker and bassett back in 1978 as an alternative method to ordinary least squares regression koenker 2005 koenker and hallock 2001 an envelope curve is a mathematical relation that represents the upper or lower limit of the given dataset if the quantile is sufficiently high the estimated curve can be thought of as an envelope curve amponsah et al 2018 envelope curves based on quantile regression have been used in hydrology for estimating peak floods leal et al 2020 in this paper quantile regression is used to parameterize envelope curves describing the relationship between site altitude elevation required tank sizes and maximum daily use rates the quantreg matlab function was used for the calculation of quantile regression coefficients and their associated uncertainties the calculation procedure is based on the work of koenker and hallock 2001 and koenker 2005 in the case of tank sizes the envelope curves are set to fit the upper 95th percentiles as shown in fig 2 where the top envelope curve was fitted by quantile regression in log log space fig 2a to highlight the non linear behavior of tank sizes and station elevation fig 2b shows the same relationship in linear space as can be deduced from the example presented in fig 2 the tank sizes tend to decrease with elevation the top envelope curve 95th quantile confines 95 of the estimated required tank sizes from above in other words 95 of tank sizes corresponding to the elevation lie below the top envelope curve we choose the 95th percentile in the quantile regression to provide the most conservative estimate of the required tank sizing although it has to be acknowledged that this may lead to overestimation of required tank sizes each top envelope curve was fitted on log transformed data 3 results rainfall time series from 84 locations in slovakia were separated into statistically independent rainfall events the separated events were subsequently used to estimate event based statistical characteristics such as the mean rainfall duration mean event depth mean inter event time and mean incidence of rainfall episodes for each of the analyzed locations the empirical estimates of the mean event depth and mean inter event time annual values are listed in the supplementary material table s2 seasonal estimates are shown in tables s3 s5 the seasonal estimates were defined separately for the spring m a m summer j j a and fall s o n seasons every site appears to be specific in terms of its rainfall statistical properties the values of mit depend on the season of the year and exhibit a great deal of variability between locations as indicated by the coefficients of variation cv in tables s2 s5 for example in the spring season m a m and summer season j j a the median values of mit of the analyzed rainfall series are 11 and 12 h respectively table s3 table s4 in the fall table s5 the median mit for all locations is 17 25 h the cv of seasonal mit values is around 0 4 tables s3 s5 on the annual basis the mit values across the analyzed rainfall records range from 8 h to 45 h table s2 with a median value of 16 h the coefficients of variation calculated for the annual statistics revealed that mean event duration has the greatest spatial variability with cv 0 62 table s2 whereas the annual incidence of rainfall events showed the lowest variability cv 0 13 on the seasonal basis the mean median of mit tables s3 s5 are 11 h for the spring season 12 h for the summer season and 17 25 h in the fall the summertime median of rainfall depths for all locations is 8 3 mm table s4 the incidence of rainfall events apparently fluctuates seasonally the highest incidence of rainfall episodes was observed in the summer season when the median value determined from all locations was 26 9 events table s4 the empirical relationships between site elevation and the annual mean event depth mean event duration and mean inter event time iet are plotted in fig 6 only the relationship between iet and elevation was statistically significant p 0 05 with pearson correlation coefficient rpearson 0 51 the mean event depth and the mean event duration seem to be uncorrelated to elevation at the chosen level of significance α 0 05 regional curves relating the required tank sizes b and the maximum daily use rate g with elevation were fitted for a wide interval of reliabilities r and rooftop catchment areas a to delineate the top envelope curve of the required tank sizes b the 95th percentile was used in quantile regression with elevation as an independent predictor the 5th percentile was used to delineate the bottom envelope curve of the maximum daily use rate g and elevation as an independent predictor these regression coefficients intercept and slope including the associated uncertainties for the top envelope curves are indicated in table 1 similarly the regression coefficients of the bottom envelope curves are listed in table 2 the envelope curves defined by the regression coefficients in tables

use rates for an hypothetical house with rooftop catchment are 130 m2 and reliability r 0 3 fig 7 illustrates the simulations of required tank sizes b and maximum water use rates g for an arbitrarily chosen rooftop catchment area and reliability at sites located in low altitude areas in the southern and eastern parts of the country 4 discussion high resolution 1 minute time series of rainfall from a dense network of rainfall gauges in slovakia were used to estimate the minimum inter event time that is necessary to separate statistically independent rainfall events having identified and isolated the independent rainfall events the mean values of rainfall depth rainfall duration and inter event time were calculated on seasonal and annual bases as these parameters are essential parameters in probabilistic analytical modeling of rainwater harvesting measures becciu et al 2018 raimondi and becciu 2017 guo 2016 raimondi and becciu 2014 guo and hughes 2001 on the annual basis the minimum inter event time across the analyzed locations in the study region ranged from 8 h to 45 h with a mean of 17 22 h it is interesting to compare these values to other investigations worldwide for instance restrepo and eagleson 1982 estimated mit values for 17 sites in the continental usa and in saudi arabia their estimates of mit ranged from 1 h in columbia to 9 h in ohio usa and up to 132 h in saudi arabia a recent study conducted by wang et al 2019 identified mit values ranging from 7 6 h to 16 6 h in the monsoon region of china guo 2016 estimated that mit in a semiarid region of montana usa and in a humid sub tropical part of georgia usa was 8 h raimondi and becciu 2017 estimated event based rainfall characteristics for a location in milan italy by separating events by setting the value of mit to 10 h our results suggest that the mean values of mit reflect the local climate and are site specific even within a relatively small investigated region the interval of mit values identified in slovakia is from 8 to 45 h table s2 moreover a seasonal behavior of the considered rainfall event based characteristics was observed this intra annual seasonal variability can attributed to different physical origin of rain producing systems stratiform vs convective precipitation and their geographical origin atlantic vs mediterranean to our best knowledge the seasonal aspects of event based rainfall statistics have not received much attention in the literature so far which makes our results rather unique another goal of this paper was to show how rainfall characteristics affect the sizing of rainwater tanks several simulations were run for an average residential house with rooftop surface area 130 m2 the results show that the local climate expressed by the event based statistics of rainfall has a substantial effect on the choice of optimal rain collecting tank using the analytical probabilistic model of guo and baetz 2007 given the high spatial variability of model input parameters related to the event based statistics a new procedure based on quantile regression was described to estimate tank sizes and maximum daily water use rates for areas outside the training dataset the equations listed in tables 1 and 2 was proposed for a range of typical rooftop catchment areas 40 220 m2 and expected system reliabilities 20 80 the presented regression coefficients of regional envelope curves can be used by engineers and municipalities to estimate the optimal sizing of rainwater tanks for residential projects collecting rainwater from roofs with the presented equations municipalities or water authorities can now assist homeowners in selecting rain barrel sizes without having to laboriously acquiring local statistics of rainfall the only parameter that that is needed to estimate the optimal sizing of rain barrels is altitude of the area of interest more specifically the presented parameters can be further used to define storage and retention times of storm water in detention facilities using various applications proposed by e g becciu and raimondi 2015a 2015b and to design rainwater tanks becciu et al 2018 raimondi and becciu 2014 bio retention and infiltration basins guo and hughes 2001 vegetative roofs raimondi et al 2020 guo 2016 sewer tanks balistrocchi et al 2009 or to conduct hydrologic analysis of rainfall runoff relationships in catchments guo and adams 1998 in addition rainfall characteristics such as those presented in this paper determine the efficiency with which detention basins can remove undesired pollutants in surface runoff raimondi and becciu 2017 although only the mean inter event time and mean event depth were used in the estimation of proper sizing for rain collecting tanks in this paper we present also the values of mean event duration and the mean number of events table s2 s5 since these parameters may be used in analytical probabilistic modeling of other rain water harvesting measures therefore apart from the application of annual event based statistics of rainfall in the design of rainwater collecting tanks as illustrated in this paper the tabulated seasonal rainfall statistical properties see the supplementary material can be used by engineers to optimize the design for a particular season of the year 5 conclusions the most important measures to alleviate the manifestation of drought in cities are green infrastructure and improvement of water retention the use of rooftop inexpensive rainwater collecting systems such as rain barrels or cisterns may increase the quantity of water for urban agriculture as rainfall characteristics vary in space in this paper we focused our attention on analyzing event based statistical properties of rainfall at a total of 84 locations the minimum inter event time was defined for each rain gauge in slovakia the estimates of inter event time are highly variable in space ranging from 8 to 45 h statistically independent rainfall events were analyzed to calculate event based statistics such as mean event duration mean event depth mean inter event time and mean incidence of events over a chosen season a strong linkage between tank sizes and altitude was observed which served as a bases for the development of empirical relationships between tank size and altitude envelope curves based on quantile regression were developed to predict required tank sizes for every location within the investigated region analytical probabilistic models require locally estimated event based rainfall statistics such as the rainfall volume duration and inter event time the presented statistics were determined for each of the 84 rain gauges for the first time as analytical probabilistic are gaining in popularity in the hydro meteorological community the presented local estimates of event based statistics of rainfall can be further used in analytical probabilistic models developed for detention basins bio retention systems infiltration systems and vegetated roofs to our best knowledge there has been no investigation of event based rainfall statistics in the central european setting undertaken yet that would focus also on the seasonal aspects which makes the presented results rather unique credit authorship contribution statement milan onderka methodology investigation formal

8292,study region the study area slovakia is to a great extent a part of the carpathian mountainous system where lowlands dominate the southwest and southeast of the region and are part of the pannonian basin study focus rainwater harvesting can reduce vulnerability of urban areas to climate change by storing water for rainless periods and by reducing surface runoff the efficiency and reliability of water harvesting systems depends on the local climate analysing rainfall characteristics is therefore essential for a proper sizing of any rainwater collecting project a total of 84 rainfall records from climatologically distinct regions of slovakia were separated into statistically independent episodes to derive event based statistical characteristics new hydrological insights for the region a considerable spatial and seasonal variability has been observed in the statistics of rainfall events inter event times decrease with elevation whereas event volume and annual incidence of rainfall events increase with elevation the applicability of the derived rainfall statistics was illustrated by simulations for a typical residential house using the analytical probabilistic approach empirical relationships between tank size and site elevation have been a developed to estimate tank sizes for un gauged locations the simulations show that rain barrels in the southern parts of slovakia require larger storage capacities than those located in the mountainous regions the presented annual and seasonal estimates of rainfall characteristics are published for the first time keywords rainwater harvesting rain barrels design values inter event time analytical probabilistic model 1 introduction water resources are under severe pressure imposed by demographic and economic development environmental degradation and climate change yannopoulos et al 2019 although most of europe is still considered to have adequate water resources water scarcity and drought are becoming increasingly frequent and widespread phenomena recent projections of meteorological and agricultural drought for europe suggest that under the emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 droughts are likely to become more frequent more severe everywhere in europe by 2070 spinoni et al 2018 rainwater harvesting rwh can contribute to a reduction of the amount of water abstracted from public mains which makes rwh attractive particularly for economic and environmental reasons raimondi and becciu 2014 mattos et al 2019 seo et al 2013 rahman et al 2014 cain 2010 in addition to flood control rwh systems are often optimized to achieve lower discharge of uncontrolled pollutants into streams and ground water becciu and raimondi 2015a 2015b in general rwh systems are based on collecting rainwater from rooftop catchments temporarily storing it in tanks in order to provide water for different uses such as irrigation laundry washing or toilet flushing in europe the first rwh systems can be traced back to the roman times when whole municipalities took advantage of rain as the principal source of potable water other examples of harvesting rain water come from israel where runoff from hillsides is stored for both domestic and agricultural purposes the tradition of storing rain water has a long history also in egypt and asia for instance in the western rajasthan india traditional technologies are designed to collect and store water in underground cisterns known as taanka that are used as a major source of drinking water hussain et al 2014 the world s largest rainwater tank is probably the basilica cistern in istanbul turkey constructed during the rule of caesar justinian a d 527 565 rainwater harvesting has many applications in the modern society for example in urbanized areas rain water may be used for irrigating urban green spaces parece et al 2016 other uses of rainwater include flushing toilets and in washing machines because rainwater can be considered as one of the cleanest sources of water on earth tammaddun et al 2018 it can be used under very strict hygienic conditions even for drinking purposes in the developed world water from roofs is used by households for irrigation in gardens to save the cost of water and to protect the available water resources however in the developing world rain water is used for basic survival including drinking cooking and hygiene there are several approaches used in modeling rwh systems in cities semaan et al 2020 raimondi and becciu 2014 empirical relationship methods regress the sizing of rain water tanks to parameters such as rainfall depth water demand and roof area lash et al 2014 on the other hand stochastic parametric and non parametric models or probabilistic analytical models belong to the second group of methods that use various stochastic techniques to simulate parameters in rainwater tank design guo and baetz 2007 raimondi et al 2020 raimondi and becciu 2014 the third group of methods is based on continuous mass balance simulations of the tank inflow and outflow rahman et al 2014 semaan et al 2020 the analytical probabilistic approach is used in this paper the estimation of storage capacity is a key issue in the design of rwh systems becciu et al 2018 semaan et al 2020 the operation of a rainwater tank can be described as altering filling and emptying phases becciu et al 2018 the size of rainwater collecting tanks is affected by the degree of security required semaan et al 2020 although water is the most abundant substance on earth its distribution is not the same everywhere variations in rainfall patterns depend on geographical location defining the position within climate zones of the continent elevation and additional geomorphological factors affecting its availability intuitively the storage volume of rainfall collecting tanks or rain barrels has to be able to maintain water supply under a broad range of conditions including extended dry spells in this paper we focus on the calculation procedure of adequate sizes of rain barrels using rain barrels to harvest rainwater in the investigated region of slovakia is not an entirely new idea in fact almost every homeowner owns a tank to store rain water however despite the widespread use of rain barrels in slovakia the optimal sizing of rain barrels is often anecdotal to our best knowledge no regional research has been undertaken yet that would deal with the sizing of rain barrels across the whole country this paper attempts to fill this gap the goals of this paper are threefold i to analyze high resolution time series of rainfall and estimate the minimum inter event time that is necessary to separate statistically independent rainfall events ii to analyze the statistical properties on an event basis mean values of event depth event duration and inter event time iii to simulate required tank storage volumes and daily use rates for typical residential conditions 2 methods 2 1 source data and local climate the rainfall data analyzed in this paper were obtained from the internal climatological databases of the slovak hydrometeorological institute in this study 19 years of pluviographic records 1 minute data measured at 84 rain gauges in slovakia between 1991 and 2009 were analyzed the rain gauges are located at a wide range of altitudes ranging from 97 m a s l to 1322 m a s l table s1 data quality checks were performed to remove suspicious outliers in the time series the rainfall data cover the warm part of the year when precipitation predominantly falls in liquid form april october rainfall in the cold season december february was not measured since the network of rain gauges used in this study self registering rain gauge metra 890 iba was operated only in the warm part of the year to avoid freezing of the instruments nevertheless local rainfall characteristics affect the sizing of rainwater tanks only throughout the warm part of the year during which rain barrels are operated operation of rain barrels in the winter months is not possible due to higher risk of freezing conditions although liquid precipitation may be observed especially at lower altitudes the territory of the study area slovakia is to a great extent a part of the carpathian mountainous system lowlands dominate only the southwest and southeast portions of the country and are part of the pannonian basin kozak et al 2013 the average annual rainfall varies from less than 500 mm in the south west leeward side of the little carpathians mts to approximately 2000 mm in the high tatra mountains relatively low precipitation is observed in rain shadows i e areas located on the leeward side of a mountain that are blocking the passage of rain producing weather for this reason the eastern part is relatively dry protected from the southwest to northwest by the high and low tatras the amount of precipitation in slovakia generally increases with altitude by approximately 50 60 mm per 100 m the mountains in the northwest are generally richer in atmospheric precipitation than the rest of the country due to a greater exposure of these mountains to the prevailing northwestern winds caring a large portion of moisture from the atlantic ocean precipitation in this region is affected by atmospheric systems coming from the atlantic ocean western direction mostly in the winter and spring and from the mediterranean southern direction mostly in the fall however cyclones passing the baltic sea play a significant role determining precipitation occurrence and rainfall totals as well moist air coming from the area of the black sea during retrograde weather situations is also a significant factor especially in the summer when heavy storms are more frequent in the eastern portion of the country the aforementioned factors together with local effects give rise to three different precipitation regimes in slovakia i continental regime with low precipitation in winter and the highest in summer ii atlantic regime with equally distributed precipitation all year round and iii mediterranean regime with the highest precipitation in june or may with a secondary maximum in october december the mediterranean regime is more pronounced in the southern part of central slovakia while the continental regime is pronounced in the northeastern part of slovakia pokorna et al 2013 2 2 rain event separation and event characteristics estimation of statistical characteristics of rainfall on an event basis requires a prior identification of minimum inter event time mit definition of mit is an essential step in separating statistically independent rainfall events from a time series as originally defined by restrepo and eagleson 1982 mit refers to a rainless period between two successive rains events wang et al 2019 joo et al 2014 two successive rains can be considered as a single event if the rainless period between two rains is shorted than the mit value fig 1 on the other hand if the rainless period lasts longer than the mit value the successive rain events are considered as statistically independent events the procedure of event selection is based on the premise that the inter event times are exponentially distributed restrepo and eagleson 1982 if the duration of event is much shorter than the inter event time the arrival of independent events is thought to follow a poisson process the intrinsic property of exponential distribution is that the mean and standard deviation are equal in value therefore the estimated coefficient of variation of inter events times must converge to unity because by definition coefficient of variation is a ratio of the sample standard deviation and the sample mean the whole procedure of identifying mit value for a time series of rainfall data is based on the use of trial values of mit until the coefficient of variation is equal or as close as possible to unity bedient et al 2008 in this paper the trial mit values ranged from 2 h to 48 h with 20 minute increments each independent rainfall event can be characterized by a set of statistical characteristics e g event depth event duration inter event time time to peak and maximum intensity wang et al 2019 dunkerley 2008 2015 for the purposes of this paper we calculated event characteristics that are used as parametric inputs in various probabilistic analytical models e g becciu et al 2018 raimondi and becciu 2017 guo 2016 becciu and raimondi 2015a 2015b zhang and guo 2014 raimondi and becciu 2014 basinger et al 2010 balistrocchi et al 2009 bacchi et al 2008 guo and baetz 2007 guo and hughes 2001 guo and adams 1998 i e the mean event duration mean event depth and mean inter event time and incidence of events were calculated for each rain gauge from the series of previously separated rainfall events the length of the inter event time is in this paper defined as the time that elapsed between the previous rain episode and the start of the current rain episode event duration is defined as the length of time an event lasts event depth is the cumulative amount of rain depth that was registered in a rain gauge during an event the event based statistics was calculated on both annual and seasonal bases the seasonal statistics was calculated for three seasons of the warm part of the year the spring season spanning over the months march april may the summer season spanning over june july august and finally the fall season spanning over the months september october november 2 3 estimation of tank sizing and maximum water use rate the applicability of the derived rainfall statistics is presented on an example where the analytical probabilistic model proposed by guo and baetz 2007 was applied however it has to be noted that there are several other models described in the literature that were proposed to calculate the storage volumes of rain water tanks e g becciu et al 2018 raimondi and becciu 2014 the choice to use the model described in guo and baetz 2007 is based only on our personal preference it was not our intention to repeat all mathematical formulations published in the work of guo and baetz 2007 here we restrict our

inter event time across the analyzed locations in the study region ranged from 8 h to 45 h with a mean of 17 22 h it is interesting to compare these values to other investigations worldwide for instance restrepo and eagleson 1982 estimated mit values for 17 sites in the continental usa and in saudi arabia their estimates of mit ranged from 1 h in columbia to 9 h in ohio usa and up to 132 h in saudi arabia a recent study conducted by wang et al 2019 identified mit values ranging from 7 6 h to 16 6 h in the monsoon region of china guo 2016 estimated that mit in a semiarid region of montana usa and in a humid sub tropical part of georgia usa was 8 h raimondi and becciu 2017 estimated event based rainfall characteristics for a location in milan italy by separating events by setting the value of mit to 10 h our results suggest that the mean values of mit reflect the local climate and are site specific even within a relatively small investigated region the interval of mit values identified in slovakia is from 8 to 45 h table s2 moreover a seasonal behavior of the considered rainfall event based characteristics was observed this intra annual seasonal variability can attributed to different physical origin of rain producing systems stratiform vs convective precipitation and their geographical origin atlantic vs mediterranean to our best knowledge the seasonal aspects of event based rainfall statistics have not received much attention in the literature so far which makes our results rather unique another goal of this paper was to show how rainfall characteristics affect the sizing of rainwater tanks several simulations were run for an average residential house with rooftop surface area 130 m2 the results show that the local climate expressed by the event based statistics of rainfall has a substantial effect on the choice of optimal rain collecting tank using the analytical probabilistic model of guo and baetz 2007 given the high spatial variability of model input parameters related to the event based statistics a new procedure based on quantile regression was described to estimate tank sizes and maximum daily water use rates for areas outside the training dataset the equations listed in tables 1 and 2 was proposed for a range of typical rooftop catchment areas 40 220 m2 and expected system reliabilities 20 80 the presented regression coefficients of regional envelope curves can be used by engineers and municipalities to estimate the optimal sizing of rainwater tanks for residential projects collecting rainwater from roofs with the presented equations municipalities or water authorities can now assist homeowners in selecting rain barrel sizes without having to laboriously acquiring local statistics of rainfall the only parameter that that is needed to estimate the optimal sizing of rain barrels is altitude of the area of interest more specifically the presented parameters can be further used to define storage and retention times of storm water in detention facilities using various applications proposed by e g becciu and raimondi 2015a 2015b and to design rainwater tanks becciu et al 2018 raimondi and becciu 2014 bio retention and infiltration basins guo and hughes 2001 vegetative roofs raimondi et al 2020 guo 2016 sewer tanks balistrocchi et al 2009 or to conduct hydrologic analysis of rainfall runoff relationships in catchments guo and adams 1998 in addition rainfall characteristics such as those presented in this paper determine the efficiency with which detention basins can remove undesired pollutants in surface runoff raimondi and becciu 2017 although only the mean inter event time and mean event depth were used in the estimation of proper sizing for rain collecting tanks in this paper we present also the values of mean event duration and the mean number of events table s2 s5 since these parameters may be used in analytical probabilistic modeling of other rain water harvesting measures therefore apart from the application of annual event based statistics of rainfall in the design of rainwater collecting tanks as illustrated in this paper the tabulated seasonal rainfall statistical properties see the supplementary material can be used by engineers to optimize the design for a particular season of the year 5 conclusions the most important measures to alleviate the manifestation of drought in cities are green infrastructure and improvement of water retention the use of rooftop inexpensive rainwater collecting systems such as rain barrels or cisterns may increase the quantity of water for urban agriculture as rainfall characteristics vary in space in this paper we focused our attention on analyzing event based statistical properties of rainfall at a total of 84 locations the minimum inter event time was defined for each rain gauge in slovakia the estimates of inter event time are highly variable in space ranging from 8 to 45 h statistically independent rainfall events were analyzed to calculate event based statistics such as mean event duration mean event depth mean inter event time and mean incidence of events over a chosen season a strong linkage between tank sizes and altitude was observed which served as a bases for the development of empirical relationships between tank size and altitude envelope curves based on quantile regression were developed to predict required tank sizes for every location within the investigated region analytical probabilistic models require locally estimated event based rainfall statistics such as the rainfall volume duration and inter event time the presented statistics were determined for each of the 84 rain gauges for the first time as analytical probabilistic are gaining in popularity in the hydro meteorological community the presented local estimates of event based statistics of rainfall can be further used in analytical probabilistic models developed for detention basins bio retention systems infiltration systems and vegetated roofs to our best knowledge there has been no investigation of event based rainfall statistics in the central european setting undertaken yet that would focus also on the seasonal aspects which makes the presented results rather unique credit authorship contribution statement milan onderka methodology investigation formal

8293,study region the upper nan river basin northern thailand study focus precipitation is a major component of the hydrological cycle a large number of remotely sensed precipitation products are used in hydro meteorological studies the accuracy of these relies on basin climatology basin topography precipitation mechanism and precipitation sampling techniques used in satellites hence the precipitation products should be validated numerous studies have evaluated the reliability of satellite based precipitation products sbpps in the tropical asia however a handful of research has yet examined the reliability of these in thailand therefore in this study the reliability of six sbpps namely persiann persiann ccs persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt and imerg was tested by comparing against ground measured rainfall records and through simulating a hydrology model at daily and monthly time scales for a major head water catchment of the northern thailand new hydrological insights for the study region the results of this study revealed that sbpps had considerable differences when compared to rain gauge records and in reproducing observed streamflow of the upper nan river for instance persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42 rt demonstrated significant over estimates 5 54 while persiann and persiann ccs showed considerable under estimates 6 to 39 in terms of the hydrological utility the lowest skills were in persiann nash sutcliffe efficiency nse monthly 0 48 imerg was superior among the tested in capturing gauge measured daily with correlation coefficient r2 0 60 and monthly with r2 0 90 rainfall amounts and in simulating the hydrological model with nsemonthly 0 63 hence imerg demonstrates promising prospects for future hydro meteorological applications in this region the dynamic parameter approach which calibrated the hydrologic model with specific sbpps showed substantial improvements in reproducing observed streamflow when compared to the static approach which uses the same set of parameters calibrated through simulating the model with rain gauge data the results of this study essentially provide valuable feedback to identify the most suitable sbpps in watersheds under limited data availability with climatic and topographical features similar to the upper nan keywords hec hms precipitation sbpp streamflow upper nan river basin 1 introduction precipitation is a major component of the global hydrological cycle alazzy et al 2017 bai liu 2018 pfeifroth et al 2013 thiemig et al 2013 vergara et al 2014 accurate precipitation estimates are useful in developing sustainable water management strategies monitoring water quality forecasting landslides monitoring isotopes forecasting floods planning agricultural activities monitoring droughts etc alazzy et al 2017 bajracharya et al 2015 behrangi et al 2011 2014 bai and liu 2018 sirisena et al 2018 sorooshian et al 2011 brunetti et al 2018 solakian et al 2019 munksgaard et al 2019 the three most commonly used techniques to estimate precipitation are rain gauges weather radars and satellites li et al 2015a 2015b weather radars and satellites use indirect estimation techniques through scatter and attenuation of microwaves to measure precipitation while the gauge observations provide relatively direct ground precipitation estimates bai and liu 2018 however the complex topographical features limit installation and maintenance of dense rain gauge networks required for capturing the spatial variability of precipitation in addition dense rain gauge networks are often less common in the developing regions due to the high instalment and maintenance cost lakshmi et al 2018 beam blockage due to mountains and high rise buildings beam height variations ground clutter and complicated atmospheric conditions due to complex terrains restrict the use of weather radars in many regions of the world chokngamwong and chiu 2008 tian and peters lidard 2010 nguyen et al 2018 krajewski et al 2006 therefore satellite based precipitation products sbpps play a prominent role to carry out research over oceans in regions of extreme climates such as snow covered areas and deserts and complex topographies eg in steep mountain ranges importantly sbpps are a reliable source for research studies in river basins particularly in asia africa and south america in addition the meteorological observations from these regions frequently comprise erroneous rainfall records and suffer significant reporting time delays artan et al 2007 bitew and gebremichael 2011 koutsouris et al 2016 thiemig et al 2012 hence the most economical method of obtaining continuous rainfall measurements over the globe is through satellites the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm lunched by the joint efforts of north atlantic space agency nasa and japan aerospace exploration agency in 1997 was the first mission which aimed on studying latent heat cycles of the tropics nguyen et al 2018 kummerow et al 1998 anagnostou et al 2001 the currently adopted methods to measure precipitation in satellites are discussed in hong et al 2012 recent improvements of sbpp retrieval algorithms allow for representation of high spatiotemporal variations of rainfall estimates through satellites with higher quasi global coverage examples of extensively used sbpps are precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann family of products sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 ashouri et al 2015 climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products huffman et al 2007 integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurements imerg huffman et al 2015 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap ushio et al 2009 naval research laboratory developed blended satellite precipitation technique nrl blend turk and miller 2005 multisource weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 the accuracy of sbpps depends on precipitation type precipitation mechanism regional and seasonal climates basin topography and watershed size dinku et al 2010 seibert and vis 2012 sun et al 2018 tobin and bennett 2009 furthermore errors in sbpps are associated randomly due to systematic processes and sampling uncertainties ebert et al 2007 gebremichael et al 2014 villarini et al 2008 therefore validation of sbpps is essential the validation can be done through two methods they are 1 direct comparison of sbpps against rain gauge records and 2 evaluating streamflow simulation capacity by calibrating hydrological models bitew and gebremichael 2011 many studies including nguyen et al 2014 miao et al 2015 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2013 hobouchian et al 2017 wei et al 2018 pipunic et al 2015 attempted to evaluate the performance of sbpps with reference to rain gauge data in australia north america south america africa europe and asia multitude of studies reported the use of sbpps as the meteorological input for calibration of various hydrological models for river basins with complex topographies alazzy et al 2017 bui et al 2019 su et al 2017 bai and liu 2018 behrangi et al 2011 2014 bitew and gebremichael 2011 khan et al 2011 overall these studies suggest that there is no single sbpp which shows robust performance in all regions of the world moreover the expected level of accuracy of sbpps also depends on the purpose of its use despite the large amount of sbpp reliability assessments carried out in tropics less attention has yet focused for thailand as per authors best knowledge only janjai et al 2015 pakoksung and takagi 2016 chokngamwong and chiu 2008 li et al 2019 have attempted to evaluate the accuracy of sbpps over thailand among these li et al 2019 pakoksung and takagi 2016 performed an intercomparison between rain gauge data and satellite data and thereafter assessed the hydrologic utility of sbpps janjai et al 2015 chokngamwong and chiu 2008 evaluated the difference between estimates of rain gauge and satellite derived rainfall pakoksung and takagi 2016 used the rainfall runoff inundation model to simulate a historical monsoon flood event in the upper nan hence this particular research opens the light on future research prospects of persiann persiann ccs persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt and imerg for long term hydro meteorological model simulations which have not previously evaluated noteworthy this is the first study in thailand which attempted to evaluate hydrological utility of sbpps in the hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms model fleming 2013 the hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms is a conceptually based lumped model developed by the united states army corps of engineers feldman 2000 applications of hec hms in climate change impacts urbanization impact and land use change on streamflow have been reported by meenu et al 2013 al zahrani et al 2017 amini et al 2011 respectively the land in the upper nan river basin is dominated by mountainous forests and highlands wangpimool et al 2013 this further limits the establishment of a dense rain gauge network furthermore installation and maintenance costs of dense rain gauge networks are unbearable for a developing nation such as thailand the weather radars are not a viable choice for the upper nan due to radar beam blockage due to surrounding mountains moreover high financial costs associated will restrict the installation of weather radars these conditions make the upper nan a suitable test bed for evaluating the accuracy of sbpps in absence of rain gauge and radar data the present study evaluates the reliability of six sbpps persiann persiann ccs persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt and imerg during 2003 10 in daily and monthly scales the performance of the sbpps is evaluated by two distinct approaches they are 1 comparing rainfall estimates of sbpps against rain gauge records 2 evaluating streamflow simulation capacity through simulating the hec hms model with sbpps the results of this study provide reasonable answers to address what is the estimation error in each satellite rainfall product and what are the implications for a given hydrologic prediction which are often raised by hydrologists therefore this study demonstrates the usefulness of remotely sensed data for hydro meteorological applications in the upper nan river basin of thailand and elsewhere across the globe which are under gauged or ungauged 2 study area data collection and methodology 2 1 study area the upper nan river basin in northern thailand lies between latitudes of 17 42 12 19 37 48 n and longitudes of 100 06 30 102 21 48 e refer fig 1 it drains a geographical area of 13 000 km2 pakoksung and takagi 2016 the climate of this region is tropical monsoon and characterized by three distinct seasons rainy season or southwest monsoon mid may to late oct winter season early nov to late feb and summer season mid feb to mid may southwest monsoon is the dominant rainfall season in which nearly 80 of the annual rainfall is received intense rainfall events usually occur during july and august plangoen et al 2013 the low lying areas receive an annual average rainfall between 600 1000 mm while the annual rainfall in the mountainous regions is more than 1000 mm the weather is rather warm during mid february to mid may plangoen et al 2013 trisurat et al 2009 fig 2 illustrates topography through digital elevation model dem soil cover and land use in the upper nan river basin the dem of 150 m resolution was obtained from the royal thai survey department the altitude of this region varies between 0 2020 m above mean sea level refer fig 2a soil cover map of resolution 500 m and land use map of 90 m for the year 2010 were obtained from the land development department of thailand the dominant soil type slope complex covers nearly 85 of the watershed refer fig 2b more information on the soil types present in the study area can be found in wangpimool et al 2013 pakoksung and takagi 2016 ldd 2020 the main land uses of the upper nan river basin are forests and agricultural lands accounting for 71 and 15 of the land refer fig 2c pakoksung and takagi 2016 the upper nan river basin is an important source of livelihood for nearly 477 000 people wangpimool et al 2013 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 rain gauge and streamflow data rainfall gauges meteorological stations and the streamflow gauging station in the upper nan river basin used in this study are illustrated in fig 1 daily rainfall data during 2003 2010

irrigation department of thailand rid in addition daily rainfall data at tha wang pha station id 331 401 and nan station id 331 201 meteorological stations during 2003 2010 were collected from the thai meteorological department observed streamflow data at station ban bun nak wiang sa station id n 13a during 2003 2010 in daily frequency were obtained from the rid 2 2 2 satellite based precipitation products table 1 presents the general information of persiann persiann ccs persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt and imerg the precipitation data of persiann family of products are available in https chrsdata eng uci edu while tmpa and imerg products are available in https disc gsfc nasa gov tmpa version 7 products and imerg version 6 product are used in this study tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt persiann ccs and persiann cdr are hereinafter referred to as 3b42 tmpa rt ccs and cdr respectively 2 2 3 hec hms software the hec hms software comprises four components namely a basin model a meteorological model a specification control manager and a time series data manager this software offers eleven precipitation loss seven direct runoff five baseflow and eight routing methods for users it is capable of both event and continuous simulations a major advantage of hec hms is the availability in the public domain feldman 2000 2 3 methodology the sbpps used in this study were selected based on spatiotemporal resolution and common applications in the tropical region the period between 2003 2010 was established to perform the analysis for sbpps due to two reasons they were 1 persiann ccs data sets were only available from 2003 onwards 2 there was significant amount of missing data after 2010 in the obtained rainfall records therefore in order to enhance the reliability of the research carried out the available but quality data sets were decided to be used hence the study was limited to the period between 2003 2010 the point to pixel method was used to evaluate the performance satellite estimated rainfall by comparing with rain gauges the point refers to rain gauges while pixel refers to satellite based grids many studies including bai and liu 2018 sharifi et al 2016 vu et al 2018 thiemig et al 2012 adopted this approach to validate satellite rainfall with reference to rain gauge records statistical indicators were used to compare the accuracy of satellite rainfall products with reference to rain gauges at daily and monthly scales during 2003 2010 the hec hms model was then simulated by different precipitation products through calibrating by static and dynamic parameter approaches in order to evaluate the streamflow simulation capacity during 2003 2010 2 3 1 extraction of sbpps network common data form netcdf extractor tool lashkari et al 2018 was used to extract gridded precipitation data sets from netcdf files for 3b42 tmpa rt and imerg at grids closer to respective rain gauge locations precipitation data of persiann family of products was extracted in excel format 2 3 2 statistical evaluation of sbpps several statistical indices were used to assess the accuracy of sbpps observed rainfall detection capability in sbpps was evaluated through probability of detection pod critical success index csi false alarm ratio far and proportion correct pc these have been used by meng et al 2014 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 vu et al 2018 pod determines the likelihood of detected rainfall csi refers to correct estimation of the rain occurrence while removing the negative occurrence far provides a measure of the fraction of satellite diagnosed events which were actually false and pc represents the accuracy of detected rainfall ayub et al 2020 the governing equations of pod csi far and pc are given below by eq s 1 2 3 and 4 1 p o d

defined to differentiate rainfall days and non rainfall days in this study katiraie boroujerdy et al 2013 vu et al 2018 behrangi et al 2014 the accuracy in rainfall estimates of satellite products was measured by root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias coefficient of correlation r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse refer eq 5 8 meng et al 2014 5 r m s e i 1 n m i o i 2 n 6 p b i a s i 1 n m

statistical indices are provided in table a2 in appendix 2 3 3 watershed model development this study used hec hms 4 3 for rainfall runoff modeling the dem was initially fed into the hydrologic engineering center geospatial hydrologic modeling extension tool in arc geographical information system the thissen polygon method thiessen 1911 was used to calculate areal rainfall distributions over the upper nan river basin in the catchment delineation process a drainage area threshold of 500 km2 was assigned for stream definition in this study the upper nan river basin was delineated into thirteen sub basins refer fig a1 in the appendix the model was calibrated at j64 junction 64 refer fig a1 where observed streamflow data n 13a was available through the sensitivity analysis it was identified that the percent impervious area maximum infiltration tension storage and soil storage were the most sensitive parameters to streamflow volume the developed model was simulated in daily time steps detailed information on model structure and development can be found in scharffenberg and fleming 2006 fleming 2013 de silva et al 2014 thereafter manual calibration was performed to adjust parameters through trial and error procedure satisfying the goodness of fit criterion between observed and simulated discharges to maximize nse it was ensured that physical meaningful values were assigned for parameters following the ranges outlined by feldman 2000 the imperviousness is the percentage area under built up areas which does not allow infiltration this was assigned 20 by considering the land use types of the upper nan according to feldman et al 2000 maximum infiltration of loamy soil is 13 2 mm hour during calibration the value obtained for maximum infiltration in this study was 10 mm hour the assigned values for soil storage and tension storage are similar to de silva et al 2014 carried out in kelani river basin of sri lanka which has similar soil types to the upper nan furthermore feldman et al 2000 suggests that fixing several parameters in soil moisture accounting model is an iterative process which is determined by calibration with observed data refer table 2 the model was calibrated and validated using observed streamflow data at station n 13a draining a geographical area of 8573 km2 refer fig 1 precipitation losses direct runoff transformation base flow simulation and channel routing were simulated by soil moisture accounting model clark unit hydrograph clark 1945 recession method and muskingum method scharffenberg and fleming 2006 soil moisture accounting model feldman 2000 was used to simulate precipitation losses combined with canopy and surface methods for more details on soil moisture accounting model readers are encouraged to refer ouedraogo et al 2018 this study used static and dynamic approaches to calibrate parameters of the hydrological model as mentioned earlier the static parameter approach used calibrated parameters from the developed model with rainfall inputs from rain gauges the dynamic parameter approach used specific satellite rainfall inputs to calibrate the hydrological model the calibrated values of parameters in static parameter approach used in soil moisture accounting model are presented in table 2 in the dynamic parameter scenario only soil storage and tension storage were varied while keeping other parameters constant the hydrological model was calibrated between 2003 06 4 years and validated between 2007 10 4 years 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of satellite based precipitation products fig 3 a f provide station wise performance of rainfall detection indices pod csi far and pc for persiann ccs cdr 3b42 tmpa rt and imerg in daily time scale between 2003 2010 with respect to pod tmpa rt had the highest mean of 0 81 which is closer to a perfect score of 1 the values of pod ranged between 0 66 and 0 85 for tmpa rt the lowest mean of pod was in persiann which was 0 58 with values ranging between 0 39 and 0 67 in the context of far the best performance was demonstrated by 3b42 the mean value of far for 3b42 was 0 45 with a station wise variation of 0 30 and 0 60 the worst performance for far was from cdr data with a mean value of 0 59 with respect to csi the best agreement between satellite precipitation estimates and rain gauges was demonstrated by tmpa rt with a mean value of 0 47 and a station wise variation between 0 32 and 0 59 the poorest performance for csi was demonstrated by persiann with a mean value of 0 37 the station wise variation of csi for persiann was between 0 29 and 0 44 with respect to pc the highest mean value was in imerg which was 0 79 the station wise variation of imerg ranged between 0 70 and 0 84 the results implied that imerg was superior in detecting rain events followed by tmpa rt and 3b42 while the worst performance was demonstrated by persiann higher detection ability of precipitation events increases accurate estimations of soil moisture modeling resulting improved hydrological simulations behrangi et al 2011 generally sbpps performed better in capturing rainfall amounts captured by gauges in southern and middle regions compared to northern region in the upper nan which is dominated by mountains higher detection capability of sbpps in the southern and middle part of upper nan was also observed by pakoksung and takagi 2016 rmse and pbias of sbpps for daily precipitation estimates between 2003 2010 are given in table a3 in the appendix these rmse values obtained suggest that sbpps had similar ranges for rmses similar under estimations and over estimations in sbpps were demonstrated by behrangi et al 2011 chen et al 2011 for 3b42 shariﬁ et al 2016 for imerg quin et al 2014 for tmpa rt pakoksung and takagi 2016 for persiann miao et al 2015 bai and liu 2018 for cdr calculated r2 and nse with reference to rain gauge for areal rainfall in sbpps in daily and monthly time scales during 2003 2010 are illustrated through fig 4 a d the results showed that imerg outperformed other products generally the second best performance was displayed by 3b42 followed by tmpa rt and cdr in general r2 and nse of all sbpps decreased during validation 2007 10 when compared to calibration time period 3 2 evaluation of streamflow simulation capacity 3 2 1 static parameter approach fig 5 presents the hydrograph with model forced by rain gauge data during calibration 2003 2006 and validation 2007 2010 time periods nse is the best objective function for reflecting the overall fit of a hydrograph sevat and dezetter 1991 the results obtained for nse for hydrological modeling in this study is comparable with the hydrological model performance obtained in terms of nse by gathagu et al 2018 babel et al 2011 jha et al 2004 however there were several mismatches in some of the magnitudes and timings of peak flows for instance increases in rainfall in 2009 have not shown significant changes in observed streamflow this might be attributed to local rainfall events fig 6 a f illustrate hydrographs resulting from hydrological model forced by different sbpps hydrological simulations from input of persiann and ccs consistently under estimated observed streamflow although with an exception in 2009 noteworthy both cdr and 3b42 captured the peak flow in 2008 with a reasonable accuracy interestingly cdr captured peak flow in 2005 although 3b42 was unable to capture this peak however in general both cdr and 3b42 under estimated most of the major and minor peak flows nevertheless imerg has adequately captured several peak flows but still misrepresented minor peak flows in 2007 2008 and 2009 and major peak flows in 2004 2006 and 2010 moreover some of the peak flows generated by imerg were slightly ahead and behind of time reliable model performance was observed during both calibration and validation time periods from the model forced by rain gauge records followed by imerg cdr tmpa rt and 3b42 r2 and nse obtained through forcing the hydrologic model by different precipitation products static parameter approach are given in table 3 persiann showed worst skills followed by ccs in streamflow simulations as visible through statistical indicators and visual comparisons the relatively poor performance for simulating extreme streamﬂow can be observed due to the choice of hydrologic model and largely linked to the skill of the precipitation products in capturing precipitation events behrangi et al 2014 as discussed earlier in section 3 1 hydrographs generated through imerg and rain gauges were remarkably similar with statistical indicators in closer agreements the fine spatial resolution of imerg 0 10 0 10 might have resulted in the increased hydrologic utility the differences in hydrologic simulation capabilities are attributed to the variations in sbpps since precipitation is the primary forcing for hydrological models variations in precipitation inputs are expected to cause such disparities bajracharya et al 2015 the mismatches between observed and simulated streamflow might be due to uncertainties in sbpps due to sampling instrumental and algorithmic errors propagated into the developed hydrological model gebregiorgis and hossain 2014 the over estimations of minor peaks in tmpa rt and 3b42 can be attributed to over estimation in overall precipitation amounts interestingly the trmm s real time product tmpa rt posed better performance during the calibration time period compared to trmm s post real time product 3b42 interestingly similar findings were reported by bitew et al 2012 the extra sampling techniques in precipitation estimates of imerg might have resulted accurate precipitation estimations leading to increase hydrological simulation capabilities in general all simulated hydrographs generally reproduced the respective precipitation pattern 3 2 2 dynamic parameter approach table 4 provides the results from dynamic parameter approach for different sbpps moreover fig 7 a f illustrate the hydrographs obtained for sbpps through dynamic parameter approach the persiann and css have still consistently under estimated peak flows with the exception of 2009 similar to the static approach the highest skill in hydrological simulations was illustrated by imerg data sets through the dynamic approach in general the dynamic parameter approach which used parameters for calibration through specific satellite rainfall estimates substantially improved hydrological model performance when compared with the static approach this can be clearly seen through statistical comparisons and graphical comparisons for instance the peak in 2003 which was not captured by static parameter approach was captured through the dynamic parameter approach for cdr this may be due to buffering large differences in the precipitation inputs inside the hydrological model through parameter calibration procedure it is clear that sbpps which used multiple input sensors 3b42 tmpa rt and imerg performed better than the single input sensors for precipitation estimation in addition the sbpps which incorporate bias correction algorithms imerg 3b42 and cdr performed better among the six types analyzed in this study the role of bias adjustment is seen in improvements of 3b42 over tmpa rt which does not incorporate bias adjustments similar findings were demonstrated by quin et al 2014 4 conclusions this study demonstrates the usefulness of sbpps in the upper nan river basin thailand for applications in climatological and hydrological modelling the accuracy of six satellite based precipitation products in predicting rainfall and simulating streamflow was examined for the upper nan river basin of northern thailand rainfall data from 2003 to 2010 of persiann ccs cdr 3b42 tmpa rt and imerg were evaluated with reference to rain gauge data these sbpps were then used to calibrate the hec hms model through static and dynamic approaches closer agreements in detecting rain events and capturing rainfall amounts recorded by rain gauges was demonstrated by imerg it was also capable of simulating observed streamflow rates with a reasonable accuracy calibrating the hydrological model with sbpps through the dynamic approach showed closer agreements with observed streamflow model when compared to the static approach this suggests that calibrating with specific satellite inputs mask the differences in rainfall data the similarity between precipitation and streamflow errors suggest that significant improvement in streamflow simulation is possible if enhanced fine resolution sbpps are available as precipitation is the major forcing factor for hydrologic simulations the differences between rain gauge and sbpp data are clearly manifested in simulated streamflow imerg is capable of simulating peak discharges fairly well when compared to other satellite products therefore it is a recommended choice for flood forecasting applications in the upper nan which faces annual floods the findings of this study are essentially valuable for sbpp developers to improve data retrieval and bias correction algorithms in the tropical region moreover it is recommended that imerg might be suitable in watersheds elsewhere which have similar topographical and climatic characteristics further research in investigating the utility of imerg is advocated in middle low latitude and humid zones funding this study was carried out in the environment of sri lanka institute

8293,study region the upper nan river basin northern thailand study focus precipitation is a major component of the hydrological cycle a large number of remotely sensed precipitation products are used in hydro meteorological studies the accuracy of these relies on basin climatology basin topography precipitation mechanism and precipitation sampling techniques used in satellites hence the precipitation products should be validated numerous studies have evaluated the reliability of satellite based precipitation products sbpps in the tropical asia however a handful of research has yet examined the reliability of these in thailand therefore in this study the reliability of six sbpps namely persiann persiann ccs persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt and imerg was tested by comparing against ground measured rainfall records and through simulating a hydrology model at daily and monthly time scales for a major head water catchment of the northern thailand new hydrological insights for the study region the results of this study revealed that sbpps had considerable differences when compared to rain gauge records and in reproducing observed streamflow of the upper nan river for instance persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42 rt demonstrated significant over estimates 5 54 while persiann and persiann ccs showed considerable under estimates 6 to 39 in terms of the hydrological utility the lowest skills were in persiann nash sutcliffe efficiency nse monthly 0 48 imerg was superior among the tested in capturing gauge measured daily with correlation coefficient r2 0 60 and monthly with r2 0 90 rainfall amounts and in simulating the hydrological model with nsemonthly 0 63 hence imerg demonstrates promising prospects for future hydro meteorological applications in this region the dynamic parameter approach which calibrated the hydrologic model with specific sbpps showed substantial improvements in reproducing observed streamflow when compared to the static approach which uses the same set of parameters calibrated through simulating the model with rain gauge data the results of this study essentially provide valuable feedback to identify the most suitable sbpps in watersheds under limited data availability with climatic and topographical features similar to the upper nan keywords hec hms precipitation sbpp streamflow upper nan river basin 1 introduction precipitation is a major component of the global hydrological cycle alazzy et al 2017 bai liu 2018 pfeifroth et al 2013 thiemig et al 2013 vergara et al 2014 accurate precipitation estimates are useful in developing sustainable water management strategies monitoring water quality forecasting landslides monitoring isotopes forecasting floods planning agricultural activities monitoring droughts etc alazzy et al 2017 bajracharya et al 2015 behrangi et al 2011 2014 bai and liu 2018 sirisena et al 2018 sorooshian et al 2011 brunetti et al 2018 solakian et al 2019 munksgaard et al 2019 the three most commonly used techniques to estimate precipitation are rain gauges weather radars and satellites li et al 2015a 2015b weather radars and satellites use indirect estimation techniques through scatter and attenuation of microwaves to measure precipitation while the gauge observations provide relatively direct ground precipitation estimates bai and liu 2018 however the complex topographical features limit installation and maintenance of dense rain gauge networks required for capturing the spatial variability of precipitation in addition dense rain gauge networks are often less common in the developing regions due to the high instalment and maintenance cost lakshmi et al 2018 beam blockage due to mountains and high rise buildings beam height variations ground clutter and complicated atmospheric conditions due to complex terrains restrict the use of weather radars in many regions of the world chokngamwong and chiu 2008 tian and peters lidard 2010 nguyen et al 2018 krajewski et al 2006 therefore satellite based precipitation products sbpps play a prominent role to carry out research over oceans in regions of extreme climates such as snow covered areas and deserts and complex topographies eg in steep mountain ranges importantly sbpps are a reliable source for research studies in river basins particularly in asia africa and south america in addition the meteorological observations from these regions frequently comprise erroneous rainfall records and suffer significant reporting time delays artan et al 2007 bitew and gebremichael 2011 koutsouris et al 2016 thiemig et al 2012 hence the most economical method of obtaining continuous rainfall measurements over the globe is through satellites the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm lunched by the joint efforts of north atlantic space agency nasa and japan aerospace exploration agency in 1997 was the first mission which aimed on studying latent heat cycles of the tropics nguyen et al 2018 kummerow et al 1998 anagnostou et al 2001 the currently adopted methods to measure precipitation in satellites are discussed in hong et al 2012 recent improvements of sbpp retrieval algorithms allow for representation of high spatiotemporal variations of rainfall estimates through satellites with higher quasi global coverage examples of extensively used sbpps are precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann family of products sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 ashouri et al 2015 climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products huffman et al 2007 integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurements imerg huffman et al 2015 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap ushio et al 2009 naval research laboratory developed blended satellite precipitation technique nrl blend turk and miller 2005 multisource weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 the accuracy of sbpps depends on precipitation type precipitation mechanism regional and seasonal climates basin topography and watershed size dinku et al 2010 seibert and vis 2012 sun et al 2018 tobin and bennett 2009 furthermore errors in sbpps are associated randomly due to systematic processes and sampling uncertainties ebert et al 2007 gebremichael et al 2014 villarini et al 2008 therefore validation of sbpps is essential the validation can be done through two methods they are 1 direct comparison of sbpps against rain gauge records and 2 evaluating streamflow simulation capacity by calibrating hydrological models bitew and gebremichael 2011 many studies including nguyen et al 2014 miao et al 2015 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2013 hobouchian et al 2017 wei et al 2018 pipunic et al 2015 attempted to evaluate the performance of sbpps with reference to rain gauge data in australia north america south america africa europe and asia multitude of studies reported the use of sbpps as the meteorological input for calibration of various hydrological models for river basins with complex topographies alazzy et al 2017 bui et al 2019 su et al 2017 bai and liu 2018 behrangi et al 2011 2014 bitew and gebremichael 2011 khan et al 2011 overall these studies suggest that there is no single sbpp which shows robust performance in all regions of the world moreover the expected level of accuracy of sbpps also depends on the purpose of its use despite the large amount of sbpp reliability assessments carried out in tropics less attention has yet focused for thailand as per authors best knowledge only janjai et al 2015 pakoksung and takagi 2016 chokngamwong and chiu 2008 li et al 2019 have attempted to evaluate the accuracy of sbpps over thailand among these li et al 2019 pakoksung and takagi 2016 performed an intercomparison between rain gauge data and satellite data and thereafter assessed the hydrologic utility of sbpps janjai et al 2015 chokngamwong and chiu 2008 evaluated the difference between estimates of rain gauge and satellite derived rainfall pakoksung and takagi 2016 used the rainfall runoff inundation model to simulate a historical monsoon flood event in the upper nan hence this particular research opens the light on future research prospects of persiann persiann ccs persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt and imerg for long term hydro meteorological model simulations which have not previously evaluated noteworthy this is the first study in thailand which attempted to evaluate hydrological utility of sbpps in the hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms model fleming 2013 the hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms is a conceptually based lumped model developed by the united states army corps of engineers feldman 2000 applications of hec hms in climate change impacts urbanization impact and land use change on streamflow have been reported by meenu et al 2013 al zahrani et al 2017 amini et al 2011 respectively the land in the upper nan river basin is dominated by mountainous forests and highlands wangpimool et al 2013 this further limits the establishment of a dense rain gauge network furthermore installation and maintenance costs of dense rain gauge networks are unbearable for a developing nation such as thailand the weather radars are not a viable choice for the upper nan due to radar beam blockage due to surrounding mountains moreover high financial costs associated will restrict the installation of weather radars these conditions make the upper nan a suitable test bed for evaluating the accuracy of sbpps in absence of rain gauge and radar data the present study evaluates the reliability of six sbpps persiann persiann ccs persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt and imerg during 2003 10 in daily and monthly scales the performance of the sbpps is evaluated by two distinct approaches they are 1 comparing rainfall estimates of sbpps against rain gauge records 2 evaluating streamflow simulation capacity through simulating the hec hms model with sbpps the results of this study provide reasonable answers to address what is the estimation error in each satellite rainfall product and what are the implications for a given hydrologic prediction which are often raised by hydrologists therefore this study demonstrates the usefulness of remotely sensed data for hydro meteorological applications in the upper nan river basin of thailand and elsewhere across the globe which are under gauged or ungauged 2 study area data collection and methodology 2 1 study area the upper nan river basin in northern thailand lies between latitudes of 17 42 12 19 37 48 n and longitudes of 100 06 30 102 21 48 e refer fig 1 it drains a geographical area of 13 000 km2 pakoksung and takagi 2016 the climate of this region is tropical monsoon and characterized by three distinct seasons rainy season or southwest monsoon mid may to late oct winter season early nov to late feb and summer season mid feb to mid may southwest monsoon is the dominant rainfall season in which nearly 80 of the annual rainfall is received intense rainfall events usually occur during july and august plangoen et al 2013 the low lying areas receive an annual average rainfall between 600 1000 mm while the annual rainfall in the mountainous regions is more than 1000 mm the weather is rather warm during mid february to mid may plangoen et al 2013 trisurat et al 2009 fig 2 illustrates topography through digital elevation model dem soil cover and land use in the upper nan river basin the dem of 150 m resolution was obtained from the royal thai survey department the altitude of this region varies between 0 2020 m above mean sea level refer fig 2a soil cover map of resolution 500 m and land use map of 90 m for the year 2010 were obtained from the land development department of thailand the dominant soil type slope complex covers nearly 85 of the watershed refer fig 2b more information on the soil types present in the study area can be found in wangpimool et al 2013 pakoksung and takagi 2016 ldd 2020 the main land uses of the upper nan river basin are forests and agricultural lands accounting for 71 and 15 of the land refer fig 2c pakoksung and takagi 2016 the upper nan river basin is an important source of livelihood for nearly 477 000 people wangpimool et al 2013 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 rain gauge and streamflow data rainfall gauges meteorological stations and the streamflow gauging station in the upper nan river basin used in this study are illustrated in fig 1 daily rainfall data during 2003 2010

irrigation department of thailand rid in addition daily rainfall data at tha wang pha station id 331 401 and nan station id 331 201 meteorological stations during 2003 2010 were collected from the thai meteorological department observed streamflow data at station ban bun nak wiang sa station id n 13a during 2003 2010 in daily frequency were obtained from the rid 2 2 2 satellite based precipitation products table 1 presents the general information of persiann persiann ccs persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt and imerg the precipitation data of persiann family of products are available in https chrsdata eng uci edu while tmpa and imerg products are available in https disc gsfc nasa gov tmpa version 7 products and imerg version 6 product are used in this study tmpa 3b42 tmpa 3b42 rt persiann ccs and persiann cdr are hereinafter referred to as 3b42 tmpa rt ccs and cdr respectively 2 2 3 hec hms software the hec hms software comprises four components namely a basin model a meteorological model a specification control manager and a time series data manager this software offers eleven precipitation loss seven direct runoff five baseflow and eight routing methods for users it is capable of both event and continuous simulations a major advantage of hec hms is the availability in the public domain feldman 2000 2 3 methodology the sbpps used in this study were selected based on spatiotemporal resolution and common applications in the tropical region the period between 2003 2010 was established to perform the analysis for sbpps due to two reasons they were 1 persiann ccs data sets were only available from 2003 onwards 2 there was significant amount of missing data after 2010 in the obtained rainfall records therefore in order to enhance the reliability of the research carried out the available but quality data sets were decided to be used hence the study was limited to the period between 2003 2010 the point to pixel method was used to evaluate the performance satellite estimated rainfall by comparing with rain gauges the point refers to rain gauges while pixel refers to satellite based grids many studies including bai and liu 2018 sharifi et al 2016 vu et al 2018 thiemig et al 2012 adopted this approach to validate satellite rainfall with reference to rain gauge records statistical indicators were used to compare the accuracy of satellite rainfall products with reference to rain gauges at daily and monthly scales during 2003 2010 the hec hms model was then simulated by different precipitation products through calibrating by static and dynamic parameter approaches in order to evaluate the streamflow simulation capacity during 2003 2010 2 3 1 extraction of sbpps network common data form netcdf extractor tool lashkari et al 2018 was used to extract gridded precipitation data sets from netcdf files for 3b42 tmpa rt and imerg at grids closer to respective rain gauge locations precipitation data of persiann family of products was extracted in excel format 2 3 2 statistical evaluation of sbpps several statistical indices were used to assess the accuracy of sbpps observed rainfall detection capability in sbpps was evaluated through probability of detection pod critical success index csi false alarm ratio far and proportion correct pc these have been used by meng et al 2014 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 vu et al 2018 pod determines the likelihood of detected rainfall csi refers to correct estimation of the rain occurrence while removing the negative occurrence far provides a measure of the fraction of satellite diagnosed events which were actually false and pc represents the accuracy of detected rainfall ayub et al 2020 the governing equations of pod csi far and pc are given below by eq s 1 2 3 and 4 1 p o d

defined to differentiate rainfall days and non rainfall days in this study katiraie boroujerdy et al 2013 vu et al 2018 behrangi et al 2014 the accuracy in rainfall estimates of satellite products was

statistical indices are provided in table a2 in appendix 2 3 3 watershed model development this study used hec hms 4 3 for rainfall runoff modeling the dem was initially fed into the hydrologic engineering center geospatial hydrologic modeling extension tool in arc geographical information system the thissen polygon method thiessen 1911 was used to calculate areal rainfall distributions over the upper nan river basin in the catchment delineation process a drainage area threshold of 500 km2 was assigned for stream definition in this study the upper nan river basin was delineated into thirteen sub basins refer fig a1 in the appendix the model was calibrated at j64 junction 64 refer fig a1 where observed streamflow data n 13a was available through the sensitivity analysis it was identified that the percent impervious area maximum infiltration tension storage and soil storage were the most sensitive parameters to streamflow volume the developed model was simulated in daily time steps detailed information on model structure and development can be found in scharffenberg and fleming 2006 fleming 2013 de silva et al 2014 thereafter manual calibration was performed to adjust parameters through trial and error procedure satisfying the goodness of fit criterion between observed and simulated discharges to maximize nse it was ensured that physical meaningful values were assigned for parameters following the ranges outlined by feldman 2000 the imperviousness is the percentage area under built up areas which does not allow infiltration this was assigned 20 by considering the land use types of the upper nan according to feldman et al 2000 maximum infiltration of loamy soil is 13 2 mm hour during calibration the value obtained for maximum infiltration in this study was 10 mm hour the assigned values for soil storage and tension storage are similar to de silva et al 2014 carried out in kelani river basin of sri lanka which has similar soil types to the upper nan furthermore feldman et al 2000 suggests that fixing several parameters in soil moisture accounting model is an iterative process which is determined by calibration with observed data refer table 2 the model was calibrated and validated using observed streamflow data at station n 13a draining a geographical area of 8573 km2 refer fig 1 precipitation losses direct runoff transformation base flow simulation and channel routing were simulated by soil moisture accounting model clark unit hydrograph clark 1945 recession method and muskingum method scharffenberg and fleming 2006 soil moisture accounting model feldman 2000 was used to simulate precipitation losses combined with canopy and surface methods for more details on soil moisture accounting model readers are encouraged to refer ouedraogo et al 2018 this study used static and dynamic approaches to calibrate parameters of the hydrological model as mentioned earlier the static parameter approach used calibrated parameters from the developed model with rainfall inputs from rain gauges the dynamic parameter approach used specific satellite rainfall inputs to calibrate the hydrological model the calibrated values of parameters in static parameter approach used in soil moisture accounting model are presented in table 2 in the dynamic parameter scenario only soil storage and tension storage were varied while keeping other parameters constant the hydrological model was calibrated between 2003 06 4 years and validated between 2007 10 4 years 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of satellite based precipitation products fig 3 a f provide station wise performance of rainfall detection indices pod csi far and pc for persiann ccs cdr 3b42 tmpa rt and imerg in daily time scale between 2003 2010 with respect to pod tmpa rt had the highest mean of 0 81 which is closer to a perfect score of 1 the values of pod ranged between 0 66 and 0 85 for tmpa rt the lowest mean of pod was in persiann which was 0 58 with values ranging between 0 39 and 0 67 in the context of far the best performance was demonstrated by 3b42 the mean value of far for 3b42 was 0 45 with a station wise variation of 0 30 and 0 60 the worst performance for far was from cdr data with a mean value of 0 59 with respect to csi the best agreement between satellite precipitation estimates and rain gauges was demonstrated by tmpa rt with a mean value of 0 47 and a station wise variation between 0 32 and 0 59 the poorest performance for csi was demonstrated by persiann with a mean value of 0 37 the station wise variation of csi for persiann was between 0 29 and 0 44 with respect to pc the highest mean value was in imerg which was 0 79 the station wise variation of imerg ranged between 0 70 and 0 84 the results implied that imerg was superior in detecting rain events followed by tmpa rt and 3b42 while the worst performance was demonstrated by persiann higher detection ability of precipitation events increases accurate estimations of soil moisture modeling resulting improved hydrological simulations behrangi et al 2011 generally sbpps performed better in capturing rainfall amounts captured by gauges in southern and middle regions compared to northern region in the upper nan which is dominated by mountains higher detection capability of sbpps in the southern and middle part of upper nan was also observed by pakoksung and takagi 2016 rmse and pbias of sbpps for daily precipitation estimates between 2003 2010 are given in table a3 in the appendix these rmse values obtained suggest that sbpps had similar ranges for rmses similar under estimations and over estimations in sbpps were demonstrated by behrangi et al 2011 chen et al 2011 for 3b42 shariﬁ et al 2016 for imerg quin et al 2014 for tmpa rt pakoksung and takagi 2016 for persiann miao et al 2015 bai and liu 2018 for cdr calculated r2 and nse with reference to rain gauge for areal rainfall in sbpps in daily and monthly time scales during 2003 2010 are illustrated through fig 4 a d the results showed that imerg outperformed other products generally the second best performance was displayed by 3b42 followed by tmpa rt and cdr in general r2 and nse of all sbpps decreased during validation 2007 10 when compared to calibration time period 3 2 evaluation of streamflow simulation capacity 3 2 1 static parameter approach fig 5 presents the hydrograph with model forced by rain gauge data during calibration 2003 2006 and validation 2007 2010 time periods nse is the best objective function for reflecting the overall fit of a hydrograph sevat and dezetter 1991 the results obtained for nse for hydrological modeling in this study is comparable with the hydrological model performance obtained in terms of nse by gathagu et al 2018 babel et al 2011 jha et al 2004 however there were several mismatches in some of the magnitudes and timings of peak flows for instance increases in rainfall in 2009 have not shown significant changes in observed streamflow this might be attributed to local rainfall events fig 6 a f illustrate hydrographs resulting from hydrological model forced by different sbpps hydrological simulations from input of persiann and ccs consistently under estimated observed streamflow although with an exception in 2009 noteworthy both cdr and 3b42 captured the peak flow in 2008 with a reasonable accuracy interestingly cdr captured peak flow in 2005 although 3b42 was unable to capture this peak however in general both cdr and 3b42 under estimated most of the major and minor peak flows nevertheless imerg has adequately captured several peak flows but still misrepresented minor peak flows in 2007 2008 and 2009 and major peak flows in 2004 2006 and 2010 moreover some of the peak flows generated by imerg were slightly ahead and behind of time reliable model performance was observed during both calibration and validation time periods from the model forced by rain gauge records followed by imerg cdr tmpa rt and 3b42 r2 and nse obtained through forcing the hydrologic model by different precipitation products static parameter approach are given in table 3 persiann showed worst skills followed by ccs in streamflow simulations as visible through statistical indicators and visual comparisons the relatively poor performance for simulating extreme streamﬂow can be observed due to the choice of hydrologic model and largely linked to the skill of the precipitation products in capturing precipitation events behrangi et al 2014 as discussed earlier in section 3 1 hydrographs generated through imerg and rain gauges were remarkably similar with statistical indicators in closer agreements the fine spatial resolution of imerg 0 10 0 10 might have resulted in the increased hydrologic utility the differences in hydrologic simulation capabilities are attributed to the variations in sbpps since precipitation is the primary forcing for hydrological models variations in precipitation inputs are expected to cause such disparities bajracharya et al 2015 the mismatches between observed and simulated streamflow might be due to uncertainties in sbpps due to sampling instrumental and algorithmic errors propagated into the developed hydrological model gebregiorgis and hossain 2014 the over estimations of minor peaks in tmpa rt and 3b42 can be attributed to over estimation in overall precipitation amounts interestingly the trmm s real time product tmpa rt posed better performance during the calibration time period compared to trmm s post real time product 3b42 interestingly similar findings were reported by bitew et al 2012 the extra sampling techniques in precipitation estimates of imerg might have resulted accurate precipitation estimations leading to increase hydrological simulation capabilities in general all simulated hydrographs generally reproduced the respective precipitation pattern 3 2 2 dynamic parameter approach table 4 provides the results from dynamic parameter approach for different sbpps moreover fig 7 a f illustrate the hydrographs obtained for sbpps through dynamic parameter approach the persiann and css have still consistently under estimated peak flows with the exception of 2009 similar to the static approach the highest skill in hydrological simulations was illustrated by imerg data sets through the dynamic approach in general the dynamic parameter approach which used parameters for calibration through specific satellite rainfall estimates substantially improved hydrological model performance when compared with the static approach this can be clearly seen through statistical comparisons and graphical comparisons for instance the peak in 2003 which was not captured by static parameter approach was captured through the dynamic parameter approach for cdr this may be due to buffering large differences in the precipitation inputs inside the hydrological model through parameter calibration procedure it is clear that sbpps which used multiple input sensors 3b42 tmpa rt and imerg performed better than the single input sensors for precipitation estimation in addition the sbpps which incorporate bias correction algorithms imerg 3b42 and cdr performed better among the six types analyzed in this study the role of bias adjustment is seen in improvements of 3b42 over tmpa rt which does not incorporate bias adjustments similar findings were demonstrated by quin et al 2014 4 conclusions this study demonstrates the usefulness of sbpps in the upper nan river basin thailand for applications in climatological and hydrological modelling the accuracy of six satellite based precipitation products in predicting rainfall and simulating streamflow was examined for the upper nan river basin of northern thailand rainfall data from 2003 to 2010 of persiann ccs cdr 3b42 tmpa rt and imerg were evaluated with reference to rain gauge data these sbpps were then used to calibrate the hec hms model through static and dynamic approaches closer agreements in detecting rain events and capturing rainfall amounts recorded by rain gauges was demonstrated by imerg it was also capable of simulating observed streamflow rates with a reasonable accuracy calibrating the hydrological model with sbpps through the dynamic approach showed closer agreements with observed streamflow model when compared to the static approach this suggests that calibrating with specific satellite inputs mask the differences in rainfall data the similarity between precipitation and streamflow errors suggest that significant improvement in streamflow simulation is possible if enhanced fine resolution sbpps are available as precipitation is the major forcing factor for hydrologic simulations the differences between rain gauge and sbpp data are clearly manifested in simulated streamflow imerg is capable of simulating peak discharges fairly well when compared to other satellite products therefore it is a recommended choice for flood forecasting applications in the upper nan which faces annual floods the findings of this study are essentially valuable for sbpp developers to improve data retrieval and bias correction algorithms in the tropical region moreover it is recommended that imerg might be suitable in watersheds elsewhere which have similar topographical and climatic characteristics further research in investigating the utility of imerg is advocated in middle low latitude and humid zones funding this study was carried out in the environment of sri lanka institute

8294,study region the mekong basin where climate change and anthropogenic interventions e g dams sand mining and sluice gates have intensified in the recent decades affecting the pristine flow regime and salinity intrusion study focus this paper aims at quantifying the flow regime alterations in the entire mekong from 1980 to 2015 and linking with the controlling drivers of alterations in this regard various indicators analytical methods and a semi two dimensional hydrodynamic and advection dispersion model were used new hydrological insights for the region the flow regime alterations in the high dam development period 2009 2015 are more pronounced than in the low dam development period 1993 2008 compared to the no dam development period 1980 1992 based on most of the indicators analyzed in the high dam development period all existing dams with large reservoir capacity seemed to have cumulatively reduced the flood pulses and frequency and increased the low flow discharge along the entire mekong through reservoir operations exceeding climate change effect in the recent years the water levels in the low flow season in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd have decreased possibly because of increased riverbed incision caused by reduced sediment supply and increased sand mining the reduced water levels together with the increased number of the sluice gates constructed seemed to have increased salinity intrusion in the vmd which may be partly reduced by early emergency water release from upstream dams keywords hydropower dams flow regimes discharge the mekong vietnamese mekong delta vmd salinity intrusion 1 introduction natural river flow regimes produce spatial and temporal variations in environmental conditions which are crucial to support native biodiversity and the integrity of riverine ecosystems poff and ward 1989 richter et al 1998 flood pulse is the primary driving forces for the productivity of ecosystems in the mekong river the mekong basin räsänen et al 2017 the longitudinal connectivity and dynamic flow variability between the mekong and its floodplains are needed for sustaining fish migration and promoting the exchange of water sediment and nutrients in this regard the tonle sap lake plays an important role as a natural reservoir to regulate the flood pulse of its downstream floodplains in cambodia and vietnam by receiving flows from the upstream reaches during high flow periods and releasing water back to the mekong during low flow periods pokhrel et al 2018 however increased socioeconomic development of the recent decades has led to the construction of hydropower dams weirs and reservoirs for multi purposes water diversions for irrigation and navigation and sluice gates for flow and salinity control yin et al 2015 in the mekong basin 130 dams have been built and planned since the 1990s of which 64 large dams 15 m high were completed by 2017 hecht et al 2019 fig 1 the total storage capacity of the 64 existing dams is over 82 km3 table s1 accounting for more than 98 of the annual discharges at the chiang saen station of which six mega mainstream hydropower dams in the upper mekong known as lancang cascade constitute approximately 50 table 1 among the 64 existing dams 13 dams are in the upper mekong and another 51 dams are in the tributaries of the lower mekong basin these hydraulic infrastructures have significantly altered flow regimes of the mekong by affecting the quality quantity and intra and inter annual variations of the flow regime such as frequency timing and duration of the flood discharges lauri et al 2012 lu et al 2014 manh et al 2015 räsänen et al 2017 dams normally cut the flood peak and reduce the amplitude of annual flood pulses causing disconnection between rivers and floodplains dams also trap sediment reducing the sediment volume that can be transported downstream to maintain river channels and coastal landforms kondolf et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 additionally dam operations may cause prolonged and earlier salinity intrusion in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd mai et al 2018 because of riverbed degradation caused by upstream dam development and sand mining binh et al 2018a 2020 eslami et al 2019 moreover fish migration paths are blocked by dams pokhrel et al 2018 leading to losses of biodiversity and degradation of the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the mekong basin arias et al 2014 climate and land use changes are also major drivers that alter the hydrologic regime bao et al 2012 milliman et al 2008 wang et al 2006 with significant impacts on social and environmental variables changing rainfall intensity and patterns induced by climate change could result in changing hydrological circle wang et al 2017 although climate change is known as one of the drivers of flow alterations its impacts on flow regime alterations in the mekong are profusely smaller than those caused by hydropower dams arias et al 2014 lauri et al 2012 a similar trend was found in the yellow river where the annual runoff decreased by 82 although the annual precipitation exhibited only slight changes milliman et al 2008 additionally dam induced flow regime alterations in the mekong basin far exceed the land use induced influence li et al 2017 understanding long term alterations of the flow regimes along the mekong is of crucial importance for evidence based sustainable water management strategies and informed decisions to share benefits from the transboundary mekong in the coming decades any decision from stakeholders based on a short term flow analysis may lead to unsustainable development therefore the functioning of existing high dike systems and salinity control sluice gates in the vmd has been heavily debated and revised many scientists have argued against these structures because they may worsen the situation e g triet et al 2017 high dike systems may destroy soil properties and wetland ecosystems because nutrient rich fine sediment blocks access to the wetlands and agriculture areas furthermore salinity control sluice gates may increase the intrusion length up river because of reduced buffering zones near the estuaries it may well be that these structures were suitable at the time of being built however they may have become a constraint in recent years because of unexpected flow regime alterations that outrange the design values therefore the investigation of long term flow regime alterations plays a fundamental reference for sustainable water resource management strategies various studies have sought to understand the impacts of dams along the mekong basin binh et al 2020 li et al 2017 räsänen et al 2017 and some have worked to adapt and apply adaptive measures to specific areas within the delta or the lower mekong ha et al 2018a smajgl et al 2015 triet et al 2017 however long term flow alterations along the entire lower mekong especially the vmd have not been fully understood which may in turn challenge proposed adaptive measures in this context the specific shortcoming of prior studies is the lack of comprehensive assessment that links long term hydrologic flow regime alterations to the controlling factors and management variables the goals of this work are 1 to quantify long term flow regime alterations along the entire lower mekong including the vmd and 2 to link flow regime alterations with the controlling factors including climate variability and dams based on these understanding we propose possible interventions across various regions in the mekong basin to improve water and environmental management the outcomes of this research can be referred by stakeholders to plan strategic river basin management and to make sustainable long term decisions one of the unique contributions of our study is providing evidence based historical changes of the hydrology in the vmd which is important for informing future preparedness and adaptive strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mekong is 4880 km long and has a catchment area of 795 000 km2 running through china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam before emptying into the east sea of vietnam fig 1 the mekong basin is spatially divided into the upper mekong or the lancang 24 of the total area and lower mekong 76 of the total area the upper mekong is widely defined as the area upstream of chiang saen thailand and lies mostly in china it contributes 34 of the mean annual discharge at pakse kiem et al 2008 and approximately 18 of the mean annual flow of the mekong mekong river commission mrc 2005 but up to 75 and 40 of the low flows at vientiane and kratie respectively adamson et al 2009 the lower mekong lies in thailand laos cambodia and vietnam approximately 85 90 of the mekong s flow occurs in the wet season may october with an average peak flow of approximately 45 000 m3 s lu and siew 2006 controlled by monsoon precipitation and the flow from the left bank tributaries in laos and vietnam cook et al 2012 the remaining 10 15 of the river flow takes place in the dry season november april with an average minimum discharge of approximately 1500 m3 s controlled by the flow from snow melt in the upper mekong located in the lowermost of the mekong the vmd is home to approximately 17 million people whose livelihoods are dependent on agriculture and aquaculture the vmd is a low lying area having an average ground elevation of 0 7 1 2 m the total area of the vmd is approximately 39 000 km2 from the vietnam cambodia border several kilometers upstream of the tan chau and chau doc gauging stations to the east and west seas of vietnam fig 1 there are two main waterways in the vmd the tien and hau rivers vietnamese names of the mekong and bassac rivers the tien river conveys approximately 80 of the flow and the hau river transports approximately 20 the flood season in the vmd extends from june july to november december while the dry season lasts for nearly half the year from november december to may june the vmd is one of the most vulnerable deltas in the world regarding salinity intrusion accompanied by sea level rise and upstream development smajgl et al 2015 there have been growing concerns of the potential impacts of salinity intrusion and changes in seasonal water availability on the vmd rice production as a result of climate change land use change and infrastructure developments hoang et al 2016 annually water with a salinity concentration of 4 g l intrudes approximately 40 50 km inland in march april affecting 1 4 1 7 million hectares toan 2014 the intrusion length might be 20 25 km further than usual under severe drought events i e in the 2015 2016 drought year kantoush et al 2017 2 2 data collection and missing data estimation the analysis of flow regime alterations was performed based on daily discharges and water levels measured at chiang saen kratie tan chau chau doc and my thuan over 36 years 1980 2015 and monthly maximum salinity concentrations at tra vinh and cau quan measured during the period 1990 2016 fig 1 these data were provided by the vietnamese national hydro meteorological data centre and the mekong river commission mrc because chiang saen is located just downstream of the lancang cascade changes in the flow regimes at this station largely reflect the influence of dam operations in the cascade differences in the flow patterns between chiang saen and kratie are likely attributed to the contribution of tributaries mainly in thailand and laos daily water levels at tan chau and chau doc in the vmd were continuously measured from 1980 to 2015 while daily discharges were available from 1996 to 2015 from 1980 1995 daily discharges at these two stations were measured some months a year in both flood and dry seasons therefore we developed rating curves to estimate the missing discharges based on all available daily data at each station the developed rating curves were generated for the rising april september and falling october march stages separately using polynomial regression with the least squares method the rating equations for the rising and falling stages at tan chau are exhibited by eqs 1 and 2 respectively while the respective equations at chau doc are given in eqs 3 and 4 1 q 0 0913 z 2 92 433 z 1060 7 2 q 0 0592 z 2 77 11 z 1643 7 3 q 0 0174 z 2 25 32 z 484 5 4 q 0 0075 z 2 24 531 z 796 9 where q is the discharge in m3 s and z is the water level in cm missing discharges were well predicted by these equations with high coefficients of determination r2 0 95 0 96 fig s1 shows that the 95 confidence interval lines cover most of the input data although some extreme values were over or under estimated all daily discharges at all stations during the period 1980 2015 were classified into the high flow discharge 25th percentile the transition flow discharge between the 25th and 75th percentiles and the low flow discharges 75th percentile as shown in table s2 in general the high flow season upstream of the vmd starts one month earlier and the low flow season at such locations ends one month earlier than those within the vmd the high flow transports a majority of the annual flow e g 62 at chiang saen and 74 at kratie 2 3 precipitation datasets in many regions over the world it is well known that the rain gauges are sparsely distributed with very limited long term records therefore using gridded global data products such as globally or regionally interpolated from observation reanalysis and satellite based precipitation datasets is a promising alternative specially in the mekong basin to understand the spatial and temporal variability of the precipitation as an indication of climatic impacts on the flow regimes over the mekong basin from 1980 to 2015 we employed three precipitation datasets including the climate research unit cru ts 4 03 the global precipitation climatology center gpcc and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data record persiann cdr the cru dataset was developed by the uk s national centre for atmospheric science ncas at the university of east anglia s climatic research unit based on the observational data the datasets are monthly available on a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 covering the globe from 1901 to 2018 harris et al 2020 in this study the version 2018 of gpcc dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 was used it is monthly land surface precipitation from rain gauges built on gts based and historical data and available from 1891 to 2016 with different spatial resolutions schneider et al 2018 the persiann cdr satellite based dataset is daily available from 1983 to 2018 on a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 ashouri et al 2015 these datasets were used because of their long term availability and fine spatial resolutions we first compared these three datasets with some of the existing rain gauges in the mekong basin and found that the cru data performed better than gpcc and persiann cdr data fig s2 additionally the cru datasets were used as reference of observational data in comparison with many other precipitation and climatic datasets e g ayugi et al 2020 therefore the basin scale cru data were used to perform the long term variations of the precipitation in this study 2 4 methods 2 4 1 impact assessment of flow regime metrics the first large dam in the mekong basin manwan was operated in 1993 therefore the long term flow was divided into the ndd period no dam development 1980 1992 and the postdam period 1993 2015 to assess dam impacts this division was commonly considered in previous studies e g lauri et al 2012 lu and siew 2006 the discrepancies of the twenty one flow regime metrics table 2 between the ndd and postdam periods were quantified the absolute discrepancy was used for the impact assessment of the timing and the relative discrepancy was used for the impact assessment of the magnitude duration and frequency the equations of the absolute and relative discrepancies were adopted based on zhang et al 2018 as follows 5 a d i v p o s t i v p r e i r d i a d i v p r e i 100 v p r e i 1 n v p r e i n where adi and rdi are the absolute and relative discrepancies of the ith metric respectively vi pre and vi post are the values in the ndd and postdam periods of the ith metric respectively v p r e i is mean value in the ndd period of the ith metric and n is the number of years in the ndd period if the discrepancy is greater than 0 the flow regime metrics are positively impacted if it is equal to 0 no impact is detected and if it is less than 0 the flow regime metrics are negatively impacted then the relative discrepancy was categorized into five grades based on the percentiles as adopted from zhang et al 2018 no impact 5 rd 5 slight 15 rd 5 or 5 rd 15 moderate 30 rd 15 or 15 rd 30 high 45 rd 30 or 30 rd 45 and extreme rd 45 or 45 rd we further divided the long term time series of flow metrics into three periods ndd ldd low dam development 1993 2008 and hdd high dam development 2009 2015 to further differentiate the postdam period into ldd and hdd periods before and after the operation of the second largest dam in the mekong basin xiaowan in december 2008 the ldd period consisted of four mainstream dams in the lancang cascade and 18 dams in the tributaries table s1 the hdd period included additional two mainstream dams in the lancang cascade and 38 dams in the tributaries 2 4 2 index of hydrological regime alteration fq we adapted the fq proposed by alcayaga et al 2012 to assess alterations in the frequency and duration in the high flow and low flow seasons at stations along the lower mekong the general form is as follows 6 f q n q p o s t n q p r e 100 100 where fq is the index of frequency alteration applied to the high flow and low flow conditions nqpre and nqpost are the numbers of days duration that have discharges exceeding the high flow discharge or lower than the low flow discharge in the ndd and postdam periods respectively 2 4 3 statistical trend tests the alterations of the long term discharge water level precipitation and salinity concentrations in the mekong were examined by using the non parametric mann kendall and pettitt tests and the slope method of sen at the 5 significance level α 0 05 first changes in the trend of the long term data were detected by the mann kendall test kendall 1938 mann 1945 when trends were detected we identified inflection points in the time series using the pettitt test pettitt 1979 finally the slope method of sen sen 1968 was employed to estimate the rate of change the slope of the data these trend tests were performed on the annual values 2 4 4 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha the iha method was used to quantify flow regime alterations from the ndd to the ldd and hdd periods this method comprises 32 hydrologic indicators which are categorized into five groups 1 magnitude of monthly discharge 2 magnitude and duration of annual extreme discharge 3 timing of annual extreme discharge 4 frequency and duration of high and low pulses and 5 rate and frequency of flow changes richter et al 1998 the iha method was performed on daily discharges 2 4 5 flow duration curve fdc and frequency analysis the fdcs were established for the ndd ldd and hdd periods at each station in the mekong to quantify flow regime alterations in each period daily discharges were averaged and ranked in descending order then daily ranked discharges qi were plotted as a function of their corresponding percent exceedance pi i n 1 where i is the rank and n is the total number of days in quantifying the changes in the magnitude of annual extreme discharges maximum and minimum under different occurrence frequencies flow frequency analysis was employed first long term discharges were ranked in descending order the probabilities associated with the ranked values were then computed using the hazen equation bartkes et al 2016 finally the predicted probabilities were estimated using the pearson type iii probability distribution and fitted by the method of moments as proposed by usgs 1982 2 4 6 distinguishing effects of climate from anthropogenic factors on flow regime alterations the applied methods in this study are able to quantify the altered flow regimes in the postdam i e ldd and hdd period such alterations are driven by both natural e g climate change variability precipitation is a proximity and anthropogenic e g dams and irrigation factors to distinguish effects of the latter from the former changes in the flow regimes were first compared to changes in the precipitation when the flow and precipitation change in different ways anthropogenic factors likely control the flow regime alterations we further investigate water demands for irrigation spatially and seasonally to distinguish effects of dams and irrigation for instance if the low flow discharge increased the effect of irrigation would be negligible because it consumes water causing discharge reduction 2 4 7 semi two dimensional hydrodynamic and advection dispersion model the mike 11 hydrodynamic modelling software developed by the danish hydraulic institute was used to simulate salinity intrusion in the vmd by using the hydrodynamic and advection dispersion modules adopted from mai et al 2018 the vmd model is developed in a semi two dimensional fashion as it is one dimension in the river channels and quasi two dimension in the floodplains by implementing detailed network of rice field compartments as linked channels joining with the main channels the model encompassed five upstream boundaries using hourly discharge and zero salinity and 59 downstream boundaries using hourly water level and odd hourly salinity concentration fig 2 a the model consisted of 2089 branches with over 20 734 points and more than 330 control structures for irrigation and salinity control the model was established using the up to date hydrologic topographic and bathymetric data provided by the southern institute of water resources research vietnam the model was validated using the data measured in 2016 we used six water level stations i e tan chau chau doc my thuan can tho dai ngai and tra vinh to validate the hydrodynamic module and three salinity stations i e dai ngai cau quan and tra vinh to validate the advection dispersion module the accuracy of the numerical results was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient ef mccuen et al 2006 fig 2b c show a good agreement between the simulated and observed data with r2 0 85 and ef 0 85 in the hydrodynamics module and r2 ranging from 0 73 to 0 81 in the advection dispersion module we then established three scenarios to investigate the effect of constructing sluice gates along the main rivers on salinity intrusion in the vmd the baseline scenario used discharges water levels salinity concentrations and number of sluice gates in the drought event of 2016 the remaining two scenarios used the respective data measured in the drought events of 1998 and 2005 the number of sluice gates constructed along the branches of the tien and hau rivers from 1998 to 2005 was 58 and was increased by an additional 11 from 2005 to 2016 in investigating the effectiveness of dam operation on mitigating salinity intrusion into the vmd we established the fourth scenario by shifting the upstream boundary discharges at kratie in march april 2016 backward by one month this scenario was stemmed from the emergency water release by dams in the upper mekong basin in march april 2016 to fight salinity intrusion in the vmd mai et al 2018 table 3 summarizes all scenarios of the model 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations in precipitation in the mekong basin the precipitation in the mekong basin varies spatially fig 3 a tributaries in the left bank in laos and the mekong delta in cambodia and vietnam have more intensive precipitation than other parts in the basin there was no statistically significant trends in the annual low flow season and high flow season precipitation in the mekong basin fig 3d f from 1980 to 2015 by mann kendall test although slight decreases were estimated the annual precipitation in the upper and entire mekong basin was less variable from the ndd to the ldd and hdd periods fig 3b c and table 4 the mean low flow season precipitation increased slightly from the ndd to the ldd periods but decreased substantially in the hdd period in both upper and entire mekong basin on the other hand the mean high flow season precipitation decreased in the ldd period but increased in the hdd period 3 2 impact variations of flow regime metrics along the lower mekong for the magnitude of the flow regime metrics at chiang saen low flow discharges e g minimum q90 february april were negatively impacted within slight to high grades during the ldd period before becoming positively impacted during the hdd period falling mainly within moderate to extreme grades fig 4 in contrast high flow discharges e g maximum q10 july september were positively impacted during the ldd period mainly within moderate to extreme grades before becoming negatively impacted during the hdd period mainly within slight to high grades the impact patterns at kratie tan chau and chau doc were relatively consistent which were slightly different from those at chiang saen low flow discharges were in general positively impacted throughout the ldd and hdd periods falling within moderate to extreme grades at kratie and high to extreme grades at tan chau and chau doc at tan chau and chau doc the minimum discharge has increased substantially on the other hand high flow discharges changed from positive to negative grades from the ldd to the hdd period mostly falling into slight to high grades at all stations the impact variations of average flow discharges e g mean q40 q60 were not consistent throughout the postdam period however the general pattern changed from positive to negative grades around 2003 the low flow duration and frequency i e fq low flow changed from positive to negative impact grades from 2009 at chiang saen and from 1999 at tan chau and chau doc while at kratie it was always negatively impacted the most impacted areas were at chiang saen and kratie under highly to extremely negative grades the high flow duration and frequency i e fq high flow at chiang saen and kratie changed from negative to positive grades in 2009 whereas it mostly belonged to positive grades at tan chau and chau doc where it became extremely negatively impacted in 2014 although there was a slight deviation in the annual impact variations among the flow regime metrics two obvious groups were distinguished the high flow discharge and frequency changed from positive to negative grades and low flow discharge and frequency changed from negative to positive grades around 2009 noticeably the changes at kratie tan chau and chau doc started in 2003 and it became more obvious in 2009 these results supported the division into the ndd ldd and hdd periods such divisions coincided with the results from mann kendal and pettitt tests which revealed that most of the flow metrics changed from increasing or decreasing in 1993 and or 2009 table s3 these change years were consistent with the infilling years of mega dams in the lancang cascade table 1 e g the manwan dam in 1993 and the xiaowan and jinghong dams in 2008 3 3 quantified alterations of flow regime metrics along the lower mekong 3 3 1 maximum and high flow discharges the maximum and high flow discharges at all analyzed stations along the lower mekong increased significantly in the ldd period from the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5 and 6 a the largest increase in the maximum discharge was at chiang saen by 18 and the increased rate decreased moving downstream frequency analysis showed that the maximum discharges increased at almost all exceedance probabilities tables s6 s9 similarly high flow discharges increased by 1 16 at chiang saen 5 19 at kratie 3 7 at tan chau and 5 15 at chau doc tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 moreover the duration of the high flow season calculated by eq 6 in the ldd period at tan chau and chau doc increased by 12 and 15 respectively however high flow discharges at all stations decreased in both magnitude frequency and duration in the hdd period from the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5 and 6a the reduction rates at chiang saen and kratie were greater than those at tan chau and chau doc the largest reduction rate was at chiang saen by 26 in july also the maximum discharge decreased at chiang saen and kratie for instance the trend tests revealed that the maximum discharge decreased by a rate of 56 3 m3 s yr at chiang saen α 0 05 not only the magnitude but also the patterns of the discharge hydrographs were altered fig 6a the peak discharges at all stations were shifted to occur later in the ldd and hdd periods than in the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 for instance the peak discharges were delayed on average by 6 days at chiang saen and 7 days at tan chau in the hdd period 3 3 2 mean and transition flow discharges the annual mean discharges at all four stations increased in the ldd period 1 12 from the ndd period the maximum increase was at kratie followed by chiang saen however it decreased in the hdd period at the four stations ranging from 2 to 8 with a maximum reduction at chiang saen at chiang saen and kratie the transition flow discharges generally increased in the ldd period and decreased in the hdd period compared to the ndd period fig 6b at tan chau and chau doc the discharges of all months in the transition flow season decreased significantly in the hdd period while slight reductions in the ldd period were revealed 3 3 3 minimum and low flow discharges the minimum and low flow discharges decreased at chiang saen e g minimum discharge decreased by 25 and increased markedly at kratie tan chau and chau doc in the ldd period from the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5 and 6c these trends were consistent with the frequency analysis results at all non exceedance probabilities tables s10 s13 additionally the duration of the low flow season increased in the ldd period e g from 91 days in the ndd period to 97 days in ldd period at tan chau the minimum and low flow discharges at all stations increased significantly in the hdd period from the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5 and 6c the increased rates of the low flow discharge were 23 39 at chiang saen 21 62 at kratie 1 38 at tan chau and 12 67 at chau doc moreover the duration of the low flow season decreased significantly e g from 91 days in the ndd period to 79 days in the hdd period at tan chau 3 4 long term alterations of water level and salinity various indicators of water levels at tan chau and my thuan fig 1 in the vmd showed decreasing trends at different rates in the long term time series fig 7 maximum and high flow water levels experienced the most significant reduction for instance high flow water levels at tan chau and my thuan decreased by 17 3 mm yr α 0 05 and 5 8 mm yr α 0 01 respectively the decreasing rate of the mean daily water level at tan chau 0 02 mm day was greater than that at my thuan 0 01 mm day moreover long term minimum and low flow water levels at these two stations decreased as well which may increase salinity intrusions in the vmd for instance the minimum water level at tan chau increased by 71 in the ldd period but decreased by 51 in the hdd period from the ndd period controlling and mitigating salinity intrusions is of strategic importance to maintain and increase agricultural production in the vmd however long term salinity concentrations in the vmd have sharply increased fig 8 a b maximum salinity concentrations at tra vinh in the tien river and cau quan in the hau river fig 1 increased with a rate of 0 23 g l yr α 0 001 and 0 16 g l yr α 0 01 respectively during the period 1990 2016 moreover salinity intrusions were more severe in recent years than the past for instance the maximum salinity concentration at cau quan in 2016 was approximately 1 4 times 42 greater than that in 1998 16 5 g l in the former and 11 6 g l in the later the results of the numerical simulations showed that the extent of salinity concentrations of at least 4 g l in the hau river increased from 48 km in 1998 in the ldd period to 58 km in 2005 and 65 km in 2016 both in the hdd period fig 8d not only the magnitude but also the intrusion pattern shifted substantially i e beginning earlier in recent years than in the past fig 8c particularly the timing of occurrence of the maximum salinity concentration in 2016 was approximately 1 2 months earlier than that in previous years for instance at cau quan the maximum salinity concentration occurred in february 2016 while it occurred in april 1998 and march 2010 however if upstream dams released emergency water in february 2016 instead of in march april one month earlier in the fourth scenario salinity intrusion in the vmd would be reduced by 3 17 fig 8e 4 discussion the analysis results from various approaches showed substantial alterations in the flow regimes along the lower mekong overall this study shows the benefit of using the iha indices in quantifying hydrological changes at the basin scale these indices are useful for developing adaptation strategies for water resource management in the vmd due to salinity intrusion induced by flow regime alterations 4 1 drivers of flow regime alterations along the lower mekong 4 1 1 in the ldd period in river systems undisturbed by human activities climate conditions are the key drivers for controlling the river flow regimes however the flow alteration mechanism would be more complicated if anthropogenic interventions such as hydropower dams were present in the river systems maximum and high flow discharges at the four analyzed stations chiang saen kratie tan chau and chau doc increased in both magnitude and duration in the ldd period from the ndd period mainly with moderately to highly positive grades tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 4 and 5 however the precipitation in the high flow season decreased in the upper 31 7 and entire 26 4 mekong basin table 4 therefore increases in the intensity and shifting in the timing and pattern of tropical cyclones e g more concentrated over shorter time periods may explain such discharge increases because the precipitation derived from tropical cyclones falls largely during or just after monsoon months when subsoil layers are already wetted or even saturated therefore these events are effective in forming runoff darby et al 2016 kingston et al 2010 found an earlier occurrence of and reduced flood peak at chiang saen due to climate driven factors because they did not incorporate dams in their numerical model which was consistent with the reduced precipitation in the high flow season in the upper mekong basin table 4 while our observed data at chiang saen showed a delay of and increased flood peak in the ldd period fig 6a this discrepancy shows a signal of dam influence therefore it is more likely that hydropower dams in the mekong basin with relatively small reservoir capacities in the ldd period table s1 may intensify the maximum and high flow discharge increases through reservoir operations because tropical cyclones usually occur when reservoirs are almost or already full and as a result dam regulators have to release a huge volume of water as fast as possible for dam safety reasons the minimum and low flow discharges in the ldd period at chiang saen decreased in magnitude and increased in duration and frequency table 5 figs 5a and 6 c our results are consistent with the findings of lu et al 2014 however the precipitation in the low flow season in the upper mekong basin increased by 6 3 table 4 kingston et al 2010 numerically found that the low flow discharge at chiang saen increased due to enhanced snowmelt from increased temperature increased rain snow ratio and changing climate from seven global climate models therefore the reduced minimum and low flow discharges in the ldd period at chiang saen are likely attributed to dam operations in the lancang cascade which is consistent with the findings by lu et al 2014 this implies that dams in the ldd period modified the low flow discharge in the mekong more strongly than the climate driven factors however the low flow discharge at kratie tan chau and chau doc in the ldd period increased tables 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5b d and 6 c this was likely driven by a slight increase in the precipitation table 4 other drivers may also involve in altering the flow regimes in the mekong in various magnitudes and extents including shrinkage of glacial covers in the tibet plateau reforestation afforestation highway construction sand mining and water diversion and consumption due to population growth lu et al 2014 because hydropower dams normally release water in the dry season from stored water in the flood season dam effect on the mean annual discharge should be minimal therefore increases in the mean annual discharges at all analyzed stations are attributed to climate variability possibly by local warming leading to increased local annual precipitation kingston et al 2010 decreased discharges in november december in the transition flow season at analyzed stations may be partially because of increased water demands for irrigation as irrigated land has increased by 0 57 from 2000 to 2010 li et al 2017 and dam operations an important finding from the aforementioned results is that hydropower dams in the upper mekong basin were not able to reduce the maximum and high flow discharges and increase the minimum and low flow discharges downstream in the ldd period which differs from the conventional functions of hydropower dams that increase the low flow and reduce the high flow 4 1 2 in the hdd period wang et al 2017 estimated striking increases in the flood peak and flood frequency at chiang saen after 2010 compared to the period 1975 2004 induced by climate change causing increased precipitation in the upper mekong basin we found a slight increase 6 6 in the high flow season precipitation in the upper mekong basin in the hdd period compared to the ndd period table 4 increased flood peak and flood duration under climate change effect were also estimated by hoanh et al 2010 however we estimated substantial decreases in the flood peak flood frequency flood duration and high flow discharges at chiang saen in the hdd period table 5 this indicates that dams with large reservoir capacity in the upper mekong basin especially the xiaowan and nuozhado have reduced the flood flow significantly it is consistent with the numerical modelling results by wang et al 2017 moreover the delay of the flood peak fig 6a is likely attributed to the operations of dams in the upper mekong basin especially the lancang cascade therefore dams in the upper mekong basin have greater impacts on the flood flow than climate change in the hdd period flood frequency and high flow discharges largely decreased at kratie tan chau and chau doc in the hdd period tables 6 and s4 and s5 which are inconsistent with the slightly increased high flow season precipitation in the mekong basin table 4 flood peaks were delayed collectively these imply that all dams in the mekong basin cumulatively reduced flood pulses and regulated the flood flow in the lower mekong exceeding climate change effect analyzing the data from 2009 to 2016 ha et al 2018b found a time lag between the discharge at my thuan and can tho and the enso el niño southern oscillation of 7 8 months with low correlation coefficients suggesting that dams have regulated the interannual discharge changes moreover diversion infrastructures such as the nam theun 2 dam and extensive diversions for irrigation in the mun chi basin in the north eastern thailand may additionally reduce the high flow discharges in the lower mekong hecht et al 2019 in the hdd period minimum and low flow discharges at all analyzed stations increased significantly tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 4 6c the duration and frequency of the low flow season decreased markedly these are in contrast with significant decreases in the low flow season precipitation in the upper 45 5 and entire 44 4 mekong basin table 4 such opposite trends are obvious signals of the effects of dam operations that release water in the dry season these findings are in good agreement with the results of at least three prior studies e g li et al 2017 räsänen et al 2012 2017 increasing water intake for irrigation due to expansion of agricultural lands especially in cambodian and vietnamese mekong deltas may reduce the low flow discharge however this driver clearly has minimal effect because of substantial increases of the low flow discharges due to dam operations li et al 2017 found that dam induced flow regime alterations in the mekong basin far exceed the land use induced influence decreased mean annual discharges at analyzed stations which were consistent with the decreased trends at can tho and my thuan ha et al 2018b may be attributed to climate variability because hydropower dams basically preserve the total water volume in reservoirs decreased discharges in may july in the transition flow season at stations along the mekong may be attributed to early water storing by reservoirs or climate variability decreased discharges in november december in the transition flow may be attributed to dam operations and increased water demands for irrigation li et al 2017 especially in the mekong delta because water demands for irrigation peak in these months when the spring winter rice crop starts the aforementioned findings imply that existing dams in the mekong basin in the hdd period cumulatively reduced the flood pulses and increased the low flow discharge along the mekong through reservoir operations exceeding climate change effect 4 2 cumulative impacts on the vietnamese mekong delta there are two major concerns for the vmd related to the flow regime alterations especially during the hdd period reduction of the flood pulses and frequency and decrease in the low flow water levels both of these have negatively changed farming practices increased salinity intrusions and affected livelihoods of the local people in the vmd flood pulses are important for the society that is dependent on fisheries and floodplain agriculture the estimated annual economic benefit from a typical wet season flood pulse is 8 10 billion in the lower mekong basin which is over a hundred times greater than the annual damages caused by the flooding estimated at 60 70 million hecht et al 2019 reduced flood pulses might disconnect the main mekong to its floodplains in the vmd preventing nutrient rich sediment from depositing on the floodplains with negative consequences to ecosystems and agricultural production reduced natural fertilizer in agricultural lands due to reduced flood pulses would pose a risk on the environment because farmers tend to increase artificial fertilizer and pesticide use to maintain agricultural production moreover local people especially the poor would be vulnerable due to potentially losing their secondary income from fisheries in the floodplains during the high flow season because of river floodplain disconnection reduction in floodplain fisheries and increased use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides in the vmd have been occurring for at least the last five years presenting serious challenges to the vietnamese government from the human security and the environmental aspects although low flow discharges in the vmd increased low flow water levels decreased fig 7 this can be explained through riverbed incision binh et al 2018b found that the rate of riverbed incision was faster than the rate of water depth increase from the increased dry season discharge in the main rivers of the vmd riverbed incision is a consequence of reduced sediment supply from the mekong due to reservoir sediment trapping kondolf et al 2014 kummu et al 2010 and sand mining jordan et al 2019 kondolf et al 2018 binh et al 2020 found that riverbed incision in the tien river in 2014 2017 was approximately threefold that in 1998 2008 and upstream dams explained for approximately 85 of riverbed incision compared to 15 from sand mining additionally water abstraction for irrigation of agricultural lands especially in the cambodian and vietnamese mekong deltas may reduce the low flow discharge however this driver clearly has minimal effect because the low flow discharge increased significantly it means water abstractions are likely not responsible for decreased low flow water level reductions in the low flow water levels pose two critical problems the first problem is the difficulty in obtaining irrigation freshwater especially during the winter spring crop which is the most productive and important among the three rice crops in the vmd as a result pumping is used to lift water for irrigation as an alternative which ultimately reduce the income of farmers second the reduction in the low flow water levels is likely one of the causes of significantly increased salinity intrusions in the vmd fig 8a b in which the frequency of extreme salinity intrusions has been greater in recent years than in the past mai et al 2018 eslami et al 2019 found that riverbed incision is one of the main causes of increased salinity intrusion in the vmd recently possibly because of reduction of the water surface gradient between rivers and seas reduced river to sea gradient means that sea water can reach further upstream in the river during the high tide moreover increasing the number of sluice gates along the main rivers was estimated to increase the length of salinity intrusion fig 8d due to reduced buffering zones 4 3 proposed strategies for sustainable development of the mekong basin following the flow regime alterations identified in our analyses we proposed a conceptual framework and actions fig 9 to enhance sustainable development of the mekong basin by reducing adverse impacts of the alterations it requires keeping the main river relatively free from human interventions to maintain healthy flow and sediment regimes adequate supply of quality water and environmental flow from the upper and middle mekong basins could support people s livelihoods farming practices and the survival of ecosystems in downstream reaches maintaining forest cover and restricting water diversion to other basins could mitigate extreme floods and droughts in extreme events reservoir operation rules should be modified to support downstream regions which may minimize the transboundary impacts in the mekong delta proactive preparedness to cope with extreme events as the extreme flood in 2000 and drought in 2016 is prerequisite for the long term development which requires improving monitoring system and sharing data among countries importantly strategic collaboration among riparian countries and different geographical regions is crucial to share the benefits from the mekong an increase in the magnitude and frequency of floods in the ldd period especially since an extreme flood in 2000 has forced enhanced construction of large scale high dike systems in the vmd such high dike systems not only protect the people from flooding but also extensively convert double to triple rice crops in the vmd which helps increase the people s income however under reduced flood pulses and frequency in the hdd period high dike systems have become barriers to isolate fine sediment from depositing into the floodplains thus posing various social environmental problems negative impacts of high dike systems were extensively discussed in tran et al 2018 triet et al 2017 dang et al 2016 therefore flood control in recent years may not need such costly high dike systems instead low dike rings are preferable to receive flood water which contains fine sediment tran et al 2018 cultivating lands inside existing high dike systems should be converted from triple to double crops by permanently or periodically opening sluice gates under existing high dikes e g every 3 or 5 years this action would recover soil properties flush out contaminants support wetland ecosystems and provide more retention capacity for flood control in cities critical concerns of salinity intrusion management in the vmd are to determine the quantity and location of salinity control sluice gates which have been increasingly built and planned along the tien and hau rivers over the last decade in the hau river for example in response to increasing salinity intrusion the vietnamese government had built 11 sluice gates in 1998 2005 and an additional three in 2005 2016 from a limited number before 1998 consequently together with the reduced low flow water level and riverbed incision eslami et al 2019 the salinity intrusion length in 2016 increased by 21 km from that in 1998 fig 8d an additional five sluice gates are under construction and many are planned in the hau river locations are shown in fig 8d when such sluice gates are completed the salinity intrusion length in the hau river may increase more significantly the situation is the same in other branches of the tien river therefore we propose that building new salinity control structures along the main rivers in the vmd should be based on comprehensive assessment of the location and operation routines re evaluation of existing structures is needed which should pay special attention to clarifying the relation between recently increased sluice gate construction and the increased salinity intrusion length in this regard early emergency water release from upstream dams may partly reduce salinity intrusion in the vmd fig 8e shifting the land use from agriculture to aquaculture in areas intruded by saltwater may be an effective alternative to increase income and to adapt to new flow regime conditions ca mau province is a good model of such land use change however aquaculture farming practices must be friendly to the environment and ecosystems finally water resource management should be investigated over a long period and implemented at the delta scale but not provincial or local scales and the results of this research is a promising reference for such management 5 conclusions and recommendations in this research we for the first time investigated flow regime alterations in the entire lower mekong from chiang saen to the vmd during a 36 year period by analyzing in detail the discharges water levels salinity concentrations and precipitation and discussed comprehensively the drivers of such alterations various analytical methods and a semi two dimensional numerical model were used the suitability of the existing hydraulic structures for flood control i e low dike and high dike systems and salinity intrusion control i e sluice gates were addressed and some associated management policies were proposed one of the important contributions of our study is providing evidence based historical changes of the hydrology in the vmd which serves as an important reference for future preparedness and adaptive strategies for sustainable development of the delta main conclusions are the flow regime alterations in the hdd period are more pronounced than in the ldd period compared to the ndd period based on most of the indicators analyzed some flow regime alterations observed in the ldd period maybe attributed to the inter annual climatic variability and changes in the tropical cyclones than the effects of reservoir operation hydropower dams in the ldd period with relatively small reservoir capacity table s1 were seemed unable to reduce the maximum and high flow discharges and increase the minimum and low flow discharges downstream however in the hdd period the existing dams in the mekong basin seemed to have cumulatively reduced the flood pulses and frequency and increased the low flow discharge along the entire mekong through reservoir operations exceeding climate change effect furthermore in the recent years water levels in the low flow season in the vmd have decreased possibly because of increased riverbed incision resulted from reduced sediment supply and increased sand mining such reduced water level together with increased construction of sluice gates seemed to have increased salinity intrusion in the vmd which may be partly reduced by early emergency water release from upstream dams the sustainability of the vmd requires comprehensive revision of the functioning of sluice gates and high dyke systems before building more any stakeholder s decisions related to water resources issues should be based on long term flow regime alterations and the results from this paper are a promising reference additionally water resource management should be investigated over a long period and implemented at the delta scale instead of provincial or local scales an integrated water resource management strategy in the mekong basin that is collaboratively designed and adopted by all riparian countries would enhance the sustainability of the river ecosystem and protection of the shared benefits provided by the river proactive preparedness to cope with extreme events is prerequisite for the basin sustainable development which requires improving the monitoring system and sharing data among countries credit authorship contribution statement doan van binh conceptualization data curation

8294,study region the mekong basin where climate change and anthropogenic interventions e g dams sand mining and sluice gates have intensified in the recent decades affecting the pristine flow regime and salinity intrusion study focus this paper aims at quantifying the flow regime alterations in the entire mekong from 1980 to 2015 and linking with the controlling drivers of alterations in this regard various indicators analytical methods and a semi two dimensional hydrodynamic and advection dispersion model were used new hydrological insights for the region the flow regime alterations in the high dam development period 2009 2015 are more pronounced than in the low dam development period 1993 2008 compared to the no dam development period 1980 1992 based on most of the indicators analyzed in the high dam development period all existing dams with large reservoir capacity seemed to have cumulatively reduced the flood pulses and frequency and increased the low flow discharge along the entire mekong through reservoir operations exceeding climate change effect in the recent years the water levels in the low flow season in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd have decreased possibly because of increased riverbed incision caused by reduced sediment supply and increased sand mining the reduced water levels together with the increased number of the sluice gates constructed seemed to have increased salinity intrusion in the vmd which may be partly reduced by early emergency water release from upstream dams keywords hydropower dams flow regimes discharge the mekong vietnamese mekong delta vmd salinity intrusion 1 introduction natural river flow regimes produce spatial and temporal variations in environmental conditions which are crucial to support native biodiversity and the integrity of riverine ecosystems poff and ward 1989 richter et al 1998 flood pulse is the primary driving forces for the productivity of ecosystems in the mekong river the mekong basin räsänen et al 2017 the longitudinal connectivity and dynamic flow variability between the mekong and its floodplains are needed for sustaining fish migration and promoting the exchange of water sediment and nutrients in this regard the tonle sap lake plays an important role as a natural reservoir to regulate the flood pulse of its downstream floodplains in cambodia and vietnam by receiving flows from the upstream reaches during high flow periods and releasing water back to the mekong during low flow periods pokhrel et al 2018 however increased socioeconomic development of the recent decades has led to the construction of hydropower dams weirs and reservoirs for multi purposes water diversions for irrigation and navigation and sluice gates for flow and salinity control yin et al 2015 in the mekong basin 130 dams have been built and planned since the 1990s of which 64 large dams 15 m high were completed by 2017 hecht et al 2019 fig 1 the total storage capacity of the 64 existing dams is over 82 km3 table s1 accounting for more than 98 of the annual discharges at the chiang saen station of which six mega mainstream hydropower dams in the upper mekong known as lancang cascade constitute approximately 50 table 1 among the 64 existing dams 13 dams are in the upper mekong and another 51 dams are in the tributaries of the lower mekong basin these hydraulic infrastructures have significantly altered flow regimes of the mekong by affecting the quality quantity and intra and inter annual variations of the flow regime such as frequency timing and duration of the flood discharges lauri et al 2012 lu et al 2014 manh et al 2015 räsänen et al 2017 dams normally cut the flood peak and reduce the amplitude of annual flood pulses causing disconnection between rivers and floodplains dams also trap sediment reducing the sediment volume that can be transported downstream to maintain river channels and coastal landforms kondolf et al 2014 shrestha et al 2018 additionally dam operations may cause prolonged and earlier salinity intrusion in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd mai et al 2018 because of riverbed degradation caused by upstream dam development and sand mining binh et al 2018a 2020 eslami et al 2019 moreover fish migration paths are blocked by dams pokhrel et al 2018 leading to losses of biodiversity and degradation of the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the mekong basin arias et al 2014 climate and land use changes are also major drivers that alter the hydrologic regime bao et al 2012 milliman et al 2008 wang et al 2006 with significant impacts on social and environmental variables changing rainfall intensity and patterns induced by climate change could result in changing hydrological circle wang et al 2017 although climate change is known as one of the drivers of flow alterations its impacts on flow regime alterations in the mekong are profusely smaller than those caused by hydropower dams arias et al 2014 lauri et al 2012 a similar trend was found in the yellow river where the annual runoff decreased by 82 although the annual precipitation exhibited only slight changes milliman et al 2008 additionally dam induced flow regime alterations in the mekong basin far exceed the land use induced influence li et al 2017 understanding long term alterations of the flow regimes along the mekong is of crucial importance for evidence based sustainable water management strategies and informed decisions to share benefits from the transboundary mekong in the coming decades any decision from stakeholders based on a short term flow analysis may lead to unsustainable development therefore the functioning of existing high dike systems and salinity control sluice gates in the vmd has been heavily debated and revised many scientists have argued against these structures because they may worsen the situation e g triet et al 2017 high dike systems may destroy soil properties and wetland ecosystems because nutrient rich fine sediment blocks access to the wetlands and agriculture areas furthermore salinity control sluice gates may increase the intrusion length up river because of reduced buffering zones near the estuaries it may well be that these structures were suitable at the time of being built however they may have become a constraint in recent years because of unexpected flow regime alterations that outrange the design values therefore the investigation of long term flow regime alterations plays a fundamental reference for sustainable water resource management strategies various studies have sought to understand the impacts of dams along the mekong basin binh et al 2020 li et al 2017 räsänen et al 2017 and some have worked to adapt and apply adaptive measures to specific areas within the delta or the lower mekong ha et al 2018a smajgl et al 2015 triet et al 2017 however long term flow alterations along the entire lower mekong especially the vmd have not been fully understood which may in turn challenge proposed adaptive measures in this context the specific shortcoming of prior studies is the lack of comprehensive assessment that links long term hydrologic flow regime alterations to the controlling factors and management variables the goals of this work are 1 to quantify long term flow regime alterations along the entire lower mekong including the vmd and 2 to link flow regime alterations with the controlling factors including climate variability and dams based on these understanding we propose possible interventions across various regions in the mekong basin to improve water and environmental management the outcomes of this research can be referred by stakeholders to plan strategic river basin management and to make sustainable long term decisions one of the unique contributions of our study is providing evidence based historical changes of the hydrology in the vmd which is important for informing future preparedness and adaptive strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mekong is 4880 km long and has a catchment area of 795 000 km2 running through china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam before emptying into the east sea of vietnam fig 1 the mekong basin is spatially divided into the upper mekong or the lancang 24 of the total area and lower mekong 76 of the total area the upper mekong is widely defined as the area upstream of chiang saen thailand and lies mostly in china it contributes 34 of the mean annual discharge at pakse kiem et al 2008 and approximately 18 of the mean annual flow of the mekong mekong river commission mrc 2005 but up to 75 and 40 of the low flows at vientiane and kratie respectively adamson et al 2009 the lower mekong lies in thailand laos cambodia and vietnam approximately 85 90 of the mekong s flow occurs in the wet season may october with an average peak flow of approximately 45 000 m3 s lu and siew 2006 controlled by monsoon precipitation and the flow from the left bank tributaries in laos and vietnam cook et al 2012 the remaining 10 15 of the river flow takes place in the dry season november april with an average minimum discharge of approximately 1500 m3 s controlled by the flow from snow melt in the upper mekong located in the lowermost of the mekong the vmd is home to approximately 17 million people whose livelihoods are dependent on agriculture and aquaculture the vmd is a low lying area having an average ground elevation of 0 7 1 2 m the total area of the vmd is approximately 39 000 km2 from the vietnam cambodia border several kilometers upstream of the tan chau and chau doc gauging stations to the east and west seas of vietnam fig 1 there are two main waterways in the vmd the tien and hau rivers vietnamese names of the mekong and bassac rivers the tien river conveys approximately 80 of the flow and the hau river transports approximately 20 the flood season in the vmd extends from june july to november december while the dry season lasts for nearly half the year from november december to may june the vmd is one of the most vulnerable deltas in the world regarding salinity intrusion accompanied by sea level rise and upstream development smajgl et al 2015 there have been growing concerns of the potential impacts of salinity intrusion and changes in seasonal water availability on the vmd rice production as a result of climate change land use change and infrastructure developments hoang et al 2016 annually water with a salinity concentration of 4 g l intrudes approximately 40 50 km inland in march april affecting 1 4 1 7 million hectares toan 2014 the intrusion length might be 20 25 km further than usual under severe drought events i e in the 2015 2016 drought year kantoush et al 2017 2 2 data collection and missing data estimation the analysis of flow regime alterations was performed based on daily discharges and water levels measured at chiang saen kratie tan chau chau doc and my thuan over 36 years 1980 2015 and monthly maximum salinity concentrations at tra vinh and cau quan measured during the period 1990 2016 fig 1 these data were provided by the vietnamese national hydro meteorological data centre and the mekong river commission mrc because chiang saen is located just downstream of the lancang cascade changes in the flow regimes at this station largely reflect the influence of dam operations in the cascade differences in the flow patterns between chiang saen and kratie are likely attributed to the contribution of tributaries mainly in thailand and laos daily water levels at tan chau and chau doc in the vmd were continuously measured from 1980 to 2015 while daily discharges were available from 1996 to 2015 from 1980 1995 daily discharges at these two stations were measured some months a year in both flood and dry seasons therefore we developed rating curves to estimate the missing discharges based on all available daily data at each station the developed rating curves were generated for the rising april september and falling october march stages separately using polynomial regression with the least squares method the rating equations for the rising and falling stages at tan chau are exhibited by eqs 1 and 2 respectively while the respective equations at chau doc are given in eqs 3 and 4 1 q 0 0913 z 2 92 433 z 1060 7 2 q 0 0592 z 2 77 11 z 1643 7 3 q 0 0174 z 2 25 32 z 484 5 4 q 0 0075 z 2 24 531 z 796 9 where q is the discharge in m3 s and z is the water level in cm missing discharges were well predicted by these equations with high coefficients of determination r2 0 95 0 96 fig s1 shows that the 95 confidence interval lines cover most of the input data although some extreme values were over or under estimated all daily discharges at all stations during the period 1980 2015 were classified into the high flow discharge 25th percentile the transition flow discharge between the 25th and 75th percentiles and the low flow discharges 75th percentile as shown in table s2 in general the high flow season upstream of the vmd starts one month earlier and the low flow season at such locations ends one month earlier than those within the vmd the high flow transports a majority of the annual flow e g 62 at chiang saen and 74 at kratie 2 3 precipitation datasets in many regions over the world it is well known that the rain gauges are sparsely distributed with very limited long term records therefore using gridded global data products such as globally or regionally interpolated from observation reanalysis and satellite based precipitation datasets is a promising alternative specially in the mekong basin to understand the spatial and temporal variability of the precipitation as an indication of climatic impacts on the flow regimes over the mekong basin from 1980 to 2015 we employed three precipitation datasets including the climate research unit cru ts 4 03 the global precipitation climatology center gpcc and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data record persiann cdr the cru dataset was developed by the uk s national centre for atmospheric science ncas at the university of east anglia s climatic research unit based on the observational data the datasets are monthly available on a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 covering the globe from 1901 to 2018 harris et al 2020 in this study the version 2018 of gpcc dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 was used it is monthly land surface precipitation from rain gauges built on gts based and historical data and available from 1891 to 2016 with different spatial resolutions schneider et al 2018 the persiann cdr satellite based dataset is daily available from 1983 to 2018 on a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 ashouri et al 2015 these datasets were used because of their long term availability and fine spatial resolutions we first compared these three datasets with some of the existing rain gauges in the mekong basin and found that the cru data performed better than gpcc and persiann cdr data fig s2 additionally the cru datasets were used as reference of observational data in comparison with many other precipitation and climatic datasets e g ayugi et al 2020 therefore the basin scale cru data were used to perform the long term variations of the precipitation in this study 2 4 methods 2 4 1 impact assessment of flow regime metrics the first large dam in the mekong basin manwan was operated in 1993 therefore the long term flow was divided into the ndd period no dam development 1980 1992 and the postdam period 1993 2015 to assess dam impacts this division was commonly considered in previous studies e g lauri et al 2012 lu and siew 2006 the discrepancies of the twenty one flow regime metrics table 2 between the ndd and postdam periods were quantified the absolute discrepancy was used for the impact assessment of the timing and the relative discrepancy was used for the impact assessment of the magnitude duration and frequency the equations of the absolute and relative discrepancies were adopted based on zhang et al 2018 as follows 5 a d i v p o s t i v p r e i r d i a d i v p r e i 100 v p r e i 1 n v p r e i n where adi and rdi are the absolute and relative discrepancies of the ith metric respectively vi pre and vi post are the values in the ndd and postdam periods of the ith metric respectively v p r e i is mean value in the ndd period of the ith metric and n is the number of years in the ndd period if the discrepancy is greater than 0 the flow regime metrics are positively impacted if it is equal to 0 no impact is detected and if it is less than 0 the flow regime metrics are negatively impacted then the relative discrepancy was categorized into five grades based on the percentiles as adopted from zhang et al 2018 no impact 5 rd 5 slight 15 rd 5 or 5 rd 15 moderate 30 rd 15 or 15 rd 30 high 45 rd 30 or 30 rd 45 and extreme rd 45 or 45 rd we further divided the long term time series of flow metrics into three periods ndd ldd low dam development 1993 2008 and hdd high dam development 2009 2015 to further differentiate the postdam period into ldd and hdd periods before and after the operation of the second largest dam in the mekong basin xiaowan in december 2008 the ldd period consisted of four mainstream dams in the lancang cascade and 18 dams in the tributaries table s1 the hdd period included additional two mainstream dams in the lancang cascade and 38 dams in the tributaries 2 4 2 index of hydrological regime alteration fq we adapted the fq proposed by alcayaga et al 2012 to assess alterations in the frequency and duration in the high flow and low flow seasons at stations along the lower mekong the general form is as follows 6 f q n q p o s t n q p r e 100 100 where fq is the index of frequency alteration applied to the high flow and low flow conditions nqpre and nqpost are the numbers of days duration that have discharges exceeding the high flow discharge or lower than the low flow discharge in the ndd and postdam periods respectively 2 4 3 statistical trend tests the alterations of the long term discharge water level precipitation and salinity concentrations in the mekong were examined by using the non parametric mann kendall and pettitt tests and the slope method of sen at the 5 significance level α 0 05 first changes in the trend of the long term data were detected by the mann kendall test kendall 1938 mann 1945 when trends were detected we identified inflection points in the time series using the pettitt test pettitt 1979 finally the slope method of sen sen 1968 was employed to estimate the rate of change the slope of the data these trend tests were performed on the annual values 2 4 4 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha the iha method was used to quantify flow regime alterations from the ndd to the ldd and hdd periods this method comprises 32 hydrologic indicators which are categorized into five groups 1 magnitude of monthly discharge 2 magnitude and duration of annual extreme discharge 3 timing of annual extreme discharge 4 frequency and duration of high and low pulses and 5 rate and frequency of flow changes richter et al 1998 the iha method was performed on daily discharges 2 4 5 flow duration curve fdc and frequency analysis the fdcs were established for the ndd ldd and hdd periods at each station in the mekong to quantify flow regime alterations in each period daily discharges were averaged and ranked in descending order then daily ranked discharges qi were plotted as a function of their corresponding percent exceedance pi i n 1 where i is the rank and n is the total number of days in quantifying the changes in the magnitude of annual extreme discharges maximum and minimum under different occurrence frequencies flow frequency analysis was employed first long term discharges were ranked in descending order the probabilities associated with the ranked values were then computed using the hazen equation bartkes et al 2016 finally the predicted probabilities were estimated using the pearson type iii probability distribution and fitted by the method of moments as proposed by usgs 1982 2 4 6 distinguishing effects of climate from anthropogenic factors on flow regime alterations the applied methods in this study are able to quantify the altered flow regimes in the postdam i e ldd and hdd period such alterations are driven by both natural e g climate change variability precipitation is a proximity and anthropogenic e g dams and irrigation factors to distinguish effects of the latter from the former changes in the flow regimes were first compared to changes in the precipitation when the flow and precipitation change in different ways anthropogenic factors likely control the flow regime alterations we further investigate water demands for irrigation spatially and seasonally to distinguish effects of dams and irrigation for instance if the low flow discharge increased the effect of irrigation would be negligible because it consumes water causing discharge reduction 2 4 7 semi two dimensional hydrodynamic and advection dispersion model the mike 11 hydrodynamic modelling software developed by the danish hydraulic institute was used to simulate salinity intrusion in the vmd by using the hydrodynamic and advection dispersion modules adopted from mai et al 2018 the vmd model is developed in a semi two dimensional fashion as it is one dimension in the river channels and quasi two dimension in the floodplains by implementing detailed network of rice field compartments as linked channels joining with the main channels the model encompassed five upstream boundaries using hourly discharge and zero salinity and 59 downstream boundaries using hourly water level and odd hourly salinity concentration fig 2 a the model consisted of 2089 branches with over 20 734 points and more than 330 control structures for irrigation and salinity control the model was established using the up to date hydrologic topographic and bathymetric data provided by the southern institute of water resources research vietnam the model was validated using the data measured in 2016 we used six water level stations i e tan chau chau doc my thuan can tho dai ngai and tra vinh to validate the hydrodynamic module and three salinity stations i e dai ngai cau quan and tra vinh to validate the advection dispersion module the accuracy of the numerical results was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient ef mccuen et al 2006 fig 2b c show a good agreement between the simulated and observed data with r2 0 85 and ef 0 85 in the hydrodynamics module and r2 ranging from 0 73 to 0 81 in the advection dispersion module we then established three scenarios to investigate the effect of constructing sluice gates along the main rivers on salinity intrusion in the vmd the baseline scenario used discharges water levels salinity concentrations and number of sluice gates in the drought event of 2016 the remaining two scenarios used the respective data measured in the drought events of 1998 and 2005 the number of sluice gates constructed along the branches of the tien and hau rivers from 1998 to 2005 was 58 and was increased by an additional 11 from 2005 to 2016 in investigating the effectiveness of dam operation on mitigating salinity intrusion into the vmd we established the fourth scenario by shifting the upstream boundary discharges at kratie in march april 2016 backward by one month this scenario was stemmed from the emergency water release by dams in the upper mekong basin in march april 2016 to fight salinity intrusion in the vmd mai et al 2018 table 3 summarizes all scenarios of the model 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations in precipitation in the mekong basin the precipitation in the mekong basin varies spatially fig 3 a tributaries in the left bank in laos and the mekong delta in cambodia and vietnam have more intensive precipitation than other parts in the basin there was no statistically significant trends in the annual low flow season and high flow season precipitation in the mekong basin fig 3d f from 1980 to 2015 by mann kendall test although slight decreases were estimated the annual precipitation in the upper and entire mekong basin was less variable from the ndd to the ldd and hdd periods fig 3b c and table 4 the mean low flow season precipitation increased slightly from the ndd to the ldd periods but decreased substantially in the hdd period in both upper and entire mekong basin on the other hand the mean high flow season precipitation decreased in the ldd period but increased in the hdd period 3 2 impact variations of flow regime metrics along the lower mekong for the magnitude of the flow regime metrics at chiang saen low flow discharges e g minimum q90 february april were negatively impacted within slight to high grades during the ldd period before becoming positively impacted during the hdd period falling mainly within moderate to extreme grades fig 4 in contrast high flow discharges e g maximum q10 july september were positively impacted during the ldd period mainly within moderate to extreme grades before becoming negatively impacted during the hdd period mainly within slight to high grades the impact patterns at kratie tan chau and chau doc were relatively consistent which were slightly different from those at chiang saen low flow discharges were in general positively impacted throughout the ldd and hdd periods falling within moderate to extreme grades at kratie and high to extreme grades at tan chau and chau doc at tan chau and chau doc the minimum discharge has increased substantially on the other hand high flow discharges changed from positive to negative grades from the ldd to the hdd period mostly falling into slight to high grades at all stations the impact variations of average flow discharges e g mean q40 q60 were not consistent throughout the postdam period however the general pattern changed from positive to negative grades around 2003 the low flow duration and frequency i e fq low flow changed from positive to negative impact grades from 2009 at chiang saen and from 1999 at tan chau and chau doc while at kratie it was always negatively impacted the most impacted areas were at chiang saen and kratie under highly to extremely negative grades the high flow duration and frequency i e fq high flow at chiang saen and kratie changed from negative to positive grades in 2009 whereas it mostly belonged to positive grades at tan chau and chau doc where it became extremely negatively impacted in 2014 although there was a slight deviation in the annual impact variations among the flow regime metrics two obvious groups were distinguished the high flow discharge and frequency changed from positive to negative grades and low flow discharge and frequency changed from negative to positive grades around 2009 noticeably the changes at kratie tan chau and chau doc started in 2003 and it became more obvious in 2009 these results supported the division into the ndd ldd and hdd periods such divisions coincided with the results from mann kendal and pettitt tests which revealed that most of the flow metrics changed from increasing or decreasing in 1993 and or 2009 table s3 these change years were consistent with the infilling years of mega dams in the lancang cascade table 1 e g the manwan dam in 1993 and the xiaowan and jinghong dams in 2008 3 3 quantified alterations of flow regime metrics along the lower mekong 3 3 1 maximum and high flow discharges the maximum and high flow discharges at all analyzed stations along the lower mekong increased significantly in the ldd period from the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5 and 6 a the largest increase in the maximum discharge was at chiang saen by 18 and the increased rate decreased moving downstream frequency analysis showed that the maximum discharges increased at almost all exceedance probabilities tables s6 s9 similarly high flow discharges increased by 1 16 at chiang saen 5 19 at kratie 3 7 at tan chau and 5 15 at chau doc tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 moreover the duration of the high flow season calculated by eq 6 in the ldd period at tan chau and chau doc increased by 12 and 15 respectively however high flow discharges at all stations decreased in both magnitude frequency and duration in the hdd period from the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5 and 6a the reduction rates at chiang saen and kratie were greater than those at tan chau and chau doc the largest reduction rate was at chiang saen by 26 in july also the maximum discharge decreased at chiang saen and kratie for instance the trend tests revealed that the maximum discharge decreased by a rate of 56 3 m3 s yr at chiang saen α 0 05 not only the magnitude but also the patterns of the discharge hydrographs were altered fig 6a the peak discharges at all stations were shifted to occur later in the ldd and hdd periods than in the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 for instance the peak discharges were delayed on average by 6 days at chiang saen and 7 days at tan chau in the hdd period 3 3 2 mean and transition flow discharges the annual mean discharges at all four stations increased in the ldd period 1 12 from the ndd period the maximum increase was at kratie followed by chiang saen however it decreased in the hdd period at the four stations ranging from 2 to 8 with a maximum reduction at chiang saen at chiang saen and kratie the transition flow discharges generally increased in the ldd period and decreased in the hdd period compared to the ndd period fig 6b at tan chau and chau doc the discharges of all months in the transition flow season decreased significantly in the hdd period while slight reductions in the ldd period were revealed 3 3 3 minimum and low flow discharges the minimum and low flow discharges decreased at chiang saen e g minimum discharge decreased by 25 and increased markedly at kratie tan chau and chau doc in the ldd period from the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5 and 6c these trends were consistent with the frequency analysis results at all non exceedance probabilities tables s10 s13 additionally the duration of the low flow season increased in the ldd period e g from 91 days in the ndd period to 97 days in ldd period at tan chau the minimum and low flow discharges at all stations increased significantly in the hdd period from the ndd period tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5 and 6c the increased rates of the low flow discharge were 23 39 at chiang saen 21 62 at kratie 1 38 at tan chau and 12 67 at chau doc moreover the duration of the low flow season decreased significantly e g from 91 days in the ndd period to 79 days in the hdd period at tan chau 3 4 long term alterations of water level and salinity various indicators of water levels at tan chau and my thuan fig 1 in the vmd showed decreasing trends at different rates in the long term time series fig 7 maximum and high flow water levels experienced the most significant reduction for instance high flow water levels at tan chau and my thuan decreased by 17 3 mm yr α 0 05 and 5 8 mm yr α 0 01 respectively the decreasing rate of the mean daily water level at tan chau 0 02 mm day was greater than that at my thuan 0 01 mm day moreover long term minimum and low flow water levels at these two stations decreased as well which may increase salinity intrusions in the vmd for instance the minimum water level at tan chau increased by 71 in the ldd period but decreased by 51 in the hdd period from the ndd period controlling and mitigating salinity intrusions is of strategic importance to maintain and increase agricultural production in the vmd however long term salinity concentrations in the vmd have sharply increased fig 8 a b maximum salinity concentrations at tra vinh in the tien river and cau quan in the hau river fig 1 increased with a rate of 0 23 g l yr α 0 001 and 0 16 g l yr α 0 01 respectively during the period 1990 2016 moreover salinity intrusions were more severe in recent years than the past for instance the maximum salinity concentration at cau quan in 2016 was approximately 1 4 times 42 greater than that in 1998 16 5 g l in the former and 11 6 g l in the later the results of the numerical simulations showed that the extent of salinity concentrations of at least 4 g l in the hau river increased from 48 km in 1998 in the ldd period to 58 km in 2005 and 65 km in 2016 both in the hdd period fig 8d not only the magnitude but also the intrusion pattern shifted substantially i e beginning earlier in recent years than in the past fig 8c particularly the timing of occurrence of the maximum salinity concentration in 2016 was approximately 1 2 months earlier than that in previous years for instance at cau quan the maximum salinity concentration occurred in february 2016 while it occurred in april 1998 and march 2010 however if upstream dams released emergency water in february 2016 instead of in march april one month earlier in the fourth scenario salinity intrusion in the vmd would be reduced by 3 17 fig 8e 4 discussion the analysis results from various approaches showed substantial alterations in the flow regimes along the lower mekong overall this study shows the benefit of using the iha indices in quantifying hydrological changes at the basin scale these indices are useful for developing adaptation strategies for water resource management in the vmd due to salinity intrusion induced by flow regime alterations 4 1 drivers of flow regime alterations along the lower mekong 4 1 1 in the ldd period in river systems undisturbed by human activities climate conditions are the key drivers for controlling the river flow regimes however the flow alteration mechanism would be more complicated if anthropogenic interventions such as hydropower dams were present in the river systems maximum and high flow discharges at the four analyzed stations chiang saen kratie tan chau and chau doc increased in both magnitude and duration in the ldd period from the ndd period mainly with moderately to highly positive grades tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 4 and 5 however the precipitation in the high flow season decreased in the upper 31 7 and entire 26 4 mekong basin table 4 therefore increases in the intensity and shifting in the timing and pattern of tropical cyclones e g more concentrated over shorter time periods may explain such discharge increases because the precipitation derived from tropical cyclones falls largely during or just after monsoon months when subsoil layers are already wetted or even saturated therefore these events are effective in forming runoff darby et al 2016 kingston et al 2010 found an earlier occurrence of and reduced flood peak at chiang saen due to climate driven factors because they did not incorporate dams in their numerical model which was consistent with the reduced precipitation in the high flow season in the upper mekong basin table 4 while our observed data at chiang saen showed a delay of and increased flood peak in the ldd period fig 6a this discrepancy shows a signal of dam influence therefore it is more likely that hydropower dams in the mekong basin with relatively small reservoir capacities in the ldd period table s1 may intensify the maximum and high flow discharge increases through reservoir operations because tropical cyclones usually occur when reservoirs are almost or already full and as a result dam regulators have to release a huge volume of water as fast as possible for dam safety reasons the minimum and low flow discharges in the ldd period at chiang saen decreased in magnitude and increased in duration and frequency table 5 figs 5a and 6 c our results are consistent with the findings of lu et al 2014 however the precipitation in the low flow season in the upper mekong basin increased by 6 3 table 4 kingston et al 2010 numerically found that the low flow discharge at chiang saen increased due to enhanced snowmelt from increased temperature increased rain snow ratio and changing climate from seven global climate models therefore the reduced minimum and low flow discharges in the ldd period at chiang saen are likely attributed to dam operations in the lancang cascade which is consistent with the findings by lu et al 2014 this implies that dams in the ldd period modified the low flow discharge in the mekong more strongly than the climate driven factors however the low flow discharge at kratie tan chau and chau doc in the ldd period increased tables 6 and s4 and s5 figs 5b d and 6 c this was likely driven by a slight increase in the precipitation table 4 other drivers may also involve in altering the flow regimes in the mekong in various magnitudes and extents including shrinkage of glacial covers in the tibet plateau reforestation afforestation highway construction sand mining and water diversion and consumption due to population growth lu et al 2014 because hydropower dams normally release water in the dry season from stored water in the flood season dam effect on the mean annual discharge should be minimal therefore increases in the mean annual discharges at all analyzed stations are attributed to climate variability possibly by local warming leading to increased local annual precipitation kingston et al 2010 decreased discharges in november december in the transition flow season at analyzed stations may be partially because of increased water demands for irrigation as irrigated land has increased by 0 57 from 2000 to 2010 li et al 2017 and dam operations an important finding from the aforementioned results is that hydropower dams in the upper mekong basin were not able to reduce the maximum and high flow discharges and increase the minimum and low flow discharges downstream in the ldd period which differs from the conventional functions of hydropower dams that increase the low flow and reduce the high flow 4 1 2 in the hdd period wang et al 2017 estimated striking increases in the flood peak and flood frequency at chiang saen after 2010 compared to the period 1975 2004 induced by climate change causing increased precipitation in the upper mekong basin we found a slight increase 6 6 in the high flow season precipitation in the upper mekong basin in the hdd period compared to the ndd period table 4 increased flood peak and flood duration under climate change effect were also estimated by hoanh et al 2010 however we estimated substantial decreases in the flood peak flood frequency flood duration and high flow discharges at chiang saen in the hdd period table 5 this indicates that dams with large reservoir capacity in the upper mekong basin especially the xiaowan and nuozhado have reduced the flood flow significantly it is consistent with the numerical modelling results by wang et al 2017 moreover the delay of the flood peak fig 6a is likely attributed to the operations of dams in the upper mekong basin especially the lancang cascade therefore dams in the upper mekong basin have greater impacts on the flood flow than climate change in the hdd period flood frequency and high flow discharges largely decreased at kratie tan chau and chau doc in the hdd period tables 6 and s4 and s5 which are inconsistent with the slightly increased high flow season precipitation in the mekong basin table 4 flood peaks were delayed collectively these imply that all dams in the mekong basin cumulatively reduced flood pulses and regulated the flood flow in the lower mekong exceeding climate change effect analyzing the data from 2009 to 2016 ha et al 2018b found a time lag between the discharge at my thuan and can tho and the enso el niño southern oscillation of 7 8 months with low correlation coefficients suggesting that dams have regulated the interannual discharge changes moreover diversion infrastructures such as the nam theun 2 dam and extensive diversions for irrigation in the mun chi basin in the north eastern thailand may additionally reduce the high flow discharges in the lower mekong hecht et al 2019 in the hdd period minimum and low flow discharges at all analyzed stations increased significantly tables 5 and 6 and s4 and s5 figs 4 6c the duration and frequency of the low flow season decreased markedly these are in contrast with significant decreases in the low flow season precipitation in the upper 45 5 and entire 44 4 mekong basin table 4 such opposite trends are obvious signals of the effects of dam operations that release water in the dry season these findings are in good agreement with the results of at least three prior studies e g li et al 2017 räsänen et al 2012 2017 increasing water intake for irrigation due to expansion of agricultural lands especially in cambodian and vietnamese mekong deltas may reduce the low flow discharge however this driver clearly has minimal effect because of substantial increases of the low flow discharges due to dam operations li et al 2017 found that dam induced flow regime alterations in the mekong basin far exceed the land use induced influence decreased mean annual discharges at analyzed stations which were consistent with the decreased trends at can tho and my thuan ha et al 2018b may be attributed to climate variability because hydropower dams basically preserve the total water volume in reservoirs decreased discharges in may july in the transition flow season at stations along the mekong may be attributed to early water storing by reservoirs or climate variability decreased discharges in november december in the transition flow may be attributed to dam operations and increased water demands for irrigation li et al 2017 especially in the mekong delta because water demands for irrigation peak in these months when the spring winter rice crop starts the aforementioned findings imply that existing dams in the mekong basin in the hdd period cumulatively reduced the flood pulses and increased the low flow discharge along the mekong through reservoir operations exceeding climate change effect 4 2 cumulative impacts on the vietnamese mekong delta there are two major concerns for the vmd related to the flow regime alterations especially during the hdd period reduction of the flood pulses and frequency and decrease in the low flow water levels both of these have negatively changed farming practices increased salinity intrusions and affected livelihoods of the local people in the vmd flood pulses are important for the society that is dependent on fisheries and floodplain agriculture the estimated annual economic benefit from a typical wet season flood pulse is 8 10 billion in the lower mekong basin which is over a hundred times greater than the annual damages caused by the flooding estimated at 60 70 million hecht et al 2019 reduced flood pulses might disconnect the main mekong to its floodplains in the vmd preventing nutrient rich sediment from depositing on the floodplains with negative consequences to ecosystems and agricultural production reduced natural fertilizer in agricultural lands due to reduced flood pulses would pose a risk on the environment because farmers tend to increase artificial fertilizer and pesticide use to maintain agricultural production moreover local people especially the poor would be vulnerable due to potentially losing their secondary income from fisheries in the floodplains during the high flow season because of river floodplain disconnection reduction in floodplain fisheries and increased use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides in the vmd have been occurring for at least the last five years presenting serious challenges to the vietnamese government from the human security and the environmental aspects although low flow discharges in the vmd increased low flow water levels decreased fig 7 this can be explained through riverbed incision binh et al 2018b found that the rate of riverbed incision was faster than the rate of water depth increase from the increased dry season discharge in the main rivers of the vmd riverbed incision is a consequence of reduced sediment supply from the mekong due to reservoir sediment trapping kondolf et al 2014 kummu et al 2010 and sand mining jordan et al 2019 kondolf et al 2018 binh et al 2020 found that riverbed incision in the tien river in 2014 2017 was approximately threefold that in 1998 2008 and upstream dams explained for approximately 85 of riverbed incision compared to 15 from sand mining additionally water abstraction for irrigation of agricultural lands especially in the cambodian and vietnamese mekong deltas may reduce the low flow discharge however this driver clearly has minimal effect because the low flow discharge increased significantly it means water abstractions are likely not responsible for decreased low flow water level reductions in the low flow water levels pose two critical problems the first problem is the difficulty in obtaining irrigation freshwater especially during the winter spring crop which is the most productive and important among the three rice crops in the vmd as a result pumping is used to lift water for irrigation as an alternative which ultimately reduce the income of farmers second the reduction in the low flow water levels is likely one of the causes of significantly increased salinity intrusions in the vmd fig 8a b in which the frequency of extreme salinity intrusions has been greater in recent years than in the past mai et al 2018 eslami et al 2019 found that riverbed incision is one of the main causes of increased salinity intrusion in the vmd recently possibly because of reduction of the water surface gradient between rivers and seas reduced river to sea gradient means that sea water can reach further upstream in the river during the high tide moreover increasing the number of sluice gates along the main rivers was estimated to increase the length of salinity intrusion fig 8d due to reduced buffering zones 4 3 proposed strategies for sustainable development of the mekong basin following the flow regime alterations identified in our analyses we proposed a conceptual framework and actions fig 9 to enhance sustainable development of the mekong basin by reducing adverse impacts of the alterations it requires keeping the main river relatively free from human interventions to maintain healthy flow and sediment regimes adequate supply of quality water and environmental flow from the upper and middle mekong basins could support people s livelihoods farming practices and the survival of ecosystems in downstream reaches maintaining forest cover and restricting water diversion to other basins could mitigate extreme floods and droughts in extreme events reservoir operation rules should be modified to support downstream regions which may minimize the transboundary impacts in the mekong delta proactive preparedness to cope with extreme events as the extreme flood in 2000 and drought in 2016 is prerequisite for the long term development which requires improving monitoring system and sharing data among countries importantly strategic collaboration among riparian countries and different geographical regions is crucial to share the benefits from the mekong an increase in the magnitude and frequency of floods in the ldd period especially since an extreme flood in 2000 has forced enhanced construction of large scale high dike systems in the vmd such high dike systems not only protect the people from flooding but also extensively convert double to triple rice crops in the vmd which helps increase the people s income however under reduced flood pulses and frequency in the hdd period high dike systems have become barriers to isolate fine sediment from depositing into the floodplains thus posing various social environmental problems negative impacts of high dike systems were extensively discussed in tran et al 2018 triet et al 2017 dang et al 2016 therefore flood control in recent years may not need such costly high dike systems instead low dike rings are preferable to receive flood water which contains fine sediment tran et al 2018 cultivating lands inside existing high dike systems should be converted from triple to double crops by permanently or periodically opening sluice gates under existing high dikes e g every 3 or 5 years this action would recover soil properties flush out contaminants support wetland ecosystems and provide more retention capacity for flood control in cities critical concerns of salinity intrusion management in the vmd are to determine the quantity and location of salinity control sluice gates which have been increasingly built and planned along the tien and hau rivers over the last decade in the hau river for example in response to increasing salinity intrusion the vietnamese government had built 11 sluice gates in 1998 2005 and an additional three in 2005 2016 from a limited number before 1998 consequently together with the reduced low flow water level and riverbed incision eslami et al 2019 the salinity intrusion length in 2016 increased by 21 km from that in 1998 fig 8d an additional five sluice gates are under construction and many are planned in the hau river locations are shown in fig 8d when such sluice gates are completed the salinity intrusion length in the hau river may increase more significantly the situation is the same in other branches of the tien river therefore we propose that building new salinity control structures along the main rivers in the vmd should be based on comprehensive assessment of the location and operation routines re evaluation of existing structures is needed which should pay special attention to clarifying the relation between recently increased sluice gate construction and the increased salinity intrusion length in this regard early emergency water release from upstream dams may partly reduce salinity intrusion in the vmd fig 8e shifting the land use from agriculture to aquaculture in areas intruded by saltwater may be an effective alternative to increase income and to adapt to new flow regime conditions ca mau province is a good model of such land use change however aquaculture farming practices must be friendly to the environment and ecosystems finally water resource management should be investigated over a long period and implemented at the delta scale but not provincial or local scales and the results of this research is a promising reference for such management 5 conclusions and recommendations in this research we for the first time investigated flow regime alterations in the entire lower mekong from chiang saen to the vmd during a 36 year period by analyzing in detail the discharges water levels salinity concentrations and precipitation and discussed comprehensively the drivers of such alterations various analytical methods and a semi two dimensional numerical model were used the suitability of the existing hydraulic structures for flood control i e low dike and high dike systems and salinity intrusion control i e sluice gates were addressed and some associated management policies were proposed one of the important contributions of our study is providing evidence based historical changes of the hydrology in the vmd which serves as an important reference for future preparedness and adaptive strategies for sustainable development of the delta main conclusions are the flow regime alterations in the hdd period are more pronounced than in the ldd period compared to the ndd period based on most of the indicators analyzed some flow regime alterations observed in the ldd period maybe attributed to the inter annual climatic variability and changes in the tropical cyclones than the effects of reservoir operation hydropower dams in the ldd period with relatively small reservoir capacity table s1 were seemed unable to reduce the maximum and high flow discharges and increase the minimum and low flow discharges downstream however in the hdd period the existing dams in the mekong basin seemed to have cumulatively reduced the flood pulses and frequency and increased the low flow discharge along the entire mekong through reservoir operations exceeding climate change effect furthermore in the recent years water levels in the low flow season in the vmd have decreased possibly because of increased riverbed incision resulted from reduced sediment supply and increased sand mining such reduced water level together with increased construction of sluice gates seemed to have increased salinity intrusion in the vmd which may be partly reduced by early emergency water release from upstream dams the sustainability of the vmd requires comprehensive revision of the functioning of sluice gates and high dyke systems before building more any stakeholder s decisions related to water resources issues should be based on long term flow regime alterations and the results from this paper are a promising reference additionally water resource management should be investigated over a long period and implemented at the delta scale instead of provincial or local scales an integrated water resource management strategy in the mekong basin that is collaboratively designed and adopted by all riparian countries would enhance the sustainability of the river ecosystem and protection of the shared benefits provided by the river proactive preparedness to cope with extreme events is prerequisite for the basin sustainable development which requires improving the monitoring system and sharing data among countries credit authorship contribution statement doan van binh conceptualization data curation
