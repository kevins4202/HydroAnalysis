17580,fungal contamination of drinking water sources is increasingly threatening the environment and human health in this study the inactivation of three genera of dominant fungi in drinking water sources using ozone was first reported the inactivation of the fungal spores by ozone could be divided into two distinct stages first a rapid reduction in survival and then the inactivation at a slower rate the secondary stage inactivation fitted the chick watson model well and there was no significant difference in the second order inactivation rate constants of the three fungal spores 0 199 0 209 l mg 1 min 1 the inactivation rate constants of fungal spores by molecular ozone were much lower than those of viruses which were equivalent to that of cryptosporidium the increase in ph and temperature showed a positive effect on the inactivation rate damage to cell membranes leakage of intracellular compounds and changes of reactive oxygen species and esterase activity in the spores were detected after inactivation the results indicated that ozone inactivated fungal spores by firstly destroying cell walls and membranes and then causing the release of intracellular compounds the fungicidal efficiency of ozone was superior to those of chlorine and chlorine dioxide in addition the inactivation efficiency of ozone on fungal spores in real water matrices was reduced to 50 7 91 2 of the efficiency in phosphate buffer in conclusion ozone showed high efficiency in the inactivation of fungal spores and could be used as an alternative disinfectant for fungal contamination in drinking water sources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozone fungal spores inactivation kinetics mechanisms 1 introduction in recent years mass propagation of fungi has been considered a problem that cannot be ignored threatening the drinking water safety and has attracted much attention in the field of water treatment pereira et al 2009 wen et al 2017a fungi of various genera have been isolated from different drinking water sources around the world and the dominant species of these fungi included aspergillus spp penicillium spp trichoderma spp cladosporium spp fusarium spp rhizopus spp and some others oliveira et al 2013 rankovic 2005 wen et al 2017a fungal metabolic products have caused a variety of problems in the aquatic environment despite their low concentrations under normal circumstances red pigments in water caused by fusarium graminearum have been reported kelley et al 2003 and the fungus has been listed in most drinking water guidelines as a nuisance organism that causes odor problems babič et al 2017 worse still people will be at increased risk of suffering from mycosis and allergic reactions once the mycotoxins come into contact with the human body through water or food especially to immunocompromised patients curtis et al 2004 hageskal et al 2007 marr et al 2002 harmful effects of pathogenic aspergillus spp on human health mainly include asthma symptoms hypersensitivity pneumonitis and skin irritation which have been reported previously al gabr et al 2014 anaissie et al 2002 2003 green et al 2003 furthermore the incidence of fungal infections continues to increase with some invasive fungal infections being responsible for more than 50 of the mortality brown et al 2012 therefore it is very important to find an efficient method for controlling fungi in the aquatic environment inactivation of fungi with different disinfectants including free chlorine chlorine dioxide monochloramine and ultraviolet radiation has been reported ma and bibby 2017 pereira et al 2013 wen et al 2017a 2019a b 2020b oliveira et al 2020 wan et al 2020 pereira et al reported that fungi showed stronger resistance to chlorine than bacteria and viruses pereira et al 2013 the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine on three fungi aspergillus versicolor aspergillus fumigatus and penicillium purpurogenum was observed to be much lower than that of free chlorine ma and bibby 2017 additionally a large amount of disinfection by products will be produced during the application of chlorine and monochloramine hua and reckhow 2007 furst et al 2018 chlorine dioxide exhibited a higher inactivation efficiency than chlorine with 70 100 death of fungal spores in 60 s wen et al 2017a yang et al have reported that chlorate and chlorite were the major by products during chlorine dioxide disinfection yang et al 2013 in addition chlorine dioxide must be prepared on site due to its instability praeger et al 2018 results on the inactivation of three genera of aspergillus using ultraviolet c light indicated that ultraviolet radiation was effective for control of the fungi in water wan et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 however it has been reported that fungal spores have the potential to reactivate through dna repair mechanisms after uv irradiation even though their cell membranes are incomplete wen et al 2019a goldman and kafer 2004 ozone has been used for a long time as a disinfectant against most of waterborne pathogens due to its strong oxidization and broad spectrum microbicidal ability kruithof and masschelein 1999 roy et al 1982 shin and sobsey 2003 a high degree of inactivation 4 log of adenovirus type 40 and feline calicivirus was achieved during a low ozone exposure 0 60 mg min l 1 at 5 c and ph 7 0 thurston enriquez et al 2005 the inactivation efficiency of five enteric viruses by ozone was shown to be extremely high with second order inactivation rate constants ranging from 4 5 105 to 3 3 106 m 1 s 1 wolf et al 2018 ozone was considered as a promising alternative disinfectant for chlorine resistant bacteria in water causing 2 33 2 10 and 1 97 log inactivation for bacillus alvei lysinibacillus fusiformis and bacillus cereus spores at the ozone concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 within 1 min ding et al 2019 in addition ozone was used to inactivate the pathogenic bacterium ralstonia solanacearum by spraying ozonated water onto plants guo et al 2019 ozone has also been reported to be effective against the more resistant cryptosporidium with the inactivation process included an initial lag phase followed by rapid inactivation and subsequent slower inactivation rennecker et al 1999 2001 to the best of our knowledge previous studies have favored ozone inactivation of bacteria and viruses whereas inactivation of fungal spores using ozone in water has been reported much less frequently five fungi aspergillus parasiticus aspergillus flavus penicillium citrinum fusarium verticillioides and fusarium graminearum were exposed to ozone gas with a concentration of 60 µmol mol 1 and the results indicated that ozone was a highly effective disinfectant for the fungi savi and scussel 2014 inactivation of fungal spores associated with rice seeds was conducted using ozone and arc discharge plasma and the reactive oxygen species ros produced by ozone in water were found to be more effective than the nitric oxide generated from plasma for inactivating fusarium fujikuroi kang et al 2015 however inactivation of fungal spores in drinking water sources by ozone has scarcely been reported and detailed research on the kinetics and mechanisms of ozone inactivation of fungi is lacking in previous studies therefore the present study conducted inactivation of fungal spores by ozone with the following four main objectives 1 to evaluate the fungicidal potential of ozone solution on spores isolated from groundwater of three dominant genera of fungi and explore the inactivation kinetics 2 to investigate the role of three operational factors ozone concentration ph and temperature in the efficiency and kinetics of fungal spore inactivation with ozone 3 to explore the mechanism of ozone inactivation of fungal spores by observing the change of cell morphology determining the leakage of intracellular compounds evaluating the membrane integrity of spores and detecting the variations in ros level and esterase activity in spores 4 to assess the inactivation efficiency of ozone on fungal spores in surface water and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and test water all chemicals used in the present study were acs grade reagents chloride free phosphate buffer solution pbs 40 mm was used to maintain the ph of the reaction wen et al 2019b tert butanol t buoh stock solution 400 mm was prepared as a radical scavenger and sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 solution 0 1 m was prepared as a quenching agent the glass wares used in the experiments were rinsed and sterilized using the method described previously pereira et al 2013 surface water and groundwater were taken from two drinking water sources located in northwest china wen et al 2017b the parameters of water quality are shown in table s1 2 2 preparation of fungal spore suspensions the selected fungal species used in the present study were aspergillus niger a niger penicillium polonicum p polonicum and trichoderma harzianum t harzianum among which aspergillus spp and penicillium spp have been reported to be producers of mycotoxins paterson and lima 2005 all the three genera of fungi were isolated from groundwater sources in northwest china wen et al 2017a the spore suspensions were prepared with pbs and spores scraped from dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol drbc medium using the method described previously jung et al 2008 wen et al 2019b the concentration of spore suspensions cfu ml 1 was determined using the method described in our previous study wen et al 2017b and the target spore concentration of the stock solution was controlled at 108 109 cfu ml 1 2 3 preparation and determination of ozone in water the ozonated water was prepared by continuously passing ozone gas produced by an ozone generator lab2b ozonia co scotland into ultrapure water until the ozone concentration in water became stable as described in fig s1 the indigo disulphonate method was used to determine the ozone concentration of the ozonated water bader and hoigné 1981 2 4 inactivation procedures inactivation experiments were conducted in 40 mm pbs in sequence batch reactors to investigate the kinetics of ozone inactivation accurately excessive t buoh 20 mm was used to capture the hydroxyl radical oh produced by ozone decomposition von gunten 2003 wolf et al 2018 and thus ensure that the inactivation of fungal spores was principally caused by molecular ozone the stock of spore suspensions was added to each reactor to achieve an initial spore concentration of 1 2 105 cfu ml 1 at the beginning of the inactivation a volume of concentrated ozonated water appropriate for attaining the target ozone concentration was immediately mixed with the solution containing fungal spores in the batch reactor na2s2o3 solution 0 1 m was added to each reactor at a target reaction time to quench the residual ozone cho et al 2006 the concentration of fungal spores after inactivation was quantified by the heterotrophic plate count method and recorded as colony forming units per ml cfu ml 1 wen et al 2017a 2019b liu and zhang 2006 ozone decomposition experiments were conducted in a conical flask with stopper samples were taken at different reaction times and the indigo disulphonate method was used to determine the residual amount of ozone in the spore suspension bader and hoigné 1981 in the control experiment the procedure was the same with inactivation of fungal spores by ozone except that ozone solution was replaced with an equal volume of pure water to compare the inactivation efficiency of ozone with other disinfectants chlorine and chlorine dioxide were selected to inactivate fungal spores under the same operational conditions as ozone according to the ozone inactivation procedure described above the concentrated ozone solution was replaced with a sodium hypochlorite stock solution or a chlorine dioxide stock solution to achieve the initial disinfectant concentration of 2 mg l 1 a blank controlled experiment using pure water instead of disinfectants was also carried out 2 5 influencing factors the effects of three parameters on inactivation of fungal spores using ozone were investigated to evaluate the effect of initial ozone concentration 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 mg l 1 on inactivation efficiency inactivation experiments were carried out by adding different volumes of concentrated ozone solution to examine the influence of ph inactivation experiments were conducted in pbs at various ph values ranging from 6 0 8 0 to explore the temperature dependence of the fungal spore response to ozone a cryostat oldc 0510 olan china was used to control the reaction temperature at 5 14 20 27 and 33 c respectively in order to investigate the effect of ionic strength in water on ozone inactivation efficiency of fungal spores inactivation experiments were carried out in different concentrations of pbs 10 20 40 60 mm and by adding different amounts of sodium chloride 0 10 20 30 mm the effects of ca2 and mg2 ions on inactivation were also investigated by adding different concentrations of calcium sulfate and magnesium sulfate 50 100 200 mg l 1 2 6 analysis of inactivation mechanisms 2 6 1 changes of extracellular total nitrogen and protein an appropriate volume of the inactivated spore suspension was added to a centrifuge tube and then the supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the concentration of extracellular total nitrogen tn was determined in triplicate by spectrophotometry federation 2005 wen et al 2017a tn concentrations of untreated samples were tested as a control extracellular protein concentration before and after inactivation was determined in triplicate by spectrophotometer using the broadford method bradford 1976 2 6 2 flow cytometry measurement changes of membrane integrity ros level and esterase activity of fungal spores before and after inactivation were measured using a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa emitting at wavelengths of 488 nm and 640 nm berney et al 2007 wen et al 2014 2015 2016 2020a three dyes were used sybr green і propidium iodide sg pi dihydroethidium dhe and 5 and 6 carboxyfluorescein cfda the pi is repelled by living cells but can penetrate the membranes of cells that are dying or dead whereas the sg can stain all cells therefore sg pi combined staining was used to evaluate the ratio of compromised to intact membrane and thus explore the membrane integrity of fungal spores dhe was used to detect the intracellular ros level of fungal spores and cfda was used to investigate the esterase activity of fungal spores before analysis by flow cytometry fcm the stained samples were diluted with pbs to an appropriate concentration 103 105 cfu ml 1 wen et al 2020a additional details pertaining to the staining and detection procedures are available in our previous studies wan et al 2020 wen et al 2020a 2 6 3 scanning electron microscope observation after being treated with ozone fungal spores were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and fixed in 3 glutaraldehyde at 4 c overnight then the excess glutaraldehyde was removed by washing with pbs and ethanol with gradient concentration isoamyl acetate was added to the rinsed spores and the mixture was air dried finally the surface morphology of the fungal spores was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6510 jeol japan pre inactivation fungal spores were also observed as described above 2 7 data analysis the chick watson model was selected to describe the inactivation process 1 ln n t n 0 k c n t where nt and n0 represent the fungal spore concentrations cfu ml 1 at times t and 0 respectively k represents the inactivation rate constant l mg 1 min 1 c represents the disinfectant concentration mg l 1 t represents the reaction time min and n represents the kinetic parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation kinetics of fungal spores by ozone the inactivation efficiency of ozone on the fungal spores is shown in fig 1 there was no initial lag phase in the inactivation the inactivation curves of the three fungal spores were characterized by an initial rapid inactivation within approximately 30 s and a subsequent slower inactivation the results were in accordance with previous studies which have reported that the inactivation of viruses and cryptosporidium parvum by ozone included a secondary stage of inactivation with a slower rate rennecker et al 2001 wolf et al 2018 the rapid inactivation in the first stage was caused to some extent by advanced oxidation process related to oh because the oh with high transient concentration was not completely captured by t buoh in a short time 30 s buffle et al 2006 buffle and von gunten 2006 the results of the control experiment without ozone treatment are shown in fig s2 the contribution of the first stage was more significant during the inactivation of fungal spores by ozone the inactivation of spores in the first stage achieved 1 10 1 42 and 1 80 log reductions in survival rate for a niger t harzianum and p polonicum respectively the resistance against ozone varied among the three fungal spores for instance 5 63 2 36 and 0 51 mg min l 1 of ozone exposure ct value were required to achieve 2 log 99 inactivation of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum spores in pbs respectively therefore the resistance of the three genera of fungal spores against ozone followed the sequence of a niger t harzianum p polonicum the difference in resistance to ozone among the three fungal spores could be ascribed in part to the size of the spores the diameter of the a niger spore 2 67 0 12 µm was larger than those of t harzianum 2 25 0 22 µm and p polonicum 2 16 0 48 µm the lowest specific surface area of a niger spores made it more difficult to be inactivated by ozone in a previous study it was pointed out that the higher resistance against chlorine dioxide of cladosporium spp was attributable to its relatively larger spore size than those of penicillium spp and trichoderma spp wen et al 2017a the second stage inactivation of fungal spores by ozone fitted the chick watson model well r2 0 930 0 986 as shown in the internal illustration of fig 1 the k value in the present study refers to the second stage inactivation rate constant corresponding to the reaction of fungal spores with molecular ozone which was 0 199 0 209 and 0 204 l mg 1 min 1 for a niger t harzianum and p polonicum respectively no significant discrepancy in k value was observed among the three fungal spores the difference in resistance of the three fungal spores to ozone mainly occurred in the first stage of the inactivation the inactivation rate constants of different microorganisms by ozone are summarized in table 1 choi et al 2007 ding et al 2019 li et al 2017 rennecker et al 2001 wolf et al 2018 as shown in the table the second stage k values of fungal spores are 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than those of viruses and are comparable to that of cryptosporidium parvum the ct values required for 2 log inactivation 99 0 of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum were 5 65 2 36 and 0 82 mg min l 1 respectively which were much greater than the ct values required for viruses 1 9 8 0 10 3 mg min l 1 reported previously and were similar to that of cryptosporidium 4 52 mg min l 1 thus fungi and cryptosporidium parvum have higher resistance to ozone than bacteria and viruses which can be ascribed to their more complex cellular structures as eukaryotes hosni et al 2013 madigan et al 2012 different from fungi the genetic materials of bacteria are present in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus causing bacteria to be more vulnerable to inactivation by ozone viruses without a cellular structure tend to be inactivated even more quickly madigan et al 2012 3 2 influencing factors 3 2 1 effect of ozone concentration the increase in initial ozone concentration had a positive effect on the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores as shown in fig 2 the log reduction of a niger with 4 mg l 1 ozone 3 25 log at a contact time of 10 min was 2 48 times that of 1 mg l 1 ozone 1 31 log for t harzianum and p polonicum the log reductions with 4 mg l 1 ozone were 2 27 and 1 76 times higher than those of 1 mg l 1 ozone the increased inactivation efficiency could be attributed mostly to greater ozone exposure ct value at higher initial ozone concentration during the same reaction time for instance the ozone exposure of a niger spores within 10 min was 21 95 mg min l 1 at the initial ozone concentration of 4 mg l 1 but it was only 3 50 mg min l 1 at the initial ozone concentration of 1 mg l 1 in addition the larger amount of oh generated by ozone decomposition at higher initial ozone concentration led to higher log reduction in the first inactivation stage thus improving the overall inactivation efficiency 3 2 2 effect of ph the effect of ph on ozone inactivation of the fungal spores is depicted in fig 3 change in ph had no obvious effect on fungal spore activity as shown in fig s2 the inactivation efficiency of ozone on the three fungal spores decreased as the ph value increased the inactivation of a niger spores by ozone within 10 min at ph 6 0 and 8 0 was 3 23 and 1 74 log respectively for t harzianum and p polonicum the inactivation decreased from 3 10 and 3 50 log to 2 52 and 2 60 log respectively as the ph value increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the weakened inactivation efficiency was related to a reduction of available ozone to react with fungal spores at higher ph for example the 10 min ozone exposure of a niger spores at ph 8 0 2 52 mg min l 1 was much lower than that at ph 6 0 10 78 mg min l 1 as shown in the illustration in fig 3 a c ozone decomposed faster in alkaline solution ph 8 0 than in acidic solution ph 6 0 because hydroxide ions could promote the decomposition of ozone to generate oh hoigné 1998 previous study revealed that the half life values of ozone concentration in water at ph 8 0 and 9 0 were approximately 100 and 10 times that at ph 10 0 respectively staehelin and hoigne 1982 furthermore the concentration of oh in pbs at ph 10 was more than 100 times higher than that at ph 6 0 under the same conditions when the initial ozone concentration was 0 5 mg l 1 rennecker et al 2001 in the present study the oh formed by the increase of ph was scavenged by excessive t buoh 20 mm the reduction in ozone exposure at ph 8 0 led to the lower inactivation efficiency of the fungal spores a comparison of the k values at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 is depicted in fig 3 d the increase in ph value accelerated the inactivation of the three fungal spores by ozone the k value of a niger exhibited a monotonic increase from 0 181 to 0 234 l mg 1 min 1 as the ph value increased from 6 0 to 8 0 for t harzianum the k value increased from 0 166 to 0 257 l mg 1 min 1 for p polonicum it increased from 0 157 to 0 230 l mg 1 min 1 the results were consistent with a previous study wolf et al 2018 that revealed that the k value of ms2 inactivated by ozone increased from 1 94 106 to 3 82 106 m 1 s 1 with increase of ph in the range of 6 5 8 5 in other studies cho et al 2002 2003 the slope value for bacillus subtilis inactivated by ozone increased slightly as the ph value increased from 5 6 to 8 2 in the presence of t buoh there are two main explanations for the positive effect of higher ph on the k value of fungal spores by ozone firstly the zeta potential of fungal spores increased with increasing ph wen et al 2019b which means that the electrostatic repulsion between spores was enhanced the dispersed spores had a greater chance of coming into contact with molecular ozone resulting in a faster rate of inactivation the k values of t harzianum and p polonicum increased by 54 8 and 47 7 respectively as the ph value increased from 6 0 to 8 0 while the k value of a niger increased by only 29 3 indicating that the k values of t harzianum and p polonicum spores were more affected by the change of ph than the value of a niger this difference was related to some extent to the different increments in zeta potential of the three fungal spores as ph increased the increase in zeta potential of a niger spores 0 3 mv with increase of ph from 6 0 to 8 0 was much less than those of t harzianum and p polonicum spores 3 78 and 4 87 mv respectively wen et al 2019b so among the three fungal spores a niger spores had the k value that was least susceptible to the change of ph secondly the difference in increase of k value could be related to increased activity of ozone in varying degrees against the different deprotonated chemical structures on the outer layers of the three fungal spores as the ph value increased cho et al 2002 3 2 3 effect of temperature to investigate the temperature dependence of the inactivation of fungal spores by ozone experiments were conducted at various temperatures ranging from 5 to 33 c the results of the control experiment showed that the spore concentration in the suspension remained constant at different temperatures during the reaction time fig s2 as shown in fig s3 the decrease of temperature inhibited the decomposition of ozone in the fungal spore system the inactivation of the fungal spores at different temperatures is shown in figs s4 s6 and the second stage inactivation were found to fit the chick watson model well a comparison of k values at the different temperatures is shown in fig 4 a increase of temperature accelerated the inactivation rate of fungal spores by ozone by enhancing the reactivity of ozone the k values of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum increased by 55 8 127 2 and 136 with the increase of temperature from 5 to 33 c respectively the results demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the k values of the three fungal spores inactivated by ozone followed the sequence p polonicum t harzianum a niger the arrhenius formula can be used to obtain the apparent activation energy of the three fungal spores inactivated by molecular ozone 2 log k log a 1 2 3 e a r t where a represents the collision frequency factor l mg 1 min 1 e a represents the activation energy j mol 1 r represents the ideal gas constant r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t represents the absolute temperature k taking the inverse of absolute temperature as the abscissa and log k as the ordinate the data obtained from the inactivation experiments at different temperatures are shown in fig 4 b the activation energy e a of the reaction of the fungal spores with ozone was calculated by eq 2 from the slope obtained by fitting the scatter plot to a straight line e a 10 63 kj mol 1 for a niger e a 18 43 kj mol 1 for t harzianum and e a 22 35 kj mol 1 for p polonicum these values were similar to the e a of ozone on ms2 bacteriophage 22 2 kj mol 1 in a previous study wolf et al 2018 it has been reported that such low temperature dependences indicate that the reaction rate constants at various temperatures are close to the maximum reaction rate of ozone on the microorganism wolf et al 2018 3 2 4 effect of ions in water effect of ionic strength in water on ozone inactivation of the fungal spores is shown in figs s7 s8 as shown in fig s7 effect of pbs concentration on inactivation efficiency could be negligible furthermore there was no significant change in ozone inactivation efficiency of the three fungal spores within 10 min as the concentration of nacl increased from 10 to 30 mm corresponding ionic strength increased from 40 to 80 mm respectively fig s8 so it could be considered that the effect of ionic strength in the water on the ozone inactivation of fungi was negligible similarly the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores by ozone remained unchanged with the concentration of ca2 and mg2 ions ranged from 0 200 mg l 1 figs s9 s10 indicating that the presence of alkaline earth metals ions in water has no obvious effect on the inactivation of fungi by ozone 3 3 inactivation mechanisms 3 3 1 leakage of intracellular substances fig 5 a depicts the changes of extracellular tn concentration in fungal spore suspensions before and after inactivation by ozone as shown in fig 5 a the extracellular tn of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum suspensions increased by 1 21 1 22 and 1 3 mg l 1 after applying ozone for 10 min respectively indicating the release of intracellular nitrogen containing substances the change of extracellular tn of p polonicum was slightly greater than those of the other two fungal spores which may be attributable to the higher degree of ozone inactivation of p polonicum the results indicated that the cell integrity was probably destroyed when the fungal spore was exposed to molecular ozone leading to the release of nitrogen containing materials including proteins and nucleic acids and fungal spore death the change of extracellular protein concentration was in agreement with that of extracellular tn fig 5 b for a niger the extracellular protein concentration increased from 0 41 to 1 19 mg l 1 for t harzianum it increased from 0 28 to 1 22 mg l 1 and for p polonicum it increased from 0 28 to 1 31 mg l 1 the increase in extracellular proteins could be ascribed to preferential reaction of ozone with lipoprotein on the cell wall and plasma membrane resulting in leakage of proteins von gunten 2003 3 3 2 changes in membrane permeability ros level and esterase activity to elucidate the inactivation effect of ozone on the fungal spores further membrane permeability ros level and esterase activity before and after inactivation were analyzed by the combination of three kinds of dyes and fcm the results of the analyses are shown in figs 6 and 7 according to our previous study fcm combined with sg pi is an effective method for evaluating fungal spore viability wen et al 2020a as shown in fig 6 the percentage of spores with intact membranes decreased rapidly with the increase of reaction time especially in the first stage inactivation the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores of a niger increased from 8 1 to 91 9 in the first 30 s after ozone was applied fig 7 for t harzianum and p polonicum it increased from 4 6 and 6 0 to 96 0 and 97 8 respectively figs s11 ands12 the membrane permeability of a small number of fungal spores detected before inactivation was ascribed to sub lethal damage that occurred during storage thanh et al 2007 the changes of the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores indicated that 1 05 1 38 and 1 63 log inactivation of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum by ozone were achieved within 30 s according to the data obtained by the plate counting method the log reductions of the three fungal spores in 30 s were 1 10 1 42 and 1 80 log respectively which were slightly higher than the values obtained by the change of the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores the discrepancy in inactivation efficiency occurred because fungal spores firstly lost their culturability during the inactivation and then lost their membrane integrity wen et al 2020a kong et al also found that some bacteria could not be detected by plate counting but still had infection ability that could be detected by fcm and this condition was called the viable but non culturable vbnc state kong et al 2015 the change of membrane integrity showed that ozone had a rapid inactivation rate of fungal spores and caused death of spores by destroying the integrity of the cell membrane the change in intracellular ros of the three fungal spores before and after ozone inactivation detected by fcm combined with dhe dye is shown in fig 6 as shown the proportion of spores with high ros level was lower than 10 0 before inactivation but it increased rapidly to more than 90 0 within the first 30 s of inactivation subsequently the proportion of spores with high ros decreased gradually as reaction time increased for instance the percentage of a niger spores with high ros increased from 4 2 to 93 7 within 30 s and then gradually decreased to 33 1 after inactivation for 10 min fig 7 the variations in the percentages of t harzianum and p polonicum spores with high ros level showed trends similar to that of a niger fig s11 and fig s12 ros are formed during metabolism and can serve as indicators of the physiological responses of fungi gessler et al 2007 the intracellular ros level increases rapidly upon exposure to an external chemical or physical stressor mesquita et al 2013 the fungal spores responded to the strong oxidative stimulation of ozone resulting in a dramatic increase in the proportion of spores with high ros level consistent with the result of a previous study intense fluorescence as a manifestation of ros was observed inside the hyphae using a fluorescence microscope indicating that ozone exposure led to the increase in ros production savi and scussel 2014 excessive ros destroy cellular structure by attacking lipid membranes metabolic enzymes and nucleic acids which induces cell death guo et al 2019 it can be speculated that the high level ros resulted in increased membrane permeability of the three fungal spores thus enhancing the inactivation efficiency of ozone therefore the proportion of spores with high ros level showed a decreasing trend as the fungal spores were continuously oxidized by ozone and ros the variation in intracellular esterase activity of the three fungal spores detected by fcm combined with cfda dye before and after ozone inactivation is shown in fig 6 the variation tendency of intracellular esterase activity was similar to that of ros level the proportion of fungal spores with high esterase activity showed a rapid increase followed by a decrease for instance the percentage of a niger spores with high esterase activity increased from 10 6 to 57 3 during the first 30 s of inactivation and then decreased gradually to 14 3 at 10 min fig 7 the variations in the percentages of t harzianum and p polonicum spores with high esterase activity showed trends similar to that of a niger figs s11 and s12 the increase of esterase activity in the early stage of ozone inactivation indicated that the response of fungal spores to the stress stimulated the intracellular esterase activity it can be speculated that the subsequent decrease in esterase activity could be attributable to the combined effect of molecular ozone and excessive ros as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the integrity of the cell membrane was firstly destroyed after the application of ozone and then the stress response of the fungal spores led to the increases of intracellular ros level and esterase activity the increase of esterase activity was not as severe as the increase of ros level which was presumably attributed to the oxidation of the enzyme by excessive ros the intracellular enzymes e g nadph oxidase and nitric oxide synthase required for ros formation of fungal spores were varied in type and quantity gessler et al 2007 which led to the difference in the changes of ros level and esterase activity among the three genera of fungal spores after ozone inactivation in summary ozone firstly attacked the cell walls and membranes causing permeabilization of the fungal spores then the intracellular materials were oxidized by the combined effect of molecular ozone and ros resulting in spore death 3 3 3 changes in spore surface morphology and structure sem images of the three fungal spores after 30 s of ozone exposure are shown in fig 8 as the images show the spores of three fungi were all spherical in shape before inactivation the diameters of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum were approximately 2 67 0 12 µm 2 25 0 22 µm and 2 16 0 48 µm respectively before inactivation the spores had smooth surfaces and complete structures the shape and surface characteristics of the three fungal spores were changed to some extent after 30 s of ozone exposure the surfaces of all spores became rough wrinkled and sunken and the spores shrank slightly the appearance of compounds around the spores after inactivation indicated that ozone preferentially reacted with cell wall and plasma membrane of the spores causing the release of intracellular materials similarly the wrinkled surfaces of fungal spores were observed using sem after exposure to ozone gas for 30 s and the conclusion was that ozone gas oxidized and destroyed the surface of spores kang et al 2015 the results obtained by sem were in agreement with the variations in extracellular tn concentration and membrane integrity described above ozone firstly attacked and destroyed cell walls and membranes then intracellular materials were oxidized by the combined effect of molecular ozone and ros resulting in the inactivation of the fungal spores 3 4 comparison of ozone with other disinfectants to compare the inactivation efficiency of different disinfectants on fungal spores directly three common disinfectants ozone chlorine dioxide and chlorine were applied to the fungal spores under the same conditions the results are depicted in fig 9 a c the inactivation efficiency of chlorine on the three fungal spores was insignificant with only 0 23 0 29 and 1 53 log reductions in survival within 10 min for a niger t harzianum and p polonicum respectively while the inactivation by chlorine dioxide attained 2 28 3 25 and 3 68 log reductions of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum within 10 min respectively fig 9 d shows a summary of the comparison of the inactivation rate constants of the three disinfectants on fungal spores the resistance of the fungal spores against chlorine dioxide and chlorine decreased in the following order a niger t harzianum p polonicum which was consistent with the order against ozone as shown in fig 9 d the k values of ozone inactivation on a niger and t harzianum spores were higher than those of chlorine dioxide and chlorine for p polonicum the k value of ozone was slightly lower than that of chlorine dioxide nevertheless due to the high ozone inactivation efficiency in the first inactivation stage the order of inactivation efficiency of the three disinfectants on fungal spores was considered to be ozone chlorine dioxide chlorine there are several possible explanations for the different inactivation efficiencies of the different disinfectants firstly the oxidation potentials of chlorine dioxide and chlorine are 1 51 v and 1 36 v respectively whereas ozone has a relatively high oxidation potential of 2 07 v wen et al 2017a the higher redox potential makes it easier for ozone to destroy the cell walls and membranes and react with the intracellular compounds of fungal spores secondly the three disinfectants have different chemical properties in water ozone and chlorine dioxide exist as neutral molecules in water in contrast the transition equilibrium of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions formed in water is susceptible to ph scarlett et al 2016 wen et al 2017a which weakens the inactivation effect of chlorine finally the three disinfectants have fundamental differences in their inactivation mechanisms ozone first attacks and destroys cell walls and membranes chlorine does not cause significant surface damage but rather instead reacts with internal components by constantly penetrating into the cells cho et al 2010 chlorine dioxide inactivates cells by breaking down the cell wall and changing the permeability pressure wen et al 2017a to summarize the relatively higher redox potential strong ability to diffuse in water and preferential destruction of cell walls make ozone a highly effective disinfectant for fungal spores the cost comparation of the three disinfectants for drinking water disinfection was shown in table s2 the total cost of disinfection mainly includes initial infrastructure costs material costs operation costs and maintenance costs mundy et al 2018 chlorine had the lowest cost among the three disinfectants which was 0 020 0 032 yuan m3 hutton and haller 2004 the cost of ozone 0 040 0 056 yuan m3 was similar to that of chlorine dioxide 0 036 0 054 yuan m3 mundy et al 2018 given that the use of chlorine or chlorine dioxide disinfection will produce more disinfection by products the ozone was considered a more reasonable disinfectant for drinking water treatment 3 5 inactivation of fungal spores in actual water the results of the inactivation of the three fungal spores in actual water using ozone are presented in fig 10 a c after 10 min of ozone exposure the log reductions of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum spores in surface water were reduced by 39 2 37 4 and 8 8 compared with the values in pbs respectively the inactivation efficiencies in groundwater were even lower reductions of 46 3 49 3 and 23 5 compared with pbs respectively competitive depletion of ozone in the presence of organic matrices may have been mainly responsible for the relatively low inactivation efficiencies in actual water malvestiti et al 2019 as shown in fig 10 d the background materials in natural water resulted in a significant increase in decomposition of ozone compared to the rate in pbs furthermore the ozone concentration decreased at a higher rate in groundwater than in surface water the reason for the latter difference was that inorganic ions with relative higher concentrations in groundwater such as fe2 and mn2 could be efficiently oxidized by ozone table s1 resulting in faster consumption of ozone in groundwater than in surface water von gunten 2003 therefore in the presence of background materials lower ozone exposure resulted in relatively lower ozone inactivation efficiency of fungal spores in actual water than in pbs the three fungal spores showed the same order of resistance to ozone in actual water as in pbs a niger t harzianum p polonicum the contribution of oh in the inactivation efficiency of ozone on fungal spores in actual water was calculated by eq 3 as shown in table s3 oh played an important role in the inactivation of all three fungi within the first 30 s contributing more than 80 of the log reduction in addition the inactivation caused by oh accounted for more than 40 of the total inactivation within 10 min both in the two kinds of actual water 3 log n t n 0 k o 3 o 3 d t k o h o h d t where nt and n0 represent the fungal spore concentrations cfu ml 1 at times t and 0 respectively ko3 and k oh represent the inactivation rate constants of ozone and oh with fungal spores l mg 1 min 1 respectively o3 and oh represent the concentration of ozone and oh mg l 1 respectively in general ozone could effectively control the fungi in actual water although its inactivation efficiency was reduced to some extent by the water matrices 4 conclusions based on the results of the present study the following four conclusions were reached 1 ozone has high inactivation efficiency on fungal spores in water the inactivation of fungal spores by ozone had an initial rapid inactivation stage followed by a slower second inactivation stage that fit the chick watson model well additionally there were no significant differences in k value among the three fungal spores 2 increase in initial ozone concentration enhanced the ozone inactivation efficiency of fungal spores by increasing the ozone exposure increase of ph and temperature had a positive effect on the k value of ozone inactivation of fungal spores by increasing ozone reactivity the e a values of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum were 10 63 18 43 and 22 35 kj mol 1 respectively 3 the changes in the morphology and permeability of cell membrane the release of intracellular materials tn and proteins and the variations in ros level and esterase activity indicated that ozone inactivated fungal spores by firstly destroying the integrity of the cell membrane and then causing the leakage of intracellular compounds resulting in spore death 4 the water matrices in actual water competed for ozone with fungal spores resulting in 8 8 39 2 and 23 5 49 3 reductions in inactivation efficiency of surface water and groundwater compared to pbs respectively nevertheless ozone was an effective disinfectant for inactivation of fungi in actual water the resistance of the three fungal spores against both ozone in pbs and actual water was in the following order a niger t harzianum p polonicum declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17580,fungal contamination of drinking water sources is increasingly threatening the environment and human health in this study the inactivation of three genera of dominant fungi in drinking water sources using ozone was first reported the inactivation of the fungal spores by ozone could be divided into two distinct stages first a rapid reduction in survival and then the inactivation at a slower rate the secondary stage inactivation fitted the chick watson model well and there was no significant difference in the second order inactivation rate constants of the three fungal spores 0 199 0 209 l mg 1 min 1 the inactivation rate constants of fungal spores by molecular ozone were much lower than those of viruses which were equivalent to that of cryptosporidium the increase in ph and temperature showed a positive effect on the inactivation rate damage to cell membranes leakage of intracellular compounds and changes of reactive oxygen species and esterase activity in the spores were detected after inactivation the results indicated that ozone inactivated fungal spores by firstly destroying cell walls and membranes and then causing the release of intracellular compounds the fungicidal efficiency of ozone was superior to those of chlorine and chlorine dioxide in addition the inactivation efficiency of ozone on fungal spores in real water matrices was reduced to 50 7 91 2 of the efficiency in phosphate buffer in conclusion ozone showed high efficiency in the inactivation of fungal spores and could be used as an alternative disinfectant for fungal contamination in drinking water sources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozone fungal spores inactivation kinetics mechanisms 1 introduction in recent years mass propagation of fungi has been considered a problem that cannot be ignored threatening the drinking water safety and has attracted much attention in the field of water treatment pereira et al 2009 wen et al 2017a fungi of various genera have been isolated from different drinking water sources around the world and the dominant species of these fungi included aspergillus spp penicillium spp trichoderma spp cladosporium spp fusarium spp rhizopus spp and some others oliveira et al 2013 rankovic 2005 wen et al 2017a fungal metabolic products have caused a variety of problems in the aquatic environment despite their low concentrations under normal circumstances red pigments in water caused by fusarium graminearum have been reported kelley et al 2003 and the fungus has been listed in most drinking water guidelines as a nuisance organism that causes odor problems babič et al 2017 worse still people will be at increased risk of suffering from mycosis and allergic reactions once the mycotoxins come into contact with the human body through water or food especially to immunocompromised patients curtis et al 2004 hageskal et al 2007 marr et al 2002 harmful effects of pathogenic aspergillus spp on human health mainly include asthma symptoms hypersensitivity pneumonitis and skin irritation which have been reported previously al gabr et al 2014 anaissie et al 2002 2003 green et al 2003 furthermore the incidence of fungal infections continues to increase with some invasive fungal infections being responsible for more than 50 of the mortality brown et al 2012 therefore it is very important to find an efficient method for controlling fungi in the aquatic environment inactivation of fungi with different disinfectants including free chlorine chlorine dioxide monochloramine and ultraviolet radiation has been reported ma and bibby 2017 pereira et al 2013 wen et al 2017a 2019a b 2020b oliveira et al 2020 wan et al 2020 pereira et al reported that fungi showed stronger resistance to chlorine than bacteria and viruses pereira et al 2013 the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine on three fungi aspergillus versicolor aspergillus fumigatus and penicillium purpurogenum was observed to be much lower than that of free chlorine ma and bibby 2017 additionally a large amount of disinfection by products will be produced during the application of chlorine and monochloramine hua and reckhow 2007 furst et al 2018 chlorine dioxide exhibited a higher inactivation efficiency than chlorine with 70 100 death of fungal spores in 60 s wen et al 2017a yang et al have reported that chlorate and chlorite were the major by products during chlorine dioxide disinfection yang et al 2013 in addition chlorine dioxide must be prepared on site due to its instability praeger et al 2018 results on the inactivation of three genera of aspergillus using ultraviolet c light indicated that ultraviolet radiation was effective for control of the fungi in water wan et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 however it has been reported that fungal spores have the potential to reactivate through dna repair mechanisms after uv irradiation even though their cell membranes are incomplete wen et al 2019a goldman and kafer 2004 ozone has been used for a long time as a disinfectant against most of waterborne pathogens due to its strong oxidization and broad spectrum microbicidal ability kruithof and masschelein 1999 roy et al 1982 shin and sobsey 2003 a high degree of inactivation 4 log of adenovirus type 40 and feline calicivirus was achieved during a low ozone exposure 0 60 mg min l 1 at 5 c and ph 7 0 thurston enriquez et al 2005 the inactivation efficiency of five enteric viruses by ozone was shown to be extremely high with second order inactivation rate constants ranging from 4 5 105 to 3 3 106 m 1 s 1 wolf et al 2018 ozone was considered as a promising alternative disinfectant for chlorine resistant bacteria in water causing 2 33 2 10 and 1 97 log inactivation for bacillus alvei lysinibacillus fusiformis and bacillus cereus spores at the ozone concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 within 1 min ding et al 2019 in addition ozone was used to inactivate the pathogenic bacterium ralstonia solanacearum by spraying ozonated water onto plants guo et al 2019 ozone has also been reported to be effective against the more resistant cryptosporidium with the inactivation process included an initial lag phase followed by rapid inactivation and subsequent slower inactivation rennecker et al 1999 2001 to the best of our knowledge previous studies have favored ozone inactivation of bacteria and viruses whereas inactivation of fungal spores using ozone in water has been reported much less frequently five fungi aspergillus parasiticus aspergillus flavus penicillium citrinum fusarium verticillioides and fusarium graminearum were exposed to ozone gas with a concentration of 60 µmol mol 1 and the results indicated that ozone was a highly effective disinfectant for the fungi savi and scussel 2014 inactivation of fungal spores associated with rice seeds was conducted using ozone and arc discharge plasma and the reactive oxygen species ros produced by ozone in water were found to be more effective than the nitric oxide generated from plasma for inactivating fusarium fujikuroi kang et al 2015 however inactivation of fungal spores in drinking water sources by ozone has scarcely been reported and detailed research on the kinetics and mechanisms of ozone inactivation of fungi is lacking in previous studies therefore the present study conducted inactivation of fungal spores by ozone with the following four main objectives 1 to evaluate the fungicidal potential of ozone solution on spores isolated from groundwater of three dominant genera of fungi and explore the inactivation kinetics 2 to investigate the role of three operational factors ozone concentration ph and temperature in the efficiency and kinetics of fungal spore inactivation with ozone 3 to explore the mechanism of ozone inactivation of fungal spores by observing the change of cell morphology determining the leakage of intracellular compounds evaluating the membrane integrity of spores and detecting the variations in ros level and esterase activity in spores 4 to assess the inactivation efficiency of ozone on fungal spores in surface water and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and test water all chemicals used in the present study were acs grade reagents chloride free phosphate buffer solution pbs 40 mm was used to maintain the ph of the reaction wen et al 2019b tert butanol t buoh stock solution 400 mm was prepared as a radical scavenger and sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 solution 0 1 m was prepared as a quenching agent the glass wares used in the experiments were rinsed and sterilized using the method described previously pereira et al 2013 surface water and groundwater were taken from two drinking water sources located in northwest china wen et al 2017b the parameters of water quality are shown in table s1 2 2 preparation of fungal spore suspensions the selected fungal species used in the present study were aspergillus niger a niger penicillium polonicum p polonicum and trichoderma harzianum t harzianum among which aspergillus spp and penicillium spp have been reported to be producers of mycotoxins paterson and lima 2005 all the three genera of fungi were isolated from groundwater sources in northwest china wen et al 2017a the spore suspensions were prepared with pbs and spores scraped from dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol drbc medium using the method described previously jung et al 2008 wen et al 2019b the concentration of spore suspensions cfu ml 1 was determined using the method described in our previous study wen et al 2017b and the target spore concentration of the stock solution was controlled at 108 109 cfu ml 1 2 3 preparation and determination of ozone in water the ozonated water was prepared by continuously passing ozone gas produced by an ozone generator lab2b ozonia co scotland into ultrapure water until the ozone concentration in water became stable as described in fig s1 the indigo disulphonate method was used to determine the ozone concentration of the ozonated water bader and hoigné 1981 2 4 inactivation procedures inactivation experiments were conducted in 40 mm pbs in sequence batch reactors to investigate the kinetics of ozone inactivation accurately excessive t buoh 20 mm was used to capture the hydroxyl radical oh produced by ozone decomposition von gunten 2003 wolf et al 2018 and thus ensure that the inactivation of fungal spores was principally caused by molecular ozone the stock of spore suspensions was added to each reactor to achieve an initial spore concentration of 1 2 105 cfu ml 1 at the beginning of the inactivation a volume of concentrated ozonated water appropriate for attaining the target ozone concentration was immediately mixed with the solution containing fungal spores in the batch reactor na2s2o3 solution 0 1 m was added to each reactor at a target reaction time to quench the residual ozone cho et al 2006 the concentration of fungal spores after inactivation was quantified by the heterotrophic plate count method and recorded as colony forming units per ml cfu ml 1 wen et al 2017a 2019b liu and zhang 2006 ozone decomposition experiments were conducted in a conical flask with stopper samples were taken at different reaction times and the indigo disulphonate method was used to determine the residual amount of ozone in the spore suspension bader and hoigné 1981 in the control experiment the procedure was the same with inactivation of fungal spores by ozone except that ozone solution was replaced with an equal volume of pure water to compare the inactivation efficiency of ozone with other disinfectants chlorine and chlorine dioxide were selected to inactivate fungal spores under the same operational conditions as ozone according to the ozone inactivation procedure described above the concentrated ozone solution was replaced with a sodium hypochlorite stock solution or a chlorine dioxide stock solution to achieve the initial disinfectant concentration of 2 mg l 1 a blank controlled experiment using pure water instead of disinfectants was also carried out 2 5 influencing factors the effects of three parameters on inactivation of fungal spores using ozone were investigated to evaluate the effect of initial ozone concentration 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 mg l 1 on inactivation efficiency inactivation experiments were carried out by adding different volumes of concentrated ozone solution to examine the influence of ph inactivation experiments were conducted in pbs at various ph values ranging from 6 0 8 0 to explore the temperature dependence of the fungal spore response to ozone a cryostat oldc 0510 olan china was used to control the reaction temperature at 5 14 20 27 and 33 c respectively in order to investigate the effect of ionic strength in water on ozone inactivation efficiency of fungal spores inactivation experiments were carried out in different concentrations of pbs 10 20 40 60 mm and by adding different amounts of sodium chloride 0 10 20 30 mm the effects of ca2 and mg2 ions on inactivation were also investigated by adding different concentrations of calcium sulfate and magnesium sulfate 50 100 200 mg l 1 2 6 analysis of inactivation mechanisms 2 6 1 changes of extracellular total nitrogen and protein an appropriate volume of the inactivated spore suspension was added to a centrifuge tube and then the supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the concentration of extracellular total nitrogen tn was determined in triplicate by spectrophotometry federation 2005 wen et al 2017a tn concentrations of untreated samples were tested as a control extracellular protein concentration before and after inactivation was determined in triplicate by spectrophotometer using the broadford method bradford 1976 2 6 2 flow cytometry measurement changes of membrane integrity ros level and esterase activity of fungal spores before and after inactivation were measured using a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa emitting at wavelengths of 488 nm and 640 nm berney et al 2007 wen et al 2014 2015 2016 2020a three dyes were used sybr green і propidium iodide sg pi dihydroethidium dhe and 5 and 6 carboxyfluorescein cfda the pi is repelled by living cells but can penetrate the membranes of cells that are dying or dead whereas the sg can stain all cells therefore sg pi combined staining was used to evaluate the ratio of compromised to intact membrane and thus explore the membrane integrity of fungal spores dhe was used to detect the intracellular ros level of fungal spores and cfda was used to investigate the esterase activity of fungal spores before analysis by flow cytometry fcm the stained samples were diluted with pbs to an appropriate concentration 103 105 cfu ml 1 wen et al 2020a additional details pertaining to the staining and detection procedures are available in our previous studies wan et al 2020 wen et al 2020a 2 6 3 scanning electron microscope observation after being treated with ozone fungal spores were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and fixed in 3 glutaraldehyde at 4 c overnight then the excess glutaraldehyde was removed by washing with pbs and ethanol with gradient concentration isoamyl acetate was added to the rinsed spores and the mixture was air dried finally the surface morphology of the fungal spores was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6510 jeol japan pre inactivation fungal spores were also observed as described above 2 7 data analysis the chick watson model was selected to

spores by ozone the inactivation efficiency of ozone on the fungal spores is shown in fig 1 there was no initial lag phase in the inactivation the inactivation curves of the three fungal spores were characterized by an initial rapid inactivation within approximately 30 s and a subsequent slower inactivation the results were in accordance with previous studies which have reported that the inactivation of viruses and cryptosporidium parvum by ozone included a secondary stage of inactivation with a slower rate rennecker et al 2001 wolf et al 2018 the rapid inactivation in the first stage was caused to some extent by advanced oxidation process related to oh because the oh with high transient concentration was not completely captured by t buoh in a short time 30 s buffle et al 2006 buffle and von gunten 2006 the results of the control experiment without ozone treatment are shown in fig s2 the contribution of the first stage was more significant during the inactivation of fungal spores by ozone the inactivation of spores in the first stage achieved 1 10 1 42 and 1 80 log reductions in survival rate for a niger t harzianum and p polonicum respectively the resistance against ozone varied among the three fungal spores for instance 5 63 2 36 and 0 51 mg min l 1 of ozone exposure ct value were required to achieve 2 log 99 inactivation of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum spores in pbs respectively therefore the resistance of the three genera of fungal spores against ozone followed the sequence of a niger t harzianum p polonicum the difference in resistance to ozone among the three fungal spores could be ascribed in part to the size of the spores the diameter of the a niger spore 2 67 0 12 µm was larger than those of t harzianum 2 25 0 22 µm and p polonicum 2 16 0 48 µm the lowest specific surface area of a niger spores made it more difficult to be inactivated by ozone in a previous study it was pointed out that the higher resistance against chlorine dioxide of cladosporium spp was attributable to its relatively larger spore size than those of penicillium spp and trichoderma spp wen et al 2017a the second stage inactivation of fungal spores by ozone fitted the chick watson model well r2 0 930 0 986 as shown in the internal illustration of fig 1 the k value in the present study refers to the second stage inactivation rate constant corresponding to the reaction of fungal spores with molecular ozone which was 0 199 0 209 and 0 204 l mg 1 min 1 for a niger t harzianum and p polonicum respectively no significant discrepancy in k value was observed among the three fungal spores the difference in resistance of the three fungal spores to ozone mainly occurred in the first stage of the inactivation the inactivation rate constants of different microorganisms by ozone are summarized in table 1 choi et al 2007 ding et al 2019 li et al 2017 rennecker et al 2001 wolf et al 2018 as shown in the table the second stage k values of fungal spores are 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than those of viruses and are comparable to that of cryptosporidium parvum the ct values required for 2 log inactivation 99 0 of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum were 5 65 2 36 and 0 82 mg min l 1 respectively which were much greater than the ct values required for viruses 1 9 8 0 10 3 mg min l 1 reported previously and were similar to that of cryptosporidium 4 52 mg min l 1 thus fungi and cryptosporidium parvum have higher resistance to ozone than bacteria and viruses which can be ascribed to their more complex cellular structures as eukaryotes hosni et al 2013 madigan et al 2012 different from fungi the genetic materials of bacteria are present in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus causing bacteria to be more vulnerable to inactivation by ozone viruses without a cellular structure tend to be inactivated even more quickly madigan et al 2012 3 2 influencing factors 3 2 1 effect of ozone concentration the increase in initial ozone concentration had a positive effect on the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores as shown in fig 2 the log reduction of a niger with 4 mg l 1 ozone 3 25 log at a contact time of 10 min was 2 48 times that of 1 mg l 1 ozone 1 31 log for t harzianum and p polonicum the log reductions with 4 mg l 1 ozone were 2 27 and 1 76 times higher than those of 1 mg l 1 ozone the increased inactivation efficiency could be attributed mostly to greater ozone exposure ct value at higher initial ozone concentration during the same reaction time for instance the ozone exposure of a niger spores within 10 min was 21 95 mg min l 1 at the initial ozone concentration of 4 mg l 1 but it was only 3 50 mg min l 1 at the initial ozone concentration of 1 mg l 1 in addition the larger amount of oh generated by ozone decomposition at higher initial ozone concentration led to higher log reduction in the first inactivation stage thus improving the overall inactivation efficiency 3 2 2 effect of ph the effect of ph on ozone inactivation of the fungal spores is depicted in fig 3 change in ph had no obvious effect on fungal spore activity as shown in fig s2 the inactivation efficiency of ozone on the three fungal spores decreased as the ph value increased the inactivation of a niger spores by ozone within 10 min at ph 6 0 and 8 0 was 3 23 and 1 74 log respectively for t harzianum and p polonicum the inactivation decreased from 3 10 and 3 50 log to 2 52 and 2 60 log respectively as the ph value increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the weakened inactivation efficiency was related to a reduction of available ozone to react with fungal spores at higher ph for example the 10 min ozone exposure of a niger spores at ph 8 0 2 52 mg min l 1 was much lower than that at ph 6 0 10 78 mg min l 1 as shown in the illustration in fig 3 a c ozone decomposed faster in alkaline solution ph 8 0 than in acidic solution ph 6 0 because hydroxide ions could promote the decomposition of ozone to generate oh hoigné 1998 previous study revealed that the half life values of ozone concentration in water at ph 8 0 and 9 0 were approximately 100 and 10 times that at ph 10 0 respectively staehelin and hoigne 1982 furthermore the concentration of oh in pbs at ph 10 was more than 100 times higher than that at ph 6 0 under the same conditions when the initial ozone concentration was 0 5 mg l 1 rennecker et al 2001 in the present study the oh formed by the increase of ph was scavenged by excessive t buoh 20 mm the reduction in ozone exposure at ph 8 0 led to the lower inactivation efficiency of the fungal spores a comparison of the k values at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 is depicted in fig 3 d the increase in ph value accelerated the inactivation of the three fungal spores by ozone the k value of a niger exhibited a monotonic increase from 0 181 to 0 234 l mg 1 min 1 as the ph value increased from 6 0 to 8 0 for t harzianum the k value increased from 0 166 to 0 257 l mg 1 min 1 for p polonicum it increased from 0 157 to 0 230 l mg 1 min 1 the results were consistent with a previous study wolf et al 2018 that revealed that the k value of ms2 inactivated by ozone increased from 1 94 106 to 3 82 106 m 1 s 1 with increase of ph in the range of 6 5 8 5 in other studies cho et al 2002 2003 the slope value for bacillus subtilis inactivated by ozone increased slightly as the ph value increased from 5 6 to 8 2 in the presence of t buoh there are two main explanations for the positive effect of higher ph on the k value of fungal spores by ozone firstly the zeta potential of fungal spores increased with increasing ph wen et al 2019b which means that the electrostatic repulsion between spores was enhanced the dispersed spores had a greater chance of coming into contact with molecular ozone resulting in a faster rate of inactivation the k values of t harzianum and p polonicum increased by 54 8 and 47 7 respectively as the ph value increased from 6 0 to 8 0 while the k value of a niger increased by only 29 3 indicating that the k values of t harzianum and p polonicum spores were more affected by the change of ph than the value of a niger this difference was related to some extent to the different increments in zeta potential of the three fungal spores as ph increased the increase in zeta potential of a niger spores 0 3 mv with increase of ph from 6 0 to 8 0 was much less than those of t harzianum and p polonicum spores 3 78 and 4 87 mv respectively wen et al 2019b so among the three fungal spores a niger spores had the k value that was least susceptible to the change of ph secondly the difference in increase of k value could be related to increased activity of ozone in varying degrees against the different deprotonated chemical structures on the outer layers of the three fungal spores as the ph value increased cho et al 2002 3 2 3 effect of temperature to investigate the temperature dependence of the inactivation of fungal spores by ozone experiments were conducted at various temperatures ranging from 5 to 33 c the results of the control experiment showed that the spore concentration in the suspension remained constant at different temperatures during the reaction time fig s2 as shown in fig s3 the decrease of temperature inhibited the decomposition of ozone in the fungal spore system the inactivation of the fungal spores at different temperatures is shown in figs s4 s6 and the second stage inactivation were found to fit the chick watson model well a comparison of k values at the different temperatures is shown in fig 4 a increase of temperature accelerated the inactivation rate of fungal spores by ozone by enhancing the reactivity of ozone the k values of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum increased by 55 8 127 2 and 136 with the increase of temperature from 5 to 33 c respectively the results demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the k values of the three fungal spores inactivated by ozone followed the sequence p polonicum t harzianum a niger the arrhenius formula can be used to obtain the apparent activation energy of the three fungal spores inactivated by molecular ozone 2 log k log a 1 2 3 e a r t where a represents the collision frequency factor l mg 1 min 1 e a represents the activation energy j mol 1 r represents the ideal gas constant r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t represents the absolute temperature k taking the inverse of absolute temperature as the abscissa and log k as the ordinate the data obtained from the inactivation experiments at different temperatures are shown in fig 4 b the activation energy e a of the reaction of the fungal spores with ozone was calculated by eq 2 from the slope obtained by fitting the scatter plot to a straight line e a 10 63 kj mol 1 for a niger e a 18 43 kj mol 1 for t harzianum and e a 22 35 kj mol 1 for p polonicum these values were similar to the e a of ozone on ms2 bacteriophage 22 2 kj mol 1 in a previous study wolf et al 2018 it has been reported that such low temperature dependences indicate that the reaction rate constants at various temperatures are close to the maximum reaction rate of ozone on the microorganism wolf et al 2018 3 2 4 effect of ions in water effect of ionic strength in water on ozone inactivation of the fungal spores is shown in figs s7 s8 as shown in fig s7 effect of pbs concentration on inactivation efficiency could be negligible furthermore there was no significant change in ozone inactivation efficiency of the three fungal spores within 10 min as the concentration of nacl increased from 10 to 30 mm corresponding ionic strength increased from 40 to 80 mm respectively fig s8 so it could be considered that the effect of ionic strength in the water on the ozone inactivation of fungi was negligible similarly the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores by ozone remained unchanged with the concentration of ca2 and mg2 ions ranged from 0 200 mg l 1 figs s9 s10 indicating that the presence of alkaline earth metals ions in water has no obvious effect on the inactivation of fungi by ozone 3 3 inactivation mechanisms 3 3 1 leakage of intracellular substances fig 5 a depicts the changes of extracellular tn concentration in fungal spore suspensions before and after inactivation by ozone as shown in fig 5 a the extracellular tn of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum suspensions increased by 1 21 1 22 and 1 3 mg l 1 after applying ozone for 10 min respectively indicating the release of intracellular nitrogen containing substances the change of extracellular tn of p polonicum was slightly greater than those of the other two fungal spores which may be attributable to the higher degree of ozone inactivation of p polonicum the results indicated that the cell integrity was probably destroyed when the fungal spore was exposed to molecular ozone leading to the release of nitrogen containing materials including proteins and nucleic acids and fungal spore death the change of extracellular protein concentration was in agreement with that of extracellular tn fig 5 b for a niger the extracellular protein concentration increased from 0 41 to 1 19 mg l 1 for t harzianum it increased from 0 28 to 1 22 mg l 1 and for p polonicum it increased from 0 28 to 1 31 mg l 1 the increase in extracellular proteins could be ascribed to preferential reaction of ozone with lipoprotein on the cell wall and plasma membrane resulting in leakage of proteins von gunten 2003 3 3 2 changes in membrane permeability ros level and esterase activity to elucidate the inactivation effect of ozone on the fungal spores further membrane permeability ros level and esterase activity before and after inactivation were analyzed by the combination of three kinds of dyes and fcm the results of the analyses are shown in figs 6 and 7 according to our previous study fcm combined with sg pi is an effective method for evaluating fungal spore viability wen et al 2020a as shown in fig 6 the percentage of spores with intact membranes decreased rapidly with the increase of reaction time especially in the first stage inactivation the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores of a niger increased from 8 1 to 91 9 in the first 30 s after ozone was applied fig 7 for t harzianum and p polonicum it increased from 4 6 and 6 0 to 96 0 and 97 8 respectively figs s11 ands12 the membrane permeability of a small number of fungal spores detected before inactivation was ascribed to sub lethal damage that occurred during storage thanh et al 2007 the changes of the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores indicated that 1 05 1 38 and 1 63 log inactivation of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum by ozone were achieved within 30 s according to the data obtained by the plate counting method the log reductions of the three fungal spores in 30 s were 1 10 1 42 and 1 80 log respectively which were slightly higher than the values obtained by the change of the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores the discrepancy in inactivation efficiency occurred because fungal spores firstly lost their culturability during the inactivation and then lost their membrane integrity wen et al 2020a kong et al also found that some bacteria could not be detected by plate counting but still had infection ability that could be detected by fcm and this condition was called the viable but non culturable vbnc state kong et al 2015 the change of membrane integrity showed that ozone had a rapid inactivation rate of fungal spores and caused death of spores by destroying the integrity of the cell membrane the change in intracellular ros of the three fungal spores before and after ozone inactivation detected by fcm combined with dhe dye is shown in fig 6 as shown the proportion of spores with high ros level was lower than 10 0 before inactivation but it increased rapidly to more than 90 0 within the first 30 s of inactivation subsequently the proportion of spores with high ros decreased gradually as reaction time increased for instance the percentage of a niger spores with high ros increased from 4 2 to 93 7 within 30 s and then gradually decreased to 33 1 after inactivation for 10 min fig 7 the variations in the percentages of t harzianum and p polonicum spores with high ros level showed trends similar to that of a niger fig s11 and fig s12 ros are formed during metabolism and can serve as indicators of the physiological responses of fungi gessler et al 2007 the intracellular ros level increases rapidly upon exposure to an external chemical or physical stressor mesquita et al 2013 the fungal spores responded to the strong oxidative stimulation of ozone resulting in a dramatic increase in the proportion of spores with high ros level consistent with the result of a previous study intense fluorescence as a manifestation of ros was observed inside the hyphae using a fluorescence microscope indicating that ozone exposure led to the increase in ros production savi and scussel 2014 excessive ros destroy cellular structure by attacking lipid membranes metabolic enzymes and nucleic acids which induces cell death guo et al 2019 it can be speculated that the high level ros resulted in increased membrane permeability of the three fungal spores thus enhancing the inactivation efficiency of ozone therefore the proportion of spores with high ros level showed a decreasing trend as the fungal spores were continuously oxidized by ozone and ros the variation in intracellular esterase activity of the three fungal spores detected by fcm combined with cfda dye before and after ozone inactivation is shown in fig 6 the variation tendency of intracellular esterase activity was similar to that of ros level the proportion of fungal spores with high esterase activity showed a rapid increase followed by a decrease for instance the percentage of a niger spores with high esterase activity increased from 10 6 to 57 3 during the first 30 s of inactivation and then decreased gradually to 14 3 at 10 min fig 7 the variations in the percentages of t harzianum and p polonicum spores with high esterase activity showed trends similar to that of a niger figs s11 and s12 the increase of esterase activity in the early stage of ozone inactivation indicated that the response of fungal spores to the stress stimulated the intracellular esterase activity it can be speculated that the subsequent decrease in esterase activity could be attributable to the combined effect of molecular ozone and excessive ros as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the integrity of the cell membrane was firstly destroyed after the application of ozone and then the stress response of the fungal spores led to the increases of intracellular ros level and esterase activity the increase of esterase activity was not as severe as the increase of ros level which was presumably attributed to the oxidation of the enzyme by excessive ros the intracellular enzymes e g nadph oxidase and nitric oxide synthase required for ros formation of fungal spores were varied in type and quantity gessler et al 2007 which led to the difference in the changes of ros level and esterase activity among the three genera of fungal spores after ozone inactivation in summary ozone firstly attacked the cell walls and membranes causing permeabilization of the fungal spores then the intracellular materials were oxidized by the combined effect of molecular ozone and ros resulting in spore death 3 3 3 changes in spore surface morphology and structure sem images of the three fungal spores after 30 s of ozone exposure are shown in fig 8 as the images show the spores of three fungi were all spherical in shape before inactivation the diameters of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum were approximately 2 67 0 12 µm 2 25 0 22 µm and 2 16 0 48 µm respectively before inactivation the spores had smooth surfaces and complete structures the shape and surface characteristics of the three fungal spores were changed to some extent after 30 s of ozone exposure the surfaces of all spores became rough wrinkled and sunken and the spores shrank slightly the appearance of compounds around the spores after inactivation indicated that ozone preferentially reacted with cell wall and plasma membrane of the spores causing the release of intracellular materials similarly the wrinkled surfaces of fungal spores were observed using sem after exposure to ozone gas for 30 s and the conclusion was that ozone gas oxidized and destroyed the surface of spores kang et al 2015 the results obtained by sem were in agreement with the variations in extracellular tn concentration and membrane integrity described above ozone firstly attacked and destroyed cell walls and membranes then intracellular materials were oxidized by the combined effect of molecular ozone and ros resulting in the inactivation of the fungal spores 3 4 comparison of ozone with other disinfectants to compare the inactivation efficiency of different disinfectants on fungal spores directly three common disinfectants ozone chlorine dioxide and chlorine were applied to the fungal spores under the same conditions the results are depicted in fig 9 a c the inactivation efficiency of chlorine on the three fungal spores was insignificant with only 0 23 0 29 and 1 53 log reductions in survival within 10 min for a niger t harzianum and p polonicum respectively while the inactivation by chlorine dioxide attained 2 28 3 25 and 3 68 log reductions of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum within 10 min respectively fig 9 d shows a summary of the comparison of the inactivation rate constants of the three disinfectants on fungal spores the resistance of the fungal spores against chlorine dioxide and chlorine decreased in the following order a niger t harzianum p polonicum which was consistent with the order against ozone as shown in fig 9 d the k values of ozone inactivation on a niger and t harzianum spores were higher than those of chlorine dioxide and chlorine for p polonicum the k value of ozone was slightly lower than that of chlorine dioxide nevertheless due to the high ozone inactivation efficiency in the first inactivation stage the order of inactivation efficiency of the three disinfectants on fungal spores was considered to be ozone chlorine dioxide chlorine there are several possible explanations for the different inactivation efficiencies of the different disinfectants firstly the oxidation potentials of chlorine dioxide and chlorine are 1 51 v and 1 36 v respectively whereas ozone has a relatively high oxidation potential of 2 07 v wen et al 2017a the higher redox potential makes it easier for ozone to destroy the cell walls and membranes and react with the intracellular compounds of fungal spores secondly the three disinfectants have different chemical properties in water ozone and chlorine dioxide exist as neutral molecules in water in contrast the transition equilibrium of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions formed in water is susceptible to ph scarlett et al 2016 wen et al 2017a which weakens the inactivation effect of chlorine finally the three disinfectants have fundamental differences in their inactivation mechanisms ozone first attacks and destroys cell walls and membranes chlorine does not cause significant surface damage but rather instead reacts with internal components by constantly penetrating into the cells cho et al 2010 chlorine dioxide inactivates cells by breaking down the cell wall and changing the permeability pressure wen et al 2017a to summarize the relatively higher redox potential strong ability to diffuse in water and preferential destruction of cell walls make ozone a highly effective disinfectant for fungal spores the cost comparation of the three disinfectants for drinking water disinfection was shown in table s2 the total cost of disinfection mainly includes initial infrastructure costs material costs operation costs and maintenance costs mundy et al 2018 chlorine had the lowest cost among the three disinfectants which was 0 020 0 032 yuan m3 hutton and haller 2004 the cost of ozone 0 040 0 056 yuan m3 was similar to that of chlorine dioxide 0 036 0 054 yuan m3 mundy et al 2018 given that the use of chlorine or chlorine dioxide disinfection will produce more disinfection by products the ozone was considered a more reasonable disinfectant for drinking water treatment 3 5 inactivation of fungal spores in actual water the results of the inactivation of the three fungal spores in actual water using ozone are presented in fig 10 a c after 10 min of ozone exposure the log reductions of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum spores in surface water were reduced by 39 2 37 4 and 8 8 compared with the values in pbs respectively the inactivation efficiencies in groundwater were even lower reductions of 46 3 49 3 and 23 5 compared with pbs respectively competitive depletion of ozone in the presence of organic matrices may have been mainly responsible for the relatively low inactivation efficiencies in actual water malvestiti et al 2019 as shown in fig 10 d the background materials in natural water resulted in a significant increase in decomposition of ozone compared to the rate in pbs furthermore the ozone concentration decreased at a higher rate in groundwater than in surface water the reason for the latter difference was that inorganic ions with relative higher concentrations in groundwater such as fe2 and mn2 could be efficiently oxidized by ozone table s1 resulting in faster consumption of ozone in groundwater than in surface water von gunten 2003 therefore in the presence of background materials lower ozone exposure resulted in relatively lower ozone inactivation efficiency of fungal spores in actual water than in pbs the three fungal spores showed the same order of resistance to ozone in actual water as in pbs a niger t harzianum p polonicum the contribution of oh in the inactivation efficiency of ozone on fungal spores in actual water was calculated by eq 3 as shown in table s3 oh played an important role in the inactivation of all three fungi within the first 30 s contributing more than 80 of the log reduction in addition the inactivation caused by oh accounted for more than 40 of the total inactivation within 10 min both in the two kinds of actual water 3 log n t n 0 k o 3 o 3 d t k o h o h d t where nt and n0 represent the fungal spore concentrations cfu ml 1 at times t and 0 respectively ko3 and k oh represent the inactivation rate constants of ozone and oh with fungal spores l mg 1 min 1 respectively o3 and oh represent the concentration of ozone and oh mg l 1 respectively in general ozone could effectively control the fungi in actual water although its inactivation efficiency was reduced to some extent by the water matrices 4 conclusions based on the results of the present study the following four conclusions were reached 1 ozone has high inactivation efficiency on fungal spores in water the inactivation of fungal spores by ozone had an initial rapid inactivation stage followed by a slower second inactivation stage that fit the chick watson model well additionally there were no significant differences in k value among the three fungal spores 2 increase in initial ozone concentration enhanced the ozone inactivation efficiency of fungal spores by increasing the ozone exposure increase of ph and temperature had a positive effect on the k value of ozone inactivation of fungal spores by increasing ozone reactivity the e a values of a niger t harzianum and p polonicum were 10 63 18 43 and 22 35 kj mol 1 respectively 3 the changes in the morphology and permeability of cell membrane the release of intracellular materials tn and proteins and the variations in ros level and esterase activity indicated that ozone inactivated fungal spores by firstly destroying the integrity of the cell membrane and then causing the leakage of intracellular compounds resulting in spore death 4 the water matrices in actual water competed for ozone with fungal spores resulting in 8 8 39 2 and 23 5 49 3 reductions in inactivation efficiency of surface water and groundwater compared to pbs respectively nevertheless ozone was an effective disinfectant for inactivation of fungi in actual water the resistance of the three fungal spores against both ozone in pbs and actual water was in the following order a niger t harzianum p polonicum declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17581,this study compared chlorination induced changes of the properties of natural organic matter nom represented by standard humic substances and nom present in pristine and anthropogenically affect reservoirs rivers groundwater and seawater the chlorination induced changes of nom properties were quantified using the differential absorbance spectra das which were processed via numeric deconvolution six gaussian bands were found to comprise the das of all examined waters these bands denoted as a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 respectively have maxima located at ca 200 240 276 316 385 and 547 nm the bands a1 a4 were observed in the das of representative model chlorinated compounds quantum chemical qc calculations were carried out to examine the intrinsic nature of these bands and electronic transitions associated with them qc data demonstrate that bands a1 and a2 are present in almost all aromatic organic species a3 is likely to be associated with acetophenone and or styrene like groups a4 can be attributed to the engagement of m hydroxyaromatic and flavone type groups typical for the polyphenolic moiety in nom and known to be the key precursors of disinfection by product dbp formation thus the intensity of band a4 is predicted to be an especially strong predictor of dbp formation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorination differential absorbance spectra disinfection byproducts electronic transition natural organic matter frontier molecular orbital theory 1 introduction since the discovery of chloroform in chlorinated drinking water almost four decades ago consistent efforts have been made to determine the identities and toxicities of a wide range of chlorinated brominated and iodinated disinfection by products dbps including currently regulated trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas as well as numerous unregulated and emerging dbps for example aromatic halogenated dbps which tend to decompose during chlorination to form a range of aliphatic halogenated dbps whose developmental toxicity may be tens or hundreds of times higher than the regulated dbps cowman and singer 1996 korshin et al 2007 plewa and wagner 2015 rook 1974 nonetheless the complexity of natural organic matter nom and its reaction pathways make it difficult to predict dbp concentrations with sufficient precision beauchamp et al 2018 shah and mitch 2012 szczuka et al 2017 because absorbance spectroscopy is a simple inexpensive rapid and reliable method to track changes of nom properties it has been widely used to characterize nom halogenation of and dbp formation beauchamp et al 2018 li and hur 2017 the absorbance of natural waters measured using wavelengths between 250 and 280 nm is indicative of the concentration of aromatic structures korshin et al 1999 korshin et al 1997 while the intensity of the differential absorbance spectra das at wavelengths near 272 nm da272 tends to correspond to the maximum of a prominent band found in the das of chlorinated waters da272 has been used to quantify the formation of individual dbps total organic halogen tox and chlorine consumption korshin et al 2007 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 roccaro et al 2015 the use of da272 approach has allowed developing strong correlations between da272 values and dbp concentrations formed in a wide range of natural waters chlorinated at variable ph nom and bromide concentrations chlorine dose reaction time temperature and other conditions beauchamp et al 2018 korshin et al 2002 although the das of chlorinated nom tends to have a prominent maximum at ca 272 nm the shape of das exhibits subtle but consistent changes as the reaction progresses korshin et al 2007 korshin et al 1999 the correlations between the concentrations of individual dbps cl2 consumption and on the other hand da272 values tend to be nonlinear for example exhibiting a relatively lower slope for da272 values 0 011 cm 1 and a higher slope for da272 0 020 cm 1 for chlorination of water from lake washington lw in seattle in prior publication korshin et al 2007 changes in the shape of the das of nom have been interpreted to reflect the engagement of spectroscopically and kinetically distinct functionalities that were operationally termed fast and slow chromophores respectively the generation of di and tri halogenated dbps has been shown to be closely correlated with the engagement of the slow chromophores and less so with that of the fast chromophores korshin et al 2007 yan et al 2014 several alternative parameters for instance the differential absorbance at 425 nm da425 the differential of the logarithm of absorbance at 350 nm dlna350 and the change in the spectral slope in the wavelength range of 325 to 375 nm dslope325 375 have been introduced in recent research beauchamp et al 2019b yan et al 2014 use of these parameters has allowed demonstrating that changes in the absorbance of nom at long wavelengths tend to reflect the engagement of the slow chromophores and have a stronger linear correlation with the yields of some dbp species and cl2 consumption however the chemical mechanism of the correlation between fast or slow chromophores and parameters derived from different wavelengths is still indistinct this is a great obstacle to expanding the utility of this approach given that nom comprises a complex set of reactive chromophoric functionalities whose intrinsic properties remain to be determined in adequate detail helms et al 2008 korshin et al 1997 twardowski et al 2004 numerous model compounds have been employed to explore the features observed in das of chlorinated nom while some similarities exist between the features found in das of nom and those of selected model compounds a sufficiently detailed understanding of the relationships between the spectroscopic responses of the model compounds and nom has not been achieved beauchamp et al 2019a huang et al 2018 in addition a number of nonhalogenated or nonhalogenated aromatic compounds may form as unstable intermediates during the generation of dbps the occurrence and nature of such intermediates need to be identified further jiang et al 2020 we posit that this difficulty can be addressed based on quantum chemical qc simulations of the spectroscopic changes caused by halogenation reactions recent advances in qc methods demonstrate that time dependent density functional theory td dft can be particularly useful for accurate predictions of the absorbance spectra of some small molecular weight organic molecules anouar et al 2012 chaitanya 2012 karabacak et al 2012 given that qc calculations allow ascertaining the nature of the electronic transitions yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 this approach can provide insights needed for further understanding of the features observed in the absorbance spectra of nom and model compounds and their relationships with dbp formation in this study we examined main properties of the das of surface waters seawater and standard humic substances both differences and commonalities in the structure of das of these waters were discovered via numeric deconvolution a combination of qc calculations based on the frontier molecular orbital theory fmo and experiments for 10 representative model compounds allowed exploring the intrinsic chemistry of nom chromophores engaged in halogenation and their correlations with dbp formation the results provide a more detailed basis for the understanding of the structure of the differential absorbance spectra of nom and developing a system of spectroscopic parameters for the characterization of nom halogenation and other water treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 source waters standard humic substances suwannee river

were shipped in high density polyethylene or polypropylene containers to the laboratories in which the experiments were carried out upon arrival the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter

those specifically mentioned all solutions were prepared using milli q water 18 2 mu cm millipore corp ma usa chlorination was carried out in headspace free ptfe bags as described previously beauchamp

amount of cl2 chlorinated natural water samples were allowed to react from 5 min to 1 day the model compounds were allowed to react for 24 h samples aliquots were withdrawn from the bags at desired

gaussian 09 software frisch et al 2009 methods based on the td dft were used to simulate chlorination reactions peb0 functional was used because of its advantages in optimizing organic structures and calculating their energies adamo and barone 1999 perdew et al 1996 1997 the 6 311g d p basis set was used for all atoms when the system is neutral frisch et al 1984 krishnan et al 1980 mclean and chandler 1980 however if the system was negatively charged the 6 311 g d p basis set was used due to the advantages of the dispersion function clark et al 1983 structural optimizations were realized using standard algorithms without any symmetry constraints the nature of the minima was examined via vibrational analysis solvent water effects were treated using the pcm implicit solvent model scalmani and frisch 2010 multiwfn software was used to view molecular orbitals of different molecules analyze the contribution of each atom to molecular orbitals and calculate mayer bond order lu and chen 2012 in conjugated polymers the atom and bond properties in the conjugation chain show alternant character therefore the bond order alternation boa is introduced as an important quantity to study conjugation of molecules chattopadhyaya et al 2012 generally the boa is defined as 1 boa average order of even bonds average order of odd bonds mayer bond order was chosen in this study which can be obtained from the gaussian output file through multiwfn the details were introduced in si section with an example of 2 6 6 trichlorohexa 2 4 dienoic acid as defined boa is an indicator of the bond alternation character in the structural characterization of organic reactive substrates accordingly changes of boa can be used to quantify structural effects caused by chlorination 3 results 3 1 das of different chlorinated water samples the absorbance of twelve examined waters decreased quasi exponentially vs the wavelength fig s1 as was observed in prior research helms et al 2008 korshin et al 1997 twardowski et al 2004 no obvious features were observed for the chlorinated waters at varying reaction times except that the absorbance decreased gradually over most of the wavelength range to amplify the spectral features the das is calculated vs the reference spectrum measured before chlorination of six representative water samples as shown in fig 1 the data presented in this figure include standard humic substance river water lake or reservoir water groundwater and seawater the das of the remaining six water samples is presented in the si sections the das of nom in different waters exhibits different behavior vs reaction time the groundwater from henan shows the largest change in absorbance with time while the seawater has the smallest change surface waters such as rivers and reservoirs exhibit similar changes and features in their differential absorbance this implies the different properties of nom found in different waters the das showed a peak with a maximum located at 272 nm in all examined waters fig 1 and fig s2 in addition there were several weak features located at wavelengths of approximately 220 240 320 380 and 550 nm for example including peaks at c a 240 nm in fig 1 a 320 nm in fig 1 e and 220 nm in fig 1 f 3 2 deconvolution of the das to examine the features observed in the das shown in fig 1 the differential spectra were deconvoluted into a set of discrete bands he et al 2015 huang et al 2018 yan et al 2013 these bands were assumed to have a gaussian shape when represented vs photon energy measured in ev calculated as 2 e e v 1240 λ n m each of the gaussian bands was characterized by the energy of its maximum e0i width wi and intensity at e e0i a0i and the resultant differential spectra a e obtained at varying reaction time are represented as 3 δ a e i δ a 0 i exp e e 0 i w i 2 2 the application of this concept to the modeling of the das of all examined waters resulted in a very close fitting between the observed and modeled spectra r2 0 98 in most cases fig 2 and fig s3 in all cases except for the seawaters six gaussian components were sufficient to model the experimental data the energies of the maxima of these bands were not affected by water provenance and reaction time but their intensity and in some cases their width changed as the chlorination progressed the maxima of the bands denoted as a5 a4 a3 a2 a1 and a0 were located at 2 27 0 04 ev 547 nm 3 22 0 07 ev 385 nm 3 92 0 04 ev 316 nm 4 50 0 07 ev 276 nm 5 19 0 08 ev 240 nm and 6 23 0 12 ev 200 nm an additional gaussian band denoted as a6 5 64 0 04 ev 220 nm needed to be introduced for the seawaters this band most likely represents the spectroscopic response to the oxidation of iodide in seawater he et al 2015 because the contributions of band a0 were affected by the non specific absorbance from hydroxyl and other inorganic ions while band a5 was relatively very weak only bands a1 4 will be discussed henceforth fig 2 shows that the different shapes of das of the examined waters are due to the different contributions of these bands the changes of the intensities of each band normalized by corresponding highest absorbance respectively in srfa and alento river water at varying reaction time are provided in fig 3 as an example although the intensity of each band consistently increases with the reaction time for both types of water they show different trends for alento water the intensity of band a1 increases most quickly at lower reaction time followed by a2 a3 and a4 whereas in the case of srfa the intensity of bands a2 and a3 increased most quickly followed by a1 and a4 these differences indicated that it is important to ascertain the nature of each band and relate it to the reactivity of the chromophores associated with the emergence of each band as a result of nom chlorination 3 3 interpreting the features of das with model compounds to test the notion that the bands observed in the das of nom can be indicative of the presence of distinct functional groups 10 representative model compounds were selected to examine their das the initial spectra and das of model compounds chlorinated at varying reaction time and chlorine doses are shown in figs s5 and s6 respectively although the positions of the peaks for the model compounds differ considerably the four bands observed in the das of nom were found in the das of the model compounds to examine their nature qc calculations were carried out using the approach described in prior study yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for representative products of chlorination of the model compounds these products included mono di and trichloro substituted products as well as those of hydrolysis the chlorinated products that are likely to be dominant for the chlorination of any selected model compound were selected based on the comparison of the experimental and modeled das the qc calculated das of the 10 model compounds and their dominant chlorinated products are shown in fig s6 it demonstrates that the positions of the main bands in the theoretical das match well with those observed in the experimental das with the differences within 10 nm except for hydroquinone this level of precision is deemed to be acceptable in quantum chemistry calculations to find the commonalities in the properties of the gaussian bands that comprise the das of model compounds fig s6 the hole electron distribution of these model compounds and their main chlorinated products and the oscillator strength denoted as f of electron transitions were calculated by multiwfn lu 2018 these distributions can be illustrated by the data for bands a1 4 for one of the selected model compounds dhba table 1 the structures of the dominant reaction products formed as a result of dhba chlorination are also shown table 1 the hole electron distributions for the other model compounds are shown in table s3 the experimental das of the model compounds with a single benzene ring and an independent auxochrome e g 4 hydroxybenzoic acid catechol acetaminophen and hydroquinone exhibit spectroscopic responses primarily for wavelengths 300 nm correspondingly their qc simulated spectra have only two strong absorption peaks located at wavelengths below 300 nm one of these peaks has a high oscillator strength f 0 05 and the other one is very strong f 0 1 these two peaks correspond to gaussian bands a1 and a2 although some deviation from their experimentally observed positions occurs due to the effect of the substituents after chlorination the n π transition from the lone pair of the oxygen or chlorine to the π orbital of the conjugated system would occur with the oxidation of benzene ring causing a decrease in oscillator strength for example the peak at 242 nm of catechol has an oscillator strength of 0 179 while its chlorinated product is 0 027 the model compound p aminoacetophenone has the structure of a benzene ring bound to a double carbon oxygen bond this increases the length of the conjugated chain and in agreement with prior research yan et al 2017 this results in the appearance of a peak at 310 nm in the das which is attributable to the π π electron transition the das of the model compounds with a m hydroxyaromatic structure e g resorcinol dhba and phloroglucinol have pronounced peaks in the range of wavelengths 300 nm li et al 2000 these peaks appear to correspond to bands a3 and a4 and stem from the n π transition of their oxidation products such as 2 4 4 6 6 pentachloro 3 5 dioxocyclohex 1 ene 1 carboxylic acid structure 2 in table 1 which are important dbp precursors the model compounds quercetin and kaempferol with the flavone structure have peaks located at 380 nm due to the presence of the long conjugated chain these results show that the π π and n π electron transitions make the most prominent contributions to the das bands in the spectra of the examined model compounds however the change in the peak positions of the model compounds after chlorination are complex with redshifts of the maxima and blueshifts in others to quantify these changes the concept of boa an important quantity in the study of conjugated structures was introduced the changes in the location of the first absorption peak before and after chlorination change of peak show a linear correlation with the change in boa δboa of the model compounds and dominant products in chlorination as shown in fig 4 each point in this figure represents the data of modeling for each model compound the data shown in fig 4 can divided into two major groups that have similar slopes but different intercepts between change in the location of the first absorption peak and boa before and after chlorination in the first group that includes kaempferol acetaminophen quercetin p amino acetophenone and dhba when dhba was chlorinated at low chlorine dose the aromatic rings have not undergone cleavage yet after chlorination resulting in a small corresponding intercept 21 8 the second group includes catechol hydroquinone resorcinol phloroglucinol 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and dhba when dhba was chlorinated at low chlorine dose the aromatic structures have been broken by chlorination and the conjugated structure changed significantly leading to a high intercept 382 9 the similar slopes show some commonalities in chlorination process of model compounds it means that the change of conjugation of molecules may be predicted by observing spectral features with the expanding of the above correlation in general the destruction of the aromatic structures will lead to an increase in boa and a red shift of the first absorption peak of the model compounds this is shown in the data represented by the orange triangle in fig 4 it is well also known that the destruction of the aromatic structures in nom is closely correlated with the formation of halogenated aliphatic disinfection by products this implies that the boa approach can help to study disinfection processes 4 discussion prior research has resulted in the development of a number of spectroscopic parameters but it remains unclear whether the spectral parameters derived from

introduced in the introduction part beauchamp et al 2019b the presented data combining the experimental and modeled spectra of the model compounds may help examine this issue in more detail to elucidate this point dhba which is an excellent dbp precursor widely used in prior studies deleer et al 1985 norwood et al 1980 can be to illustrate the significance of our approach because dhba is one of the compounds that has a similar molar absorptivity to nom and it is well known to form chloroform in reactions with hocl li et al 2000 the das data for dhba chlorinated at varying chlorine doses are shown in fig s7 according to the features of das that emerge at increasing molar ratios of cl2 dhba the progress of the reaction can be divided into four stages qc calculations were carried out for each stage to determine the theoretical differential spectra and corresponding dominant reaction and products as shown in fig 5 the change in the absorbance is consistent with the yield of representative dbps fig 6 for the first stage of chlorination which corresponds to low chlorine doses cl2 dhba 0 2 dhba undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution that result in a redshift of the peak characteristic for the benzene ring this stage of chlorination causes the change in absorbance spectra at wavelengths 300 nm when given that little dbps are formed in chlorination phase this observation explains the presence of nonlinear relationships between the da272 parameter and dbp concentrations that is typical for nom halogenation korshin et al 2007 korshin et al 1999 in the second

cl2 dhba 6 a significant amount of cyclic ketone structures is formed and their haloform reaction leads to a considerable formation of dbps and at the same time a consistent decrease in the intensity absorbance both above and below 300 nm takes place in the fourth phase of dhba chlorination cl2 dhba 6 chlorine causes the organic substrate to break down into smaller fragments without causing additional increases of dbp concentrations although the intensity of absorbance can decrease further this result can be interpreted to demonstrate that spectral parameters that are based on measurements at relatively long wavelengths e g 300 nm that are reflective of the formation and hydrolysis of the active ketones are more intrinsically related with the formation of dbps while on the other hand the spectral parameters derived from measurements at short wavelengths are affected by a more complex set of factors 5 conclusions 1 this study shows that the differential spectra of chlorinated nom can be deconvoluted into six gaussian bands with maxima at about 457 385 316 276 240 and 200 nm denoted as a5 a4 a3 a2 a1 and a0 this system of gaussian band is similar to that observed for nom interaction with metals bands a1 a4 could be also observed in the das of representative model chlorinated compounds 2 qc data demonstrate that bands a1 and a2 are present in the das spectra of almost all aromatic organics a3 is associated with acetophenone or styrene derivatives and a4 is attributed to the engagement of a polyphenolic structure with high conjugation like flavonoids and a m hydroxyaromatic structure linear correlations were found to exist between the change in conjugation of molecules and the positions of absorption peaks in das 3 the experimental and modeled data for dhba demonstrate that the spectroscopic parameters based on the measurements at relatively long wavelengths 300 nm are expected to have stronger correlations with dbp formation because changes of the absorbance in this region are more reflective of the formation of the tautomeric ketone forms that are involved in dbp generation this study demonstrates that the combination of experimental and quantum chemistry calculations represents a powerful method for the exploration of dbp formation this approach needs to be developed further to examine halogenation reactions and

17581,this study compared chlorination induced changes of the properties of natural organic matter nom represented by standard humic substances and nom present in pristine and anthropogenically affect reservoirs rivers groundwater and seawater the chlorination induced changes of nom properties were quantified using the differential absorbance spectra das which were processed via numeric deconvolution six gaussian bands were found to comprise the das of all examined waters these bands denoted as a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 respectively have maxima located at ca 200 240 276 316 385 and 547 nm the bands a1 a4 were observed in the das of representative model chlorinated compounds quantum chemical qc calculations were carried out to examine the intrinsic nature of these bands and electronic transitions associated with them qc data demonstrate that bands a1 and a2 are present in almost all aromatic organic species a3 is likely to be associated with acetophenone and or styrene like groups a4 can be attributed to the engagement of m hydroxyaromatic and flavone type groups typical for the polyphenolic moiety in nom and known to be the key precursors of disinfection by product dbp formation thus the intensity of band a4 is predicted to be an especially strong predictor of dbp formation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorination differential absorbance spectra disinfection byproducts electronic transition natural organic matter frontier molecular orbital theory 1 introduction since the discovery of chloroform in chlorinated drinking water almost four decades ago consistent efforts have been made to determine the identities and toxicities of a wide range of chlorinated brominated and iodinated disinfection by products dbps including currently regulated trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas as well as numerous unregulated and emerging dbps for example aromatic halogenated dbps which tend to decompose during chlorination to form a range of aliphatic halogenated dbps whose developmental toxicity may be tens or hundreds of times higher than the regulated dbps cowman and singer 1996 korshin et al 2007 plewa and wagner 2015 rook 1974 nonetheless the complexity of natural organic matter nom and its reaction pathways make it difficult to predict dbp concentrations with sufficient precision beauchamp et al 2018 shah and mitch 2012 szczuka et al 2017 because absorbance spectroscopy is a simple inexpensive rapid and reliable method to track changes of nom properties it has been widely used to characterize nom halogenation of and dbp formation beauchamp et al 2018 li and hur 2017 the absorbance of natural waters measured using wavelengths between 250 and 280 nm is indicative of the concentration of aromatic structures korshin et al 1999 korshin et al 1997 while the intensity of the differential absorbance spectra das at wavelengths near 272 nm da272 tends to correspond to the maximum of a prominent band found in the das of chlorinated waters da272 has been used to quantify the formation of individual dbps total organic halogen tox and chlorine consumption korshin et al 2007 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 roccaro et al 2015 the use of da272 approach has allowed developing strong correlations between da272 values and dbp concentrations formed in a wide range of natural waters chlorinated at variable ph nom and bromide concentrations chlorine dose reaction time temperature and other conditions beauchamp et al 2018 korshin et al 2002 although the das of chlorinated nom tends to have a prominent maximum at ca 272 nm the shape of das exhibits subtle but consistent changes as the reaction progresses korshin et al 2007 korshin et al 1999 the correlations between the concentrations of individual dbps cl2 consumption and on the other hand da272 values tend to be nonlinear for example exhibiting a relatively lower slope for da272 values 0 011 cm 1 and a higher slope for da272 0 020 cm 1 for chlorination of water from lake washington lw in seattle in prior publication korshin et al 2007 changes in the shape of the das of nom have been interpreted to reflect the engagement of spectroscopically and kinetically distinct functionalities that were operationally termed fast and slow chromophores respectively the generation of di and tri halogenated dbps has been shown to be closely correlated with the engagement of the slow chromophores and less so with that of the fast chromophores korshin et al 2007 yan et al 2014 several alternative parameters for instance the differential absorbance at 425 nm da425 the differential of the logarithm of absorbance at 350 nm dlna350 and the change in the spectral slope in the wavelength range of 325 to 375 nm dslope325 375 have been introduced in recent research beauchamp et al 2019b yan et al 2014 use of these parameters has allowed demonstrating that changes in the absorbance of nom at long wavelengths tend to reflect the engagement of the slow chromophores and have a stronger linear correlation with the yields of some dbp species and cl2 consumption however the chemical mechanism of the correlation between fast or slow chromophores and parameters derived from different wavelengths is still indistinct this is a great obstacle to expanding the utility of this approach given that nom comprises a complex set of reactive chromophoric functionalities whose intrinsic properties remain to be determined in adequate detail helms et al 2008 korshin et al 1997 twardowski et al 2004 numerous model compounds have been employed to explore the features observed in das of chlorinated nom while some similarities exist between the features found in das of nom and those of selected model compounds a sufficiently detailed understanding of the relationships between the spectroscopic responses of the model compounds and nom has not been achieved beauchamp et al 2019a huang et al 2018 in addition a number of nonhalogenated or nonhalogenated aromatic compounds may form as unstable intermediates during the generation of dbps the occurrence and nature of such intermediates need to be identified further jiang et al 2020 we posit that this difficulty can be addressed based on quantum chemical qc simulations of the spectroscopic changes caused by halogenation reactions recent advances in qc methods demonstrate that time dependent density functional theory td dft can be particularly useful for accurate predictions of the absorbance spectra of some small molecular weight organic molecules anouar et al 2012 chaitanya 2012 karabacak et al 2012 given that qc calculations allow ascertaining the nature of the electronic transitions yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 this approach can provide insights needed for further understanding of the features observed in the absorbance spectra of nom and model compounds and their relationships with dbp formation in this study we examined main properties of the das of surface waters seawater and standard humic substances both differences and commonalities in the structure of das of these waters were discovered via numeric deconvolution a combination of qc calculations based on the frontier molecular orbital theory fmo and experiments for 10 representative model compounds allowed exploring the intrinsic chemistry of nom chromophores engaged in halogenation and their correlations with dbp formation the results provide a more detailed basis for the understanding of the structure of the differential absorbance spectra of nom and developing a system of spectroscopic parameters for the characterization of nom halogenation and other water treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 source waters standard humic substances suwannee river

gaussian 09 software frisch et al 2009 methods based on the td dft were used to simulate chlorination reactions peb0 functional was used because of its advantages in optimizing organic structures and calculating their energies adamo and barone 1999 perdew et al 1996 1997 the 6 311g d p basis set was used for all atoms when the system is neutral frisch et al 1984 krishnan et al 1980 mclean and chandler 1980 however if the system was negatively charged the 6 311 g d p basis set was used due to the advantages of the dispersion function clark et al 1983 structural optimizations were realized using standard algorithms without any symmetry constraints the nature of the minima was examined via vibrational analysis solvent water effects were treated using the pcm implicit solvent model scalmani and frisch 2010 multiwfn software was used to view molecular orbitals of different molecules analyze the contribution of each atom to molecular orbitals and calculate mayer bond order lu and chen 2012 in conjugated polymers the atom and bond properties in the conjugation chain show alternant character therefore the bond order alternation boa is introduced as an important quantity to study conjugation of molecules chattopadhyaya et al 2012 generally the boa is defined as 1 boa average order of even bonds average order of odd bonds mayer bond order was chosen in this study which can be obtained from the gaussian output file through multiwfn the details were introduced in si section with an example of 2 6 6 trichlorohexa 2 4 dienoic acid as defined boa is an indicator of the bond alternation character in the structural characterization of organic reactive substrates accordingly changes of boa can be used to quantify structural effects caused by chlorination 3 results 3 1 das of different chlorinated water samples the absorbance of twelve examined waters decreased quasi exponentially vs the wavelength fig s1 as was observed in prior research helms et al 2008 korshin et al 1997 twardowski et al 2004 no obvious features were observed for the chlorinated waters at varying reaction times except that the absorbance decreased gradually over most of the wavelength range to amplify the spectral features the das is calculated vs the reference spectrum measured before chlorination of six representative water samples as shown in fig 1 the data presented in this figure include standard humic substance river water lake or reservoir water groundwater and seawater the das of the remaining six water samples is presented in the si sections the das of nom in different waters exhibits different behavior vs reaction time the groundwater from henan shows the largest change in absorbance with time while the seawater has the smallest change surface waters such as rivers and reservoirs exhibit similar changes and features in their differential absorbance this implies the different properties of nom found in different waters the das showed a peak with a maximum located at 272 nm in all examined waters fig 1 and fig s2 in addition there were several weak features located at wavelengths of approximately 220 240 320 380 and 550 nm for example including peaks at c a 240 nm in fig 1 a 320 nm in fig 1 e and 220 nm in fig 1 f 3 2 deconvolution of the das to examine the features observed in the das shown in fig 1 the differential spectra were deconvoluted into a set of discrete bands he et al 2015 huang et al 2018 yan et al 2013 these bands were assumed to have a gaussian shape when represented vs photon energy measured in ev calculated as 2 e e v 1240 λ n m each of the gaussian bands was characterized by the energy of its maximum e0i width wi and intensity at e e0i a0i and the resultant differential spectra a e obtained at varying reaction time are represented as 3 δ a e i δ a 0 i exp e e 0 i w i 2 2 the application of this concept to the modeling of the das of all examined waters resulted in a very close fitting between the observed and modeled spectra r2 0 98 in most cases fig 2 and fig s3 in all cases except for the seawaters six gaussian components were sufficient to model the experimental data the energies of the maxima of these bands were not affected by water provenance and reaction time but their intensity and in some cases their width changed as the chlorination progressed the maxima of the bands denoted as a5 a4 a3 a2 a1 and a0 were located at 2 27 0 04 ev 547 nm 3 22 0 07 ev 385 nm 3 92 0 04 ev 316 nm 4 50 0 07 ev 276 nm 5 19 0 08 ev 240 nm and 6 23 0 12 ev 200 nm an additional gaussian band denoted as a6 5 64 0 04 ev 220 nm needed to be introduced for the seawaters this band most likely represents the spectroscopic response to the oxidation of iodide in seawater he et al 2015 because the contributions of band a0 were affected by the non specific absorbance from hydroxyl and other inorganic ions while band a5 was relatively very weak only bands a1 4 will be discussed henceforth fig 2 shows that the different shapes of das of the examined waters are due to the different contributions of these bands the changes of the intensities of each band normalized by corresponding highest absorbance respectively in srfa and alento river water at varying reaction time are provided in fig 3 as an example although the intensity of each band consistently increases with the reaction time for both types of water they show different trends for alento water the intensity of band a1 increases most quickly at lower reaction time followed by a2 a3 and a4 whereas in the case of srfa the intensity of bands a2 and a3 increased most quickly followed by a1 and a4 these differences indicated that it is important to ascertain the nature of each band and relate it to the reactivity of the chromophores associated with the emergence of each band as a result of nom chlorination 3 3 interpreting the features of das with model compounds to test the notion that the bands observed in the das of nom can be indicative of the presence of distinct functional groups 10 representative model compounds were selected to examine their das the initial spectra and das of model compounds chlorinated at varying reaction time and chlorine doses are shown in figs s5 and s6 respectively although the positions of the peaks for the model compounds differ considerably the four bands observed in the das of nom were found in the das of the model compounds to examine their nature qc calculations were carried out using the approach described in prior study yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for representative products of chlorination of the model compounds these products included mono di and trichloro substituted products as well as those of hydrolysis the chlorinated products that are likely to be dominant for the chlorination of any selected model compound were selected based on the comparison of the experimental and modeled das the qc calculated das of the 10 model compounds and their dominant chlorinated products are shown in fig s6 it demonstrates that the positions of the main bands in the theoretical das match well with those observed in the experimental das with the differences within 10 nm except for hydroquinone this level of precision is deemed to be acceptable in quantum chemistry calculations to find the commonalities in the properties of the gaussian bands that comprise the das of model compounds fig s6 the hole electron distribution of these model compounds and their main chlorinated products and the oscillator strength denoted as f of electron transitions were calculated by multiwfn lu 2018 these distributions can be illustrated by the data for bands a1 4 for one of the selected model compounds dhba table 1 the structures of the dominant reaction products formed as a result of dhba

flavonoids and a m hydroxyaromatic structure linear correlations were found to exist between the change in conjugation of molecules and the positions of absorption peaks in das 3 the experimental and modeled data for dhba demonstrate that the spectroscopic parameters based on the measurements at relatively long wavelengths 300 nm are expected to have stronger correlations with dbp formation because changes of the absorbance in this region are more reflective of the formation of the tautomeric ketone forms that are involved in dbp generation this study demonstrates that the combination of experimental and quantum chemistry calculations represents a powerful method for the exploration of dbp formation this approach needs to be developed further to examine halogenation reactions and

17582,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have emerged as a major concern in aquatic systems worldwide due to their widespread applications and health concerns perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is one of the most detected pfas yet a cost effective technology has been lacking for the degradation of pfas due to their resistance to conventional treatment processes to address this challenge we prepared a novel adsorptive photocatalyst referred to fe tnts ac based on low cost commercial activated carbon ac and tio2 the composite material exhibited synergistic adsorption and photocatalytic activity and enabled a novel concentrate destroy strategy for rapid and complete degradation of pfoa in water fe tnts ac was able to adsorb pfoa within a few minutes thereby effectively concentrating the target contaminant on the photoactive sites subsequently fe tnts ac was able to degrade 90 of pfoa that was preconcentrated on the solid in 4 h under uv irradiation 254 nm 21 mw cm 2 of which 62 was completely mineralized to f the efficient photodegradation also regenerated fe tnts ac eliminating the need for expensive chemical regenerants and after six cycles of adsorption photodegradation the material showed no significant drop in adsorption capacity or photocatalytic activity simulations based on the density functional theory dft revealed that fe tnts ac adsorbs pfoa in the side on parallel mode facilitating the subsequent photocatalytic degradation of pfoa according to the dft analysis scavenger tests and analysis of degradation intermediates pfoa decomposition is initiated by direct hole oxidation which activates the molecule and leads to a series of decarboxylation c f bond cleavage and chain shortening reactions the innovative concentrate destroy strategy may significantly advance conventional adsorption or photochemical treatment of pfas contaminated water and holds the potential to degrade pfoa and potentially other pfas more cost effectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances perfluorooctanoic acid adsorption photocatalysis concentrate and destroy 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been widely detected in soil and waters due to their widespread applications and high resistance to environmental degradation li et al 2019 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos are the most detected pfas and have been associated with various adverse health effects li et al 2019 to mitigate human exposure the u s environmental protection agency epa established a lifetime health advisory level of 70 ng l 1 for combined pfoa and pfos in drinking water on may 19 2016 a recent survey reported that drinking water supplies for 6 million u s residents exceeded the advisory level hu et al 2016 to remove or degrade pfas in contaminated waters various technologies have been tested including adsorption ion exchange and redox decomposition for instance effective adsorption of pfoa has been reported using activated carbon zhang et al 2016 carbon nanotubes deng et al 2012 carbon fibers wang et al 2015 metal organic frameworks liu et al 2015a and ion exchange resins wang et al 2019 however these adsorption approaches involve some critical drawbacks including 1 they do not degrade the pfas and 2 the regeneration of the adsorbents is costly and often requires expensive and toxic solvents such as methanol and ethanol generating large volumes of regenerant waste residuals that require additional costly handling and disposal deng et al 2015 du et al 2015 while pfas are hardly biodegradable many physicochemical methods have been intensively studied in recent years including chemical park et al 2016 photochemical liang et al 2016 photocatalytic zhong et al 2019 sonochemical shende et al 2019 electrochemical le et al 2019 and thermochemical watanabe et al 2018 treatments while these methods may partially mineralize pfas the high chemical and energy demands prohibit practical implementation recently photocatalytic decomposition of persistent organic pollutants has come a long way with the advancement in development of highly active nanostructured composite materials for instance uv generated hydrated electron was applied to degrade pfoa pfos in the presence of 10 mm na2so3 and was able to defluorinate 48 and 38 of pfoa and pfos respectively after 12 h of uv irradiation 254 nm bentel et al 2019 while commercial tio2 p25 cannot decompose pfoa effectively zhong et al 2019 graphene modified tio2 was able to decompose 93 of pfoa after 12 h of uv 254 nm irradiation gomez ruiz et al 2018 through photocatalysis additionally modifying tio2 with noble metallic nanoparticles e g pt and pd enhanced pfoa photodegradation since the nanoparticles can facilitate electron transfer and prevent hole electron recombination for instance li et al 2016 found that pt and pd modified tio2 decomposed pfoa 12 5 and 7 5 times faster than pristine tio2 respectively in general oh e 0 2 72 v schwarz and dodson 1984 and o2 e 0 1 83 v radi et al 1991 radicals may not be able to directly attack the c f bonds in pfas due to the high bond energy 107 118 kcal mol 1 bentel et al 2019 this is also true for other stronger oxidation radicals such as no2 and so4 which can be generated in the photochemical process thus pfoa decomposition typically starts with the cleavage of the c c bond at the head group by photogenerated holes or electrons bahnemann et al 1997 estrellan et al 2010 for instance the coo head group of pfoa is first decarboxylated by direct hole mediated oxidation or indirect radical oxidation electron transfer which activates the molecule eqs 1 3 and initiates a stepwise defluorination process each of which loses one cf2 entity zhong et al 2019 in this stepwise defluorination process the organic substrate radicals cnf2n 1 react with oh and or reactive oxygen species ros to former shorter chain byproducts or mineralization products 1 pfo a h pfoa 2 pfo a oh n o 2 so 4 pfoa o h no 2 so 4 2 3 pfoa c 7 f 15 co o h however the photogenerated e h pairs are prone to recombination and or being scavenged by side reactions to overcome this issue conventional photocatalysts such as tio2 are often modified by depositing or doping with transition metals chen et al 2015 noble metals li et al 2016 carbon nanotubes song et al 2012 and graphene graphene oxide li et al 2012 which can facilitate transfer of photogenerated electrons thereby preventing the electron hole recombination typically pfas are present at trace concentrations ppb or ppt levels in contaminated waters as such it is often not practical to directly treat large volumes of water using energy or chemical intensive methods such as advanced oxidation with persulfate or direct photolysis for instance heat activated persulfate has been widely studied for the degradation of pfoa park et al 2016 however in addition to the high chemical dosage it requires heating the bulk water to 50 85 c which largely hampering the cost effectiveness others used vacuum ultraviolet vuv light 185 nm to activate persulfate to degrade perfluorodecanoic acid wang et al 2010 only 60 degradation was observed but the high energy consumption associated with the irradiation of energy intensive vuv on the bulk water prevents implementation of the technology for large scale applications generally photocatalytic processes are less practical when used to treat trace concentrations of pfas in a large volume of contaminated water due to 1 large reactor size special reactor configuration and the associated high cost 2 limited light penetration 3 high energy cost and 4 difficulties in recycling and reusing the photocatalysts besides conventional photocatalysts like tio2 have limited catalytic activity towards pfas recently titanate nanotubes tnts derived from tio2 have attracted intensive interest as adsorbents or photocatalysts for organic pollutants removal due to their specific tubular structure large surface area nanoscale properties and good photoelectron response chen et al 2019 ji et al 2020 liu et al 2016a xu et al 2019 in previous work we developed an adsorptive photocatalyst tnts ac by combining activated charcoal ac and tnts through a hydrothermal treatment approach liu et al 2016a tnts ac not only offered rapid adsorption rate and enhanced adsorption capacity for phenanthrene but also boosted the generation of ros and photocatalytic activity practically such adsorptive photocatalysts may enable an innovative concentrate destroy approach for treating trace concentrations of persistent organic pollutants pops like pfas in large volumes of water first pops are concentrated on a small volume of ac modified tnts sites and then the pre concentrated pops are efficiently degraded under solar or uv light the photodegradation also regenerates the material allowing for repeated use the first concentrating step can be implemented using low cost adsorption processes such as mixer settlers or fix bed columns the concentrating step not only facilitates the subsequent photodegradation but also greatly cut down the photodegradation cost compared to treating the large volumes of bulk water using chemical or energy intensive methods therefore titanate nanomaterials supported on carbonaceous materials comprise a high application potential for pfas removal through initial concentration and subsequent degradation mechanisms however despite the carbon modification tnts ac carries negative surface potential due to the titanate functional groups o consequently tnts ac is expected to be unfavorable for sorption of pfoa anions due to electrostatic repulsion therefore proper surface tailoring of tnts ac is needed to enhance both adsorption and photocatalytic activity for pfoa building upon the prior work we prepared a new iron modified tnts ac referred to as fe tnts ac for enhanced adsorption and photodegradation of pfoa pfoa was used as a model pfas compound because pfoa has been one of the most widely detected pfas in contaminated waters and one of the most investigated pfas giesy and kannan 2002 kwak et al 2020 vierke et al 2012 besides pfoa is one of the high priority pfas in drinking water and has been regulated in 11 us states e g the proposed maximum contaminant level for pfoa has been set at 12 ng l 1 in new hampshire and 14 ng l 1 in california and new jersey iron is an excellent electron conductor and can act as an electron sink and prevent electron hole recombination thus promoting the photocatalytic activity of tnts liu et al 2015b besides the deposition of iron oxides may suppress the negative surface potential moreover iron can interact with the carboxylate head group of pfoa and facilitate a side on adsorption mode of pfoa which is conducive to both adsorption and photocatalytic degradation xu et al 2020a the specific objectives of this study were to 1 synthesize characterize and optimize fe tnts ac 2 test fe tnts ac for adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of pfoa 3 examine the effect of ph on the material performance 4 gage the reusability of fe tnts ac after photodegradation without chemical regeneration and 5 elucidate the reaction pathways and mechanisms via chemical analysis and

weatherley 1998 2 2 synthesis and characterization of fe tnts ac first tnts ac was synthesized through a hydrothermal method based on our prior work liu et al 2016 briefly 1 2 g of tio2 was mixed with 1 2 g of f 400 gac and then dispersed into 67 ml of a 10 m naoh solution upon thorough mixing the mixture was transferred into a teflon lined reactor in an autoclave and heated at 130 c for 72 h the gray precipitates i e tnts ac were separated and washed with di water until neutral ph and then oven dried at 105 c for 4 h then 1 g of the dried tnts ac was dispersed in 100 ml of di water and then 10 ml of an fecl2 solution 1 g l 1 as fe ph 3 0 was dropwise added into the tnts ac suspension upon equilibrium 99 7 fe ii was adsorbed by tnts ac the solid particles were then separated and oven dried at 105 c for 24 h which also oxidized fe ii to fe iii the dried particles were then calcined at 550 c under nitrogen flow at 100 ml min 1 for 3 h the fe content in the resulting fe tnts ac was 1 wt the resulting fe tnts ac had a particle size of 0 59 0 84 mm and a density 2630 kg m 3 the calcination temperature and fe content were varied to obtain the optimal fe tnts ac based on the adsorption rate capacity and photoactivity the following calcination temperatures were tested at a fixed fe content of 1 wt 300 550 650 and 850 c whereas the fe contents were tested at 0 5 1 3 and 5

in batch reactors using 40 ml high density polyethylene hdpe vials under the following experimental conditions initial pfoa 100 µg l 1 material dosage 1 g l 1 and temperature 22 1 c the initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 using diluted hclo4 and naoh the adsorption was initiated by mixing a given material with the pfoa solution the vials were kept in the dark and under shaking at 100 rpm at predetermined times the vials were sampled in duplicate and centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 rpm and the supernatants were analyzed for the remaining pfoa each adsorption kinetic test lasted for 4 h which was sufficient to reach equilibrium adsorption isotherms for pfoa were conducted following the same procedure and under the following conditions initial pfoa 0 to 100 mg l 1 material dosage 1 g

settle by gravity 99 of the materials settled note 95 of fe tnts ac settled in 30 s then 95 of the supernatant was pipetted out and the residual solid liquid mixture was transferred into a quartz photo reactor with a quartz cover afterwards 8 ml of di water was added to the mixture so that the solution volume in the photo reactor reached 10 ml i e solid loading 4 g l 1 and the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 the reactor was then placed in a rayonet chamber uv reactor southern new england ultraviolet co branford ct usa and subjected to uv light at a wavelength of 254 nm and an intensity of 21 mw cm 2 at a 38 cm distance at predetermined times i e 1 2 3 and 4 h the solid and liquid were sacrificially separated through centrifugation with the solid subjected to hot methanol extraction section s2 in sm and the liquid analyzed for fluoride duplicate experiments were carried out for each time point m8pfoa was used as the internal standard is to correct the mass recovery and the average method recovery was 90 for pfoa all tests were carried out in duplicate in this paper the term degradation refers to decomposition or breakdown of pfoa into other compounds such as shorter chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas whereas defluorination or mineralization indicates the conversion of fluorine in pfoa into fluoride ions the degradation was quantified by comparing the pfoa concentrations before and after photodegradation whereas defluorination was determined by measuring the fluoride produced upon the photocatalytic reactions the effects of ph on pfoa photodegradation were studied in the initial ph range from 4 0 to 10 0 the roles of h oh and o2 were tested through the classical scavenger experiments using potassium iodide ki isopropanol ip and benzoquinone bq as the respective radical scavengers wei et al 2017b the reusability of the photo regenerated materials was tested by using the same material in six consecutive cycles of the adsorption photodegradation experiments 2 5 chemical analysis quantitative analysis of pfoa was performed via liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms text s3 in

oes 710 es varian usa and the instrument detection limits were 30 and 50 μg l 1 respectively 2 6 density functional theory calculations to understand the role of surface complexation in adsorption of pfoa anions on fe tnts ac the fukui index of organic compounds pfoa in this work was obtained from the peking university reactive sites for organic compounds database pku reod specifically the density functional theory dft calculations were performed using the gaussian 16 c 01 package frisch et al 2016 according to wei et al 2017a the b3lyp functional 6 311 g d p basis set and the integral equation formalism polarized continuum model iefpcm as the solvation model were employed in the hybrid dft calculations to determine the orientation of pfoa adsorbed on the surface e g parallel or perpendicular formic acid and edge sharing octahedral dimers with two fe3 atoms were used to mimic the surface binding this simplified configuration saves computing time and at the same time adequately predicts the possible orientation of pfoa anions on the surface the fukui function and the calculated electrostatic potential esp were used to predict the regioselectivity of reactive species h and oh acting on pfoa the geometry optimization and single point energy calculations were carried out following the b3lyp approach with the 6 31 g d p basis set the fukui function has been widely used in the prediction of reactive sites of electrophilic nucleophilic and general radical attacks parr and yang 1984 specifically the fukui function is defined as 4 f r ρ r n v r where ρ r is the electron density at a point r in space n is the electron number in the system and the constant term v is the external potential in this work the atomic population number was used to represent the electron density distribution around an atom and the condensed fukui functions for different radical attacks were calculated via 5 electrophilic attack f a q n 1 a q n a 6 nucleophilic attack f a q n a q n 1 a 7 radical attack f a 0 q n 1 a q n 1 a 2 where q a is the charge of atom a at the corresponding state the more reactive sites on a molecule usually have larger values of the fukui index than other regions in this study the natural population analysis npa charge was used to calculate the fukui index oláh et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of fe tnts ac fig s1a in sm presents a representative sem image of calcined fe tnts ac displaying a cotton like surface structure consisting of interwoven carbon and fe modified tnts this structure is expected to be conducive to concentrating pfas on the outer shell of the particles due to partial blockage of the inner pores during the hydrothermal treatment thereby facilitating the subsequent photocatalytic destruction of pfas in situ fig s1b shows the eds spectra of fe tnts ac confirming the presence of the five major elements i e c o na fe and ti on the surface of fe tnts ac tables s2 and s3 in sm give the percentages of the elements based on the eds and xps analyses respectively the fairly high carbon content 53 02 wt per eds and 51 08 wt per xps indicates that some of the core ac was broken into fine particles that are attached or blended with the fe tnts on the outer shell of the fe tnts ac fig 1 a shows the tem images of fe tnts ac which confirms that some micro carbon particles are blended with tnts with a particle size in the range of 5 to 20 nm the attachment of these carbon nanoparticles on tnts suppresses the negative surface potential of tnts and facilitates the adsorption of pfoa through enhanced hydrophobic interactions and weakened electrostatic repulsion moreover the micro carbon particles may facilitate electron transfer to result in enhanced photoactivity liu et al 2016a figs 1 b and 1 c show close ups of the fe and carbon modified tnts fig 1 b reveals that the tnts have an outer diameter of 20 nm and a length of 100 nm fig s2 in sm presents the eds mappings of the elements indicating that fe was well distributed on the surface of fe tnts ac while ti o and c were the predominant elements fig 1d shows the xrd patterns of f 400 gac tnts ac and calcined fe tnts ac table s4 in sm lists the six crystalline phases where quartz sio2 and moissanite sic are from the parent ac for the parent ac f 400 the peaks at 26 7 and 43 4 are assigned to the diffractions of the 002 and 100 crystal planes of graphite respectively le et al 2012 quiñones et al 2014 rey et al 2012 for tnts ac the peaks at 9 2 24 1 28 1 48 4 and 61 4 are attributed to sodium trititanate expressed as na x h2 x ti3o7 which is composed of corrugated ribbons of triple edge sharing tio6 the skeletal structure with cations e g na h and fe3 attached at the interlayers chen et al 2002 liu et al 2016b ma et al 2017 the peak at 9 2 signifies the interlayer distance 9 1 å crystal plane 200 of sodium trititanate sun and li 2003 the peak at 26 1 represents the crystal plane of graphite 002 confirming that the carbon nanoparticles were intermingled with tnts liu et al 2016a for calcined fe tnts ac the peaks at 24 1 36 6 46 2 52 4 60 2 and 73 are attributed to anatase li et al 2018 whereas the peaks at 26 1 and 31 4 are assigned to graphite 002 and hematite α fe2o3 104 sivula et al 2011 respectively evidently upon calcination and fe deposition the sodium tri titanate of tnts ac was transformed into anatase this observation agrees with the eds mapping data fig s1b and fig s2 the hrtem images in fig 1 c display the layered crystalline structures of tnts and fe2o3 on the calcined fe tnts ac revealing an interlayer distance of 0 35 nm for anatase and 0 27 nm for fe2o3 the interlayer distance for anatase is much smaller than that for neat tnts 0 75 nm for the crystal plane 200 of titanate and 0 79 nm for unmodified tnts ac liu et al 2016a indicating the iron modification and calcination altered the crystalline structure of tnts ac fig s3 in sm shows the xps spectra of fe tnts ac and table s3 lists the corresponding atomic compositions of fe tnts ac and tnts ac previously liu et al 2016a identified that tnts can be described as na0 7h1 3ti3o7 in this work the mass ratio of ac tnts in tnts ac was 1 2 1 after the fe loading and calcination the c content decreased from 60 11 to 51 08 wt while the contents of ti and o increased from 8 34 to 11 35 wt and from 24 40 to 30 52 wt respectively meanwhile the xps data indicated an fe content of 0 68 wt which was close to the eds based value 0 59 wt fig s3b shows the high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p where the two main peaks at 710 and 723 ev correspond to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 of oxidized iron fe iii respectively wu et al 2015 these observations confirmed that the initially adsorbed fe ii ions were converted to fe iii resulting in the α fe2o3 phase which is consistent with the tem and xrd data fig 2 shows the pore size distributions of tnts ac and fe tnts ac the parent ac f 400 which has been well characterized by previous researches has a large specific surface area of 1069 2 m2 g 1 and a porosity of 0 4 and 80 of the surface area was situated in pores of 2 nm diameter walker and weatherley 2001 tnts ac displayed a bimodal pore size distribution profile with a primary peaking at 4 nm and a secondary peaking at 2 2 5 nm the enlarged pore size distribution for tnts ac compared to the parent ac can be attributed to 1 blockage of some micropores in the parent ac due to the hydrothermal alkaline treatment and 2 conversion of larger pores 10 nm of tnts into smaller micropores in tnts ac liu et al 2016a a similar distribution profile was observed for fe tnts ac however fe tnts ac showed a much lower peak at 4 nm and higher changes in dv dd from 4 to 10 nm than tnts ac given that the ac tnts mass ratio is 1 2 1 and the ssa of neat tnts is 272 3 m2 g 1 liu et al 2016a the combined ssa of tnts ac or fe tnts ac would be about 707 m2 g 1 if they were combined without distortion yet the measured specific surface area 292 1 m2 g 1 for fe tnts ac was much lower suggesting that the hydrothermal alkaline treatment fe loading and calcination blocked or narrowed some pores in the ac the blockage of the interior pores is expected to favor the accumulation of pfoa on the outer shell of fe tnts ac enabling effective photodegradation of adsorbed pfoa moreover the fe loading and the calcination treatment of tnts ac increased the pore volume from 0 55 to 0 61 cm3 g 1 3 2 adsorption of pfoa fig 3 a shows the adsorption kinetics of pfoa by various materials more than 95 of pfoa 100 µg l 1 was rapidly adsorbed in 5 min using 1 g l 1 of fe tnts ac and over 99 was adsorbed after 60 min text s5 in sm the rapid adsorption allows for efficient removal of pfoa from bulk water with a small hydraulic residence time hrt i e a small reactor moreover the adsorption process pre concentrates pfoa from a large volume of water onto a small volume of fe tnts ac enabling the subsequent photocatalytic degradation to be carried out in a much smaller volume of photo reactor with much less energy consumption compared to directly treating the bulk raw water fig 3 a also displays that both pristine and hydrothermally treated f 400 ac were able to adsorb pfoa under the same conditions but at a slower rate with 70 of pfoa removed in the first 5 min and 99 at 2 h neat tnts were not effective in adsorption of pfoa due to the inorganic structure and negative surface charges the point of zero charge ph phpzc 2 57 liu et al 2016b liu et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the observations indicate that blending fe ac nanoparticles and tnts induced corporative adsorption mechanisms resulting in the synergistic effect on both adsorption capacity and rate for pfoa the pseudo first order eq 8 and pseudo second order kinetic models eq 9 were tested to interpret the kinetic data ho and mckay 1999 8 q t q e q e k 1 t 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt and q e are the pfoa uptakes µg g 1 at time t min and equilibrium respectively k 1 is the first order rate constant min 1 and k 2 is the second order rate constant g µg min 1 table s5 indicates the pseudo second order model fits the experimental kinetic data r 2 0 997 much better than the pseudo first order model r 2 0 894 for fe tnts ac whereas both models adequately fit the experimental kinetic data for the unmodified ac r 2 0 996 vs r 2 0 976 which agrees with the characterization results that the fe and tnts modifications of the gac along with the hydrothermal and calcination treatments altered accessibility of the adsorption sites i e shifted the primary sites to the shell part fig 3 b shows the adsorption isotherms of pfoa by uncalcined or calcined fe tnts ac and various forms of the precursor materials again neat tnts showed negligible pfoa adsorption 10 µg g 1 the classical langmuir and freundlich models were applied to fit the adsorption isotherm data liu et al 2016a 10 q e q max b c e 1 b c e 11 q e k f c e 1 n where c e mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of pfoa in the aqueous phase q max mg g 1 is the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity and b l mg 1 is the langmuir affinity constant related to the free energy of adsorption k f mg g l mg 1 1 n 1 is the freundlich capacity constant and n is the heterogeneity factor indicating the adsorption intensity table s6 gives the best fit model parameters in all cases both models were able to adequately fit the experimental data although the langmuir model provided a slightly better goodness of fit based on the r 2 values these results suggest that the adsorption of pfoa conforms to the homogeneous monolayer adsorption model foo and hameed 2010 the q max values for the different materials followed the order f 400 110 6 mg g 1 calcined fe tnts ac 84 5 mg g 1 non calcined fe tnts ac 81 4 mg g 1 tnts ac 80 2 mg g 1 non calcined tnts ac 77 6 mg g 1 although fe tnts ac contained nearly 50 of the less adsorptive tnts both unmodified f 400 ac and fe tnts ac showed high pfoa adsorption capacity moreover while the specific surface area of f 400 ac is 3 7 times larger than that of fe tnts ac the langmuir maximum capacity of f 400 ac was only 1 3 times higher taken together these observations indicate that carbon and α fe2o3 modifications of tnts and the multi phase induced multi mechanism binding of pfoa notably enhanced the overall pfoa adsorption and compensated the capacity loss due the lost surface area in the parent ac moreover while ac adsorbs pfoa in both deep and shallow pores fe tnts ac tends to accumulate more pfoa on the shallow outer shell sites that are more photo accessible also backed by the photodegradation rate data because of the hybrid modifications the calcination treatment which was intended to enhance the photocatalytic activity slightly enhanced the pfoa adsorption capacity which can be attributed to the opening up of some more adsorption sites fig s4 compares the zeta potential of tnts ac and fe tnts ac with and without calcination evidently the loading of a small fraction of fe2o3 on tnts ac suppressed the negative surface potential and elevated the phpzc value from 3 8 to 5 2 rendering the adsorption of pfoa anions more favorable when the fe content was increased from 1 to 5 wt the q max value for fe tnts ac increased by 14 fig s5 in sm generally hydrophobic adsorbents such as ac sorb pfoa via hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic chain cf3 cf2 6 of pfoa and anion π interaction xu et al 2020a 2020b whereas charged sorbents like ion exchangers involve electrostatic interactions with the head carboxylate group deng et al 2012 higgins and luthy 2006 while the tail group of pfoa is inert to tnts it can interact with the hydrophobic micro carbon particles on the surface of fe tnts ac liu et al 2016a furthermore the α fe2o3 particles which have a phpzc of 6 7 watanabe and seto 1986 can attract the carboxylate group pk a 3 of pfoa through concurrent electrostatic and lewis acid base interactions burns et al 2008 these cooperative adsorption modes allowed pfoa to be adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface in the parallel orientation side on i e the carbon chain of pfoa is attached to the surface with both tail and head groups anchored fig 4 this spatial orientation is expected to be more conducive to the subsequent photochemical bond breaking than the vertical orientation such as tail on only for ac or head on only for ion exchangers for instance the closer contact between pfoa and the reactive surface allows for direct electron transfer between pfoa and photo generated h or e greatly facilitating the decomposition and mineralization of pfoa the side on adsorption mode was also confirmed by the dft calculation results fig 5 shows the resulting optimized molecular orientations with minimum energy from the frequency and optimization calculations the angle between the hydroxyl group and the carbon chain of pfoa is between 110 and 120 fig 5 a the angles remain in the same range for mono and bi dentate complexed pfoa figs 5 c and 5 d based on the structural properties pfoa adsorbed through mono dentate complexation is likely oriented parallel to the fe iii dimer i e the iron oxide surface while pfoa sorption via bi dentate complexation is perpendicular to the iron oxide surface in the head in mode however it should be noted that the terms parallel or perpendicular are not strictly defined and allow for up to 10 variations in both cases the binding between the head carboxylate and fe is expected to facilitate the head first decarboxylation reactions between the two molecular orientations the side on complexation is likely the predominant adsorption mode because of the cooperative adsorption role of the ac nanoparticles xu et al 2020a 2020b and this mode is more conducive to the subsequent photocatalytic degradation of pfoa section 3 6 the solution ph remained nearly the same after the adsorption for all cases table s7 and table s8 which is in accordance with the surface complexation and hydrophobic interaction mechanisms 3 3 photodegradation of pfoa fig 3 c shows that 91 3 of pfoa pre concentrated on fe tnts ac was degraded in 4 h under uv irradiation the results also support the assertion that pfoa was pre concentrated in the vicinity of the photoactive shell sites as desired in comparison tnts ac non calcined fe tnts ac and calcined tnts ac degraded 23 8 68 7 and 83 3 respectively fig 3d shows that fe tnts ac converted 62 of organic fluorine in pfoa into f ions defluorination which was 1 5 2 and 4 times higher than tnts ac non calcined fe tnts ac and non calcined tnts ac respectively fig s6 shows that the defluorination of pfoa in control solution i e without photocatalyst and defluorination of pfoa pre sorbed on unmodified f 400 was negligible hence both the fe modification and calcination played an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic defluorination of pfoa compared to non adsorptive photocatalysts fe tnts ac offers some unique advantages including 1 it pre concentrates pfas on the solid surface through adsorption and 2 photo irradiation is applied to the pfoa laden solid only rather than to the bulk water resulting in much more efficient photocatalytic defluorination the uv drs results fig s7 show that the spectra of fe tnts ac not only displayed a blue shift compared to those of tnts ac but also a higher light absorbance especially in the wavelength range of 300 nm including enhanced absorbance of visible light the pl data in fig s8 indicate that calcined fe tnts ac generated much more hydroxyl radicals than non calcined fe tnts ac or tnts ac the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 12 and retarded first order kinetic model eq 13 were tested to fit the pfoa photodegradation rate data and table s9 presents the best fitted parameters 12 ln m t m 0 k 1 t 13 m 0 m t 1 1 α t k α α where m 0 and mt are the pfoa mass g at time 0 and t h respectively k 1 is the first order rate constant h 1 kα is the retarded first order rate constant h 1 and α is the retardation factor indicating the extent of departure from the pseudo first order behavior weber 2001 the retarded first order model incorporates a factor of α into the rate constant to accommodate the decaying reactivity during the reaction and thus better describes the reaction kinetics with gradual deviation from the initial rate see r2 values in table s9 han et al 2015 typically the gradual deviation is caused by 1 weakening reactivity 2 more diluted reactant concentration at the reactive sites and 3 reactions at deeper and less accessible sites moreover the production of less degradable intermediate products mostly shorter chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids may compete for the reactive sites table s9 presents the best fit parameters of the kinetics model the retarded first order model well described the pfoa degradation rate data for all materials r2 0 9 fe tnts ac exhibited the highest kα value of 0 918 h 1 among the tested materials to optimize the photocatalytic performance of fe tnts ac the calcination temperature and fe content were varied in all cases fe tnts ac was able to adsorb 99 of pfoa within 2 h adsorption conditions initial pfoa 100 μg l 1 material dosage 1 g l 1 ph 7 0 consequently material optimization was then focused on the photodegradation effectiveness fig 6 a compares the defluorination rates of fe tnts ac prepared at a fixed fe content of 1 wt and various calcination temperatures 300 850 c and the results indicate that fe tnts ac prepared at 550 c displayed the highest defluorination rate with 62 of fluorine converted to fluoride after 4 h of uv irradiation increasing the temperature to 650 and 850 c decreased the defluorination to 57 and 16 respectively conversely lowering the calcination temperature to 300 c resulted in only 37 defluorination it has been reported that titanate can be transformed into anatase at 200 c and the phase conversion process is highly related to interlayered na content lee et al 2007 as the calcination temperature increases more anatase crystallites are formed which can absorb a broader range of light le et al 2012 yang et al 2008 however when the calcination temperature exceeds 600 c the anatase phase tends to transform into the rutile phase which has much lower photocatalytic activity than the anatase phase yang et al 2008 yoganarasimhan and rao 1962 thus the best calcination temperature range falls between 500 and 600 c in addition the calcination may also affect the electron conductivity of the carbon nanoparticles and photocatalytic characteristics of the iron oxide particles which are to be investigated in follow on studies fig 6 b compares the photocatalytic defluorination rates of pfoa by fe tnts ac prepared at a fixed calcination temperature of 550 c and various fe contents 0 5 5 wt the highest defluorination was observed at an fe content of 1 wt with 62 of fluorine converted into fluoride in 4 h increasing the fe content to 3 and 5 wt decreased the defluorination extent to 57 and 20 respectively conversely lowering the fe content to 0 5 wt resulted in only 43 of pfoa defluorinated although increasing fe content can suppress the negative surface potential and enhance the interactions with the head group of pfoa excessive amounts of iron oxides may act as recombination centers for the photo generated electrons and holes due to the quantum tunneling effects zhang and lei 2008 zhou et al 2006 2005 besides when pfoa is taken up by iron oxide alone the synergistic effect of the carbon nanoparticles would be compromised moreover excessive loading of fe2o3 aggregates on the tnts may hamper the photocatalytic activity of anatase 3 4 effects of ph fig s9 shows that fe tnts ac was able to adsorb nearly all 99 of pfoa in the solution over a broad ph range of 4 0 11 0 within 2 h the different material phases of fe tnts ac adsorb pfoa through different mechanisms the α fe2o3 tnts phases bind with pfoa through electrostatic interactions and complexation with the head carboxylate group whereas ac adsorbs pfoa through hydrophobic and anion π interactions with the tail and the cf2 cf3 entities xu et al 2020a the concurrent interactions result in a side on adsorption mode where pfoa is attached in parallel to the material surface through the multi point synergistic interactions theoretically alkaline ph is expected to be less favorable for α fe2o3 tnts to interact with the carboxylate group due to increased surface repulsion wei et al 2017a and competition of ho consequently the hydrophobic and anion π interactions become more important at higher ph in other words the pfoa adsorption switches from the parallel side on mode to a vertical tail on orientation at elevated ph although the overall uptake remained comparable fig 7 compares the defluorination rates of the pre sorbed pfoa at various ph levels fe tnts ac performed equally well over the ph range of 4 0 8 0 with average defluorination of 61 3 after 4 h of uv irradiation at ph 9 0 the defluorination dropped to 56 8 and further increasing the ph to 10 0 and 11 0 lowered the defluorination to 42 7 and 36 1 respectively the decrease in the photodegradation activity at ph 9 is in accordance with the less favorable adsorption mode i e the tail tethered orientation of pfoa on the ac surface is less conducive to the hole mediated decarboxylation of the head group which is the first step in the pfoa photodegradation see section 3 6 this is because the reactive species holes and radicals are generated at the interface of α fe2o3 tnts upon light irradiation as such the head group is more favorably decarboxylated when it is adsorbed on α fe2o3 tnts in addition when the ph is too high the excessive ho could react with photogenerated holes to produce excessive hydroxyl radicals which inhibit the direct hole oxidation of pfoa see section 3 6 lawless et al 1991 table s10 gives the initial and final ph the ph change was 0 1 during the adsorption indicating that the release of ho was negligible the ph decreased by up to 0 3 after photodegradation at acidic or neutral ph which can be attributed to the consumption of oh and the associated release of h section 3 6 3 5 reusability of fe tnts ac fig 8 shows that when fe tnts ac was repeatedly used in six consecutive cycles of adsorption photodegradation the pfoa adsorption remained high 99 removal and the defluorination rate was 60 the results indicate that the efficient photodegradation of pre concentrated pfoa can also regenerate fe tnts ac and the material can be reused in multiple cycles without additional chemical regeneration this important feature represents a unique advantage of the adsorptive photocatalyst over conventional adsorbents e g ac or ion exchange resins which often require costly regeneration and subsequent treatment of the spent regenerant wastes the slight increase in defluorination with the number of cycles is attributed to the additional defluorination of intermediate products from the previous cycle indeed short chain pfas were detected on fe tnts ac during the photodegradation process see section 3 6 below no ti leaching was detected and about 2 53 wt of the impregnated fe was leached into the solution 1 7 mg l 1 after fe tnts ac was subjected to the six cycles of adsorption photodegradation 3 6 photocatalytic degradation mechanisms of pfoa by fe tnts ac to examine the roles of h oh and o2 the photocatalytic defluorination of pfoa was tested in the presence of various scavengers fig 9 compares the mineralization of pfoa which was preloaded on fe tnts ac after 2 h of uv irradiation the addition of ki a scavenger for h k 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 inhibited the pfoa defluorination from 62 to 51 0 1 mm ki and 28 1 mm ki at neutral ph in contrast the presence of 1 mm of isopropanol ip a scavenger for oh k 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 only modestly inhibited the defluorination from 62 to 51 whereas the addition of 0 1 or 1 mm benzoquinone bq a scavenger for o2 k 3 7 106 m 1 s 1 sawada et al 1975 exhibited a negligible influence these results suggest that direct h driven oxidation played a predominant role in pfoa photodegradation by fe tnts ac the results are consistent with previous observations with in2o3 or tio2 based photocatalysts li et al 2013 vecitis et al 2009 table s11 lists the intermediates and products after 2 h of pfoa photodegradation detected by lc qtof ms the intermediates at the m z values of 413 363 313 263 213 163 and 113 are assigned to pfoa and various shorter chain pfcas including pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba pfpa and tfa anions respectively based on the latest theory of photocatalysis for standard ti based materials panchangam et al 2018 peng et al 2017 and our experimental observations the pfoa photocatalytic degradation by fe tnts ac proceeds through the following stepwise defluorination process 14 c 7 f 15 co o feoh 2 c 7 f 15 co o feoh 2 15 fe tnts ac h v e cb h vb 16 h vb h 2 o oh h 17 h vb o h oh 18 c 7 f 15 co o h

c 5 f 11 co o 2 f c o 2 h f c o 2 h 2 o fig 10 a illustrates the photocatalytic reaction mechanisms first pfoa is adsorbed on the impregnated iron hydr oxide nanoparticles through concurrent electrostatic and lewis acid base interactions between the head carboxylate group of pfoa and the iron on the surface eq 14 second under uv irradiation electrons e conduction band and holes h valence band are generated eq 15 ji et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 the photo generated holes further react with h2o and ho to produce oh radicals eqs 16 and 17 ji et al 2020 third the adsorbed pfoa is oxidized by the photo generated holes h eq 18 to form the unstable perfluoroalkyl radical c7f15coo which decomposes into c7f15 through a photo kolbe like decarboxylation reaction with the head coo group cleaved eq 19 the resulting c7f15 radical is further decomposed via reactions with oh and hydrolysis eq 20 the resulting c7f15oh is highly unstable leading to the cleavage of a c f bond and the release of one fluoride ion eq 21 the intermediate product c6f13cof is easily attacked by oh radicals resulting in the shorter chain pfca eq 22 the shorter chain product c6f13coo undergoes the same decarboxylation defluorination cycle each of which eliminating one carbon and two fluorine atoms cf2 eq 23 short chain pfas have been found less adsorbable and more persistent than long chain pfas li et al 2019 based on the stepwise defluorination mechanism eq 23 the detection of intermediates table s11 and the high mineralization efficiency figs 6 and 7 it is evident that fe tnts ac can also photocatalytically degrade short chain pfas however further detailed investigations are warranted into the degradation mineralization rates and final products it is noteworthy that while oh may not directly initiate the pfoa degradation oh plays an important role in the stepwise defluorination process after the hole mediated activation of pfoa however excessive oh produced under alkaline conditions can quench the overall reaction because 1 oh may compete with pfoa for the holes the primary reactive species for pfoa and 2 oh has lower oxidation potential than the holes zhang et al 2020 it should be noted that because the reaction starts with the head group decarboxylation the introduction of iron plays a critical role as it can attract the head groups of pfoa to the vicinity of the photoactive sites rendering the subsequent photodegradation much more favorable moreover while oh may not directly attack pfoa it played an important role in reacting with the intermediate products as revealed in eqs 20 and 22 the fukui index based on natural bond orbital nbo analysis was conducted to evaluate the reactivity of the active sites of pfoa fig 10 b shows the molecular structure of pfoa with various sites labeled and fig 10c displays the calculated electrostatic potential esp distribution on the pfoa molecule as expected the highest esp was at the carboxyl head group which gradually decayed towards the tail since the reactive species h oh and o2 in the system are all electron deficient and electrophilic cai et al 2019 the sites possessing more negative esp are more prone to being attacked consequently decarboxylation of the head group occurred first to describe the site reactivity towards the electrophiles both the fukui index representing electrophilic attack f and radical attack f0 were calculated based on the dft approach table s12 the o9 and o10 sites possessed the highest f values i e 0 218 and 0 079 respectively and thus are most favorably attacked by the electrophilic species meanwhile the c8 o9 and o10 showed the highest f 0 values i e 0 107 0 172 and 0 077 respectively therefore the carboxylate group of pfoa is the most reactive site for ros which is consistent with the proposed pathway and esp results in addition to the anatase facilitated hole oxidation mechanism the impregnated iron hydr oxide particles can also generate holes and initiate the same decarboxylation reaction besides the redox reactions between fe ii fe iii and photo generated holes electrons also facilitate the production of oh and o2 radicals and prevent electron hole recombination leading to enhanced photodegradation of pfoa eqs 24 29 birben et al 2017 huo et al 2011 quici et al 2007 waite 2005 24 fe oh 2 h fe oh 2 25 fe oh 2 o 2 fe oh 2 o 2 26 f e 3 h f e 4 27 f e 4 o h f e 3 oh 28 f e 3 e f e 2 29 f e 2 e f e 3 it is noted that while the fe cycle can facilitate the pfoa photodegradation an excessive amount of fe iii may act as recombination centers through quantum tunneling zhang et al 1998 zhou et al 2005 resulting in reduced photo activity as indicated in fig 6 b in addition dissolved oxygen may be needed to facilitate the fe iii fe ii cycle especially at lower ph where oh radicals may be limited yu et al 2009 yu et al 2006 zhou et al 2006 2005 the enhanced adsorption and photodegradation of pfoa by fe tnts ac are attributed to 1 the carbon nanoparticles facilitate hydrophobic and anion π interactions with pfoa 2 the carbon coating also facilitates electron transfer and prevents electron hole recombination 3 the fe iii coating suppresses negative surface potential and enhances the interactions between the holes and the pfoa head groups carboxylate 4 the fe iii fe ii redox reaction cycle facilitates the production of oh radicals and prevents e h recombination and 5 because of the narrower band energy gap of iron oxide 2 1 2 3 ev for fe2o3 vs 3 0 3 2 ev for tio2 incorporating fe in fe tnts ac also enhances absorption of visible light the concentrate destroy strategy using adsorptive photocatalysts represents a significant advancement over conventional adsorption or photochemical treatments of pfas contaminated water and has the potential to degrade pfoa in a more cost effective manner compared to ac adsorption or ion exchange fe tnts ac not only adsorbs but also degrades pfoa moreover fe tnts ac eliminates the need for costly and toxic chemical regeneration due to the efficient solid phase photodegradation compared to direct aqueous phase degradation of pfoa using strong oxidants photosensitizers or other photocatalysts the pre concentrating ability of fe tnts ac not only facilitates more efficient solid phase photocatalytic degradation of pfoa but also enables the photodegradation to be carried out in a much smaller reactor with less energy input nonetheless to move the technology to the field additional investigations and technical optimizations are needed including 1 the composite materials can be further optimized in terms of mixed phase compositions and material fabrication conditions to facilitate more selective adsorption and greater photoactivity preferably under visible light 2 the materials need to be tested under field water conditions 3 the effects of water matrix on the adsorption and photocatalytic activity should be examined in particular the possible competitive adsorption of dissolved organic matter and the associated inhibition to the solid phase photodegradation 4 conclusions a novel adsorptive photocatalyst was synthesized based on commercial ac and tio2 the composite material exhibited synergistic adsorption and photocatalytic activity and enabled a novel concentrate destroy strategy for rapid and complete degradation of pfoa in water the major findings are summarized as follows 1 a novel adsorptive photocatalyst fe tnts ac was produced through a facile alkaline hydrothermal method based on commonly used commercial ac and tio2 and the optimal material was acquired at an fe content of 1 wt a calcination temperature of 550 c 2 fe tnts ac was able to rapidly adsorb pfoa within a few minutes thereby effectively concentrating the target contaminant on the photoactive sites effective adsorption was observed over a broad ph range 4 11 3 fe tnts ac adsorbs pfoa in the side on parallel mode with both the head and tail groups of pfoa attached to the photoactive sites facilitating the subsequent photocatalytic degradation of pfoa the adsorption conforms to the langmuir homogeneous monolayer adsorption model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 84 5 mg g 1 4 fe tnts ac was able to degrade 90 of the pre concentrated pfoa in 4 h under uv irradiation of which 62 was completely mineralized to f the highly efficient photocatalytic defluorination was observed over the ph range of 4 8 while higher ph 9 11 inhibited pfoa photodegradation 5 the efficient photodegradation of pre concentrated pfoa also regenerates fe tnts ac eliminating the need for expensive and toxic chemical regenerants after six cycles of adsorption photodegradation the material showed no significant drop in adsorption capacity or photocatalytic activity 6 according to the dft calculation analysis of pfoa scavenger tests and analysis of degradation intermediates pfoa decomposition is initiated by direct hole oxidation which activates the molecule and leads to a series of decarboxylation c f bond cleavage and chain shortening reactions although oh may not directly attack pfoa it played an important role in reacting with the intermediate products while fluoride was the major and desired final product some shorter chain pfcas were also detected appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to

17582,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have emerged as a major concern in aquatic systems worldwide due to their widespread applications and health concerns perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is one of the most detected pfas yet a cost effective technology has been lacking for the degradation of pfas due to their resistance to conventional treatment processes to address this challenge we prepared a novel adsorptive photocatalyst referred to fe tnts ac based on low cost commercial activated carbon ac and tio2 the composite material exhibited synergistic adsorption and photocatalytic activity and enabled a novel concentrate destroy strategy for rapid and complete degradation of pfoa in water fe tnts ac was able to adsorb pfoa within a few minutes thereby effectively concentrating the target contaminant on the photoactive sites subsequently fe tnts ac was able to degrade 90 of pfoa that was preconcentrated on the solid in 4 h under uv irradiation 254 nm 21 mw cm 2 of which 62 was completely mineralized to f the efficient photodegradation also regenerated fe tnts ac eliminating the need for expensive chemical regenerants and after six cycles of adsorption photodegradation the material showed no significant drop in adsorption capacity or photocatalytic activity simulations based on the density functional theory dft revealed that fe tnts ac adsorbs pfoa in the side on parallel mode facilitating the subsequent photocatalytic degradation of pfoa according to the dft analysis scavenger tests and analysis of degradation intermediates pfoa decomposition is initiated by direct hole oxidation which activates the molecule and leads to a series of decarboxylation c f bond cleavage and chain shortening reactions the innovative concentrate destroy strategy may significantly advance conventional adsorption or photochemical treatment of pfas contaminated water and holds the potential to degrade pfoa and potentially other pfas more cost effectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances perfluorooctanoic acid adsorption photocatalysis concentrate and destroy 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been widely detected in soil and waters due to their widespread applications and high resistance to environmental degradation li et al 2019 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos are the most detected pfas and have been associated with various adverse health effects li et al 2019 to mitigate human exposure the u s environmental protection agency epa established a lifetime health advisory level of 70 ng l 1 for combined pfoa and pfos in drinking water on may 19 2016 a recent survey reported that drinking water supplies for 6 million u s residents exceeded the advisory level hu et al 2016 to remove or degrade pfas in contaminated waters various technologies have been tested including adsorption ion exchange and redox decomposition for instance effective adsorption of pfoa has been reported using activated carbon zhang et al 2016 carbon nanotubes deng et al 2012 carbon fibers wang et al 2015 metal organic frameworks liu et al 2015a and ion exchange resins wang et al 2019 however these adsorption approaches involve some critical drawbacks including 1 they do not degrade the pfas and 2 the regeneration of the adsorbents is costly and often requires expensive and toxic solvents such as methanol and ethanol generating large volumes of regenerant waste residuals that require additional costly handling and disposal deng et al 2015 du et al 2015 while pfas are hardly biodegradable many physicochemical methods have been intensively studied in recent years including chemical park et al 2016 photochemical liang et al 2016 photocatalytic zhong et al 2019 sonochemical shende et al 2019 electrochemical le et al 2019 and thermochemical watanabe et al 2018 treatments while these methods may partially mineralize pfas the high chemical and energy demands prohibit practical implementation recently photocatalytic decomposition of persistent organic pollutants has come a long way with the advancement in development of highly active nanostructured composite materials for instance uv generated hydrated electron was applied to degrade pfoa pfos in the presence of 10 mm na2so3 and was able to defluorinate 48 and 38 of pfoa and pfos respectively after 12 h of uv irradiation 254 nm bentel et al 2019 while commercial tio2 p25 cannot decompose pfoa effectively zhong et al 2019 graphene modified tio2 was able to decompose 93 of pfoa after 12 h of uv 254 nm irradiation gomez ruiz et al 2018 through photocatalysis additionally modifying tio2 with noble metallic nanoparticles e g pt and pd enhanced pfoa photodegradation since the nanoparticles can facilitate electron transfer and prevent hole electron recombination for instance li et al 2016 found that pt and pd modified tio2 decomposed pfoa 12 5 and 7 5 times faster than pristine tio2 respectively in general oh e 0 2 72 v schwarz and dodson 1984 and o2 e 0 1 83 v radi et al 1991 radicals may not be able to directly attack the c f bonds in pfas due to the high bond energy 107 118 kcal mol 1 bentel et al 2019 this is also true for other stronger oxidation radicals such as no2 and so4 which can be generated in the photochemical process thus pfoa decomposition typically starts with the cleavage of the c c bond at the head group by photogenerated holes or electrons bahnemann et al 1997 estrellan et al 2010 for instance the coo head group of pfoa is first decarboxylated by direct hole mediated oxidation or indirect radical oxidation electron transfer which activates the molecule eqs 1 3 and initiates a stepwise defluorination process each of which loses one cf2 entity zhong et al 2019 in this stepwise defluorination process the organic substrate radicals cnf2n 1 react with oh and or reactive oxygen species ros to former shorter chain byproducts or mineralization products 1 pfo a h pfoa 2 pfo a oh n o 2 so 4 pfoa o h no 2 so 4 2 3 pfoa c 7 f 15 co o h however the photogenerated e h pairs are prone to recombination and or being scavenged by side reactions to overcome this issue conventional photocatalysts such as tio2 are often modified by depositing or doping with transition metals chen et al 2015 noble metals li et al 2016 carbon nanotubes song et al 2012 and graphene graphene oxide li et al 2012 which can facilitate transfer of photogenerated electrons thereby preventing the electron hole recombination typically pfas are present at trace concentrations ppb or ppt levels in contaminated waters as such it is often not practical to directly treat large volumes of water using energy or chemical intensive methods such as advanced oxidation with persulfate or direct photolysis for instance heat activated persulfate has been widely studied for the degradation of pfoa park et al 2016 however in addition to the high chemical dosage it requires heating the bulk water to 50 85 c which largely hampering the cost effectiveness others used vacuum ultraviolet vuv light 185 nm to activate persulfate to degrade perfluorodecanoic acid wang et al 2010 only 60 degradation was observed but the high energy consumption associated with the irradiation of energy intensive vuv on the bulk water prevents implementation of the technology for large scale applications generally photocatalytic processes are less practical when used to treat trace concentrations of pfas in a large volume of contaminated water due to 1 large reactor size special reactor configuration and the associated high cost 2 limited light penetration 3 high energy cost and 4 difficulties in recycling and reusing the photocatalysts besides conventional photocatalysts like tio2 have limited catalytic activity towards pfas recently titanate nanotubes tnts derived from tio2 have attracted intensive interest as adsorbents or photocatalysts for organic pollutants removal due to their specific tubular structure large surface area nanoscale properties and good photoelectron response chen et al 2019 ji et al 2020 liu et al 2016a xu et al 2019 in previous work we developed an adsorptive photocatalyst tnts ac by combining activated charcoal ac and tnts through a hydrothermal treatment approach liu et al 2016a tnts ac not only offered rapid adsorption rate and enhanced adsorption capacity for phenanthrene but also boosted the generation of ros and photocatalytic activity practically such adsorptive photocatalysts may enable an innovative concentrate destroy approach for treating trace concentrations of persistent organic pollutants pops like pfas in large volumes of water first pops are concentrated on a small volume of ac modified tnts sites and then the pre concentrated pops are efficiently degraded under solar or uv light the photodegradation also regenerates the material allowing for repeated use the first concentrating step can be implemented using low cost adsorption processes such as mixer settlers or fix bed columns the concentrating step not only facilitates the subsequent photodegradation but also greatly cut down the photodegradation cost compared to treating the large volumes of bulk water using chemical or energy intensive methods therefore titanate nanomaterials supported on carbonaceous materials comprise a high application potential for pfas removal through initial concentration and subsequent degradation mechanisms however despite the carbon modification tnts ac carries negative surface potential due to the titanate functional groups o consequently tnts ac is expected to be unfavorable for sorption of pfoa anions due to electrostatic repulsion therefore proper surface tailoring of tnts ac is needed to enhance both adsorption and photocatalytic activity for pfoa building upon the prior work we prepared a new iron modified tnts ac referred to as fe tnts ac for enhanced adsorption and photodegradation of pfoa pfoa was used as a model pfas compound because pfoa has been one of the most widely detected pfas in contaminated waters and one of the most investigated pfas giesy and kannan 2002 kwak et al 2020 vierke et al 2012 besides pfoa is one of the high priority pfas in drinking water and has been regulated in 11 us states e g the proposed maximum contaminant level for pfoa has been set at 12 ng l 1 in new hampshire and 14 ng l 1 in california and new jersey iron is an excellent electron conductor and can act as an electron sink and prevent electron hole recombination thus promoting the photocatalytic activity of tnts liu et al 2015b besides the deposition of iron oxides may suppress the negative surface potential moreover iron can interact with the carboxylate head group of pfoa and facilitate a side on adsorption mode of pfoa which is conducive to both adsorption and photocatalytic degradation xu et al 2020a

weatherley 1998 2 2 synthesis and characterization of fe tnts ac first tnts ac was synthesized through a hydrothermal method based on our prior work liu et al 2016 briefly 1 2 g of tio2 was mixed with 1 2 g of f 400 gac and then dispersed into 67 ml of a 10 m naoh solution upon thorough mixing the mixture was transferred into a teflon lined reactor in an autoclave and heated at 130 c for 72 h the gray precipitates i e tnts ac were separated and washed with di water until neutral ph and then oven dried at 105 c for 4 h then 1 g of the dried tnts ac was dispersed in 100 ml of di water and then 10 ml of an fecl2 solution 1 g l 1 as fe ph 3 0 was dropwise added into the tnts ac suspension upon equilibrium 99 7 fe ii was adsorbed by tnts ac the solid particles were then separated and oven dried at 105 c for 24 h which also oxidized fe ii to fe iii the dried particles were then calcined at 550 c under nitrogen flow at 100 ml min 1 for 3 h the fe content in the resulting fe tnts ac was 1 wt the resulting fe tnts ac had a particle size of 0 59 0 84 mm and a density 2630 kg m 3 the calcination temperature and fe content were varied to obtain the optimal fe tnts ac based on the adsorption rate capacity and photoactivity the following calcination temperatures were tested at a fixed fe content of 1 wt 300 550 650 and 850 c whereas the fe contents were tested at 0 5 1 3 and 5

performed after 60 min the excitation wavelength was set to 215 nm and the emission wavelength varied from 360 to 490 nm 2 3 adsorption kinetics and isotherms adsorption kinetic tests were performed in batch reactors using 40 ml high density polyethylene hdpe vials under the following experimental conditions initial pfoa 100 µg l 1 material dosage 1 g l 1 and temperature 22 1 c the initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 using diluted hclo4 and naoh the adsorption was initiated by mixing a given material with the pfoa solution the vials were kept in the dark and under shaking at 100 rpm at predetermined times the vials were sampled in duplicate and centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 rpm and the supernatants were analyzed for the remaining pfoa each adsorption kinetic test lasted for 4 h which was sufficient to reach equilibrium adsorption isotherms for pfoa were conducted following the same procedure and under the following conditions initial pfoa 0 to 100 mg l 1 material dosage 1 g

settle by gravity 99 of the materials settled note 95 of fe tnts ac settled in 30 s then 95 of the supernatant was pipetted out and the residual solid liquid mixture was transferred into a quartz photo reactor with a quartz cover afterwards 8 ml of di water was added to the mixture so that the solution volume in the photo reactor reached 10 ml i e solid loading 4 g l 1 and the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 the reactor was then placed in a rayonet chamber uv reactor southern new england ultraviolet co branford ct usa and subjected to uv light at a wavelength of 254 nm and an intensity of

section s2 in sm and the liquid analyzed for fluoride duplicate experiments were carried out for each time point m8pfoa was used as the internal standard is to correct the mass recovery and the average method recovery was 90 for pfoa all tests were carried out in duplicate in this paper the term degradation refers to decomposition or breakdown of pfoa into other compounds such as shorter chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas whereas defluorination or mineralization indicates the conversion of fluorine in pfoa into fluoride ions the degradation was quantified by comparing the pfoa concentrations before and after photodegradation whereas defluorination was determined by measuring the fluoride produced upon the photocatalytic reactions the effects of ph on pfoa photodegradation were studied in the initial ph range from 4 0 to 10 0 the roles of h oh and o2 were tested through the classical scavenger experiments using potassium iodide ki isopropanol ip and benzoquinone bq as the respective radical scavengers wei et al 2017b the reusability of the photo regenerated materials was tested by using the same material in six consecutive cycles of the adsorption photodegradation experiments 2 5 chemical analysis quantitative analysis of pfoa was performed via liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms text s3 in

oes 710 es varian usa and the instrument detection limits were 30 and 50 μg l 1 respectively 2 6 density functional theory calculations to understand the role of surface complexation in adsorption of pfoa anions on fe tnts ac the fukui index of organic compounds pfoa in this work was obtained from the peking university reactive sites for organic compounds database pku reod specifically the density functional theory dft calculations were performed using the gaussian 16 c 01 package frisch et al 2016 according to wei et al 2017a the b3lyp functional 6 311 g d p basis set and the integral equation formalism polarized continuum model iefpcm as the solvation model were employed in the hybrid dft calculations to determine the orientation of pfoa adsorbed on the surface e g parallel or perpendicular formic acid and edge sharing octahedral dimers with two fe3 atoms were used to mimic the surface binding this simplified configuration saves computing time and at the same time adequately predicts the possible orientation of pfoa anions on the surface the fukui function and the calculated electrostatic potential esp were used to predict the regioselectivity of reactive species h and oh acting on pfoa the geometry optimization and single point energy calculations were carried out following the b3lyp approach with the 6 31 g d p basis set the fukui function has been widely used in the prediction of reactive sites of electrophilic nucleophilic and general radical attacks parr and yang 1984 specifically the fukui function is defined as 4 f r ρ r n v r where ρ r is the electron density at a point r in space n is the electron number in the system and the constant term v is the external potential in this work the atomic population number was used to represent the electron density distribution around an atom and the condensed fukui functions for different radical attacks were calculated via 5 electrophilic attack f a q n 1 a q n a 6 nucleophilic attack f a q n a q n 1 a 7 radical attack f a 0 q n 1 a q n 1 a 2 where q a is the charge of atom a at the corresponding state the more reactive sites on a molecule usually have larger values of the fukui index than other regions in this study the natural population analysis npa charge was used to calculate the fukui index oláh et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of fe tnts ac fig s1a in sm presents a representative sem image of calcined fe tnts ac displaying a cotton like surface structure consisting of interwoven carbon and fe modified tnts this structure is expected to be conducive to concentrating pfas on the outer shell of the particles due to partial blockage of the inner pores during the hydrothermal treatment thereby facilitating the subsequent photocatalytic destruction of pfas in situ fig s1b shows the eds spectra of fe tnts ac confirming the presence of the five major elements i e c o na fe and ti on the surface of fe tnts ac tables s2 and s3 in sm give the percentages of the elements based on the eds and xps analyses respectively the fairly high carbon content 53 02 wt per eds and 51 08 wt per xps indicates that some of the core ac was broken into fine particles that are attached or blended with the fe tnts on the outer shell of the fe tnts ac fig 1 a shows the tem images of fe tnts ac which confirms that some micro carbon particles are blended with tnts with a particle size in the range of 5 to 20 nm the attachment of these carbon nanoparticles on tnts suppresses the negative surface potential of tnts and facilitates the adsorption of pfoa through enhanced hydrophobic interactions and weakened electrostatic repulsion moreover the micro carbon particles may facilitate electron transfer to result in enhanced photoactivity liu et al 2016a figs 1 b and 1 c show close ups of the fe and carbon modified tnts fig 1 b reveals that the tnts have an outer diameter of 20 nm and a length of 100 nm fig s2 in sm presents the eds mappings of the elements indicating that fe was well distributed on the surface of fe tnts ac while ti o and c were the predominant elements fig 1d shows the xrd patterns of f 400 gac tnts ac and calcined fe tnts ac table s4 in sm lists the six crystalline phases where quartz sio2 and moissanite sic are from the parent ac for the parent ac f 400 the peaks at 26 7 and 43 4 are assigned to the diffractions of the 002 and 100 crystal planes of graphite respectively le et al 2012 quiñones et al 2014 rey et al 2012 for tnts ac the peaks at 9 2 24 1 28 1 48 4 and 61 4 are attributed to sodium trititanate expressed as na x h2 x ti3o7 which is composed of corrugated ribbons of triple edge sharing tio6 the skeletal structure with cations e g na h and fe3 attached at the interlayers chen et al 2002 liu et al 2016b ma et al 2017 the peak at 9 2 signifies the interlayer distance 9 1 å crystal plane 200 of sodium trititanate sun and li 2003 the peak at 26 1 represents the crystal plane of graphite 002 confirming that the carbon nanoparticles were intermingled with tnts liu et al 2016a for calcined fe tnts ac the peaks at 24 1 36 6 46 2 52 4 60 2 and 73 are attributed to anatase li et al 2018 whereas the peaks at 26 1 and 31 4 are assigned to graphite 002 and hematite α fe2o3 104 sivula et al 2011 respectively evidently upon calcination and fe deposition the sodium tri titanate of tnts ac was transformed into anatase this observation agrees with the eds mapping data fig s1b and fig s2 the hrtem images in fig 1 c display the layered crystalline structures of tnts and fe2o3 on the calcined fe tnts ac revealing an interlayer distance of 0 35 nm for anatase and 0 27 nm for fe2o3 the interlayer distance for anatase is much smaller than that for neat tnts 0 75 nm for the crystal plane 200 of titanate and 0 79 nm for unmodified tnts ac liu et al 2016a indicating the iron modification and calcination altered the crystalline structure of tnts ac fig s3 in sm shows the xps spectra of fe tnts ac and table s3 lists the corresponding atomic compositions of fe tnts ac and tnts ac previously liu et al 2016a identified that tnts can be described as na0 7h1 3ti3o7 in this work the mass ratio of ac tnts in tnts ac was 1 2 1 after the fe loading and calcination the c content decreased from 60 11 to 51 08 wt while the contents of ti and o increased from 8 34 to 11 35 wt and from 24 40 to 30 52 wt respectively meanwhile the xps data indicated an fe content of 0 68 wt which was close to the eds based value 0 59 wt fig s3b shows the high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p where the two main peaks at 710 and 723 ev correspond to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 of oxidized iron fe iii respectively wu et al 2015 these observations confirmed that the initially adsorbed fe ii ions were converted to fe iii resulting in the α fe2o3 phase which is consistent with the tem and xrd data fig 2 shows the pore size distributions of tnts ac and fe tnts ac the parent ac f 400 which has been well characterized by previous researches has a large specific surface area of 1069 2 m2 g 1 and a porosity of 0 4 and 80 of the surface area was situated in pores of 2 nm diameter walker and weatherley 2001 tnts ac displayed a bimodal pore size distribution profile with a primary peaking at 4 nm and a secondary peaking at 2 2 5 nm the enlarged pore size distribution for tnts ac compared to the parent ac can be attributed to 1 blockage of some micropores in the parent ac due to the hydrothermal alkaline treatment and 2 conversion of larger pores 10 nm of tnts into smaller micropores in tnts ac liu et al 2016a a similar distribution profile was observed for fe tnts ac however fe tnts ac showed a much lower peak at 4 nm and higher changes in dv dd from 4 to 10 nm than tnts ac given that the ac tnts mass ratio is 1 2 1 and the ssa of neat tnts is 272 3 m2 g 1 liu et al 2016a the combined ssa of tnts ac or fe tnts ac would be about 707 m2 g 1 if they were combined without distortion yet the measured specific surface area 292 1 m2 g 1 for fe tnts ac was much lower suggesting that the hydrothermal alkaline treatment fe loading and calcination blocked or narrowed some pores in the ac the blockage of the interior pores is expected to favor the accumulation of pfoa on the outer shell of fe tnts ac enabling effective photodegradation of adsorbed pfoa moreover the fe loading and the calcination treatment of tnts ac increased the pore volume from 0 55 to 0 61 cm3 g 1 3 2 adsorption of pfoa fig 3 a shows the adsorption kinetics of pfoa by various materials more than 95 of pfoa 100 µg l 1 was rapidly adsorbed in 5 min using 1 g l 1 of fe tnts ac and over 99 was adsorbed after 60 min text s5 in sm the rapid adsorption allows for efficient removal of pfoa from bulk water with a small hydraulic residence time hrt i e a small reactor moreover the adsorption process pre concentrates pfoa from a large volume of water onto a small volume of fe tnts ac enabling the subsequent photocatalytic degradation to be carried out in a much smaller volume of photo reactor with much less energy consumption compared to directly treating the bulk raw water fig 3 a also displays that both pristine and hydrothermally treated f 400 ac were able to adsorb pfoa under the same conditions but at a slower rate with 70 of pfoa removed in the first 5 min and 99 at 2 h neat tnts were not effective in adsorption of pfoa due to the inorganic structure and negative surface charges the point of zero charge ph phpzc 2 57 liu et al 2016b liu et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the observations indicate that blending fe ac nanoparticles and tnts induced corporative adsorption mechanisms resulting in the synergistic effect on both adsorption capacity and rate for pfoa the pseudo first order eq 8 and pseudo second order kinetic models eq 9 were tested to interpret the kinetic data ho and mckay 1999 8 q t q e q e k 1 t 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt and q e are the pfoa uptakes µg g 1 at time t min and equilibrium respectively k 1 is the first order rate constant min 1 and k 2 is the second order rate constant g µg min 1 table s5 indicates the pseudo second order model fits the experimental kinetic data r 2 0 997 much better than the pseudo first order model r 2 0 894 for fe tnts ac whereas both models adequately fit the experimental kinetic data for the unmodified ac r 2 0 996 vs r 2 0 976 which agrees with the characterization results that the fe and tnts modifications of the gac along with the hydrothermal and calcination treatments altered accessibility of the adsorption sites i e shifted the primary sites to the shell part fig 3 b shows the adsorption isotherms of pfoa by uncalcined or calcined fe tnts ac and various forms of the precursor materials again neat tnts showed negligible pfoa adsorption 10 µg g 1 the classical langmuir and freundlich models were applied to fit the adsorption isotherm data liu et al 2016a 10 q e q max b c e 1 b c e 11 q e k f c e 1 n where c e mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of pfoa in the aqueous phase q max mg g 1 is the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity and b l mg 1 is the langmuir affinity constant related to the free energy of adsorption k f mg g l mg 1 1 n 1 is the freundlich capacity constant and n is the heterogeneity factor indicating the adsorption intensity table s6 gives the best fit model parameters in all cases both models were able to adequately fit the experimental data although the langmuir model provided a slightly better goodness of fit based on the r 2 values these results suggest that the adsorption of pfoa conforms to the homogeneous monolayer adsorption model foo and hameed 2010 the q max values for the different materials followed the order f 400 110 6 mg g 1 calcined fe tnts ac 84 5 mg g 1 non calcined fe tnts ac 81 4 mg g 1 tnts ac 80 2 mg g 1 non calcined tnts ac 77 6 mg g 1 although fe tnts ac contained nearly 50 of the less adsorptive tnts both unmodified f 400 ac and fe tnts ac showed high pfoa adsorption capacity moreover while the specific surface area of f 400 ac is 3 7 times larger than that of fe tnts ac the langmuir maximum capacity of f 400 ac was only 1 3 times higher taken together these observations indicate that carbon and α fe2o3 modifications of tnts and the multi phase induced multi mechanism binding of pfoa notably enhanced the overall pfoa adsorption and compensated the capacity loss due the lost surface area in the parent ac moreover while ac adsorbs pfoa in both deep and shallow pores fe tnts ac tends to accumulate more pfoa on the shallow outer shell sites that are more photo accessible also backed by the photodegradation rate data because of the hybrid modifications the calcination treatment which was intended to enhance the photocatalytic activity slightly enhanced the pfoa adsorption capacity which can be attributed to the opening up of some more adsorption sites fig s4 compares the zeta potential of tnts ac and fe tnts ac with and without calcination evidently the loading of a small fraction of fe2o3 on tnts ac suppressed the negative surface potential and elevated the phpzc value from 3 8 to 5 2 rendering the adsorption of pfoa anions more favorable when the fe content was increased from 1 to 5 wt the q max value for fe tnts ac increased by 14 fig s5 in sm generally hydrophobic adsorbents such as ac sorb pfoa via hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic chain cf3 cf2 6 of pfoa and anion π interaction xu et al 2020a 2020b whereas charged sorbents like ion exchangers involve electrostatic interactions with the head carboxylate group deng et al 2012 higgins and luthy 2006 while the tail group of pfoa is inert to tnts it can interact with the hydrophobic micro carbon particles on the surface of fe tnts ac liu et al 2016a furthermore the α fe2o3 particles which have a phpzc of 6 7 watanabe and seto 1986 can attract the carboxylate group pk a 3 of pfoa through concurrent electrostatic and lewis acid base interactions burns et al 2008 these cooperative adsorption modes allowed pfoa to be adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface in the parallel orientation side on i e the carbon chain of pfoa is attached to the surface with both tail and head groups anchored fig 4 this spatial orientation is expected to be more conducive to the subsequent photochemical bond breaking than the vertical orientation such as tail on only for ac or head on only for ion exchangers for instance the closer contact between pfoa and the reactive surface allows for direct electron transfer between pfoa and photo generated h or e greatly facilitating the decomposition and mineralization of pfoa the side on adsorption mode was also confirmed by the dft calculation results fig 5 shows the resulting optimized molecular orientations with minimum energy from the frequency and optimization calculations the angle between the hydroxyl group and the carbon chain of pfoa is between 110 and 120 fig 5 a the angles remain in the same range for mono and bi dentate complexed pfoa figs 5 c and 5 d based on the structural properties pfoa adsorbed through mono dentate complexation is likely oriented parallel to the fe iii dimer i e the iron oxide surface while pfoa sorption via bi dentate complexation is perpendicular to the iron oxide surface in the head in mode however it should be noted that the terms parallel or perpendicular are not strictly defined and allow for up to 10 variations in both cases the binding between the head carboxylate and fe is expected to facilitate the head first decarboxylation reactions between the two molecular orientations the side on complexation is likely the predominant adsorption mode because of the cooperative adsorption role of the ac nanoparticles xu et al 2020a 2020b and this mode is more conducive to the subsequent photocatalytic degradation of pfoa section 3 6 the solution ph remained nearly the same after the adsorption for all cases table s7 and table s8 which is in accordance with the surface complexation and hydrophobic interaction mechanisms 3 3 photodegradation of pfoa fig 3 c shows that 91 3 of pfoa pre concentrated on fe tnts ac was degraded in 4 h under uv irradiation the results also support the assertion that pfoa was pre concentrated in the vicinity of the photoactive shell sites as desired in comparison tnts ac non calcined fe tnts ac and calcined tnts ac degraded 23 8 68 7 and 83 3 respectively fig 3d shows that fe tnts ac converted 62 of organic fluorine in pfoa into f ions defluorination which was 1 5 2 and 4 times higher than tnts ac non calcined fe tnts ac and non calcined tnts ac respectively fig s6 shows that the defluorination of pfoa in control solution i e without photocatalyst and defluorination of pfoa pre sorbed on unmodified f 400 was negligible hence both the fe modification and calcination played an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic defluorination of pfoa compared to non adsorptive photocatalysts fe tnts ac offers some unique advantages including 1 it pre concentrates pfas on the solid surface through adsorption and 2 photo irradiation is applied to the pfoa laden solid only rather than to the bulk water resulting in much more efficient photocatalytic defluorination the uv drs results fig s7 show that the spectra of fe tnts ac not only displayed a blue shift compared to those of tnts ac but also a higher light absorbance especially in the wavelength range of 300 nm including enhanced absorbance of visible light the pl data in fig s8 indicate that calcined fe tnts ac generated much more hydroxyl radicals than non calcined fe tnts ac or tnts ac the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 12 and retarded first order kinetic model eq 13 were tested to fit the pfoa photodegradation rate data and table s9 presents the best fitted parameters 12 ln m t m 0 k 1 t 13 m 0 m t 1 1 α t k α α where m 0 and mt are the pfoa mass g at time 0 and t h respectively k 1 is the first order rate constant h 1 kα is the retarded first order rate constant h 1 and α is the retardation factor indicating the extent of departure from the pseudo first order behavior weber 2001 the retarded first order model incorporates a factor of α into the rate constant to accommodate the decaying reactivity during the reaction and thus better describes the reaction kinetics with gradual deviation from the initial rate see r2 values in table s9 han et al 2015 typically the gradual deviation is caused by 1 weakening reactivity 2 more diluted reactant concentration at the reactive sites and 3 reactions at deeper and less accessible sites moreover the production of less degradable intermediate products mostly shorter chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids may compete for the reactive sites table s9 presents the best fit parameters of the kinetics model the retarded first order model well described the pfoa degradation rate data for all materials r2 0 9 fe tnts ac exhibited the highest kα value of 0 918 h 1 among the tested materials to optimize the photocatalytic performance of fe tnts ac the calcination temperature and fe content were varied in all cases fe tnts ac was able to adsorb 99 of pfoa within 2 h adsorption conditions initial pfoa 100 μg l 1 material dosage 1 g l 1 ph 7 0 consequently material optimization was then focused on the photodegradation effectiveness fig 6 a compares the defluorination rates of fe tnts ac prepared at a fixed fe content of 1 wt and various calcination temperatures 300 850 c and the results indicate that fe tnts ac prepared at 550 c displayed the highest defluorination rate with 62 of fluorine converted to fluoride after 4 h of uv irradiation increasing the temperature to 650 and 850 c decreased the defluorination to 57 and 16 respectively conversely lowering the calcination temperature to 300 c resulted in only 37 defluorination it has been reported that titanate can be transformed into anatase at 200 c and the phase conversion process is highly related to interlayered na content lee et al 2007 as the calcination temperature increases more anatase crystallites are formed which can absorb a broader range of light le et al 2012 yang et al 2008 however when the calcination temperature exceeds 600 c the anatase phase tends to transform into the rutile phase which has much lower photocatalytic activity than the anatase phase yang et al 2008 yoganarasimhan and rao 1962 thus the best calcination temperature range falls between 500 and 600 c in addition the calcination may also affect the electron conductivity of the carbon nanoparticles and photocatalytic characteristics of the iron oxide particles which are to be investigated in follow on studies fig 6 b compares the photocatalytic defluorination rates of pfoa by fe tnts ac prepared at a fixed calcination temperature of 550 c and various fe contents 0 5 5 wt the highest defluorination was observed at an fe content of 1 wt with 62 of fluorine converted into fluoride in 4 h increasing the fe content to 3 and 5 wt decreased the defluorination extent to 57 and 20 respectively conversely lowering the fe content to 0 5 wt resulted in only 43 of pfoa defluorinated although increasing fe content can suppress the negative surface potential and enhance the interactions with the head group of pfoa excessive amounts of iron oxides may act as recombination centers for the photo generated electrons and holes due to the quantum tunneling effects zhang and lei 2008 zhou et al 2006 2005 besides when pfoa is taken up by iron oxide alone the synergistic effect of the carbon nanoparticles would be compromised moreover excessive loading of fe2o3 aggregates on the tnts may hamper the photocatalytic activity of anatase 3 4 effects of ph fig s9 shows that fe tnts ac was able to adsorb nearly all 99 of pfoa in the solution over a broad ph range of 4 0 11 0 within 2 h the different material phases of fe tnts ac adsorb pfoa through different mechanisms the α fe2o3 tnts phases bind with pfoa through electrostatic interactions and complexation with the head carboxylate group whereas ac adsorbs pfoa through hydrophobic and anion π interactions with the tail and the cf2 cf3 entities xu et al 2020a the concurrent interactions result in a side on adsorption mode where pfoa is attached in parallel to the material surface through the multi point synergistic interactions theoretically alkaline ph is expected to be less favorable for α fe2o3 tnts to interact with the carboxylate group due to increased surface repulsion wei et al 2017a and competition of ho consequently the hydrophobic and anion π interactions become more important at higher ph in other words the pfoa adsorption switches from the parallel side on mode to a vertical tail on orientation at elevated ph although the overall uptake remained comparable fig 7 compares the defluorination rates of the pre sorbed pfoa at various ph levels fe tnts ac performed equally well over the ph range of 4 0 8 0 with average defluorination of 61 3 after 4 h of uv irradiation at ph 9 0 the defluorination dropped to 56 8 and further increasing the ph to 10 0 and 11 0 lowered the defluorination to 42 7 and 36 1 respectively the decrease in the photodegradation activity at ph 9 is in accordance with the less favorable adsorption mode i e the tail tethered orientation of pfoa on the ac surface is less conducive to the hole mediated decarboxylation of the head group which is the first step in the pfoa photodegradation see section 3 6 this is because the reactive species holes and radicals are generated at the interface of α fe2o3 tnts upon light irradiation as such the head group is more favorably decarboxylated when it is adsorbed on α fe2o3 tnts in addition when the ph is too high the excessive ho could react with photogenerated holes to produce excessive hydroxyl radicals which inhibit the direct hole oxidation of pfoa see section 3 6 lawless et al 1991 table s10 gives the initial and final ph the ph change was 0 1 during the adsorption indicating that the release of ho was negligible the ph decreased by up to 0 3 after photodegradation at acidic or neutral ph which can be attributed to the consumption of oh and the associated release of h section 3 6 3 5 reusability of fe tnts ac fig 8 shows that when fe tnts ac was repeatedly used in six consecutive cycles of adsorption photodegradation the pfoa adsorption remained high 99 removal and the defluorination rate was 60 the results indicate that the efficient photodegradation of pre concentrated pfoa can also regenerate fe tnts ac and the material can be reused in multiple cycles without additional chemical regeneration this important feature represents a unique advantage of the adsorptive photocatalyst over conventional adsorbents e g ac or ion exchange resins which often require costly regeneration and subsequent treatment of the spent regenerant wastes the slight increase in defluorination with the number of cycles is attributed to the additional defluorination of intermediate products from the previous cycle indeed short chain pfas were detected on fe tnts ac during the photodegradation process see section 3 6 below no ti leaching was detected and about 2 53 wt of the impregnated fe was leached into the solution 1 7 mg l 1 after fe tnts ac was subjected to the six cycles of adsorption photodegradation 3 6 photocatalytic degradation mechanisms of pfoa by fe tnts ac to examine the roles of h oh and o2 the photocatalytic defluorination of pfoa was tested in the presence of various scavengers fig 9 compares the mineralization of pfoa which was preloaded on fe tnts ac after 2 h of uv irradiation the addition of ki a scavenger for h k 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 inhibited the pfoa defluorination from 62 to 51 0 1 mm ki and 28 1 mm ki at neutral ph in contrast the presence of 1 mm of isopropanol ip a scavenger for oh k 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 only modestly inhibited the defluorination from 62 to 51 whereas the addition of 0 1 or 1 mm benzoquinone bq a scavenger for o2 k 3 7 106 m 1 s 1 sawada et al 1975 exhibited a negligible influence these results suggest that direct h driven oxidation played a predominant role in pfoa photodegradation by fe tnts ac the results are consistent with previous observations with in2o3 or tio2 based photocatalysts li et al 2013 vecitis et al 2009 table s11 lists the intermediates and products after 2 h of pfoa photodegradation detected by lc qtof ms the intermediates at the m z values of 413 363 313 263 213 163 and 113 are assigned to pfoa and various shorter chain pfcas including pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba pfpa and tfa anions respectively based on the latest theory of photocatalysis for standard ti based materials panchangam et al 2018 peng et al 2017 and our experimental observations the pfoa photocatalytic degradation by fe tnts ac proceeds through the following stepwise defluorination process 14 c 7 f 15 co o feoh 2 c 7 f 15 co o feoh 2 15 fe tnts ac h v e cb h vb 16 h vb h 2 o oh h 17 h vb o h oh 18 c 7 f 15 co o h

c 5 f 11 co o 2 f c o 2 h f c o 2 h 2 o fig 10 a illustrates the photocatalytic reaction mechanisms first pfoa is adsorbed on the impregnated iron hydr oxide nanoparticles through concurrent electrostatic and lewis acid base interactions between the head carboxylate group of pfoa and the iron on the surface eq 14 second under uv irradiation electrons e conduction band and holes h valence band are generated eq 15 ji et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 the photo generated holes further react with h2o and ho to produce oh radicals eqs 16 and 17 ji et al 2020 third the adsorbed pfoa is oxidized by the photo generated holes h eq 18 to form the unstable perfluoroalkyl radical c7f15coo which decomposes into c7f15 through a photo kolbe like decarboxylation reaction with the head coo group cleaved eq 19 the resulting c7f15 radical is further decomposed via reactions with oh and hydrolysis eq 20 the resulting c7f15oh is highly unstable leading to the cleavage of a c f bond and the release of one fluoride ion eq 21 the intermediate product c6f13cof is easily attacked by oh radicals resulting in the shorter chain pfca eq 22 the shorter chain product c6f13coo undergoes the same decarboxylation defluorination cycle each of which eliminating one carbon and two fluorine atoms cf2 eq 23 short chain pfas have been found less adsorbable and more persistent than long chain pfas li et al 2019 based on the stepwise defluorination mechanism eq 23 the detection of intermediates table s11 and the high mineralization efficiency figs 6 and 7 it is evident that fe tnts ac can also photocatalytically degrade short chain pfas however further detailed investigations are warranted into the degradation mineralization rates and final products it is noteworthy that while oh may not directly initiate the pfoa degradation oh plays an important role in the stepwise defluorination process after the hole mediated activation of pfoa however excessive oh produced under alkaline conditions can quench the overall reaction because 1 oh may compete with pfoa for the holes the primary reactive species for pfoa and 2 oh has lower oxidation potential than the holes zhang et al 2020 it should be noted that because the reaction starts with the head group decarboxylation the introduction of iron plays a critical role as it can attract the head groups of pfoa to the vicinity of the photoactive sites rendering the subsequent photodegradation much more favorable moreover while oh may not directly attack pfoa it played an important role in reacting with the intermediate products as revealed in eqs 20 and 22 the fukui index based on natural bond orbital nbo analysis was conducted to evaluate the reactivity of the active sites of pfoa fig 10 b shows the molecular structure of pfoa with various sites labeled and fig 10c displays the calculated electrostatic potential esp distribution on the pfoa molecule as expected the highest esp was at the carboxyl head group which gradually decayed towards the tail since the reactive species h oh and o2 in the system are all electron deficient and electrophilic cai et al 2019 the sites possessing more negative esp are more prone to being attacked consequently decarboxylation of the head group occurred first to describe the site reactivity towards the electrophiles both the fukui index representing electrophilic attack f and radical attack f0 were calculated based on the dft approach table s12 the o9 and o10 sites possessed the highest f values i e 0 218 and 0 079 respectively and thus are most favorably attacked by the electrophilic species meanwhile the c8 o9 and o10 showed the highest f 0 values i e 0 107 0 172 and 0 077 respectively therefore the carboxylate group of pfoa is the most reactive site for ros which is consistent with the proposed pathway and esp results in addition to the anatase facilitated hole oxidation mechanism the impregnated iron hydr oxide particles can also generate holes and initiate the same decarboxylation reaction besides the redox reactions between fe ii fe iii and photo generated holes electrons also facilitate the production of oh and o2 radicals and prevent electron hole recombination leading to enhanced photodegradation of pfoa eqs 24 29 birben et al 2017 huo et al 2011 quici et al 2007 waite 2005 24 fe oh 2 h fe oh 2 25 fe oh 2 o 2 fe oh 2 o 2 26 f e 3 h f e 4 27 f e 4 o h f e 3 oh 28 f e 3 e f e 2 29 f e 2 e f e 3 it is noted that while the fe cycle can facilitate the pfoa photodegradation an excessive amount of fe iii may act as recombination centers through quantum tunneling zhang et al 1998 zhou et al 2005 resulting in reduced photo activity as indicated in fig 6 b in addition dissolved oxygen may be needed to facilitate the fe iii fe ii cycle especially at lower ph where oh radicals may be limited yu et al 2009 yu et al 2006 zhou et al 2006 2005 the enhanced adsorption and photodegradation of pfoa by fe tnts ac are attributed to 1 the carbon nanoparticles facilitate hydrophobic and anion π interactions with pfoa 2 the carbon coating also facilitates electron transfer and prevents electron hole recombination 3 the fe iii coating suppresses negative surface potential and enhances the interactions between the holes and the pfoa head groups carboxylate 4 the fe iii fe ii redox reaction cycle facilitates the production of oh radicals and prevents e h recombination and 5 because of the narrower band energy gap of iron oxide 2 1 2 3 ev for fe2o3 vs 3 0 3 2 ev for tio2 incorporating fe in fe tnts ac also enhances absorption of visible light the concentrate destroy strategy using adsorptive photocatalysts represents a significant advancement over conventional adsorption or photochemical treatments of pfas contaminated water and has the potential to degrade pfoa in a more cost effective manner compared to ac adsorption or ion exchange fe tnts ac not only adsorbs but also degrades pfoa moreover fe tnts ac eliminates the need for costly and toxic chemical regeneration due to the efficient solid phase photodegradation compared to direct aqueous phase degradation of pfoa using strong oxidants photosensitizers or other photocatalysts the pre concentrating ability of fe tnts ac not only facilitates more efficient solid phase photocatalytic degradation of pfoa but also enables the photodegradation to be carried out in a much smaller reactor with less energy input nonetheless to move the technology to the field additional investigations and technical optimizations are needed including 1 the composite materials can be further optimized in terms of mixed phase compositions and material fabrication conditions to facilitate more selective adsorption and greater photoactivity preferably under visible light 2 the materials need to be tested under field water conditions 3 the effects of water matrix on the adsorption and photocatalytic activity should be examined in particular the possible competitive adsorption of dissolved organic matter and the associated inhibition to the solid phase photodegradation 4 conclusions a novel adsorptive photocatalyst was synthesized based on commercial ac and tio2 the composite material exhibited synergistic adsorption and photocatalytic activity and enabled a novel concentrate destroy strategy for rapid and complete degradation of pfoa in water the major findings are summarized as follows 1 a novel adsorptive photocatalyst fe tnts ac was produced through a facile alkaline hydrothermal method based on commonly used commercial ac and tio2 and the optimal material was acquired at an fe content of 1 wt a calcination temperature of 550 c 2 fe tnts ac was able to rapidly adsorb pfoa within a few minutes thereby effectively concentrating the target contaminant on the photoactive sites effective adsorption was observed over a broad ph range 4 11 3 fe tnts ac adsorbs pfoa in the side on parallel mode with both the head and tail groups of pfoa attached to the photoactive sites facilitating the subsequent photocatalytic degradation of pfoa the adsorption conforms to the langmuir homogeneous monolayer adsorption model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 84 5 mg g 1 4 fe tnts ac was able to degrade 90 of the pre concentrated pfoa in 4 h under uv irradiation of which 62 was completely mineralized to f the highly efficient photocatalytic defluorination was observed over the ph range of 4 8 while higher ph 9 11 inhibited pfoa photodegradation 5 the efficient photodegradation of pre concentrated pfoa also regenerates fe tnts ac eliminating the need for expensive and toxic chemical regenerants after six cycles of adsorption photodegradation the material showed no significant drop in adsorption capacity or photocatalytic activity 6 according to the dft calculation analysis of pfoa scavenger tests and analysis of degradation intermediates pfoa decomposition is initiated by direct hole oxidation which activates the molecule and leads to a series of decarboxylation c f bond cleavage and chain shortening reactions although oh may not directly attack pfoa it played an important role in reacting with the intermediate products while fluoride was the major and desired final product some shorter chain pfcas were also detected appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to

17583,to improve the efficiency of antibiotic degradation the photosynergistic performance of bismuth vanadate bivo4 with a microalga dictyosphaerium sp was demonstrated under visible light irradiation for the first time sulfamethazine sm2 was selected as a representative sulfanilamide antibiotic and the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of sm2 was evaluated in media via the bivo4 algae system the hydrothermally synthesized sample was characterized using x ray powder diffraction x ray photoelectron spectroscopy ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy transmission electron microscopy brunauer emmett teller surface area and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques the results demonstrated that the prepared photocatalyst corresponded to phase pure monoclinic scheelite bivo4 the synthesized bivo4 showed superior photocatalytic properties under irradiation with visible light and more than 80 of photocatalytic degradation efficiency was obtained by the bivo4 algae system based on quenching experiments the photocatalytic degradation of sm2 in the bivo4 algae system was primarily accomplished via the generation of triplet state dissolved organic matter and hydroxyl radicals played a small role in the degradation process the direct oxidation of holes made no contribution to the degradation metabolomics data showed that a total of 91 metabolites were significantly changed between the two comparison groups algae sm2 group vs algae group algae bivo4 sm2 group vs algae bivo4 group the glycometabolism pathways were increased and the tricarboxylic acid cycle was activated when bivo4 was present the study provides a distinctive approach to remove antibiotics using visible light in the aqueous environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bivo4 dictyosphaerium sp photocatalytic degradation sulfamethazine mechanism 1 introduction sulfamethazine sm2 is one of the sulfanilamide antibiotics frequently used in veterinary medicines sarmah et al 2006 however in recent years sm2 has shown excellent properties of high detection frequency and concentrations in aqueous systems in china it showed a high detection frequency of 90 and was the predominant sulfanilamide antibiotic 37 2 with mean concentrations of 7 08 ng l in coastal waters of the yellow and bohai seas yang et al 2019 in particular sm2 was 40 1390 ng l in the surface water of the pearl river peng et al 2011 slightly higher than global levels nd 220 ng l in the united states japan france south korea and vietnam kim et al 2007 kolpin et al 2002 managaki et al 2007 murata et al 2011 tamtam et al 2008 even two groundwaters in germany 80 and 160 ng l sarmah et al 2006 because of its widespread application especially in aquaculture peng et al 2011 sm2 leads to the formation of a pseudopersistent phenomenon and has a long term toxic effect on aquatic organisms hence we need an efficient method to remove this emerging contaminant photocatalytic technology appears to be a promising treatment of organic pollutants leading to total mineralization and has attracted attention among researchers worldwide recently bismuth vanadate bivo4 as a visible light driven photocatalytic material has efficiently utilized a greater portion of the solar spectrum than titanium dioxide tio2 tio2 limits its further application in the visible light region due to its large bandgap of 3 2 ev abdullah et al 2012 bivo4 exists in three crystalline phases tetragonal zircon tetragonal scheelite and monoclinic scheelite among them monoclinic scheelite bivo4 with a bandgap of 2 4 ev exhibits a better photocatalytic performance than the other two phases zhang et al 2007 it has unique properties such as ferroelasticity lim et al 1995 electronic and ionic conductivity rullens et al 2006 photocatalytic activity for water splitting khan et al 2017 and capacity for the degradation of harmful pollutants such as ibuprofen li et al 2016 methylene blue abdullah et al 2012 and diethylstilbestrol liu et al 2017 however the activity of pure bivo4 still needs to be improved due to its poor adsorptive performance and high electron hole recombination rate gotic et al 2005 many approaches have been explored such as doping metal or nonmetal ions and combining with metal oxides regmi et al 2019 sun et al 2019 however all these strategies to improve the surface area and get a smaller bandgap of bivo4 catalysts are less favorable because they may add impurities and increase the overall cost of production madhusudan et al 2013 thus a cost effective and efficient treatment technique needs to be developed microalgal degradation of sulfanilamide antibiotics has been studied by several scholars in recent years bai and acharya 2016 xiong et al 2019a although the highest degradation efficiency was reported with 32 of sulfamethoxazole smx and 29 3 of sm2 the microalgae based technique as a potential additional treatment is being revived in antibiotic removal for many benefits including being solar powered environmentally friendly and potentially producing their own valuable products and biomass kiki et al 2020 xiong et al 2019b because both photocatalysts and microalgae require the use of light resources a combination technique of photocatalytic degradation may yield interesting results and merit further study the photocatalytic degradation of sm2 has not been reported via the bivo4 algae system even with the bivo4 system under solar light in addition the surface chemistry of bivo4 has not been well described and the generation of the active species in the photocatalytic process has been controversial in the literature yang et al 2017 to improve the degradation efficiency of antibiotics this study investigated the photocatalytic activity of monoclinic bivo4 in sm2 degradation and demonstrated the effect of microalgal addition the degradation mechanism of sm2 by the combined technique was studied by quenching analysis and metabolomics analysis as well special emphases were placed on 1 observing the potential of adding microalgae and photocatalysts to improve degradation efficiency of

is a key factor that determines its photocatalytic performance tang et al 2004 the tem micrographs fig 3 a and b of the bivo4 sample indicated that the prepared bivo4 was in the form of microspheres and showed the lattice space of 0 228 nm corresponding to 141 crystallographic planes of the monoclinic bivo4 wu et al 2017 the clear lattice fringe indicated the high crystallinity and single crystalline nature of the bivo4 sample madhusudan et al 2013 amano et al 2008 also reported that small grain size and high crystallinity provide a higher photocatalytic activity for the increased reactive sites and reduce the electron hole recombination rate the uv vis drs of the bivo4 sample is illustrated in this work fig 3c the prolonged absorption tail until about 650 nm indicated that the bivo4 sample was potentially valuable for sunlight driven applications liu et al 2017 in addition the maximum absorption wavelength of the microalgae was 688 nm and there were strong absorption bands around this wavelength the combination of bivo4 and microalgae may increase the absorption wavelength and cause photosynergy the bandgap energy of bivo4 can be determined from the abs 2 hν 2 versus photon energy hν plot in the inset of fig 3c which was 2 45 ev the steep sharp line of the spectra in the visible light region is due to the bandgap transition zhang and zhang 2009 the bet surface area of the bivo4 sample was estimated to be ca 5 5 m2 g which was larger than the 4 3 m2 g obtained by abdullah et al 2012 the high surface area retained in the catalyst is beneficial for the enhancement of the photocatalyst s activity ma et al 2016 the ftir absorption spectrum of bivo4 fig s1 showed a weak absorption of ν bi o at around 540 cm 1 which could be interpreted as the presence of bismuth oxochloride novokreshchenova et al 2005 the absorptions at around 736 and 822 cm 1 exhibited a strong characteristic peak that could be attributed to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations of the v o bonds gotic et al 2005 the band at 2346 cm 1 may be assigned to the absorbed co2 from the air ren et al 2009 the broad peak of ν oh at 3580 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of o h groups and the band at about 1635 cm 1 was attributed to h o h bending vibrations of adsorbed h2o ma et al 2016 3 2 effect of bivo4concentration the optimal bivo4 concentration for sm2 removal was determined over a 3 day period the result of the effect of 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 g l bivo4 catalyst on sm2 degradation is shown in fig 4 it was clearly observed that the photodegradation of sm2 was significantly enhanced with the addition of the catalyst the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sm2 was highest when the catalyst dosage was 0 5 g l the decreased degradation efficiency of sm2 at higher catalyst dosage was because the transmission of visible light was reduced by the suspended solid particles gao et al 2016 the 0 5 g l dosage of the catalyst was maintained in this study and the same dosage used in the study of liu et al 2017 and li et al 2016 3 3 synergistic effect of bivo4and algae the effect of bivo4 and algae on the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sm2 was determined from 4 days of incubation fig 5 it can be seen that the 83 degradation efficiency of the sm2 bivo4 algae group was significantly higher than that of 13 in the control group even 34 and 41 in the sm2 bivo4 and sm2 algae groups respectively the degradation process of sm2 could be fitted by the first order kinetics model table s2 the slope k of different antibiotic treatment groups supported that both catalyst and algae could significantly improve the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sm2 for the sm2 bivo4 algae group k of sm2 was about 2 53 fold and 3 17 fold higher than that of the sm2 algae group and sm2 bivo4 group respectively while it is 9 5 fold higher than that of the control group the calculated half lives of sm2 were shortest in the sm2 bivo4 algae group only 1 86 days in addition this study showed a better performance of bivo4 and dictyosphaerium sp photocatalytic sm2 removal than that of previous studies using bivo4 alone bian et al 2014 soltani et al 2019 and algae alone kiki et al 2020 xiong et al 2019a 3 4 mechanism of sm2 degradation 3 4 1 impact of free radical on the degradation of sm2 quenching experiments were employed to study the degradation mechanism of sm2 fig 6 the oh was quenched with the addition of ipa malathi et al 2017 the k decreased from 0 38 d 1 to 0 21 d 1 it could be determined that the contribution of oh was 44 the h was quenched with the addition of edta 2na deng et al 2018 the k 0 37 d 1 was slightly decreased the phenomenon indicated that the photocatalytic degradation of sm2 was not via the generation of h the 3dom an oxidant and a precursor to other reactive intermediates was quenched with the addition of hda schmitt et al 2019 the degradation efficiency of sm2 was remarkably reduced to 0 09 d 1 indicating 3dom played a vital role in this process 3dom can oxidize different classes of organic molecules especially those with phenol and aniline moieties mcneill and canonica 2016 it is worth noting that sulfanilamide antibiotics happen to have this structure in addition algae can release large amounts of dom omta et al 2020 providing more opportunities to degrade the tested antibiotic an inference was achieved through the reaction with the 3dom radicals followed by oh radicals as shown in the following eqs 1 9 1 biv o 4 h ν biv o 4 e h 2 d o m h ν 3 d o m 3 s

of sm2 3 4 2 1 data processing and quality control in this study we present the untargeted metabolomics analysis investigation of treatment groups and respective control groups using uhplc triple tof ms ms the 11 102 and 4073 features were extracted from each sample under esi and esi mode respectively in total 176 biochemical compounds were identified across the algae samples which could be classified into eight metabolite categories lipids organic acid nucleotides carbohydrates benzenoids organic nitrogen organoheterocyclic and phenylpropanoids to provide a general overview of all metabolites detected in this study a pca was performed resulting in a clear distinction between the metabolic profiles of algae samples fig 7 well clustered qc samples n 4 demonstrated excellent reproducibility during instrumental analysis zhang et al 2019 meantime reliable data quality across all the samples revealed the potency of the method for metabolic profiling studies liu et al 2019 3 4 2 2 metabolites identification to identify ion peaks that could be used to differentiate the metabolite profiles among the four groups we established a supervised opls da model that was concentrated on the actual class discriminating variations in fig s2 the multiple comparisons among the four groups all showed clear separation the goodness of fit r 2 and prediction ability of the model q 2 by the first three components were 0 995 and 0 588 0 998 and 0 670 respectively for differentiating the algae group and algae sm2 group fig s2a algae bivo4 group and algae bivo4 sm2 group fig s2b inducing different metabolic responses toward the control group and treatment group based on identified criteria details of 91 sdms in the two comparison groups are provided as supplementary material tables s3 and s4 the clustering results showed a satisfactory discriminatory power between the algae group and algae sm2 group fig 8 a and between the algae bivo4 group and algae bivo4 sm2 group fig 8b a total of 55 sdms 12 upregulated and 43 downregulated are observed in the algae sm2 group fig 8a and its upregulated sdms mainly belong to lipids and organic acid which accounted for 10 9 and 7 3 respectively as shown in fig 8b 54 sdms 34 upregulated and 20 downregulated were identified in the algae bivo4 sm2 group and the upregulated sdms mainly belong to lipids organic acid nucleosides and carbohydrate which accounted for 22 2 16 7 7 4 and 7 4 respectively an obvious separation was observed between the two comparison groups indicating that intracellular metabolites were altered qian et al 2018 an increase of metabolites between the two comparison groups might indicate a compensatory breakdown of proteins for energy supply or an accumulation of intermediate products kluender et al 2008 3 4 2 3 kegg pathway analysis the bioinformatics analysis aimed to find the source and mechanism for biological changes the kegg pathway analysis showed nine metabolic pathways that were significantly enriched in the algae sm2 group vs algae group p 0 05 these pathways included synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies purine metabolism glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism glutathione metabolism fatty acid biosynthesis butanoate metabolism biosynthesis of amino acids aminoacyl trna biosynthesis and abc transporters fig s3a in energy and carbohydrate metabolism we found that glucosamine 1p maltose and isomaltose in the algae sm2 group were significantly lower than those in the algae group acetyl coa an important precursor to the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle frey et al 2016 was detected significantly lower in the algae sm2 group fig 9 the tca is important to many biochemical pathways and is a key metabolic pathway connecting carbohydrate fat and protein metabolism qian et al 2018 the amino acid compounds related to the tca cycle were predominantly detected in the algae group such as l phenylalanine l glutamate and dl arginine however many kinds of amino acids have earlier been attributed to a stress response hasler sheetal et al 2015 suggesting that the algae sm2 group had a reduced defense capacity these results showed that sm2 can seriously interfere with the metabolic system of dictyosphaerium sp in fatty acid fa metabolism saturated fa tetradecanoic acid and monounsaturated fa hexadecenoic acid were significantly elevated in the algae sm2 group indicating that the peroxidation of lipids occurred belghit et al 2017 in a comparison of the algae bivo4 sm2 group vs algae bivo4 group there were five pathways enriched including galactose metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism glycerophospholipid metabolism pentose phosphate pathway and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism fig s3b most of which are related to the glycometabolism and closely related to the energy requirement of organisms zhao et al 2018 the main metabolites of enriched kegg pathways between the algae sm2 group vs algae group and the algae bivo4 sm2 group vs algae bivo4 group were changed from organic acids and lipids metabolites to carbohydrates and lipids metabolites the activities were greatly increased in the algae bivo4 sm2 group including fructose 6 phosphate and glucose 6 phosphate due to the metabolism of polysaccharides like sucrose and udp d galactose fig 10 it has been reported that the polysaccharides of algae can play a valuable role in anti inflammatory antinociceptive and antioxidation activities treves et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 amino acids were also significantly increased such as l leucyl l proline l phenylalanine l tyrosine and prolyl arginine table s4 proline is an extensively studied molecule in the context of plant responses to abiotic stresses such as water deficit salinity and low temperature sharma and dietz 2006 phenylalanine and arginine are the starting compounds used in the synthesis of flavonoids in plants and flavonoids are also involved in the resistance to environmental stresses such as uv radiation reactive oxygen species and metals falcone ferreyra et al 2012 the responding amino acids in the tca cycle were significantly increased compared with the algae bivo4 group which meant that the tca cycle was activated the difference in metabolic pathways between the two comparison groups may be due to the bivo4 having a definite removal effect on antibiotics reducing the toxicity to algae and facilitating the removal of antibiotics by algae as well in summary antibiotics were more likely to be degraded into small molecular organic matter or inorganic ions by the combined technique of bivo4 and dictyosphaerium sp and degradation products e g so4 2 nh4 and no3 could be absorbed by algae for their own growth 4 conclusions this study indicated that the prepared bivo4 combining with dictyosphaerium sp showed an effective photocatalysis for the degradation of sm2 under visible light irradiation the results of quenching experiments revealed that the main active species in the bivo4 algae solutions were 3dom followed by oh the results of metabolomics analysis demonstrated that algae responded differently to the sm2 system and bivo4 sm2 system increased carbohydrate metabolites and activated tca cycle of dictyosphaerium sp under the action of the bivo4 catalyst played a vital role in promoting the removal of sm2 this study provided a feasible combined technique to degrade antibiotics via catalyst and microalgae under solar light however the degradation by products for sm2 and detoxification in the removal processes

17583,to improve the efficiency of antibiotic degradation the photosynergistic performance of bismuth vanadate bivo4 with a microalga dictyosphaerium sp was demonstrated under visible light irradiation for the first time sulfamethazine sm2 was selected as a representative sulfanilamide antibiotic and the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of sm2 was evaluated in media via the bivo4 algae system the hydrothermally synthesized sample was characterized using x ray powder diffraction x ray photoelectron spectroscopy ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy transmission electron microscopy brunauer emmett teller surface area and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques the results demonstrated that the prepared photocatalyst corresponded to phase pure monoclinic scheelite bivo4 the synthesized bivo4 showed superior photocatalytic properties under irradiation with visible light and more than 80 of photocatalytic degradation efficiency was obtained by the bivo4 algae system based on quenching experiments the photocatalytic degradation of sm2 in the bivo4 algae system was primarily accomplished via the generation of triplet state dissolved organic matter and hydroxyl radicals played a small role in the degradation process the direct oxidation of holes made no contribution to the degradation metabolomics data showed that a total of 91 metabolites were significantly changed between the two comparison groups algae sm2 group vs algae group algae bivo4 sm2 group vs algae bivo4 group the glycometabolism pathways were increased and the tricarboxylic acid cycle was activated when bivo4 was present the study provides a distinctive approach to remove antibiotics using visible light in the aqueous environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bivo4 dictyosphaerium sp photocatalytic degradation sulfamethazine mechanism 1 introduction sulfamethazine sm2 is one of the sulfanilamide antibiotics frequently used in veterinary medicines sarmah et al 2006 however in recent years sm2 has shown excellent properties of high detection frequency and concentrations in aqueous systems in china it showed a high detection frequency of 90 and was the predominant sulfanilamide antibiotic 37 2 with mean concentrations of 7 08 ng l in coastal waters of the yellow and bohai seas yang et al 2019 in particular sm2 was 40 1390 ng l in the surface water of the pearl river peng et al 2011 slightly higher than global levels nd 220 ng l in the united states japan france south korea and vietnam kim et al 2007 kolpin et al 2002 managaki et al 2007 murata et al 2011 tamtam et al 2008 even two groundwaters in germany 80 and 160 ng l sarmah et al 2006 because of its widespread application especially in aquaculture peng et al 2011 sm2 leads to the formation of a pseudopersistent phenomenon and has a long term toxic effect on aquatic organisms hence we need an efficient method to remove this emerging contaminant photocatalytic technology appears to be a promising treatment of organic pollutants leading to total mineralization and has attracted attention among researchers worldwide recently bismuth vanadate bivo4 as a visible light driven photocatalytic material has efficiently utilized a greater portion of the solar spectrum than titanium dioxide tio2 tio2 limits its further application in the visible light region due to its large bandgap of 3 2 ev abdullah et al 2012 bivo4 exists in three crystalline phases tetragonal zircon tetragonal scheelite and monoclinic scheelite among them monoclinic scheelite bivo4 with a bandgap of 2 4 ev exhibits a better photocatalytic performance than the other two phases zhang et al 2007 it has unique properties such as ferroelasticity lim et al 1995 electronic and ionic conductivity rullens et al 2006 photocatalytic activity for water splitting khan et al 2017 and capacity for the degradation of harmful pollutants such as ibuprofen li et al 2016 methylene blue abdullah et al 2012 and diethylstilbestrol liu et al 2017 however the activity of pure bivo4 still needs to be improved due to its poor adsorptive performance and high electron hole recombination rate gotic et al 2005 many approaches have been explored such as doping metal or nonmetal ions and combining with metal oxides regmi et al 2019 sun et al 2019 however all these strategies to improve the surface area and get a smaller bandgap of bivo4 catalysts are less favorable because they may add impurities and increase the overall cost of production madhusudan et al 2013 thus a cost effective and efficient treatment technique needs to be developed microalgal degradation of sulfanilamide antibiotics has been studied by several scholars in recent years bai and acharya 2016 xiong et al 2019a although the highest degradation efficiency was reported with 32 of sulfamethoxazole smx and 29 3 of sm2 the microalgae based technique as a potential additional treatment is being revived in antibiotic removal for many benefits including being solar powered environmentally friendly and potentially producing their own valuable products and biomass kiki et al 2020 xiong et al 2019b because both photocatalysts and microalgae require the use of light resources a combination technique of photocatalytic degradation may yield interesting results and merit further study the photocatalytic degradation of sm2 has not been reported via the bivo4 algae system even with the bivo4 system under solar light in addition the surface chemistry of bivo4 has not been well described and the generation of the active species in the photocatalytic process has been controversial in the literature yang et al 2017 to improve the degradation efficiency of antibiotics this study investigated the photocatalytic activity of monoclinic bivo4 in sm2 degradation and demonstrated the effect of microalgal addition the degradation mechanism of sm2 by the combined technique was studied by quenching analysis and metabolomics analysis as well special emphases were placed on 1 observing the potential of adding microalgae and photocatalysts to improve degradation efficiency of antibiotics and 2 understanding the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of antibiotics through quenching analysis and metabolomics analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents sm2 98

briefly the enrichment level of each metabolomic pathway was calculated using fisher s exact test and a value of p 0 05 was considered statistically significant liu et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structure of bivo4 the diffraction pattern fig 1 shows that the representative peaks 2θ 18 9 28 9 and 30 5 could be indexed as the standard card jcpds card no 14 0688 with a 5 195 å b 11 701 å c 5 092 å zhou et al 2006 the xrd analysis results indicated that the as prepared photocatalyst corresponded to pure monoclinic scheelite phase bivo4 the xps analysis revealed the surface chemical states of various elements including c o bi and v in the photocatalyst fig 2 shows the bi 4f v 2p o 1s and c 1s xps spectra with gaussian fitting for bivo4 in the case of bi the deconvoluted peaks centered at 164 2 ev and 158 9 ev corresponded to the elemental composition of bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 respectively fig 2b besides the split peaks for v 2p were identified at binding energies 524 2 ev for v 2p1 2 and 516 8 ev for v 2p3 2 fig 2c and the binding energies of o 1s in bivo4 were at 529 4 530 0 and 531 9 ev fig 2d as shown in fig 2e the c 1s peak was deconvoluted into three peaks corresponding to c c and c c bonds at 284 7 ev and oxygen containing functional groups at 285 2 ev c o epoxy and hydroxyl and 288 0 ev c o carboxyl the optical absorption property of a photocatalyst is a key factor that determines its photocatalytic performance tang et al 2004 the tem micrographs fig 3 a and b of the bivo4 sample indicated that the prepared bivo4 was in the form of microspheres and showed the lattice space of 0 228 nm corresponding to 141 crystallographic planes of the monoclinic bivo4 wu et al 2017 the clear lattice fringe indicated the high crystallinity and single crystalline nature of the bivo4 sample madhusudan et al 2013 amano et al 2008 also reported that small grain size and high crystallinity provide a higher photocatalytic activity for the increased reactive sites and reduce the electron hole recombination rate the uv vis drs of the bivo4 sample is illustrated in this work fig 3c the prolonged absorption tail until about 650 nm indicated that the bivo4 sample was potentially valuable for sunlight driven applications liu et al 2017 in addition the maximum absorption wavelength of the microalgae was 688 nm and there were strong absorption bands around this wavelength the combination of bivo4 and microalgae may increase the absorption wavelength and cause photosynergy the bandgap energy of bivo4 can be determined from the abs 2 hν 2 versus photon energy hν plot in the inset of fig 3c which was 2 45 ev the steep sharp line of the spectra in the visible light region is due to the bandgap transition zhang and zhang 2009 the bet surface area of the bivo4 sample was estimated to be ca 5 5 m2 g which was larger than the 4 3 m2 g obtained by abdullah et al 2012 the high surface area retained in the catalyst is beneficial for the enhancement of the photocatalyst s activity ma et al 2016 the ftir absorption spectrum of bivo4 fig s1 showed a weak absorption of ν bi o at around 540 cm 1 which could be interpreted as the presence of bismuth oxochloride novokreshchenova et al 2005 the absorptions at around 736 and 822 cm 1 exhibited a strong characteristic peak that could be attributed to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations of the v o bonds gotic et al 2005 the band at 2346 cm 1 may be assigned to the absorbed co2 from the air ren et al 2009 the broad peak of ν oh at 3580 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of o h groups and the band at about 1635 cm 1 was attributed to h o h bending vibrations of adsorbed h2o ma et al 2016 3 2 effect of bivo4concentration the optimal bivo4 concentration for sm2 removal was determined over a 3 day period the result of the effect of 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 g l bivo4 catalyst on sm2 degradation is shown in fig 4 it was clearly observed that the photodegradation of sm2 was significantly enhanced with the addition of the catalyst the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sm2 was highest when the catalyst dosage was 0 5 g l the decreased degradation efficiency of sm2 at higher catalyst dosage was because the transmission of visible light was reduced by the suspended solid particles gao et al 2016 the 0 5 g l dosage of the catalyst was maintained in this study and the same dosage used in the study of liu et al 2017 and li et al 2016 3 3 synergistic effect of bivo4and algae the effect of bivo4 and algae on the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sm2 was determined from 4 days of incubation fig 5 it can be seen that the 83 degradation efficiency of the sm2 bivo4 algae group was significantly higher than that of 13 in the control group even 34 and 41 in the sm2 bivo4 and sm2 algae groups respectively the degradation process of sm2 could be fitted by the first order kinetics model table s2 the slope k of different antibiotic treatment groups supported that both catalyst and algae could significantly improve the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sm2 for the sm2 bivo4 algae group k of sm2 was about 2 53 fold and 3 17 fold higher than that of the sm2 algae group and sm2 bivo4 group respectively while it is 9 5 fold higher than that of the control group the calculated half lives of sm2 were shortest in the sm2 bivo4 algae group only 1 86 days in addition this study showed a better performance of bivo4 and dictyosphaerium sp photocatalytic sm2 removal than that of previous studies using bivo4 alone

employed to study the degradation mechanism of sm2 fig 6 the oh was quenched with the addition of ipa malathi et al 2017 the k decreased from 0 38 d 1 to 0 21 d 1 it could be determined that the contribution of oh was 44 the h was quenched with the addition of edta 2na deng et al 2018 the k 0 37 d 1 was slightly decreased the phenomenon indicated that the photocatalytic degradation of sm2 was not via the generation of h the 3dom an oxidant and a precursor to other reactive intermediates was quenched with the addition of hda schmitt et al 2019 the degradation efficiency of sm2 was remarkably reduced to 0 09 d 1 indicating 3dom played a vital role in this process 3dom can oxidize different classes of organic molecules especially those with phenol and aniline moieties mcneill and canonica 2016 it is worth noting that sulfanilamide antibiotics happen to have this structure in addition algae can release large amounts of dom omta et al 2020 providing more opportunities to degrade the tested antibiotic an inference was achieved through the reaction with the 3dom radicals followed by oh radicals as shown in the following eqs 1 9 1 biv o 4 h ν biv o 4 e h 2 d o m h ν 3 d o m 3 s

ms ms the 11 102 and 4073 features were extracted from each sample under esi and esi mode respectively in total 176 biochemical compounds were identified across the algae samples which could be classified into eight metabolite categories lipids organic acid nucleotides carbohydrates benzenoids organic nitrogen organoheterocyclic and phenylpropanoids to provide a general overview of all metabolites detected in this study a pca was performed resulting in a clear distinction between the metabolic profiles of algae samples fig 7 well clustered qc samples n 4 demonstrated excellent reproducibility during instrumental analysis zhang et al 2019 meantime reliable data quality across all the samples revealed the potency of the method for metabolic profiling studies liu et al 2019 3 4 2 2 metabolites identification to identify ion peaks that could be used to differentiate the metabolite profiles among the four groups we established a supervised opls da model that was concentrated on the actual class discriminating variations in fig s2 the multiple comparisons among the four groups all showed clear separation the goodness of fit r 2 and prediction ability of the model q 2 by the first three components were 0 995 and 0 588 0 998 and 0 670 respectively for differentiating the algae group and algae sm2 group fig s2a algae bivo4 group and algae bivo4 sm2 group fig s2b inducing different metabolic responses toward the control group and treatment group based on identified criteria details of 91 sdms in the two comparison groups are provided as supplementary material tables s3 and s4 the clustering results showed a satisfactory discriminatory power between the algae group and algae sm2 group fig 8 a and between the algae bivo4 group and algae bivo4 sm2 group fig 8b a total of 55 sdms 12 upregulated and 43 downregulated are observed in the algae sm2 group fig 8a and its upregulated sdms mainly belong to lipids and organic acid which accounted for 10 9 and 7 3 respectively as shown in fig 8b 54 sdms 34 upregulated and 20 downregulated were identified in the algae bivo4 sm2 group and the upregulated sdms mainly belong to lipids organic acid nucleosides and carbohydrate which accounted for 22 2 16 7 7 4 and 7 4 respectively an obvious separation was observed between the two comparison groups indicating that intracellular metabolites were altered qian et al 2018 an increase of metabolites between the two comparison groups might indicate a compensatory breakdown of proteins for energy supply or an accumulation of intermediate products kluender et al 2008 3 4 2 3 kegg pathway analysis the bioinformatics analysis aimed to find the source and mechanism for biological changes the kegg pathway analysis showed nine metabolic pathways that were significantly enriched in the algae sm2 group vs algae group p 0 05 these pathways included synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies purine metabolism glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism glutathione metabolism fatty acid biosynthesis butanoate metabolism biosynthesis of amino acids aminoacyl trna biosynthesis and abc transporters fig s3a in energy and carbohydrate metabolism we found that glucosamine 1p maltose and isomaltose in the algae sm2 group were significantly lower than those in the algae group acetyl coa an important precursor to the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle frey et al 2016 was detected significantly lower in the algae sm2 group fig 9 the tca is important to many biochemical pathways and is a key metabolic pathway connecting carbohydrate fat and protein metabolism qian et al 2018 the amino acid compounds related to the tca cycle were predominantly detected in the algae group such as l phenylalanine l glutamate and dl arginine however many kinds of amino acids have earlier been attributed to a stress response hasler sheetal et al 2015 suggesting that the algae sm2 group had a reduced defense capacity these results showed that sm2 can seriously interfere with the metabolic system of dictyosphaerium sp in fatty acid fa metabolism saturated fa tetradecanoic acid and monounsaturated fa hexadecenoic acid were significantly elevated in the algae sm2 group indicating that the peroxidation of lipids occurred belghit et al 2017 in a comparison of the algae bivo4 sm2 group vs algae bivo4 group there were five pathways enriched including galactose metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism glycerophospholipid metabolism pentose phosphate pathway and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism fig s3b most of which are related to the glycometabolism and closely related to the energy requirement of organisms zhao et al 2018 the main metabolites of enriched kegg pathways between the algae sm2 group vs algae group and the algae bivo4 sm2 group vs algae bivo4 group were changed from organic acids and lipids metabolites to carbohydrates and lipids metabolites the activities were greatly increased in the algae bivo4 sm2 group including fructose 6 phosphate and glucose 6 phosphate due to the metabolism of polysaccharides like sucrose and udp d galactose fig 10 it has been reported that the polysaccharides of algae can play a valuable role in anti inflammatory antinociceptive and antioxidation activities treves et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 amino acids were also significantly increased such as l leucyl l proline l phenylalanine l tyrosine and prolyl arginine table s4 proline is an extensively studied molecule in the context of plant responses to abiotic stresses such as water deficit salinity and low temperature sharma and dietz 2006 phenylalanine and arginine are the starting compounds used in the synthesis of flavonoids in plants and flavonoids are also involved in the resistance to environmental stresses such as uv radiation reactive oxygen species and metals falcone ferreyra et al 2012 the responding amino acids in the tca cycle were significantly increased compared with the algae bivo4 group which meant that the tca cycle was activated the difference in metabolic pathways between the two comparison groups may be due to the bivo4 having a definite removal effect on antibiotics reducing the toxicity to algae and facilitating the removal of antibiotics by algae as well in summary antibiotics were more likely to be degraded into small molecular organic matter or inorganic ions by the combined technique of bivo4 and dictyosphaerium sp and degradation products e g so4 2 nh4 and no3 could be absorbed by algae for their own growth 4 conclusions this study indicated that the prepared bivo4 combining with dictyosphaerium sp showed an effective photocatalysis for the degradation of sm2 under visible light irradiation the results of quenching experiments revealed that the main active species in the bivo4 algae solutions were 3dom followed by oh the results of metabolomics analysis demonstrated that algae responded differently to the sm2 system and bivo4 sm2 system increased carbohydrate metabolites and activated tca cycle of dictyosphaerium sp under the action of the bivo4 catalyst played a vital role in promoting the removal of sm2 this study provided a feasible combined technique to degrade antibiotics via catalyst and microalgae under solar light however the degradation by products for sm2 and detoxification in the removal processes

previous studies on algal blooms were mainly focused on relatively static water bodies i e lakes and reservoirs but less on the large rivers as the largest tributary of the yangtze river of china and the main freshwater source of the south to north water diversion project snwdp the han river has experienced frequent algal blooms in recent decades here we investigated the algal blooms during a decade 2003 2014 in the han river by two gradient boosting machine gbm models with k fold cross validation which used explanatory variables from current 10 day gbmc model or previous 10 day period gbmp model our results advocate the use of gbmp due to its higher accuracy median kappa 0 9 and practical predictability using antecedent observations compared to gbmc we also revealed that the algal blooms in the han river were significantly modulated by antecedent water levels in the han river and the yangtze river and water level variation in the han river whereas the nutrient concentrations in the han river were usually above thresholds and not limiting algal blooms this machine learning based study potentially provides scientific guidance for preemptive warning and risk management of river

excessive nutrient enrichment were regulated by hydrological regimes influenced by intensified human activities and climate change zhu et al 2008 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 yin et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a compared to the eutrophication in relatively static water bodies e g lakes and reservoirs large river algal blooms could cause more serious consequences to the aquatic ecosystem and human health at a larger scale along the rivers with a length of over hundreds of kilometers reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 zhang et al 2017 for instance the 1991 darling river cyanobacterial bloom affected almost 1000 km of the barwon darling river of australia bowling and baker 1996 the han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river of china has experienced more than 10 consecutive algal blooms defined by algal density 107 cells l 1 since 1992 xia et al 2001 zhang et al 2017 the algal bloom occurring in the middle lower han river of china in 2008 spanned more than 400 km which influenced the drinking water of more than twenty thousand people and resulted in the shutdown of many waterworks xia et al 2012 the causal analysis and prediction of algal blooms in large hydrologically regulated rivers has become a major concern as the algal blooms in these rivers not only lead to deteriorating water quality and aquatic ecosystems but also restrict the socioeconomic development and threaten the public health previous studies on algal blooms were mainly focused on relatively static water bodies i e lakes and reservoirs but less on the large rivers schmale et al 2019 revealing the causes of river algal blooms is still challenging due to complex hydrological conditions as well as interactions between multiple environmental factors in large river systems xia et al 2019 it is just not excess nutrients and nutrient uptake that drive algal blooms in complicated river ecosystems mischke et al 2011 yin et al 2012 oliver et al 2014 the diffusion and degradation processes of pollutants in rivers are affected by the horizontal and vertical mixing of water mac donagh et al 2008 liu et al 2012 xia et al 2012 evtimova et al 2014 experimental studies have showed that hydrodynamic condition i e fluctuation and agitation of water usually have significant effects on the migration diffusion growth and accumulation of algae chung et al 2008 lucas et al 2009 whitehead et al 2015 yang et al 2017a changes in hydrological conditions may lead to altered light intensities and uneven distribution of nutrients in water bodies resulting in the changes in the absorption dynamics of algae nutrients thereby affecting algae growth mckiver and neufeld 2009 istvánovics and honti 2012 relatively static hydrological conditions will also increase the transparency of water bodies which is beneficial to the growth of algae mitrovic et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 lots of studies have indicated that the algal growth in rivers is sensitive to changes in hydrological conditions particularly the changes in water levels yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 though hydrological conditions play an important role in triggering algal blooms in riverine ecosystems ferris and lehman 2007 no persuasive conclusions have been drawn based on traditional statistical or ecological modeling analysis long et al 2011 kim et al 2014 xia et al 2016 here we compile decade long multi source field observations and attempt to identify the key driving factors for the occurrence of river algal blooms in the han river using a machine learning method i e the gradient boosting machine gbm gbms are a family of powerful machine learning techniques that have proven successful in a wide range of domains such as pattern cognition schütz et al 2019 text classification natekin and knoll 2013 motion detection bouwman et al 2020 and ecological and environmental studies de ath and fabricius 2000 the learning procedure in gbms provide a more accurate estimate of the response variable by consecutively error fitting natekin and knoll 2013 algal blooms in the han river of china were dominated by excessive diatom cyclotella sp growth which led to deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and threatened drinking water security xia et al 2019 xin et al 2020 as the nutrient total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations in the downstream han river in spring were usually far above the eutrophication thresholds i e tn 0 2 mg n l 1 tp 0 02 mg p l 1 as per china s national water quality standard gb3838 2002 liang et al 2012 we hypothesized that the algal blooms in the mid downstream han river were primarily regulated by hydrologic conditions in the han river and the yangtze river we developed two gbm models i e gbmc and gbmp using measurements of explanatory variables tn and tp concentrations water temperature and hydrologic variables from current and previous 10 day period respectively we expect to build a predictive model i e the gbmp model using antecedent 10 day period data for the algal blooms in the han river which could be of practical significance for the prevention and control of algal blooms in large rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the han river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river of china fig 1 the length of the main river is about 1577 km and its total drainage area covers 168 400 km2 the han river basin 30 34 n and 106 114 e has a subtropical monsoon climate which has distinct seasons and abundant rainfall the average annual temperature is about 15 c and the average annual precipitation ranges from 700 to 1300 mm cheng et al 2019 xin et al 2020 the danjiangkou reservoir located in the upper middle han river is the water source for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp xia et al 2016 flowing through the most economically developed region in hubei province the middle lower han river has a length of about 652 km from the danjiangkou reservoir to the confluence of the han river and the yangtze river xia et al 2012 cheng et al 2019 xin et al 2020 the width of the han river ranges about 600 1200 m in the middle stream and 200 300 m in the downstream with average water depths of 6 12 m xu 1996 1997 xu et al 2002 there are about 79 fish species in the middle lower han river and the largest group is cyprinidae followed by anguidae yang et al 2020 major aquatic macrophytes are p perfoliatus p malaianus vallisneria natans salvinia natans a philoxeroides and artemisia selengensis yang et al 2017b the causes of algal blooms in the downstream han river are very complicated since it is impacted by the water environment in the han river regulated by water release from the upstream danjiangkou reservoir as well as closely related to the hydrological regime backwater zone in the yangtze river fig 1 in this study we focus on the most serious algal blooms at the wuhan section in the downstream portion of the han river from year 2003 2014 we used the hydrological data from the hanchuan station and the hankou station to represent the hydrological conditions in the han river and the yangtze river respectively fig 1 hydrological data involved in this study include daily water levels flow velocities and streamflow rates in addition 10 day water quality data i e tn and tp concentrations and algae data algae density l 1 chlorophyll a μg l 1 at three sections baihezui qinduankou and zongguan see fig 1 were provided by the yangtze river basin ecological and environmental supervision authority we used the water quality and algae data averaged across these three sections for modeling 2 2 explanatory variables and response variable for the modeling based on available data in the han river and the yangtze river we selected three categories of representative explanatory variables for the gbm modeling i hydrologic variables in the han river hr and the yangtze river yr flow velocity hrv and yrv with units of m s 1 streamflow discharge hrq and yrq m3 s 1 water level hrwl and yrwl m and coefficient of variation for water level hrwlcv and yrwlcv unitless ii water temperature wtmp c in the han river and iii water quality in the han river tn mg n l 1 and tp mg p l 1 we excluded the streamflow discharges hrq and yrq m3 s 1 from explanatory variables as they were highly correlated with water levels correlation coefficient ρ 0 78 for hr and 0 91 for yr si fig s1 this is understandable as streamflow discharge is usually estimated by the stage discharge relation mansanarez et al 2019 however we kept both flow velocities hrv and yrv and water levels hrwl and yrwl in the gbm modeling because they represented water mobility and quantity respectively although these two variables were moderately correlated ρ 0 7 si fig s1 as algal blooms generally lasted around 10 days in the han river xia et al 2016 cheng et al 2019 we divided each month into three periods i e the early 10 day period the middle 10 day period and the rest days as the third late period previous studies have suggested using 107 cells l 1 as the indicator of algal blooms in the han river lu et al 2000 dou et al 2002 xia et al 2016 cheng et al 2019 in this study we adopted the same threshold to determine the outbreak of algal blooms in the han river i e the presence and absence of blooms is defined by algal density 107 cells l 1 and 107 cells l 1 respectively in summary the response variable is binary i e the presence or absence of algal blooms we attempted to explore the dependence of algal blooms on nine explanatory variables by the gbm modeling hrv and yrv hrwl and yrwl hrwlcv and yrwlcv wtmp tn and tp 2 3 gradient boosting machine modeling the gbm is a powerful machine learning technique to train decision trees in a gradual additive and sequential manner natekin and knoll 2013 the final gbm model is the weighted sum of the predictions generated by the previous tree models where the classification process is repeated so that subsequent trees attempt to classify observed data that have not been well classified by the previous trees the gbm algorithm has been used to solve a variety of practical applications including the binary classification problem de ath and fabricius 2000 natekin and knoll 2013 which is the case for this study we examined two gbm models using the nine explanatory variables from current or previous period we named these two models as gbmc and gbmp respectively the gbm modeling was conducted using the gbm method with the k fold cross validation in the r package caret kuhn et al 2020 to build a predictive model we need to implement model calibration and validation model validation can be done using data that are not used in model training i e split sample validation or by the k fold cross validation approach de ath and fabricius 2000 cross validation also helps to avoid overfitting of the model natekin and knoll 2013 we adopted both strategies to validate our gbm models where the k fold cross validation was embedded in the split data validation procedure first we used the full datasets during the study period to train the gbmc and gbmp model respectively with the k fold cross validation method where the training dataset was further partitioned into k i e k 10 in this study subsets and each subset was held out while the model was trained on all other subsets de ath and fabricius 2000 we trained the models multiple times i e 10 000 times to assess the uncertainty in model performance and outputs nelson et al 2018 second regarding the model gbmc or gbmp performed better in the first step we further implemented the split sample validation i e splitting the full dataset into two subsets one for model training and the other for testing natekin and knoll 2013 to examine the effects of data partitioning on model performance we used six different percentages 50 100 with a 10 interval to partition the training and testing subsets amid the model training the k fold cross validation was also used 2 4 relative importance of explanatory variables relative importance of each explanatory variable was estimated with the use of varimp function in the caret package kuhn et al 2020 variable importance was determined by calculating the relative influence of each variable whether that variable was selected to split on during the tree building process and how much the squared error over all trees improved decreased as a result in each gbm model run the variable importance scores were scaled to be between 0 least important and 100 most important we summarized the variable importance scores from ensemble i e 10 000 model runs for gbmc and gbmp respectively the quantitative effects of important predictors on the occurrence of algal blooms were analyzed by the r package pdp greenwell 2017 which enables to graphically examine the dependence of the response variable on subsets of the explanatory variables specifically we used the two predictor partial dependence analysis greenwell 2017 to quantify the interactions between important variables and their impacts on the occurrence probability of algal blooms in the han river we only show the partial dependence plot within the ranges of the training data to avoid extrapolation of such relationship in regions outside the area of the training data greenwell 2017 2 5 statistics model performance was evaluated by accuracy cohen s kappa statistic and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auroc the accuracy criterion evaluates the percentage of correctly classified instances out of all instances natekin and knoll 2013 the kappa statistic quantitatively measures the magnitude of agreement on the presence or absence of algal blooms between model simulations predictions and observations where kappa observed accuracy expected accuracy 1 expected accuracy viera and garrett 2005 kappa values above 0 6 demonstrate substantial strength of agreement landis and koch 1977 viera and garrett 2005 a kappa value of 1 indicates a complete agreement the auroc is another useful metric to show the trade off between true positive rate and false positive rate across different decision thresholds schütz et al 2019 an auroc of 1 represents a complete agreement and auroc 0 8 is considered to be excellent hart 2015 we used the non parametric kruskal wallis kw method giraudoux 2013 to test the significance of difference in each of the nine explanatory variables between the presence and absence of algal blooms at a significance level of 0 05 we used the spearman correlation analysis sca to quantify the degree of correlation between two variables as sca does not require normally distributed variables asuero et al 2007 the strength of correlation is defined as asuero et al 2007 i high if the absolute value of the correlation coefficient ρ i e ρ 0 7 and p value 0 05 ii moderate if 0 5 ρ 0 7 and p value 0 05 iii low or weak if 0 3 ρ 0 5 and p value 0 05 iv marginal if 0 3 ρ 0 5 and 0 05 p value 0 1 and v little or uncorrelated if 0 ρ 0 3 or p value 0 1 3 results 3 1 variation of algae densities in the downstream han river based on the algal cell densities measured at three sections si fig s2 of the downstream han river during 2003 2014 there were severe algal blooms in four consecutive years i e 2008 2011 fig 2 a the algae densities were highly correlated with the concentrations of chlorophyll a chl a correlation coefficient 0 73 see si fig s3 the algal blooms generally occurred between february and april of these years si fig s2 with the mean algae density ranging from 1 0 5 1 107 cells l 1 in particular the algal blooms in 2008 had a peak density of 5 3 107 cells l 1 compared to the threshold of 1 107 cells l 1 in the wuhan section with a peak concentration of chl a of 30 93 μg l 1 which was the most serious algal bloom event in the lower han river during the 12 year study period although the highest algal densities 0 6 107 cells l 1 in 2004 2005 and 2012 2013 were also close to the threshold of algal blooms 107 cells l 1 yin et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 the severity was quite different from that in 2008 2011 the maximum algal densities in the other three years 2006 2007 and 2015 were lower than 0 5 107 cells l 1 fig 2a the algal blooms mostly occurred from middle february m feb to middle march m mar through multi year analysis fig 2b the algal densities usually reached the highest in middle february whereas the average algae densities in late february were similar to that in middle march in summary there were 102 sets periods of data only 3 period data available in the first year 2003 for modeling among which there were 12 algal blooms events with algal density 107 cells l 1 3 2 predictive modeling of river algal blooms by gradient boosting machine as mentioned in the methods we were wondering if it was possible to build a predictive model i e gbmp driven by input data from the previous 10 day period therefore we tested two models gbmp and gbmc to see if there was any difference in modeling performance between them if the gbmp model performed well compared to the gbmc model we would have a model with a 10 day lead time which would be valuable for the early warning of river algal blooms overall the performance of gbmp was significantly better than that of gbmc fig 3 a p value 0 001 as per the kruskal wallis test r core team 2018 the median kappa statistic was 0 6 for gbmc and 0 9 for gbmp fig 3a the 50 confidence interval of kappa was much higher for gbmp 0 78 0 95 than that of gbmc 0 43 0 71 noting that kappa values above 0 6 demonstrate substantial strength of agreement landis and koch 1977 viera and garrett 2005 our results showed that 95 of the gbmp models achieved a kappa above 0 64 whereas only 50 of the gbmc models yielded a kappa above 0 6 in addition among the 10 000 model runs 19 5 of the gbmp models demonstrated a complete agreement i e kappa 1 between model predictions and observations compared to 2 7 for the gbmc models fig 3b a kappa value of 1 indicates that the presence and absence of algal blooms were correctly classified by the model the excellent model performance of gbmp was further corroborated by the matric of auroc hart 2015 which was generally higher than 0 85 we further applied the split sample validation to the gbmp model the gbmp model performed excellent kappa 1 during the training process no matter what percentage 50 100 of the data were used for training table s1 however the split sample testing validation of the gbmp model did not show substantial strength of agreement i e kappa 0 6 until over 90 of the data were used for training although all the accuracy values were greater than or equal to 0 85 table s1 3 3 identification of important factors for river algal blooms we evaluated the variable importance denoted by the var imp values between 0 and 100 based on the ensemble simulations of both models gbmc and gbmp that achieved complete agreement kappa 1 we found that water level and its variation were generally more important than flow velocity and nutrient tn and tp concentrations fig 4 during the spring february april of 2003 2014 water temperature was also more important than nutrient concentrations since the concentrations of tn and tp were high and not the limiting factors for algal growth however the ranks of the relative importance of the variables were different between the two models gbmc and gbmp as for the gbmc model the most important factor was the water level in the yangtze river average var imp of yrwl 100 followed by water temperature var imp of wtmp 32 water level var imp of hrwl 29 and water level variation var imp of hrwlcv 26 in the han river fig 4a in the more accurate gbmp model the water level variation in the han river became the most important var imp of phrwlcv 92 followed by the water level in the yangtze river var imp of pyrwl 86 and the water level var imp of phrwl 68 and temperature var imp of pwtmp 52 in the han river fig 4b regarding the gbmp model we found only the water levels phrwl and pyrwl were significantly lower p value 0 05 for the presence than the absence of algal blooms si fig s4 the variation in water level was generally small ranged 0 001 0 08 during the spring and not significantly different between the absence and occurrence of algal blooms si fig s4 and fig s5 for example the 95 ci of phrwlcv ranged 0 002 0 03 and 0 001 0 02 and the 95 ci of pyrwlcv ranged 0 003 0 06 and 0 003 0 05 for the absence and presence of algal blooms respectively the outbreak of algal blooms was also characterized by slightly statistically insignificant higher tn and tp concentrations as well as lower water temperature and flow velocity si fig s4 using the two predictor partial dependence analysis greenwell 2017 we could further quantify the interactions between phrwl and pyrwl and their impacts on the occurrence probability of algal blooms in the lower han river there existed two regions with very low probability 0 05 of algal blooms in the spring fig 5 one region required relatively higher phrwl 19 64 21 06 m and wider range of pyrhl 14 92 18 37 m the other corresponded to lower phrwl 17 51 18 58 m and much narrow range of pyrhl 15 59 16 45 m 4 discussion 4 1 important factors regulating river algal blooms in the han river the occurrence of river algal blooms are attributed to a variety of abiotic and biotic factors such as hydrodynamic conditions water temperature nutrient concentrations light intensity and zooplankton densities ha et al 2003 lee and lee 2018 xia et al 2019 high light intensity and nutrient concentrations are required for accrual of high algal biomass in lakes and rivers stevenson 2009 while light intensity is thought to be a major inducing factor for algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs imteaz and asaeda 2000 frequently varying hydrological conditions in river ecosystem have a great influence on the light climate of the algae yang et al 2012 in addition previous studies have shown that diatoms are better adapted to low light conditions than green algae lionard et al 2005 stevenson 2009 yang et al 2012 therefore the dearth of light intensity data in our study might not have significant effects on the results we acknowledge that biological controls e g zooplankton also play an important role in regulating diatom blooms ha et al 2003 stevenson 2009 however the lack of long term biological measurements has impeded the inclusion of such variables in machine learning based modeling of algal blooms in large rivers recknagel et al 1997 coppola et al 2006 yang et al 2012 lee and lee 2018 based on the available data our analysis of variable importance using the predictive gbmp model quantitatively show that the occurrence of spring algal blooms in the downstream han river was majorly controlled by hydrologic conditions i e water levels in the han river and the yangtze river and water level variation of the han river rather than other factors including water temperature flow velocity and nutrient n and p concentrations variable importance represents the contribution of each predictor variable to the constructed model kuhn et al 2020 different from the eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs likely occurring in summer and autumn with relatively higher temperature river algal blooms usually occur in low temperature seasons i e late winter or early spring yang et al 2012 xia et al 2016 suitable water temperatures for the growth of blue algae green algae and blue green algae are approximately 30 35 c 20 25 c and 15 20 c respectively cheng et al 2019 in contrast diatom blooms in rivers usually require lower temperature and their growth may be favored by the water environment in spring and fall potapova and charles 2007 yin et al 2012 this is supported by our long term analysis that the algal blooms often occurred in the springtime february april in the han river in addition our results show no significant difference p value 0 1 in temperature between the algal bloom and non bloom events although lower temperature was generally found for the presence of algal blooms si fig s4 while excess nutrients are an essential prerequisite for algal blooms previous studies have affirmed that nutrients are not necessary the limiting factor for most of the river algal bloom events mitrovic et al 2007 yang et al 2017a a few studies have confirmed that the concentrations of nutrients e g tn and tp in the han river already satisfied the basic conditions for diatom growth but not the major limiting factors of algal blooms liang et al 2012 yin et al 2012 our data show that the nutrient concentrations tn 1 6 2 6 mg n l 1 tp 0 06 0 30 mg p l 1 in the spring of the han river were far above the eutrophication thresholds tn 0 2 mg n l 1 tp 0 02 mg p l 1 liang et al 2012 moreover zeng et al 2006 concluded that phytoplankton and chl a concentrations in the three gorges dam region had no significant positive correlations with the main nutrient contents similar studies have claimed that nutrients would not be the main limiting factors when tp concentration in the river exceeds 0 03 mg l 1 but other physical factors could exert evident and direct gain effects on river algal blooms hilton et al 2006 sivapragasam et al 2010 our results show that the tp concentrations 0 06 0 30 mg l 1 during the spring in the hr were notably higher than 0 03 mg l 1 however tp concentrations were not significantly different between the absence 95 ci of tp 0 07 0 17 mg l 1 and the presence 95 ci of tp 0 07 0 19 mg l 1 of algal blooms p value 0 18 si fig s4 such insignificant difference was also found for the tn concentrations si fig s4 all these studies and analyses further support our findings that tn and tp concentrations could not be solely used as indicators for river algal blooms in the spring for the han river our analysis indicates that the algae blooms in the lower han river was closely related to the hydrologic conditions in both the yangtze river and the han river which is evident by notably lower water levels during the presence than the absence of algal blooms si fig s4 this means that low water levels in both the han river and the yangtze river in the previous 10 days might be favorable for algal growth moreover the water levels in the yangtze river play a vital role in the occurrence of algal blooms in the han river as the hydrodynamic conditions in the yangtze river would exert significant influence on the stratification and stabilization of the water body and the growth and death of algae in the lower han river in addition we found that water levels pyrwl and phrwl were more useful than flow velocities pyrv and phrv with respect to their effects on algal blooms fig 4b though water velocities were moderately or weakly correlated with water levels in the two rivers si fig s6 recent laboratory and field experiments have shown that hydrologic conditions affected algal absorption and growth kinetics lucas et al 2009 mckiver and neufeld 2009 ji et al 2017 yang et al 2017a for example it was found that steady water level less water flow and lower velocity could reduce water level fluctuation and lengthen the retention of algae in the river thereby influencing algal migration diffusion and accumulation soballe and kimmel 1987 neal et al 2006 in addition changes in water level and flow velocity might reduce the algal reproduction rate and prevent algal blooms in rivers by accelerating pollutant dispersion and degradation chung et al 2008 ji et al 2017 yin et al 2017 our results imply that the effects of water level fluctuation on algal blooms in the han river could be more complicated than expected in actual circumstances the variation in han river water level phrwlcv was the most important factor identified by the gbmp model which means that the overall errors in the gbm decision tree has been greatly reduced when split by phrwlcv however phrwlcv was not significantly different between the presence and absence of algae si fig s4 this implies that the river algal blooms in the han river could not be merely regulated by water level fluctuation the importance of phrwlcv in this study might represent the interaction between water level variation and other hydrodynamic characteristics including the turbulent eddy viscosity the buoyancy frequency and the mixing depth ji et al 2017 these complex hydrodynamic factors altogether could result in effective or ineffective water circulation patterns in preventing algal blooms in rivers ji et al 2017 nevertheless water levels and their variation are critical in developing the predictive gbmp model not to mention they are much easier to measure compared to the aforementioned hydrodynamic variables 4 2 prediction of river algal blooms by machine learning methods given the multitude interplay and complexity of diverse biotic and abiotic factors in regulating algal blooms developing a robust model for providing accurate prediction capability can be a daunting challenge coppola et al 2006 machine learning methods alternative to linear nonlinear regression and process based models have been widely used in ecological and environmental modeling studies de ath and fabricius 2000 xiao et al 2017 friedel et al 2020 data driven statistical or machine learning models are feasible approaches for simulating algal blooms in complex river environment due to their relatively lower data requirement compare to mechanistically process based models park et al 2015 lee and lee 2018 shen et al 2019 machine learning models may work in a case where statistical models fail due to little or weak correlations between response and explanatory variables for example in this study the algal densities were not correlated with any explanatory variables except for a low correlation coefficient 0 22 with pwtmp previous 10 day water temperature si fig s6 however we successfully built a predictive gbm model i e gbmp to investigate algal blooms in the han river by converting the problem to a binary presence or absence of algal bloom classification issue which suggests machine learning based model could be an effective early warning tool to predict the outbreak of algal blooms in large rivers successful model validation could increase confidence in model predictions if enough data are available we can split the data into two subsets one for model training calibration and the other for testing validation however it may be insufficient to build a gbm model using only a subset of the data natekin and knoll 2013 because there were only 12 algal bloom events out of the 102 periods in this study our split sample validation results suggest using the full dataset to train the gbm model with the k fold cross validation method de ath and fabricius 2000 such k fold cross validation is one of the best approaches to build a less biased model based on limited available data kuhn et al 2020 the gbm model developed here offers a straightforward and quantitative approach to developing an initial appraisal of how important potentially manageable e g water levels versus intractable e g nutrient loads and non manageable e g water temperature system features are by applying the machine learning based method we have the capability to identify important driving factors that could not be discerned by traditional approaches such as correlation or regression analyses more importantly we found that better model performance could be achieved when the previous rather than the current 10 day data were used as explanatory variables for the modeling of river algal blooms compared to the gbmc model without a lead time the gbmp model can be potentially used for early warning detection of the occurrence of algal blooms using 10 day time lag input data this 10 day period represents the natural time lags between river system conditions and algal population responses in the han river xia et al 2016 cheng et al 2019 our predictive gbmp model indicates that the trajectory of the algal population over a 10 day period can be forecasted on the basis of real time measurements coppola et al 2006 to manage and prevent severe occurrences it is of great importance to make reliable early warning predictions of algal blooms by accounting for key environmental variables park et al 2015 the lack of understanding of the complex physicochemical biological processes and limited data availability hinder the development and application of process based modeling particularly the early warning of algal blooms park et al 2015 lee and lee 2018 one promising alternative approach could be the data driven machine learning methodology such as the gbm model though it is sensitive to extreme values and noises as well as there is currently no fast and efficient base leaner to capture interactions natekin and knoll 2013 therefore we strongly advocate the use of the gbmp model due to its higher accuracy and practical predictability compared to the gbmc model in addition to the identification of key driving factors we intend to predict the chance of the outbreak of river algal blooms instead of exact algal densities in the next 10 day period by this means our gbmp model is useful as an early warning decision support system for the risk management of river algae blooms 4 3 implications for mitigation and prevention of river algal blooms algal blooms are generally prone to occur in relatively static freshwaters e g lakes and reservoirs but they also happen in large rivers e g the han river in recent decades kim et al 2014 oliver et al 2014 xia et al 2016 schmale et al 2019 although much is yet to be understood about algal blooms in rivers compared to lakes different modeling approaches have been developed to analyze the interactions between algae and their environment in rivers based on large scale field observations stevenson 2009 our machine learning based prediction of algal blooms using antecedent observations might provide possible solutions to the mitigation and prevention of river algal blooms wuhan city is located in the outlet of the han river flowing into the yangtze river it is challenging to reduce the pollution loads to the han river in the near future due to large populations and rapid economic development the regulation of water level in rivers is often the main countermeasure for flood control drought relief water supply and improvement of water environment yang et al 2017a xia et al 2019 hydrological regulation is feasible and efficient to implement to reduce the risk of river algal blooms jeong et al 2007 mitrovic et al 2007 yang et al 2012 xin et al 2020 therefore there is an urgent need for integrated water management by the water conservancy and environmental protection departments generally the water level in a section of a river channel is closely related to flow velocity and streamflow rate the water level phrwl at the hanchuan station in the lower han river reflects the comprehensive hydrologic conditions of the han river similarly the water level pyrwl at the hankou station near the outlet of the han river represents the comprehensive hydrologic conditions of the yangtze river based on our machine learning model we need to coordinate the water levels in the two rivers the han river and the yangtze river for an effective control of algal blooms in the han river fig 5 these water level ranges may provide a reference for water level regulation in the han river and the yangtze river to reduce the risk of algae blooms though large uncertainty remains due to interactive effects among multiple factors including water levels water temperature and nutrient availability on the basis of our findings it appears critical to further strengthen the monitoring of pollution discharges and adopt comprehensive regulation of water levels in the han river hanchuan station and the yangtze river hankou station during the dry season by making use of water conservancy measures zhou et al 2020 such as the danjiangkou reservoir in the middle upstream han river the three gorges reservoir in the mainstream yangtze river and the yangtze han river water diversion yhwd project liu et al 2016 by quantifying the critical importance of hydrological conditions for river algal blooms our results highlight the necessity of implementing water hydropower joint operation and predictive early warning to reduce the risk of river algal blooms influenced by mega water transfer projects 5 conclusions to improve the security of freshwater resources for the protection of public health it is vital to guide policy decision by making predictions of river algal blooms schmale et al 2019 here we used the gbm methods to investigate the algal blooms during a decade 2003 2014 in the han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river of china we found that better model performance could be achieved when the previous rather than the current 10 day data were used as explanatory variables for the modeling of river algal blooms therefore we strongly suggest using the gbmp model with a 10 day lead time due to its higher accuracy and practical predictability compared to the gbmc model in addition our analysis show that tn and tp concentrations could not be solely used as indicators for river algal blooms whereas the occurrence of spring algal blooms in the downstream han river was majorly controlled by hydrologic conditions i e water levels in the han river and the yangtze river and water level variation of the han river we highlight the necessity to coordinate the water levels in the two rivers for an effective control of algal blooms in the han river which could not be merely regulated by water level fluctuation in the han river our study takes an important step forward to developing robust predictive models for river algal blooms by accounting for multiple influencing factors from multiple data sources this study was limited by the available data from the long term monitoring data program opportunities exist to expand and improve this analysis by incorporating additional environmental and biological variables e g light intensity and macrophyte phytoplankton zooplankton community data nelson et al 2018 in addition algal blooms may become more frequent and intense in many rivers worldwide that are subject to both eutrophication and hydrological modification with increased pollution and the construction of water conservancy projects ha et al 2003 mitrovic et al 2007 insights gained from this study can be also used to improve the

17584,river algal blooms have become a challenging environmental problem worldwide due to strong interference of human activities and megaprojects e g big dams and large scale water transfer projects previous studies on algal blooms were mainly focused on relatively static water bodies i e lakes and reservoirs but less on the large rivers as the largest tributary of the yangtze river of china and the main freshwater source of the south to north water diversion project snwdp the han river has experienced frequent algal blooms in recent decades here we investigated the algal blooms during a decade 2003 2014 in the han river by two gradient boosting machine gbm models with k fold cross validation which used explanatory variables from current 10 day gbmc model or previous 10 day period gbmp model our results advocate the use of gbmp due to its higher accuracy median kappa 0 9 and practical predictability using antecedent observations compared to gbmc we also revealed that the algal blooms in the han river were significantly modulated by antecedent water levels in the han river and the yangtze river and water level variation in the han river whereas the nutrient concentrations in the han river were usually above thresholds and not limiting algal blooms this machine learning based study potentially provides scientific guidance for preemptive warning and risk management of river algal blooms through comprehensive regulation of water levels during the dry season by making use of water conservancy measures in large rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

environmental problem in many large rivers worldwide ha et al 2003 jeong et al 2007 mitrovic et al 2007 yang et al 2012 liu et al 2016 xia et al 2016 yang et al 2017a algal blooms in rivers due to excessive nutrient enrichment were regulated by hydrological regimes influenced by intensified human activities and climate change zhu et al 2008 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 yin et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a compared to the eutrophication in relatively static water bodies e g lakes and reservoirs large river algal blooms could cause more serious consequences to the aquatic ecosystem and human health at a larger scale along the rivers with a length of over hundreds of kilometers reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 zhang et al 2017 for instance the 1991 darling river cyanobacterial bloom affected almost 1000 km of the barwon darling river of australia bowling and baker 1996 the han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river of china has experienced more than 10 consecutive algal blooms defined by algal density 107 cells l 1 since 1992 xia et al 2001 zhang et al 2017 the algal bloom occurring in the middle lower han river of china in 2008 spanned more than 400 km which influenced the drinking water of more than twenty thousand people and resulted in the shutdown of many waterworks xia et al 2012 the causal analysis and prediction of algal blooms in large hydrologically regulated rivers has become a major concern as the algal blooms in these rivers not only lead to deteriorating water quality and aquatic ecosystems but also restrict the socioeconomic development and threaten the public health previous studies on algal blooms were mainly focused on relatively static water bodies i e lakes and reservoirs but less on the large rivers schmale et al 2019 revealing the causes of river algal blooms is still challenging due to complex hydrological conditions as well as interactions between multiple environmental factors in large river systems xia et al 2019 it is just not excess nutrients and nutrient uptake that drive algal blooms in complicated river ecosystems mischke et al 2011 yin et al 2012 oliver et al 2014 the diffusion and degradation processes of pollutants in rivers are affected by the horizontal and vertical mixing of water mac donagh et al 2008 liu et al 2012 xia et al 2012 evtimova et al 2014 experimental studies have showed that hydrodynamic condition i e fluctuation and agitation of water usually have significant effects on the migration diffusion growth and accumulation of algae chung et al 2008 lucas et al 2009 whitehead et al 2015 yang et al 2017a changes in hydrological conditions may lead to altered light intensities and uneven distribution of nutrients in water bodies resulting in the changes in the absorption dynamics of algae nutrients thereby affecting algae growth mckiver and neufeld 2009 istvánovics and honti 2012 relatively static hydrological conditions will also increase the transparency of water bodies which is beneficial to the growth of algae mitrovic et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 lots of studies have indicated that the algal growth in rivers is sensitive to changes in hydrological conditions particularly the changes in water levels yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 though hydrological conditions play an important role in triggering algal blooms in riverine ecosystems ferris and lehman 2007 no persuasive conclusions have been drawn based on traditional statistical or ecological modeling analysis long et al 2011 kim et al 2014 xia et al 2016 here we compile decade long multi source field observations and attempt to identify the key driving factors for the occurrence of river algal blooms in the han river using a machine learning method i e the gradient boosting machine gbm gbms are a family of powerful machine learning techniques that have proven successful in a wide range of domains such as pattern cognition schütz et al 2019 text classification natekin and knoll 2013 motion detection bouwman et al 2020 and ecological and environmental studies de ath and fabricius 2000 the learning procedure in gbms provide a more accurate estimate of the response variable by consecutively error fitting natekin and knoll 2013 algal blooms in the han river of china were dominated by excessive diatom cyclotella sp growth which led to deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and threatened drinking water security xia et al 2019 xin et al 2020 as the nutrient total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations in the downstream han river in spring were usually far above the eutrophication thresholds i e tn 0 2 mg n l 1 tp 0 02 mg p l 1 as per china s national water quality standard gb3838 2002 liang et al 2012 we hypothesized that the algal blooms in the mid downstream han river were primarily regulated by hydrologic conditions in the han river and the yangtze river we developed two gbm models i e gbmc and gbmp using measurements of explanatory variables tn and tp concentrations water temperature and hydrologic variables from current and previous 10 day period respectively we expect to build a predictive model i e the gbmp model using antecedent 10 day period data for the algal blooms in the han river which could be of practical significance for the prevention and control of algal blooms in large rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the han river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river of china fig 1 the length of the main river is about 1577 km and its total drainage area covers 168 400 km2 the han river basin 30 34 n and 106 114 e has a subtropical monsoon climate which has distinct seasons and abundant rainfall the average annual temperature is about 15 c and the average annual precipitation ranges from 700 to 1300 mm cheng et al 2019 xin et al 2020 the danjiangkou reservoir located in the upper middle han river is the water source for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp xia et al 2016 flowing through the most economically developed region in hubei province the middle lower han river has a length of about 652 km from the danjiangkou reservoir to the confluence of the han river and the yangtze river xia et al 2012 cheng et al 2019 xin et al 2020 the width of the han river ranges about 600 1200 m in the middle stream and 200 300 m in the downstream with average water depths of 6 12 m xu 1996 1997 xu et al 2002 there are about 79 fish species in the middle lower han river and the largest group is cyprinidae followed by anguidae yang et al 2020 major aquatic macrophytes are p perfoliatus p malaianus vallisneria natans salvinia natans a philoxeroides and artemisia selengensis yang et al 2017b the causes of algal blooms in the downstream han river are very complicated since it is impacted by the water environment in the han river regulated by water release from the upstream danjiangkou reservoir as well as closely related to the hydrological regime backwater zone in the yangtze river fig 1 in this study we focus on the most serious algal blooms at the wuhan section in the downstream portion of the han river from year 2003 2014 we used the hydrological data from the hanchuan station and the hankou station to represent the hydrological conditions in the han river and the yangtze river respectively fig 1 hydrological data involved in this study include daily water levels flow velocities and streamflow rates in addition 10 day water quality data i e tn and tp concentrations and algae data algae density l 1 chlorophyll a μg l 1 at three sections baihezui qinduankou and zongguan see fig 1 were provided by the yangtze river basin ecological and environmental supervision authority we used the water quality and algae data averaged across these three sections for modeling 2 2 explanatory variables and response variable for the modeling based on available data in the han river and the yangtze river we selected three categories of representative explanatory variables for the gbm modeling i hydrologic variables in the han river hr and the yangtze river yr flow velocity hrv and yrv with units of m s 1 streamflow discharge hrq and yrq m3 s 1 water level hrwl and yrwl m and coefficient of variation for water level hrwlcv and yrwlcv unitless ii water temperature wtmp c in the han river and iii water quality in the han river tn mg n l 1 and tp mg p l 1 we excluded the streamflow discharges hrq and yrq m3 s 1 from explanatory variables as they were highly correlated with water levels correlation coefficient ρ 0 78 for hr and 0 91 for yr si fig s1 this is understandable as streamflow discharge is usually estimated by the stage discharge relation mansanarez et al 2019 however we kept both flow velocities hrv and yrv and water levels hrwl and yrwl in the gbm modeling because they represented water mobility and quantity respectively although these two variables were moderately correlated ρ 0 7 si fig s1 as algal blooms generally lasted around 10 days in the han river xia et al 2016 cheng et al 2019 we divided each month into three periods i e the early 10 day period the middle 10 day period and the rest days as the third late period previous studies have suggested using 107 cells l 1 as the indicator of algal blooms in the han river lu et al 2000 dou et al 2002 xia et al 2016 cheng et al 2019 in this study we adopted the same threshold to determine the outbreak of algal blooms in the han river i e the presence and absence of blooms is defined by algal density 107 cells l 1 and 107 cells l 1 respectively in summary the response variable is binary i e the presence or absence of algal blooms we attempted to explore the dependence of algal blooms on nine explanatory variables by the gbm modeling hrv and yrv hrwl and yrwl hrwlcv and yrwlcv wtmp tn and tp 2 3 gradient boosting machine modeling the gbm is a powerful machine learning technique to train decision trees in a gradual additive and sequential manner natekin and knoll 2013 the final gbm model is the weighted sum of the predictions generated by the previous tree models where the classification process is repeated so that subsequent trees attempt to classify observed data that have not been well classified by the previous trees the gbm algorithm has been used to solve a variety of practical applications including the binary classification problem de ath and fabricius 2000 natekin and knoll 2013 which is the case for this study we examined two gbm models using the nine explanatory variables from current or previous period we named these two models as gbmc and gbmp respectively the gbm modeling was conducted using the gbm method with the k fold cross validation in the r package caret kuhn et al 2020 to build a predictive model we need to implement model calibration and validation model validation can be done using data that are not used in model training i e split sample validation or by the k fold cross validation approach de ath and fabricius 2000 cross validation also helps to avoid overfitting of the model natekin and knoll 2013 we adopted both strategies to validate our gbm models where the k fold cross validation was embedded in the split data validation procedure first we used the full datasets during the study period to train the gbmc and gbmp model respectively with the k fold cross validation method where the training dataset was further partitioned into k i e k 10 in this study subsets and each subset was held out while the model was trained on all other subsets de ath and fabricius 2000 we trained the models multiple times i e 10 000 times to assess the uncertainty in model performance and outputs nelson et al 2018 second regarding the model gbmc or gbmp performed better in the first step we further implemented the split sample validation i e splitting the full dataset into two subsets one for model training and the other for testing natekin and knoll 2013 to examine the effects of data partitioning on model performance we used six different percentages 50 100 with a 10 interval to partition the training and testing subsets amid the model training the k fold cross validation was also used 2 4 relative importance of explanatory variables relative importance of each explanatory variable was estimated with the use of varimp function in the caret package kuhn et al 2020 variable importance was determined by calculating the relative influence of each variable whether that variable was selected to split on during the tree building process and how much the squared error over all trees improved decreased as a result in each gbm model run the variable importance scores were scaled to be between 0 least important and 100 most important we summarized the variable importance scores from ensemble i e 10 000 model runs for gbmc and gbmp respectively the quantitative effects of important predictors on the occurrence of algal blooms were analyzed by the r package pdp greenwell 2017 which enables to graphically examine the dependence of the response variable on subsets of the explanatory variables specifically we used the two predictor partial dependence analysis greenwell 2017 to quantify the interactions between important variables and their impacts on the occurrence probability of algal blooms in the han river we only show the partial dependence plot within the ranges of the training data to avoid extrapolation of such relationship in regions outside the area of the training data greenwell 2017 2 5 statistics model performance was evaluated by accuracy cohen s kappa statistic and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auroc the accuracy criterion evaluates the percentage of correctly classified instances out of all instances natekin and knoll 2013 the kappa statistic quantitatively measures the magnitude of agreement on the presence or absence of algal blooms between model simulations predictions and observations where kappa observed accuracy expected accuracy 1 expected accuracy viera and garrett 2005 kappa values above 0 6 demonstrate substantial strength of agreement landis and koch 1977 viera and garrett 2005 a kappa value of 1 indicates a complete agreement the auroc is another useful metric to show the trade off between true positive rate and false positive rate across different decision thresholds schütz et al 2019 an auroc of 1 represents a complete agreement and auroc 0 8 is considered to be excellent hart 2015 we used the non parametric kruskal wallis kw method giraudoux 2013 to test the significance of difference in each of the nine explanatory variables between the presence and absence of algal blooms at a significance level of 0 05 we used the spearman correlation analysis sca to quantify the degree of correlation between two variables as sca does not require normally distributed variables asuero et al 2007 the strength of correlation is defined as asuero et al 2007 i high if the absolute value of the correlation coefficient ρ i e ρ 0 7 and p value 0 05 ii moderate if 0 5 ρ 0 7 and p value 0 05 iii low or weak if 0 3 ρ 0 5 and p value 0 05 iv marginal if 0 3 ρ 0 5 and 0 05 p value 0 1 and v little or uncorrelated if 0 ρ 0 3 or p value 0 1 3 results 3 1 variation of algae densities in the downstream han river based on the algal cell densities measured at three sections si fig s2 of the downstream han river during 2003 2014 there were severe algal blooms in four consecutive years i e 2008 2011 fig 2 a the algae densities were highly correlated with the concentrations of chlorophyll a chl a correlation coefficient 0 73 see si fig s3 the algal blooms generally occurred between february and april of these years si fig s2 with the mean algae density ranging from 1 0 5 1 107 cells l 1 in particular the algal blooms in 2008 had a peak density of 5 3 107 cells l 1 compared to the threshold of 1 107 cells l 1 in the wuhan section with a peak concentration of chl a of 30 93 μg l 1 which was the most serious algal bloom event in the lower han river during the 12 year study period although the highest algal densities 0 6 107 cells l 1 in 2004 2005 and 2012 2013 were also close to the threshold of algal blooms 107 cells l 1 yin et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 the severity was quite different from that in 2008 2011 the maximum algal densities in the other three years 2006 2007 and 2015 were lower than 0 5 107 cells l 1 fig 2a the algal blooms mostly occurred from middle february m feb to middle march m mar through multi year analysis fig 2b the algal densities usually reached the highest in middle february whereas the average algae densities in late february were similar to that in middle march in summary there were 102 sets periods of data only 3 period data available in the first year 2003 for modeling among which there were 12 algal blooms events with algal density 107 cells l 1 3 2 predictive modeling of river algal blooms by gradient boosting machine as mentioned in the methods we were wondering if it was possible to build a predictive model i e gbmp driven by input data from the previous 10 day period therefore we tested two models gbmp and gbmc to see if there was any difference in modeling performance between them if the gbmp model performed well compared to the gbmc model we would have a model with a 10 day lead time which would be valuable for the early warning of river algal blooms overall the performance of gbmp was significantly better than that of gbmc fig 3 a p value 0 001 as per the kruskal wallis test r core team 2018 the median kappa statistic was 0 6 for gbmc and 0 9 for gbmp fig 3a the 50 confidence interval of kappa was much higher for gbmp 0 78 0 95 than that of gbmc 0 43 0 71 noting that kappa values above 0 6 demonstrate substantial strength of agreement landis and koch 1977 viera and garrett 2005 our results showed that 95 of the gbmp models achieved a kappa above 0 64 whereas only 50 of the gbmc models yielded a kappa above 0 6 in addition among the 10 000 model runs 19 5 of the gbmp models demonstrated a complete agreement i e kappa 1 between model predictions and observations compared to 2 7 for the gbmc models fig 3b a kappa value of 1 indicates that the presence and absence of algal blooms were correctly classified by the model the excellent model performance of gbmp was further corroborated by the matric of auroc hart 2015 which was generally higher than 0 85 we further applied the split sample validation to the gbmp model the gbmp model performed excellent kappa 1 during the training process no matter what percentage 50 100 of the data were used for training table s1 however the split sample testing validation of the gbmp model did not show substantial strength of agreement i e kappa 0 6 until over 90 of the data were used for training although all the accuracy values were greater than or equal to 0 85 table s1 3 3 identification of important factors for river algal blooms we evaluated the variable importance denoted by the var imp values between 0 and 100 based on the ensemble simulations of both models gbmc and gbmp that achieved complete agreement kappa 1 we found that water level and its variation were generally more important than flow velocity and nutrient tn and tp concentrations fig 4 during the spring february april of 2003 2014 water temperature was also more important than nutrient concentrations since the concentrations of tn and tp were high and not the limiting factors for algal growth however the ranks of the relative importance of the variables were different between the two models gbmc and gbmp as for the gbmc model the most important factor was the water level in the yangtze river average var imp of yrwl 100 followed by water temperature var imp of wtmp 32 water level var imp of hrwl 29 and water level variation var imp of hrwlcv 26 in the han river fig 4a in the more accurate gbmp model the water level variation in the han river became the most important var imp of phrwlcv 92 followed by the water level in the yangtze river var imp of pyrwl 86 and the water level var imp of phrwl 68 and temperature var imp of pwtmp 52 in the han river fig 4b regarding the gbmp model we found only the water levels phrwl and pyrwl were significantly lower p value 0 05 for the presence than the absence of algal blooms si fig s4 the variation in water level was generally small ranged 0 001 0 08 during the spring and not significantly different between the absence and occurrence of algal blooms si fig s4 and fig s5 for example the 95 ci of phrwlcv ranged 0 002 0 03 and 0 001 0 02 and the 95 ci of pyrwlcv ranged 0 003 0 06 and 0 003 0 05 for the absence and presence of algal blooms respectively the outbreak of algal blooms was also characterized by slightly statistically insignificant higher tn and tp concentrations as well as lower water temperature and flow velocity si fig s4 using the two predictor partial dependence analysis greenwell 2017 we could further quantify the interactions between phrwl and pyrwl and their impacts on the occurrence probability of algal blooms in the lower han river there existed two regions with very low probability 0 05 of algal blooms in the spring fig 5 one region required relatively higher phrwl 19 64 21 06 m and wider range of pyrhl 14 92 18 37 m the other corresponded to lower phrwl 17 51 18 58 m and much narrow range of pyrhl 15 59 16 45 m 4 discussion 4 1 important factors regulating river algal blooms in the han river the occurrence of river algal blooms are attributed to a variety of abiotic and biotic factors such as hydrodynamic conditions water temperature nutrient concentrations light intensity and zooplankton densities ha et al 2003 lee and lee 2018 xia et al 2019 high light intensity and nutrient concentrations are required for accrual of high algal biomass in lakes and rivers stevenson 2009 while light intensity is thought to be a major inducing factor for algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs imteaz and asaeda 2000 frequently varying hydrological conditions in river ecosystem have a great influence on the light climate of the algae yang et al 2012 in addition previous studies have shown that diatoms are better adapted to low light conditions than green algae lionard et al 2005 stevenson 2009 yang et al 2012 therefore the dearth of light intensity data in our study might not have significant effects on the results we acknowledge that biological controls e g zooplankton also play an important role in regulating diatom blooms ha et al 2003 stevenson 2009 however the lack of long term biological measurements has impeded the inclusion of such variables in machine learning based modeling of algal blooms in large rivers recknagel et al 1997 coppola et al 2006 yang et al 2012 lee and lee 2018 based on the available data our analysis of variable importance using the predictive gbmp model quantitatively show that the occurrence of spring algal blooms in the downstream han river was majorly controlled by hydrologic conditions i e water levels in the han river and the yangtze river and water level variation of the han river rather than other factors including water temperature flow velocity and nutrient n and p concentrations variable importance represents the contribution of each predictor variable to the constructed model kuhn et al 2020 different from the eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs likely occurring in summer and autumn with relatively higher temperature river algal blooms usually occur in low temperature seasons i e late winter or early spring yang et al 2012 xia et al 2016 suitable water temperatures for the growth of blue algae green algae and blue green algae are approximately 30 35 c 20 25 c and 15 20 c respectively cheng et al 2019 in contrast diatom blooms in rivers usually require lower temperature and their growth may be favored by the water environment in spring and fall potapova and charles 2007 yin et al 2012 this is supported by our long term analysis that the algal blooms often occurred in the springtime february april in the han river in addition our results show no significant difference p value 0 1 in temperature between the algal bloom and non bloom events although lower temperature was generally found for the presence of algal blooms si fig s4 while excess nutrients are an essential prerequisite for algal blooms previous studies have affirmed that nutrients are not necessary the limiting factor for most of the river algal bloom events mitrovic et al 2007 yang et al 2017a a few studies have confirmed that the concentrations of nutrients e g tn and tp in the han river already satisfied the basic conditions for diatom growth but not the major limiting factors of algal blooms liang et al 2012 yin et al 2012 our data show that the nutrient concentrations tn 1 6 2 6 mg n l 1 tp 0 06 0 30 mg p l 1 in the spring of the han river were far above the eutrophication thresholds tn 0 2 mg n l 1 tp 0 02 mg p l 1 liang et al 2012 moreover zeng et al 2006 concluded that phytoplankton and chl a concentrations in the three gorges dam region had no significant positive correlations with the main nutrient contents similar studies have claimed that nutrients would not be the main limiting factors when tp concentration in the river exceeds 0 03 mg l 1 but other physical factors could exert evident and direct gain effects on river algal blooms hilton et al 2006 sivapragasam et al 2010 our results show that the tp concentrations 0 06 0 30 mg l 1 during the spring in the hr were notably higher than 0 03 mg l 1 however tp concentrations were not significantly different between the absence 95 ci of tp 0 07 0 17 mg l 1 and the presence 95 ci of tp 0 07 0 19 mg l 1 of algal blooms p value 0 18 si fig s4 such insignificant difference was also found for the tn concentrations si fig s4 all these studies and analyses further support our findings that tn and tp concentrations could not be solely used as indicators for river algal blooms in the spring for the han river our analysis indicates that the algae blooms in the lower han river was closely related to the hydrologic conditions in both the yangtze river and the han river which is evident by notably lower water levels during the presence than the absence of algal blooms si fig s4 this means that low water levels in both the han river and the yangtze river in the previous 10 days might be favorable for algal growth moreover the water levels in the yangtze river play a vital role in the occurrence of algal blooms in the han river as the hydrodynamic conditions in the yangtze river would exert significant influence on the stratification and stabilization of the water body and the growth and death of algae in the lower han river in addition we found that water levels pyrwl and phrwl were more useful than flow velocities pyrv and phrv with respect to their effects on algal blooms fig 4b though water velocities were moderately or weakly correlated with water levels in the two rivers si fig s6 recent laboratory and field experiments have shown that hydrologic conditions affected algal absorption and growth kinetics lucas et al 2009 mckiver and neufeld 2009 ji et al 2017 yang et al 2017a for example it was found that steady water level less water flow and lower velocity could reduce water level fluctuation and lengthen the retention of algae in the river thereby influencing algal migration diffusion and accumulation soballe and kimmel 1987 neal et al 2006 in addition changes in water level and flow velocity might reduce the algal reproduction rate and prevent algal blooms in rivers by accelerating pollutant dispersion and degradation chung et al 2008 ji et al 2017 yin et al 2017 our results imply that the effects of water level fluctuation on algal blooms in the han river could be more complicated than expected in actual circumstances the variation in han river water level phrwlcv was the most important factor identified by the gbmp model which means that the overall errors in the gbm decision tree has been greatly reduced when split by phrwlcv however phrwlcv was not significantly different between the presence and absence of algae si fig s4 this implies that the river algal blooms in the han river could not be merely regulated by water level fluctuation the importance of phrwlcv in this study might represent the interaction between water level variation and other hydrodynamic characteristics including the turbulent eddy viscosity the buoyancy frequency and the mixing depth ji et al 2017 these complex hydrodynamic factors altogether could result in effective or ineffective water circulation patterns in preventing algal blooms in rivers ji et al 2017 nevertheless water levels and their variation are critical in developing the predictive gbmp model not to mention they are much easier to measure compared to the aforementioned hydrodynamic variables 4 2 prediction of river algal blooms by machine learning methods given the multitude interplay and complexity of diverse biotic and abiotic factors in regulating algal blooms developing a robust model for providing accurate prediction capability can be a daunting challenge coppola et al 2006 machine learning methods alternative to linear nonlinear regression and process based models have been widely used in ecological and environmental modeling studies de ath and fabricius 2000 xiao et al 2017 friedel et al 2020 data driven statistical or machine learning models are feasible approaches for simulating algal blooms in complex river environment due to their relatively lower data requirement compare to mechanistically process based models park et al 2015 lee and lee 2018 shen et al 2019 machine learning models may work in a case where statistical models fail due to little or weak correlations between response and explanatory variables for example in this study the algal densities were not correlated with any explanatory variables except for a low correlation coefficient 0 22 with pwtmp previous 10 day water temperature si fig s6 however we successfully built a predictive gbm model i e gbmp to investigate algal blooms in the han river by converting the problem to a binary presence or absence of algal bloom classification issue which suggests machine learning based model could be an effective early warning tool to predict the outbreak of algal blooms in large rivers successful model validation could increase confidence in model predictions if enough data are available we can split the data into two subsets one for model training calibration and the other for testing validation however it may be insufficient to build a gbm model using only a subset of the data natekin and knoll 2013 because there were only 12 algal bloom events out of the 102 periods in this study our split sample validation results suggest using the full dataset to train the gbm model with the k fold cross validation method de ath and fabricius 2000 such k fold cross validation is one of the best approaches to build a less biased model based on limited available data kuhn et al 2020 the gbm model developed here offers a straightforward and quantitative approach to developing an initial appraisal of how important potentially manageable e g water levels versus intractable e g nutrient loads and non manageable e g water temperature system features are by applying the machine learning based method we have the capability to identify important driving factors that could not be discerned by traditional approaches such as correlation or regression analyses more importantly we found that better model performance could be achieved when the previous rather than the current 10 day data were used as explanatory variables for the modeling of river algal blooms compared to the gbmc model without a lead time the gbmp model can be potentially used for early warning detection of the occurrence of algal blooms using 10 day time lag input data this 10 day period represents the natural time lags between river system conditions and algal population responses in the han river xia et al 2016 cheng et al 2019 our predictive gbmp model indicates that the trajectory of the algal population over a 10 day period can be forecasted on the basis of real time measurements coppola et al 2006 to manage and prevent severe occurrences it is of great importance to make reliable early warning predictions of algal blooms by accounting for key environmental variables park et al 2015 the lack of understanding of the complex physicochemical biological processes and limited data availability hinder the development and application of process based modeling particularly the early warning of algal blooms park et al 2015 lee and lee 2018 one promising alternative approach could be the data driven machine learning methodology such as the gbm model though it is sensitive to extreme values and noises as well as there is currently no fast and efficient base leaner to capture interactions natekin and knoll 2013 therefore we strongly advocate the use of the gbmp model due to its higher accuracy and practical predictability compared to the gbmc model in addition to the identification of key driving factors we intend to predict the chance of the outbreak of river algal blooms instead of exact algal densities in the next 10 day period by this means our gbmp model is useful as an early warning decision support system for the risk management of river algae blooms 4 3 implications for mitigation and prevention of river algal blooms algal blooms are generally prone to occur in relatively static freshwaters e g lakes and reservoirs but they also happen in large rivers e g the han river in recent decades kim et al 2014 oliver et al 2014 xia et al 2016 schmale et al 2019 although much is yet to be understood about algal blooms in rivers compared to lakes different modeling approaches have been developed to analyze the interactions between algae and their environment in rivers based on large scale field observations stevenson 2009 our machine learning based prediction of algal blooms using antecedent observations might provide possible solutions to the mitigation and prevention of river algal blooms wuhan city is located in the outlet of the han river flowing into the yangtze river it is challenging to reduce the pollution loads to the han river in the near future due to large populations and rapid economic development the regulation of water level in rivers is often the main countermeasure for flood control drought relief water supply and improvement of water environment yang et al 2017a xia et al 2019 hydrological regulation is feasible and efficient to implement to reduce the risk of river algal blooms jeong et al 2007 mitrovic et al 2007 yang et al 2012 xin et al 2020 therefore there is an urgent need for integrated water management by the water conservancy and environmental protection departments generally the water level in a section of a river channel is closely related to flow velocity and streamflow rate the water level phrwl at the hanchuan station in the lower han river reflects the comprehensive hydrologic conditions of the han river similarly the water level pyrwl at the hankou station near the outlet of the han river represents the comprehensive hydrologic conditions of the yangtze river based on our machine learning model we need to coordinate the water levels in the two rivers the han river and the yangtze river for an effective control of algal blooms in the han river fig 5 these water level ranges may provide a reference for water level regulation in the han river and the yangtze river to reduce the risk of algae blooms though large uncertainty remains due to interactive effects among multiple factors including water levels water temperature and nutrient availability on the basis of our findings it appears critical to further strengthen the monitoring of pollution discharges and adopt comprehensive regulation of water levels in the han river hanchuan station and the yangtze river hankou station during the dry season by making use of water conservancy measures zhou et al 2020 such as the danjiangkou reservoir in the middle upstream han river the three gorges reservoir in the mainstream yangtze river and the yangtze han river water diversion yhwd project liu et al 2016 by quantifying the critical importance of hydrological conditions for river algal blooms our results highlight the necessity of implementing water hydropower joint operation and predictive early warning to reduce the risk of river algal blooms influenced by mega water transfer projects 5 conclusions to improve the security of freshwater resources for the protection of public health it is vital to guide policy decision by making predictions of river algal blooms schmale et al 2019 here we used the gbm methods to investigate the algal blooms during a decade 2003 2014 in the han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river of china we found that better model performance could be achieved when the previous rather than the current 10 day data were used as explanatory variables for the modeling of river algal blooms therefore we strongly suggest using the gbmp model with a 10 day lead time due to its higher accuracy and practical predictability compared to the gbmc model in addition our analysis show that tn and tp concentrations could not be solely used as indicators for river algal blooms whereas the occurrence of spring algal blooms in the downstream han river was majorly controlled by hydrologic conditions i e water levels in the han river and the yangtze river and water level variation of the han river we highlight the necessity to coordinate the water levels in the two rivers for an effective control of algal blooms in the han river which could not be merely regulated by water level fluctuation in the han river our study takes an important step forward to developing robust predictive models for river algal blooms by accounting for multiple influencing factors from multiple data sources this study was limited by the available data from the long term monitoring data program opportunities exist to expand and improve this analysis by incorporating additional environmental and biological variables e g light intensity and macrophyte phytoplankton zooplankton community data nelson et al 2018 in addition algal blooms may become more frequent and intense in many rivers worldwide that are subject to both eutrophication and hydrological modification with increased pollution and the construction of water conservancy projects ha et al 2003 mitrovic et al 2007 insights gained from this study can be also used to improve the
