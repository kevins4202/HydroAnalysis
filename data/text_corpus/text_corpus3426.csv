17130,auto generative high pressure digestion ahpd and hydrogen injecting digestion hid have been introduced to directly produce high ch4 content biogas from anaerobic digester however each approach has its own technical difficulties ph changes and practical issues high cost of h2 to obtain 90 ch4 containing biogas particularly from the high strength waste like food waste fw to overcome this problem in this study ahpd and hid were integrated which can offset each drawback but maximize its benefit substrate concentration of fw tested here was 200 g cod l the highest ever applied in ahpd and hid studies at first the reactor was operated by elevating the autogenerative pressure from 1 to 3 5 and 7 bar without h2 injection with the pressure increase the ch4 content in the biogas gradually increased from 52 4 at 1 bar to 77 4 at 7 bar however a drop of ch4 production yield mpy was observed at 7 bar due to the ph drop down to 6 7 by excess co2 dissolution at further operation h2 injection began at 5 bar with increasing its amount the injection was effective to increase the ch4 content to 82 8 87 2 and 90 6 at 0 09 0 13 and 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed of h2 injection amount respectively at 0 25 l h2 g codfw fed there was a further increase of ch4 content to 92 1 but the mpy was dropped with ph increase to 8 7 with residual h2 being detected 4 in the biogas microbial community analysis showed the increased abundance of piezo tolerant microbe with pressure increase and direct interspecies electron transfer contributors after h2 injection in conclusion the integration of two approaches enabled to directly produce high calorific biogas 90 ch4 180 mj m3 biogas from high strength fw at the lowest requirement of h2 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed ever reported graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high calorific biogas autogenerative pressure hydrogen injection food waste integration biogas upgrading 1 introduction food waste fw is a problematic waste producing odor and leachate during collection and transportation and responsible for 6 of global greenhouse gas emissions kim et al 2016 ritchie 2020 on the other hand fw is considered an ideal feedstock for anaerobic digestion ad since it has a high organic content and higher ch4 production potential than other organic wastes zhang et al 2020 for these reasons it has been used as a sole substrate but also co substrate for ad plant in korea 30 of ad plant located in sewage treatment plant receives fw to attain more biogas and theryby reducing the fossil fuel consumption utilized in wastewater treatment moe 2019 the produced biogas from ad generally consists of methane ch4 40 70 by vol carbon dioxide co2 30 60 by vol and trace gasses such as nitrogen n2 and hydrogen sulfide h2s sahota et al 2018 it can be directly used for electricity generation after desulfurization but the trend for use as vehicle fuels and grid injection gets more popularity which requires the process of upgrading that increasing energy value of biogas by removing co2 muñoz et al 2015 the number of biogas upgrading plant reaches to 606 in all over the world and it is expected to grow continuously iea 2019 biogas upgrading is commonly implemented through physico chemical technologies e g water scrubbing pressure swing adsorption and membrane based iea 2019 however these technologies encounter with economic problems because of additional costs for new facilities and periodic replacement of solution and membrane angelidaki et al 2018 khan et al 2017 numerous researches are going on for the economic operation of biogas upgrading however the cost is currently about twice as high as biogas production cost chen et al 2010 rotunno et al 2017 to overcome above issue two novel biological processes 1 autogenerative high pressure digestion ahpd and 2 hydrogen h2 injecting digestion hid in which both the production of biogas and upgrading are performed in a single digester have been introduced in specific ahpd is depending on the difference in the solubility of gasses under high pressure that is generated by biogas itself lindeboom et al 2011 the solubility of co2 is about 20 times higher than that of ch4 as a consequence biogas generated from ahpd could have higher ch4 content above 70 wang et al 2003 as the pressure increased inside the digester from 1 to 9 bar the ch4 content was increased up to 75 while ch4 content of 90 was obtained by raising the pressure to around 30 bar chen et al 2014a merkle et al 2017 on the other hand hid is a process in which the co2 in digester is converted to ch4 with injected h2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogenic reaction 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o since co2 is converted to ch4 additional ch4 can be gained and the drop of ph caused by co2 dissolution can be alleviated possibly increasing ch4 production at high organic loading rate condition by h2 injection ch4 content could be increased from 55 to 96 and 64 to 99 from the ad of manure and sewage sludge at the h2 injection rate of 1760 ml l d and 1320 ml l d respectively luo et al 2013a wang et al 2013 in the light of previously mentioned studies it might be expected that further raising of generated pressure or h2 injection amount can lead to higher ch4 content in the biogas however there exist technical difficulties and practical issues the drop of ph with pressure increase is generally observed in ahpd due to the excessive co2 dissolution when the pressure was increased to 50 bar ph was dropped to 6 5 and the value of ch4 production yield mpy was decreased from 0 33 to 0 26 l ch4 g cod referring to the drop of microbial activity merkle et al 2017 on the other hand hid encounters with the ph increase according to agneessens et al 2017 the ph in the reactor was increased from 7 8 to 8 5 as the h2 injection rate was increased in addition the residual h2 at high h2 injecting rate might impede digestion process in particular syntrophic reactions that are not favorable in the presence of h2 fukuzaki et al 1990 another drawback for hid could be the high cost of h2 2 5 usd kg satyapal et al 2018 theoretically 0 2 kg approximately 2 m3 of h2 under stp of h2 is required for upgrading 1 m3 of biogas questioning its economic viability as mentioned above it seemed that ahpd and hid have the opposite aspect suggesting a hint that integrating these two approaches might solve each drawback this study therefore aimed to directly produce high calorific biogas from fw by operating the digester under high pressure with h2 injection to achieve this at first the autogenerative pressure was gradually increased from 1 to 7 bar without h2 injection and then the amount of h2 injection was gradually increased from 0 09 to 0 13 0 18 and 0 25 l h2 g chemical oxygen demand codfw fed at the fixed pressure of 5 bar the microbial community was also analyzed under different operating conditions to relate with performance to our knowledge the substrate concentration 200 g cod l tested here was the highest ever applied in ahpd and hid studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and feedstock the inoculum was taken from an anaerobic digester in sewage treatment plant located in incheon south korea concentrations of total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss ph and alkalinity of seedling sludge were 20 1 g l 16 0 g l 7 8 and 5 1 g caco3 l respectively as a feedstock synthetic fw was made with canned pork and beans w w wet basis 36 potato 8 and white bread 56 according to the method by asato et al 2016 a certain amount of water was added to dilute about 2 2 5 times maintaining constant characteristics of cod volatile solids vs concentration ph total nitrogen tn of 200 4 12 4 g l 125 7 9 8 g l 6 3 0 1 4 1 0 2 g l respectively which were in the similar value of actual fw kim et al 2016 it was shredded with grinder less than 2 mm of size and was stored at 4 c less than two days before fed to the reactor 2 2 reactor operation the experiment was carried out using a completely stirred tank reactor cstr installing with pressure meter and ph sensor istek i 1000 s8 enduring high pressure the effective volume of the reactor was 3 0 l with headspace volume of 700 ml 160 mm diameter with 185 mm height after placing 3 l of inoculum the broth was purged with n2 for 15 min at a flow rate of 5 l min to provide anaerobic condition 40 ml of fw was fed once a day using screw pump mn 010 2 nova rotors corresponding to an organic loading rate olr of 2 67 g codfw fed l d at first the reactor was operated under various pressures 1 0 0 1 3 0 0 1 5 0 0 1 and 7 0 0 1 bar phase 1 4 when the pressure inside the headspace of the reactor reached the targeted value the gas was released to the gas collector by using pressure regulator back pressure regulator tescom lee et al 2018 to explain in detail for example at p3 5 0 bar a certain amount of gas was released when the pressure reached 5 1 bar which was then decreased to 4 9 bar the ch4 content in the headspace of reactor and gas collector were measured twice a day right after feeding and at the end of cycle by using these values and the amount of gas collected in the gas collector ch4 production per day was calculated at further operation the pressure was fixed at 5 bar while the amount of h2 injection rate was gradually increased from 233 333 467 and 667 ml l d corresponding to 0 09 0 13 0 18 and 0 25 l h2 g codfw fed phase 5 8 prior to h2 injection the pressure inside the digester was further reduced to 4 0 3 5 3 0 and 2 2 bar at p5 p6 p7 and p8 respectively after discharging digestate and feeding fw h2 injection was conducted using a sphere type of sparger pore size of 1 5 mm located in the broth at the rate of 100 ml h2 min this procedure at p5 p8 was to avoid h2 loss to the gas collector just right after injecting h2 to the reactor actually right after feeding fw and h2 the drop of pressure was noticed for several hours probably by h2 consuming reactions indicating negligible loss of h2 to the gas collector the h2 injection could increase an olr from 2 67 to 2 83 2 90 3 00 and 3 14 g cod l d the reactor was operated at 37 1 c and agitated at 120 rpm using water bath and mechanical stirrer respectively the detailed operating conditions at each phase are summarized in table 1 2 3 analysis concentrations of vs tn ammonium ion nh4 and cod were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 the volume of produced biogas was measured using a gas collector and converted to the values at the standard temperature 0 c and pressure 1 bar stp conditions the ch4 co2 and h2 content were analyzed using gas chromatography gow mac series 580 usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 1 8 m 3 2 mm stainless steel column the carrier gas was n2 of flow rate 30 ml min the temperatures of injector column and detector were set to 50 80 and 70 c respectively organic acids were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography lc 20a shimadzu japan with an aminex hpx 87h column biorad usa using sulfuric acid of 0 005 mm as a mobile phase the liquid samples were pretreated with a membrane filter having a 0 45 μm pore size the concentration of sodium na was measured using a conductivity electrode ct 21772b dkk toa japan 2 4 calculation of theoretical ph in ad the produced co2 is dissolved into the broth affecting ph the dissolution of co2 exists in the form of carbonic acid h2co3 bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 which are balanced by eq 1 and 2 1 h2co3 aq h aq hco3 aq pka1 6 35 2 hco3 aq h aq co3 2 aq pka2 10 33 the theoretical ph value can be calculated using the balance between cations and anions the main ions existed in the reactor were na hydrogen ion h nh4 hydroxide oh hco3 and co3 2 considering these the theoretical ph value was calculated by the following eq 3 3 c1 c2 c3 a1 a2 2 a3 where c1 is the na concentration of 0 12 0 01 mol l average value from the sampling at 120 150 d operation c2 is the nh4 concentration of 0 18 0 01 mol l average value from the sampling at 120 150 d operation c3 is the concentration of h a1 a2 and a3 are the concentration of oh hco3 and co3 2 respectively hco3 and co3 2 were derived from eq 1 and 2 and their values can be obtained by 10ph 6 35 h2co3 and 102ph 16 68 h2co3 respectively where h2co3 was calculated using henry s law the calculation formula for substituting these values results in eq 4 4 0 12 0 18 10 ph 10ph 14 10ph 6 35 h2co3 2 102ph 16 68 h2co3 2 5 microbial community analysis the samples at the end of each operating condition were collected for archaeal and bacterial community analysis deoxyribonucleic acid dna in the samples was extracted with rsc purefood gmo and authentication kit promega usa and the quantification of dna was measured by epoch spectrometer biotek usa the 16s rrna genes v4 v5 primers for archaea arch349f 5 ccctacggggtgcascag 3 and arch1017r 5

sciences ct usa according to the manufacturer s instruction by a commercial sequencing facility macrogen and chunlab seoul korea shin et al 2019 identification of operational taxonomic units otu taxonomic assignment community comparison and statistical analysis were obtained by using the software mothur then the sequences spanning the same region were realigned with the ncbi blast database www ncbi nlm nih gov in the database screening with the blast program the threshold e value to include a sequence in the next iteration was 0 001 key genes expression was done using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust 3 results and discussion 3 1 autogenerative high pressure fig 1 a shows the variation of ch4 content and biogas production rate bpr under various pressures and the average performances at each phase are summarized in table 2 during the start up period the ch4 content in biogas was gradually increased as operation went on reaching 52 after 25 days then it showed a stable performance with 52 4 and 1440 ml ch4 l d of ch4 content and bpr respectively until 78 days of operation when the autogenerative pressure was increased to 3 bar p2 the ch4 content gradually increased and stabilized at 67 0 within 5 days with the drop of bpr to 1100 ml ch4 l d at further operation ch4 content was further increased to 74 5 and 77 4 at p3 and p4 respectively there was a drop of bpr but showed a stable value at p3 while it seemed little bit unstable at p4 since the drop of bpr is a predicted result caused by the increased amount of dissolved biogas under high pressure it does not indicate the drop of performance once mpy is maintained like our results the increase of ch4 content in the biogas with elevated pressure has been observed in former continuous studies ch4 content values of 75 78 was achieved at 9 bar in anaerobic filter system fed with diluted maize silage and grass of 20 25 g cod l chen et al 2014b lemmer et al 2015a 2015b li et al 2017 achieved 80 and 90 at 6 and 17 bar respectively from the fw of having 100 g cod l the direct comparison with former performance is unreasonable in ahpd since the ch4 content could be varied depending on the substrate characteristics in particular substrate concentration for example when the substrate concentration is 50 g cod l assuming at the ph of 7 0 the theoretical pressure required to obtain 90 of ch4 content is 30 bar however if a high strength substrate of 200 g cod l is used like in this study the pressure of 120 bar is required to achieve 90 of ch4 content details of the calculation method are included in the supplementary information this is because compared to the low strength waste the highly concentrated waste would produce larger amount of co2 at the same liquid volume for co2 dissolution to our knowledge as previously mentioned the substrate concentration here was the highest ever applied in ahpd mpy an important indicator for judging the efficiency of ad performance was maintained 0 26 0 28 l ch4 g codadded until p3 but declined significantly to 0 23 l ch4 g codadded at p4 one of the reasons could be the ch4 loss as a result of dissolution with co2 which was found to be negligible according to the henry s constant of ch4 0 0016 mol l bar and its partial pressure in the headspace the concentration of dissolved ch4 was calculated to be 0 0025 0 0032 0 0060 and 0 0087 mol l at p1 p2 p3 and p4 respectively for example at p1 the total amount of ch4 produced per day was 2 25 l d considering the production from both gaseous 2 25 l d and dissolved 0 66 ml d state of ch4 even if the amount of dissolved ch4 was included it was negligible under all operating conditions refer to table s1 which was due to the use of high strength organic waste as mentioned previously this indicates that there is another reason besides the ch4 dissolution as seen in fig 1 b there was a gradual ph drop as the pressure increased which was an expected phenomenon by the increased co2 dissolution to explain this in detail the theoretical ph values for each condition were calculated by eq 4 which were 7 65 7 33 7 22 and 7 14 at p1 p2 p3 and p4 respectively there can be a gap between theoretical and actual ph values due to the complex nature of digestate including the existence of organic acids various ions precipitation reaction and over saturation of co2 tao et al 2020 however the important fact is that the ph was maintained above 7 2 up to 5 bar while it dropped to 6 7 that was out of optimal range for methanogens ward et al 2008 resulting in the drop of mpy like our study chen et al 2014a noticed that the ph was decreased from 7 0 to 6 4 as the pressure increased from 1 5 bar to 9 bar accompanied with the drop of mpy from 0 31 to 0 25 l ch4 g cod it seemed that the excess co2 dissolution at p4 triggered the inhibition of methanogenic activity by observing the accumulation of organic acids acetate propionate and butyrate were found to be the major organic acids as the pressure increased the concentration of organic acids increased but stabilized at each operating conditions which were 9 16 cod l former works treating high strength waste showed stable performance at 15 g l of total organic acids like our study banks et al 2011 at p4 however it continuously increased until the end of operation reaching 22 g cod l and this might have caused a further drop of ph 3 2 hydrogen injection to further increase the ch4 content in the biogas h2 was injected to convert co2 to ch4 prior to h2 injection ch4 content and bpr were recovered to 74 and 910 30 ml l d respectively similar to the performance obtained at p3 as shown in fig 2 a when the h2 injection started p5 the ch4 content was gradually increased and reached around 82 8 with a bpr of 920 ml l d as the amount of h2 injection increased the ch4 content was further increased to 87 2 and 90 6 with a bpr of 930 and 940 ml l d at p6 and p7 respectively at p8 the ch4 content was further increased to 92 1 but bpr was decreased significantly to 790 ml l d in addition the h2 content of 4 1 was detected at p8 in the biogas indicating that h2 conversion to ch4 was inhibited at p8 as the amount h2 injection increased the ch4 content increased as well thus the dissolved ch4 concentration calculated by henry s law was increased from 0 0066 to 0 0069 0 0072 and 0 0074 mol l at p5 p6 p7 and p8 respectively however most of ch4 could be obtained in the gas collector under all conditions since the ch4 loss to effluent was negligible for example at p7 the daily amount of ch4 production to the gas collector was 2 55 l d while 5 70 ml d was lost by effluent discharging in terms of mpy the maintained value above 0 28 l ch4 g codadded was also dropped to 0 24 l ch4 g codadded at p8 the reason for this drop could be related with ph increase opposite to the ph drop at p2 p4 due to the drastic drop of performance at p8 the reactor operation ceased as shown in fig 2 b the ph gradually increased and maintained within optimal range of 7 0 to 8 0 until p7 accompanied with the degradation of organic acids lowered down to 9 8 g cod l lay et al 1997 however the ph exceeded 8 0 at p8 the increase of ph increase was expected and former works already pointed out wang et al 2013 observed the increase of ph up to 9 0 with the increase of h2 injection rate from 600 to 1320 ml l d agneessens et al 2017 also detected the ph increase from 7 91 to 8 43 at the flow rate of 1 17 l h2 l d resulting in a decrease of the biogas production from 0 45 l l d to 0 35 l l d the theoretical ph values at p5 p6 p7 and p8 were calculated to be 7 38 7 52 7 75 and 8 07 respectively according to eq 4 compared to other conditions a considerable difference between the theoretical and actual ph was found at p8 also the accumulation of organic acids was observed at p8 possibly causing further ph drop like our study former studies observed the accumulation of organic acids accompanied with a ph increase with h2 injection mulat et al 2017 wang et al 2013 in this experiment vs reduction efficiency at p8 was decreased indicating an inhibition of hydrolysis and acidogenesis step in ad of fw vs concentration in the reactor was increased from 12 7 g vs l at day 315 to 15 9 g vs l at day 330 data not shown in the figure from this observation it can be speculated that the total amount of acids generation from fw itself was inhibited at p8 producing also less amount of co2 compared to other operating conditions since the production amount of co2 was limited while h2 injection amount was increased at p8 the force to drop down ph by dissolved co2 seemed weak therefore it is possible to say that the amount of injected h2 was excessive breaking the balance between the co2 and other ions in the broth for keeping the ph neutral resulting in ph increase at p8 some amount of h2 was also remained in the biogas this might be due to the increased olr by h2 injection but the increment was slight for affecting h2 conversion xu et al 2020 operated hid up to 5 g cod l d without detectable h2 remaining it seemed that the incomplete h2 conversion was due to the ph increase since the optimum ph for hydrogenotrophic methanogens is in the range of 7 0 8 0 koster et al 1988 the remained h2 at 4 in the biogas at p8 could inhibit ad process in specific syntrophic acetogenesis feng et al 2015 the reactions for producing acetate from propionate and butyrate are shown eq 5 and 6 with standard gibbs free energy δgo value when the h2 partial pressure increases gibbs free energy δg increases to a positive value indicating that the un favorability of this process is expected to be higher for example δg values for propionate conversion are calculated to be 7 63 19 54 and 32 14 kj mol at p6 p7 and p8 respectively when comparing p7 and p8 the concentration of propionate was increased as seen in fig 2 b consequently the increase of ph affected not only the conversion of h2 to ch4 but also the conversion of propionate to acetate 5 ch3ch2coo 3h2o ch3coo hco3 h 3h2 δgo 76 1 kj 6 ch3ch2ch2coo 2h2o 2ch3coo h 2h2 δgo 48 1 kj the hypothesis of our research is that by applying high pressure lower h2 injection rate would be enough for achieving high ch4 content compared to former works to compare this the achieved ch4 content and the amount of h2 injection rate olr ratio hir olr was used as an indicator as noticeably comparable in table 3 very low hir olr was required to achieve 90 of ch4 content in the biogas in our study p7 to the best of our knowledge the minimal hir olr required for achieving about ch4 of 90 was 0 39 l h2 g cod fed with sewage sludge wang et al 2013 luo et al 2012a used a mixture of cattle manure and whey as substrate and the hir olr value was 0 26 l h2 g cod but ch4 content was low at 65 to conclude it was able to produce high calorific biogas from a single digester at the minimum supply of h2 this was attributed to the fact that the h2 injection was conducted under high pressure simply when the biogas with 50 co2 is generated by the conventional ad 2 m3 of h2 is needed for upgrading 1 m3 of biogas whereas the amount of required h2 can be reduced to 1 m3 due to decline of co2 to 25 at 5 bar for this reason theoretical h2 amount to achieve 90 ch4 is 1 26 l h2 g cod but this can be reduced to 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed in this study by integrating two approaches ahpd and hid the positive roles of combining are as follows i the advantages from each approach are applicable ii the solubility of h2 can increased by the pressure iii the amount of h2 required can be reduced by the pressure and iv the pressure and h2 injection can complement each other s ph changes to tell the economic benefit of the invented process the economic assessment was conducted by comparing with the conventional hid table 4 the digester capacity for the treatment and the cod concentration were assumed to be 100 ton fw d and 200 g cod l respectively by using the obtained values at p1 table 2 the amount of biogas production was 10 687 20 ton cod d 280 m3 ch4 ton cod 0 524 ch4 content biogas m3 d in the hid and the amount of h2 required to achieve 90 of ch4 content in the biogas was 16 073 10 687 0 376 0 9 0 524 4 m3 h2 d which is approximately 1 44 ton h2 d this was calculated considering the molar ratio of h2 and co2 in hydrogenotrophic methanogenic reaction and assuming 100 consumption of added h2 to ch4 for the invented process the required amount of h2 was approximately 0 32 ton h2 d which was calculated using the mpy of 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed obtained from this study then the daily ch4 production in the hid and invented process can be obtained to 9618 10 687 0 524 16 073 4 and 6320 20 000 kg codfw 180 m3 h2 ton cod 1400 kg cod m3 h2 280 m3 ch4 kg codadded m3 d respectively the cost includes capital cost for the construction of digester annual cost operating and maintenance and h2 supplementation cost for capital cost the unit price of 100 000 usd ton cod was used beegle et al 2018 since there has been no economic evaluation for the ahpd process the capital cost adopted herein was hypothesized to be similar to that in the conventional upgrading system which is two times higher than that of conventional digester chen et al 2010 the annual cost was estimated to be 18 of capital cost beegle et al 2018 the profit can be obtained by selling ch4 and treating cod reduction fw yun et al 2018 in this assessment assuming that the cod reduction was 75 for both the hid and invented process the profit from treating fw was 2700 000 usd y 100 ton d 0 75 100 usd ton 360 d y based on the above estimated costs and profits the capital and annual cost are 2000 000 usd and 2943 206 usd y respectively and the total profit is 4569 802 usd y in the hid process then the net profit can be calculated using the capital cost considering 20 years of operation period annual cost and total profit which is 1526 595 usd y 4569 802 2000 000 20 2943 206 yun et al 2018 compared to the hid the invented process needed higher capital cost 4000 000 usd 2000 000 and lower total profit 3928 608 usd y 4569 802 usd y because of the less production of ch4 however the lower annual cost 1298 571 usd y 2943 206 usd y due to the less h2 requirement made the invented process economically more attractive than the conventional hid net profit 2403 037 usd y 1526 595 furthermore pressurization is required when the biogas is injected to the gas grid which should be above 8 bar in korea kogas 2019 since the biogas with a pressure of 5 bar is directly produced from the invented process it surely provides more economic benefit compared to the conventional hid comparing the energy calories between p1 control and p7 the energy content of 1 m3 biogas at p1 is 20 mj based on higher heating value of ch4 and 52 ch4 content in the biogas at 1 bar on the other hand the 90 of ch4 content was obtained at 5 bar resulting in the production of high calorific biogas with more than 9 times compared to p1 which is 180 mj m3 biogas when the biogas containing high calorific value is produced directly it can be distributed to external site via separate pipelines without additional refining there is no international standard for biogas injection to the gas grid but most countries have their own in the dutch and sweden for example it needs to be higher than around 44 mj m3 persson et al 2006 in case of korea a minimum heat content of 41 0 mj m3 is required and a lower webber index of 54 0 mj m3 kogas 2019 the technology proposed herein seems to be promising from engineering perspective and applicable in many countries for many reasons i it has high economic feasibility ii it generates high calorific biogas that can be directly injected to natural gas grid and iii it can handle high strength organic wastes 3 3 microbial community to explain the effect of high pressure and h2 injection on the change of microbial community the archaeal and bacterial analysis was conducted a total of 109 978 reads of archaea and bacteria were obtained the average read count was 13 748 7412 per sample in the p1 the majority of community was methanosarcina 74 5 methanobacterium 14 9 methanosaeta 4 6 and methanoculleus 2 0 which are well known methanogens in ad wang et al 2018 fig 3 however a gradual drop in the abundance of methanosarcina from 74 to 14 was noticed with the increase of pressure meanwhile the two major hydrogenotrophic methanogens hms i e methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter showed significant increases in their relative abundance by pressure increase rea et al 2007 siegert et al 2015 in addition the pearson correlation analysis pca was performed to determine the correlation between the abundances of methanogens and efficiency of the ahpd process and the analysis result was able to prove microbial community changes table s4 when the pressure in the reactor was increased the abundance of hms and ams showed a significant positive correlation with pressure especially hms similarly li et al 2017 reported that pressure increasing was accompanied with a sharp drop in the relative abundance of methanosarcina and remarkable enrichment for hms methanospirillum in terms of species level the abundance of methanobacterium subterraneum was increased from 5 3 p1 to 15 4 p2 30 5 p3 and 45 5 p4 with pressure increase and this microbe is known to be abundant at groundwater from deep rock aquifers located at a depth of 440 m with the pressure of about 40 bar kotelnikova et al 1998 the analysis results about the abundance of dominant archaea in species level were provided in the supplementary information with the accession numbers table s2 this was the first observation reporting the increased abundance of piezo tolerant methanogens in ahpd with the increase of the h2 injection amount methanosaeta and methanosarcina abundances were increased while the abundance of methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter was decreased contrary to expectations of an increase in hms abundance the abundance of methanosaeta which is an acetoclastic methanogen ams increased at p7 and p8 accompanied with residual h2 patel et al 1990 this indicates that the h2 might have been converted indirectly by homoacetogens and ams wang et al 2013 also found that the h2 was utilized not via hydrogenotrophic pathway but via the partnership between ams and homoacetogens to match with above the abundance of homoacetogens in specific clostridium coccoides and eubacterium aggregans data not shown was observed accounting for 2 4 2 4 4 4 and 7 4 at p5 p6 p7 and p8 respectively mechichi et al 1998 the pca result showed the identical tendency table s4 when the h2 was injected at a fixed pressure 5 bar the abundances of ams and homoacetogens showed a positive correlation with h2 while the abundance of hms had a negative correlation for thermodynamic reasons the increase of h2 partial pressure higher than 10 pa would cause inhibition on syntrophic reactions meng et al 2013 for instance in the reaction of propionate degradation to acetate if h2 partial pressure exceeds to 10 pa it would be thermodynamically unfavorable resulting in low mpy however in our study ch4 production continued at p7 and p8 although there was a drop at p8 when h2 partial pressure exceeded 4000 and 21 000 pa 0 04 and 0 21 bar respectively one of the possible reasons could be the role of direct interspecies electron transfer diet through diet syntrophic partners can exchange electrons efficiently regardless of high h2 pressure since δgo value for propionate degradation through diet is negative it can occur spontaneously eq 7 to ensure diet occurrence we analyzed the possibility for partnership among microbes interestingly a significant increase in the abundances of syntrophomonas and methanosaeta especially methanosaeta harundinacea was observed as seen in table s2 and table s3 their abundance were increased from 3 9 and 3 9 at p3 to 10 4 and 27 7 at p8 respectively the diet reaction between these two microbes were reported previously wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in these microbes metabolic properties syntrophomonas can convert propionate to acetate h2 or acetate electrons while methanosaeta harundinacea can receive acetate and electrons for ch4 generation as an additional evidence for diet reaction the gene analysis for pila was conducted which is known to increase its expression with the occurrence of diet lovley et al 2017 as shown in fig s1 the abundance of pila was increased as the amount of h2 injection increased up to p7 approximately 2 4 times higher value compared at p5 however at p8 there was a drop of pila expression probably due to the performance deterioration the effect of h2 pressure on triggering diet reaction in ad might be an interesting topic that deserves to be studied with more detailed experiment 7 ch3ch2coo 3h2o ch3coo hco3 7h 6e δgo 162 5 kj 4 conclusion from the continuous operation of integrating ahpd and hid for treating fw following conclusions were drawn 1 the ch4 content in the biogas was gradually increased from 52 4 at the control to 67 0 74 5 and 77 4 at 3 bar 5 bar and 7 bar respectively an mpy was maintained 0 26 0 28 l ch4 g codadded until 5 bar while it declined to 0 23 l ch4 g codadded at 7 bar due to the ph drop down to 6 7 by excess co2 dissolution 2 when the h2 injection started at 5 bar the ch4 content was gradually increased to 82 8 87 2 and 90 6 at p5 p6 and p7 respectively at p8 the ch4 content was further increased to 92 1 but the mpy was dropped to 0 24 l ch4 g codadded with ph increase to 8 7 also remained h2 of 4 0 in the biogas was detected affecting syntrophic acetogenesis thermodynamically unfavorable 3 the h2 injection under high pressure enabled to directly produce high calorific biogas 90 ch4 180 mj m3 biogas from the high strength fw at the lowest requirement of h2 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed ever reported 4 the abundance of methanobacterium subterraneum known as piezo tolerant microbe was increased from 5 to 45 as the pressure increased after h2 injection the abundances of syntrophomonas and methanosaeta harundinacea known as diet contributors were increased indicating that the presence of h2 facilitated the thermodynamically favorable

17130,auto generative high pressure digestion ahpd and hydrogen injecting digestion hid have been introduced to directly produce high ch4 content biogas from anaerobic digester however each approach has its own technical difficulties ph changes and practical issues high cost of h2 to obtain 90 ch4 containing biogas particularly from the high strength waste like food waste fw to overcome this problem in this study ahpd and hid were integrated which can offset each drawback but maximize its benefit substrate concentration of fw tested here was 200 g cod l the highest ever applied in ahpd and hid studies at first the reactor was operated by elevating the autogenerative pressure from 1 to 3 5 and 7 bar without h2 injection with the pressure increase the ch4 content in the biogas gradually increased from 52 4 at 1 bar to 77 4 at 7 bar however a drop of ch4 production yield mpy was observed at 7 bar due to the ph drop down to 6 7 by excess co2 dissolution at further operation h2 injection began at 5 bar with increasing its amount the injection was effective to increase the ch4 content to 82 8 87 2 and 90 6 at 0 09 0 13 and 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed of h2 injection amount respectively at 0 25 l h2 g codfw fed there was a further increase of ch4 content to 92 1 but the mpy was dropped with ph increase to 8 7 with residual h2 being detected 4 in the biogas microbial community analysis showed the increased abundance of piezo tolerant microbe with pressure increase and direct interspecies electron transfer contributors after h2 injection in conclusion the integration of two approaches enabled to directly produce high calorific biogas 90 ch4 180 mj m3 biogas from high strength fw at the lowest requirement of h2 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed ever reported graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords high calorific biogas autogenerative pressure hydrogen injection food waste integration biogas upgrading 1 introduction food waste fw is a problematic waste producing odor and leachate during collection and transportation and responsible for 6 of global greenhouse gas emissions kim et al 2016 ritchie 2020 on the other hand fw is considered an ideal feedstock for anaerobic digestion ad since it has a high organic content and higher ch4 production potential than other organic wastes zhang et al 2020 for these reasons it has been used as a sole substrate but also co substrate for ad plant in korea 30 of ad plant located in sewage treatment plant receives fw to attain more biogas and theryby reducing the fossil fuel consumption utilized in wastewater treatment moe 2019 the produced biogas from ad generally consists of methane ch4 40 70 by vol carbon dioxide co2 30 60 by vol and trace gasses such as nitrogen n2 and hydrogen sulfide h2s sahota et al 2018 it can be directly used for electricity generation after desulfurization but the trend for use as vehicle fuels and grid injection gets more popularity which requires the process of upgrading that increasing energy value of biogas by removing co2 muñoz et al 2015 the number of biogas upgrading plant reaches to 606 in all over the world and it is expected to grow continuously iea 2019 biogas upgrading is commonly implemented through physico chemical technologies e g water scrubbing pressure swing adsorption and membrane based iea 2019 however these technologies encounter with economic problems because of additional costs for new facilities and periodic replacement of solution and membrane angelidaki et al 2018 khan et al 2017 numerous researches are going on for the economic operation of biogas upgrading however the cost is currently about twice as high as biogas production cost chen et al 2010 rotunno et al 2017 to overcome above issue two novel biological processes 1 autogenerative high pressure digestion ahpd and 2 hydrogen h2 injecting digestion hid in which both the production of biogas and upgrading are performed in a single digester have been introduced in specific ahpd is depending on the difference in the solubility of gasses under high pressure that is generated by biogas itself lindeboom et al 2011 the solubility of co2 is about 20 times higher than that of ch4 as a consequence biogas generated from ahpd could have higher ch4 content above 70 wang et al 2003 as the pressure increased inside the digester from 1 to 9 bar the ch4 content was increased up to 75 while ch4 content of 90 was obtained by raising the pressure to around 30 bar chen et al 2014a merkle et al 2017 on the other hand hid is a process in which the co2 in digester is converted to ch4 with injected h2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogenic reaction 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o since co2 is converted to ch4 additional ch4 can be gained and the drop of ph caused by co2 dissolution can be alleviated possibly increasing ch4 production at high organic loading rate condition by h2 injection ch4 content could be increased from 55 to 96 and 64 to 99 from the ad of manure and sewage sludge at the h2 injection rate of 1760 ml l d and 1320 ml l d respectively luo et al 2013a wang et al 2013 in the light of previously mentioned studies it might be expected that further raising of generated pressure or h2 injection amount can lead to higher ch4 content in the biogas however there exist technical difficulties and practical issues the drop of ph with pressure increase is generally observed in ahpd due to the excessive co2 dissolution when the pressure was increased to 50 bar ph was dropped to 6 5 and the value of ch4 production yield mpy was decreased from 0 33 to 0 26 l ch4 g cod referring to the drop of microbial activity merkle et al 2017 on the other hand hid encounters with the ph increase according to agneessens et al 2017 the ph in the reactor was increased from 7 8 to 8 5 as the h2 injection rate was increased in addition the residual h2 at high h2 injecting rate might impede digestion process in particular syntrophic reactions that are not favorable in the presence of h2 fukuzaki et al 1990 another drawback for hid could be the high cost of h2 2 5 usd kg satyapal et al 2018 theoretically 0 2 kg approximately 2 m3 of h2 under stp of h2 is required for upgrading 1 m3 of biogas questioning its economic viability as mentioned above it seemed that ahpd and hid have the opposite aspect suggesting a hint that integrating these two approaches might solve each drawback this study therefore aimed to directly produce high calorific biogas from fw by operating the digester under high pressure with h2 injection to achieve this at first the autogenerative pressure was gradually increased from 1 to 7 bar without h2 injection and then the amount of h2 injection was gradually increased from 0 09 to 0 13 0 18 and 0 25 l h2 g chemical oxygen demand codfw fed at the fixed pressure of 5 bar the microbial community was also analyzed under different operating conditions to relate with performance to our knowledge the substrate concentration 200 g cod l tested here was the highest ever applied in ahpd and hid studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and feedstock the inoculum was taken from an anaerobic digester in sewage treatment plant located in incheon south korea concentrations of total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss ph and alkalinity of seedling sludge were 20 1 g l 16 0 g l 7 8 and 5 1 g caco3 l respectively as a feedstock synthetic fw was made with canned pork and beans w w wet basis 36 potato 8 and white bread 56 according to the method by asato et al 2016 a certain amount of water was added to dilute about 2 2 5 times maintaining constant characteristics of cod volatile solids vs concentration ph total nitrogen tn of 200 4 12 4 g l 125 7 9 8 g l 6 3 0 1 4 1 0 2 g l respectively which were in the similar value of actual fw kim et al 2016 it was shredded with grinder less than 2 mm of size and was stored at 4 c less than two days before fed to the reactor 2 2 reactor operation the experiment was carried out using a completely stirred tank reactor cstr installing with pressure meter and ph sensor istek i 1000 s8 enduring high pressure the effective volume of the reactor was 3 0 l with headspace volume of 700 ml 160 mm diameter with 185 mm height after placing 3 l of inoculum the broth was purged with n2 for 15 min at a flow rate of 5 l min to provide anaerobic condition 40 ml of fw was fed once a day using screw pump mn 010 2 nova rotors corresponding to an organic loading rate olr of 2 67 g codfw fed l d at first the reactor was operated under various pressures 1 0 0 1 3 0 0 1 5 0 0 1 and 7 0 0 1 bar phase 1 4 when the pressure inside the headspace of the reactor reached the targeted value the gas was released to the gas collector by using pressure regulator back pressure regulator tescom lee et al 2018 to explain in detail for example at p3 5 0 bar a certain amount of gas was released when the pressure reached 5 1 bar which was then decreased to 4 9 bar the ch4 content in the headspace of reactor and gas collector were measured twice a day right after feeding and at the end of cycle by using these values and the amount of gas collected in the gas collector ch4 production per day was calculated at further operation the pressure was fixed at 5 bar while the amount of h2 injection rate was gradually increased from 233 333 467 and 667 ml l d corresponding to 0 09 0 13 0 18 and 0 25 l h2 g codfw fed phase 5 8 prior to h2 injection the pressure inside the digester was further reduced to 4 0 3 5 3 0 and 2 2 bar at p5 p6 p7 and p8 respectively after discharging digestate and feeding fw h2 injection was conducted using a sphere type of sparger pore size of 1 5 mm located in the broth at the rate of 100 ml h2 min this procedure at p5 p8 was to avoid h2 loss to the gas collector just right after injecting h2 to the reactor actually right after feeding fw and h2 the drop of pressure was noticed for several hours probably by h2 consuming reactions indicating negligible loss of h2 to the gas collector the h2 injection could increase an olr from 2 67 to 2 83 2 90 3 00 and 3 14 g cod l d the reactor was operated at 37 1 c and agitated at 120 rpm using water bath and mechanical stirrer respectively the detailed operating conditions at each phase are summarized in table 1 2 3 analysis concentrations of vs tn ammonium ion nh4 and cod were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 the volume of produced biogas was measured using a gas collector and converted to the values at the standard temperature 0 c and pressure 1 bar stp conditions the ch4 co2 and h2 content were analyzed using gas chromatography gow mac series 580 usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 1 8 m 3 2 mm stainless steel column the carrier gas was n2 of flow rate 30 ml min the temperatures of injector column and detector were set to 50 80 and 70 c respectively organic acids were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography lc 20a shimadzu japan with an aminex hpx 87h column biorad usa using sulfuric acid of 0 005 mm as a mobile phase the liquid samples were pretreated with a membrane filter having a 0 45 μm pore size the concentration of sodium na was measured using a conductivity electrode ct 21772b dkk toa japan 2 4 calculation of theoretical ph in ad the produced co2 is dissolved into the broth affecting ph the dissolution of co2 exists in the form of carbonic acid h2co3 bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 which are balanced by eq 1 and 2 1 h2co3 aq h aq hco3 aq pka1 6 35 2 hco3 aq h aq co3 2 aq pka2 10 33 the theoretical ph value can be calculated using the balance between cations and anions the main ions existed in the reactor were na hydrogen ion h nh4 hydroxide oh hco3 and co3 2 considering these the theoretical ph value was calculated by the following eq 3 3 c1 c2 c3 a1 a2 2 a3 where c1 is the na concentration of 0 12 0 01 mol l average value from the sampling at 120 150 d operation c2 is the nh4 concentration of 0 18 0 01 mol l average value from the sampling at 120 150 d operation c3 is the concentration of h a1 a2 and a3 are the concentration of oh hco3 and co3 2 respectively hco3 and co3 2 were derived from eq 1 and 2 and their values can be obtained by 10ph 6 35 h2co3 and 102ph 16 68 h2co3 respectively where h2co3 was calculated using henry s law the calculation formula for substituting these values results in eq 4 4 0 12 0 18 10 ph 10ph 14 10ph 6 35 h2co3 2 102ph 16 68 h2co3 2 5 microbial community analysis the

www ncbi nlm nih gov in the database screening with the blast program the threshold e value to include a sequence in the next iteration was 0 001 key genes expression was done using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust 3 results and discussion 3 1 autogenerative high pressure fig 1 a shows the variation of ch4 content and biogas production rate bpr under various pressures and the average performances at each phase are summarized in table 2 during the start up period the ch4 content in biogas was gradually increased as operation went on reaching 52 after 25 days then it showed a stable performance with 52 4 and 1440 ml ch4 l d of ch4 content and bpr respectively until 78 days of operation when the autogenerative pressure was increased to 3 bar p2 the ch4 content gradually increased and stabilized at 67 0 within 5 days with the drop of bpr to 1100 ml ch4 l d at further operation ch4 content was further increased to 74 5 and 77 4 at p3 and p4 respectively there was a drop of bpr but showed a stable value at p3 while it seemed little bit unstable at p4 since the drop of bpr is a predicted result caused by the increased amount of dissolved biogas under high pressure it does not indicate the drop of performance once mpy is maintained like our results the increase of ch4 content in the biogas with elevated pressure has been observed in former continuous studies ch4 content values of 75 78 was achieved at 9 bar in anaerobic filter system fed with diluted maize silage and grass of 20 25 g cod l chen et al 2014b lemmer et al 2015a 2015b li et al 2017 achieved 80 and 90 at 6 and 17 bar respectively from the fw of having 100 g cod l the direct comparison with former performance is unreasonable in ahpd since the ch4 content could be varied depending on the substrate characteristics in particular substrate concentration for example when the substrate concentration is 50 g cod l assuming at the ph of 7 0 the theoretical pressure required to obtain 90 of ch4 content is 30 bar however if a high strength substrate of 200 g cod l is used like in this study the pressure of 120 bar is required to achieve 90 of ch4 content details of the calculation method are included in the supplementary information this is because compared to the low strength waste the highly concentrated waste would produce larger amount of co2 at the same liquid volume for co2 dissolution to our knowledge as previously mentioned the substrate concentration here was the highest ever applied in ahpd mpy an important indicator for judging the efficiency of ad performance was maintained 0 26 0 28 l ch4 g codadded until p3 but declined significantly to 0 23 l ch4 g codadded at p4 one of the reasons could be the ch4 loss as a result of dissolution with co2 which was found to be negligible according to the henry s constant of ch4 0 0016 mol l bar and its partial pressure in the headspace the concentration of dissolved ch4 was calculated to be 0 0025 0 0032 0 0060 and 0 0087 mol l at p1 p2 p3 and p4 respectively for example at p1 the total amount of ch4 produced per day was 2 25 l d considering the production from both gaseous 2 25 l d and dissolved 0 66 ml d state of ch4 even if the amount of dissolved ch4 was included it was negligible under all operating conditions refer to table s1 which was due to the use of high strength organic waste as mentioned previously this indicates that there is another reason besides the ch4 dissolution as seen in fig 1 b there was a gradual ph drop as the pressure increased which was an expected phenomenon by the increased co2 dissolution to explain this in detail the theoretical ph values for each condition were calculated by eq 4 which were 7 65 7 33 7 22 and 7 14 at p1 p2 p3 and p4 respectively there can be a gap between theoretical and actual ph values due to the complex nature of digestate including the existence of organic acids various ions precipitation reaction and over saturation of co2 tao et al 2020 however the important fact is that the ph was maintained above 7 2 up to 5 bar while it dropped to 6 7 that was out of optimal range for methanogens ward et al 2008 resulting in the drop of mpy like our study chen et al 2014a noticed that the ph was decreased from 7 0 to 6 4 as the pressure increased from 1 5 bar to 9 bar accompanied with the drop of mpy from 0 31 to 0 25 l ch4 g cod it seemed that the excess co2 dissolution at p4 triggered the inhibition of methanogenic activity by observing the accumulation of organic acids acetate propionate and butyrate were found to be the major organic acids as the pressure increased the concentration of organic acids increased but stabilized at each operating conditions which were 9 16 cod l former works treating high strength waste showed stable performance at 15 g l of total organic acids like our study banks et al 2011 at p4 however it continuously increased until the end of operation reaching 22 g cod l and this might have caused a further drop of ph 3 2 hydrogen injection to further increase the ch4 content in the biogas h2 was injected to convert co2 to ch4 prior to h2 injection ch4 content and bpr were recovered to 74 and 910 30 ml l d respectively similar to the performance obtained at p3 as shown in fig 2 a when the h2 injection started p5 the ch4 content was gradually increased and reached around 82 8 with a bpr of 920 ml l d as the amount of h2 injection increased the ch4 content was further increased to 87 2 and 90 6 with a bpr of 930 and 940 ml l d at p6 and p7 respectively at p8 the ch4 content was further increased to 92 1 but bpr was decreased significantly to 790 ml l d in addition the h2 content of 4 1 was detected at p8 in the biogas indicating that h2 conversion to ch4 was inhibited at p8 as the amount h2 injection increased the ch4 content increased as well thus the dissolved ch4 concentration calculated by henry s law was increased from 0 0066 to 0 0069 0 0072 and 0 0074 mol l at p5 p6 p7 and p8 respectively however most of ch4 could be obtained in the gas collector under all conditions since the ch4 loss to effluent was negligible for example at p7 the daily amount of ch4 production to the gas collector was 2 55 l d while 5 70 ml d was lost by effluent discharging in terms of mpy the maintained value above 0 28 l ch4 g codadded was also dropped to 0 24 l ch4 g codadded at p8 the reason for this drop could be related with ph increase opposite to the ph drop at p2 p4 due to the drastic drop of performance at p8 the reactor operation ceased as shown in fig 2 b the ph gradually increased and maintained within optimal range of 7 0 to 8 0 until p7 accompanied with the degradation of organic acids lowered down to 9 8 g cod l lay et al 1997 however the ph exceeded 8 0 at p8 the increase of ph increase was expected and former works already pointed out wang et al 2013 observed the increase of ph up to 9 0 with the increase of h2 injection rate from 600 to 1320 ml l d agneessens et al 2017 also detected the ph increase from 7 91 to 8 43 at the flow rate of 1 17 l h2 l d resulting in a decrease of the biogas production from 0 45 l l d to 0 35 l l d the theoretical ph values at p5 p6 p7 and p8 were calculated to be 7 38 7 52 7 75 and 8 07 respectively according to eq 4 compared to other conditions a considerable difference between the theoretical and actual ph was found at p8 also the accumulation of organic acids was observed at p8 possibly causing further ph drop like our study former studies observed the accumulation of organic acids accompanied with a ph increase with h2 injection mulat et al 2017 wang et al 2013 in this experiment vs reduction efficiency at p8 was decreased indicating an inhibition of hydrolysis and acidogenesis step in ad of fw vs concentration in the reactor was increased from 12 7 g vs l at day 315 to 15 9 g vs l at day 330 data not shown in the figure from this observation it can be speculated that the total amount of acids generation from fw itself was inhibited at p8 producing also less amount of co2 compared to other operating conditions since the production amount of co2 was limited while h2 injection amount was increased at p8 the force to drop down ph by dissolved co2 seemed weak therefore it is possible to say that the amount of injected h2 was excessive breaking the balance between the co2 and other ions in the broth for keeping the ph neutral resulting in ph increase at p8 some amount of h2 was also remained in the biogas this might be due to the increased olr by h2 injection but the increment was slight for affecting h2 conversion xu et al 2020 operated hid up to 5 g cod l d without detectable h2 remaining it seemed that the incomplete h2 conversion was due to the ph increase since the optimum ph for hydrogenotrophic methanogens is in the range of 7 0 8 0 koster et al 1988 the remained h2 at 4 in the biogas at p8 could inhibit ad process in specific syntrophic acetogenesis feng et al 2015 the reactions for producing acetate from propionate and butyrate are shown eq 5 and 6 with standard gibbs free energy δgo value when the h2 partial pressure increases gibbs free energy δg increases to a positive value indicating that the un favorability of this process is expected to be higher for example δg values for propionate conversion are calculated to be 7 63 19 54 and 32 14 kj mol at p6 p7 and p8 respectively when comparing p7 and p8 the concentration of propionate was increased as seen in fig 2 b consequently the increase of ph affected not only the conversion of h2 to ch4 but also the conversion of propionate to acetate 5 ch3ch2coo 3h2o ch3coo hco3 h 3h2 δgo 76 1 kj 6 ch3ch2ch2coo 2h2o 2ch3coo h 2h2 δgo 48 1 kj the hypothesis of our research is that by applying high pressure lower h2 injection rate would be enough for achieving high ch4 content compared to former works to compare this the achieved ch4 content and the amount of h2 injection rate olr ratio hir olr was used as an indicator as noticeably comparable in table 3 very low hir olr was required to achieve 90 of ch4 content in the biogas in our study p7 to the best of our knowledge the minimal hir olr required for achieving about ch4 of 90 was 0 39 l h2 g cod fed with sewage sludge wang et al 2013 luo et al 2012a used a mixture of cattle manure and whey as substrate and the hir olr value was 0 26 l h2 g cod but ch4 content was low at 65 to conclude it was able to produce high calorific biogas from a single digester at the minimum supply of h2 this was attributed to the fact that the h2 injection was conducted under high pressure simply when the biogas with 50 co2 is generated by the conventional ad 2 m3 of h2 is needed for upgrading 1 m3 of biogas whereas the amount of required h2 can be reduced to 1 m3 due to decline of co2 to 25 at 5 bar for this reason theoretical h2 amount to achieve 90 ch4 is 1 26 l h2 g cod but this can be reduced to 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed in this study by integrating two approaches ahpd and hid the positive roles of combining are as follows i the advantages from each approach are applicable ii the solubility of h2 can increased by the pressure iii the amount of h2 required can be reduced by the pressure and iv the pressure and h2 injection can complement each other s ph changes to tell the economic benefit of the invented process the economic assessment was conducted by comparing with the conventional hid table 4 the digester capacity for the treatment and the cod concentration were assumed to be 100 ton fw d and 200 g cod l respectively by using the obtained values at p1 table 2 the amount of biogas production was 10 687 20 ton cod d 280 m3 ch4 ton cod 0 524 ch4 content biogas m3 d in the hid and the amount of h2 required to achieve 90 of ch4 content in the biogas was 16 073 10 687 0 376 0 9 0 524 4 m3 h2 d which is approximately 1 44 ton h2 d this was calculated considering the molar ratio of h2 and co2 in hydrogenotrophic methanogenic reaction and assuming 100 consumption of added h2 to ch4 for the invented process the required amount of h2 was approximately 0 32 ton h2 d which was calculated using the mpy of 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed obtained from this study then the daily ch4 production in the hid and invented process can be obtained to 9618 10 687 0 524 16 073 4 and 6320 20 000 kg codfw 180 m3 h2 ton cod 1400 kg cod m3 h2 280 m3 ch4 kg codadded m3 d respectively the cost includes capital cost for the construction of digester annual cost operating and maintenance and h2 supplementation cost for capital cost the unit price of 100 000 usd ton cod was used beegle et al 2018 since there has been no economic evaluation for the ahpd process the capital cost adopted herein was hypothesized to be similar to that in the conventional upgrading system which is two times higher than that of conventional digester chen et al 2010 the annual cost was estimated to be 18 of capital cost beegle et al 2018 the profit can be obtained by selling ch4 and treating cod reduction fw yun et al 2018 in this assessment assuming that the cod reduction was 75 for both the hid and invented process the profit from treating fw was 2700 000 usd y 100 ton d 0 75 100 usd ton 360 d y based on the above estimated costs and profits the capital and annual cost are 2000 000 usd and 2943 206 usd y respectively and the total profit is 4569 802 usd y in the hid process then the net profit can be calculated using the capital cost considering 20 years of operation period annual cost and total profit which is 1526 595 usd y 4569 802 2000 000 20 2943 206 yun et al 2018 compared to the hid the invented process needed higher capital cost 4000 000 usd 2000 000 and lower total profit 3928 608 usd y 4569 802 usd y because of the less production of ch4 however the lower annual cost 1298 571 usd y 2943 206 usd y due to the less h2 requirement made the invented process economically more attractive than the conventional hid net profit 2403 037 usd y 1526 595 furthermore pressurization is required when the biogas is injected to the gas grid which should be above 8 bar in korea kogas 2019 since the biogas with a pressure of 5 bar is directly produced from the invented process it surely provides more economic benefit compared to the conventional hid comparing the energy calories between p1 control and p7 the energy content of 1 m3 biogas at p1 is 20 mj based on higher heating value of ch4 and 52 ch4 content in the biogas at 1 bar on the other hand the 90 of ch4 content was obtained at 5 bar resulting in the production of high calorific biogas with more than 9 times compared to p1 which is 180 mj m3 biogas when the biogas containing high calorific value is produced directly it can be distributed to external site via separate pipelines without additional refining there is no international standard for biogas injection to the gas grid but most countries have their own in the dutch and sweden for example it needs to be higher than around 44 mj m3 persson et al 2006 in case of korea a minimum heat content of 41 0 mj m3 is required and a lower webber index of 54 0 mj m3 kogas 2019 the technology proposed herein seems to be promising from engineering perspective and applicable in many countries for many reasons i it has high economic feasibility ii it generates high calorific biogas that can be directly injected to natural gas grid and iii it can handle high strength organic wastes 3 3 microbial community to explain the effect of high pressure and h2 injection on the change of microbial community the archaeal and bacterial analysis was conducted a total of 109 978 reads of archaea and bacteria were obtained the average read count was 13 748 7412 per sample in the p1 the majority of community was methanosarcina 74 5 methanobacterium 14 9 methanosaeta 4 6 and methanoculleus 2 0 which are well known methanogens in ad wang et al 2018 fig 3 however a gradual drop in the abundance of methanosarcina from 74 to 14 was noticed with the increase of pressure meanwhile the two major hydrogenotrophic methanogens hms i e methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter showed significant increases in their relative abundance by pressure increase rea et al 2007 siegert et al 2015 in addition the pearson correlation analysis pca was performed to determine the correlation between the abundances of methanogens and efficiency of the ahpd process and the analysis result was able to prove microbial community changes table s4 when the pressure in the reactor was increased the abundance of hms and ams showed a significant positive correlation with pressure especially hms similarly li et al 2017 reported that pressure increasing was accompanied with a sharp drop in the relative abundance of methanosarcina and remarkable enrichment for hms methanospirillum in terms of species level the abundance of methanobacterium subterraneum was increased from 5 3 p1 to 15 4 p2 30 5 p3 and 45 5 p4 with pressure increase and this microbe is known to be abundant at groundwater from deep rock aquifers located at a depth of 440 m with the pressure of about 40 bar kotelnikova et al 1998 the analysis results about the abundance of dominant archaea in species level were provided in the supplementary information with the accession numbers table s2 this was the first observation reporting the increased abundance of piezo tolerant methanogens in ahpd with the increase of the h2 injection amount methanosaeta and methanosarcina abundances were increased while the abundance of methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter was decreased contrary to expectations of an increase in hms abundance the abundance of methanosaeta which is an acetoclastic methanogen ams increased at p7 and p8 accompanied with residual h2 patel et al 1990 this indicates that the h2 might have been converted indirectly by homoacetogens and ams wang et al 2013 also found that the h2 was utilized not via hydrogenotrophic pathway but via the partnership between ams and homoacetogens to match with above the abundance of homoacetogens in specific clostridium coccoides and eubacterium aggregans data not shown was observed accounting for 2 4 2 4 4 4 and 7 4 at p5 p6 p7 and p8 respectively mechichi et al 1998 the pca result showed the identical tendency table s4 when the h2 was injected at a fixed pressure 5 bar the abundances of ams and homoacetogens showed a positive correlation with h2 while the abundance of hms had a negative correlation for thermodynamic reasons the increase of h2 partial pressure higher than 10 pa would cause inhibition on syntrophic reactions meng et al 2013 for instance in the reaction of propionate degradation to acetate if h2 partial pressure exceeds to 10 pa it would be thermodynamically unfavorable resulting in low mpy however in our study ch4 production continued at p7 and p8 although there was a drop at p8 when h2 partial pressure exceeded 4000 and 21 000 pa 0 04 and 0 21 bar respectively one of the possible reasons could be the role of direct interspecies electron transfer diet through diet syntrophic partners can exchange electrons efficiently regardless of high h2 pressure since δgo value for propionate degradation through diet is negative it can occur spontaneously eq 7 to ensure diet occurrence we analyzed the possibility for partnership among microbes interestingly a significant increase in the abundances of syntrophomonas and methanosaeta especially methanosaeta harundinacea was observed as seen in table s2 and table s3 their abundance were increased from 3 9 and 3 9 at p3 to 10 4 and 27 7 at p8 respectively the diet reaction between these two microbes were reported previously wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in these microbes metabolic properties syntrophomonas can convert propionate to acetate h2 or acetate electrons while methanosaeta harundinacea can receive acetate and electrons for ch4 generation as an additional evidence for diet reaction the gene analysis for pila was conducted which is known to increase its expression with the occurrence of diet lovley et al 2017 as shown in fig s1 the abundance of pila was increased as the amount of h2 injection increased up to p7 approximately 2 4 times higher value compared at p5 however at p8 there was a drop of pila expression probably due to the performance deterioration the effect of h2 pressure on triggering diet reaction in ad might be an interesting topic that deserves to be studied with more detailed experiment 7 ch3ch2coo 3h2o ch3coo hco3 7h 6e δgo 162 5 kj 4 conclusion from the continuous operation of integrating ahpd and hid for treating fw following conclusions were drawn 1 the ch4 content in the biogas was gradually increased from 52 4 at the control to 67 0 74 5 and 77 4 at 3 bar 5 bar and 7 bar respectively an mpy was maintained 0 26 0 28 l ch4 g codadded until 5 bar while it declined to 0 23 l ch4 g codadded at 7 bar due to the ph drop down to 6 7 by excess co2 dissolution 2 when the h2 injection started at 5 bar the ch4 content was gradually increased to 82 8 87 2 and 90 6 at p5 p6 and p7 respectively at p8 the ch4 content was further increased to 92 1 but the mpy was dropped to 0 24 l ch4 g codadded with ph increase to 8 7 also remained h2 of 4 0 in the biogas was detected affecting syntrophic acetogenesis thermodynamically unfavorable 3 the h2 injection under high pressure enabled to directly produce high calorific biogas 90 ch4 180 mj m3 biogas from the high strength fw at the lowest requirement of h2 0 18 l h2 g codfw fed ever reported 4 the abundance of methanobacterium subterraneum known as piezo tolerant microbe was increased from 5 to 45 as the pressure increased after h2 injection the abundances of syntrophomonas and methanosaeta harundinacea known as diet contributors were increased indicating that the presence of h2 facilitated the thermodynamically favorable

17131,the united states national forests are mixed use lands that support human recreation and cattle grazing overuse by humans or cattle however can lead to the fecal contamination of local waterways until recently the source of these contaminants was a subject of conjecture however microbial source tracking tools have become widely used and are proving to be a valid methodology to identify the contamination source this study aims to analyze and model the quantity and sources of fecal contamination in the mink creek watershed in southeastern idaho the u s forest service caribou targhee national forest usfs manages this watershed previous research has indicated that some localities within the watershed exceed us epa standards for coliform bacteria in 2019 water samples were collected before livestock began grazing and throughout the spring summer and fall after livestock grazing had ended fourteen sites were sampled seven times during the field season allowing the water to be analyzed for total coliforms and e coli bacteria microbial source tracking techniques using bacteroides bacteria which are known to live in specific digestive tracks were used to identify the source of e coli at each sampling location the analysis indicated that e coli counts exceeded state regulatory limits 35 of the time these exceedances were associated with dna source tracking markers for humans 58 8 cattle 5 9 or both cattle and humans 5 9 unknown sources were responsible for the bacteroides bacteria 29 4 of the time a statistical model was developed to estimate e coli using the datasets of microbial source tracking measures the presence or absence of humans cattle the proximity of the sampling date to a holiday and other seasonal factors the resulting model showed good performance indices at all the 14 sites based on a k fold cross validation scheme r2 0 83 and nse 0 69 the results demonstrated that e coli exceedances have a close association with human recreation

reaction cattle dna human dna 1 introduction united states forest service usfs supports human recreation and livestock grazing on national forest system lands williams 2000 approximately 1 8 million livestock graze across the national forests of the western united states alone roche et al 2013 this substantial grazing activity is part of the usfs s multiple use mandate and frequently co occurs with recreational use and wildlife activity usfs 2011 recent studies identified that recreation in the u s has increased by 7 from 2000 to 2009 and the number of days public lands utilized for recreation has increased by 30 wolf et al 2017 however fecal contamination of water resources often occurs when there is heavy use by cattle humans and wildlife in rangeland watersheds roche et al 2013 fecal contamination especially by e coli e coli can occur when fecal matter is deposited on or near streams and waterways and can lead to deterioration of water quality and water supply impairment petersen and hubbart 2020 several studies have focused on the impact of human recreation and livestock grazing on chemical and bacteriological water quality in rangelands e g roche et al 2013 most of these assessments used fecal indicator bacteria fib to monitor fecal contamination in drinking water who 2011 world health organization who and joint monitoring program for water supply and sanitation jmp lists e coli as the commonly used fib for monitoring fecal contamination who unicef 2015 however it has been historically difficult if not impossible to identify the primary source s of fecal pollution in watersheds with multiple potential inputs as is often the case in rangeland watersheds leclerc et al 2001 microbial source tracking mst has been developed to differentiate various animal sources of fecal pollution and has been used to determine sources of fecal pollution in streams harwood et al 2014 several studies have employed mst to track the target members of contamination from humans e g reischer et al 2007 ruminant e g mieszkin et al 2010 and other sources e g green et al 2012 from the collected water samples library independent source tracking methods using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has increased in popularity since they are cost effective rapid and do not require organisms culturing scott et al 2002 supporting this several model validation studies have identified that qpcr is a better tool in identifying markers associated with various sources e g layton et al 2013 various studies have employed qpcr methods to track human marker genes and identified that human recreation and its associated fecal contamination pose significant public health issues harwood et al 2014 ponce terashima et al 2014 devane et al 2019 senkbeil et al 2019 recent studies such as devane et al 2019 identified that human associated qpcr markers hold a significant positive correlation with e coli in water samples similar to human recreation cattle grazing cycles have a critical role in microbial contamination measured by e coli concentrations allocca et al 2018 for example derlet and carlson 2006 analyzed water samples collected downstream of grazed and non grazed sites in sierra nevada california and found that detectable e coli concentrations are highly probable in grazed relative to non grazed areas besides human and cattle sources seasonal changes and other abiotic factors influence the microbial indicators in surface water valeo et al 2016 e coli counts are found to hold a strong relationship with meteorological conditions such as solar radiation temperature cho et al 2010 and precipitation buckerfield et al 2019 similarly e coli growth and metabolism are strongly related to dissolved oxygen in streams baez and shiloach 2014 an increase in organic matter increases the microbes and their metabolism in the streams thereby lowering dissolved oxygen mulholland et al 2005 on the other hand high dissolved oxygen in streams corresponds with reduced e coli growth and results in a higher removal rate of coliform bacteria baez and shiloach 2017 moreover dissolved oxygen in streams drops during hot summer days coinciding with low stream flows creating an ideal environment for e coli to grow khaengraeng and reed 2005 public land managers including those with the usfs seek ways to reduce the potential impairment of waterways and watersheds in their jurisdiction in southeastern idaho the mink creek watershed had a history of e coli contamination in 2017 the idaho department of environmental quality ideq monitored seven locations in the watershed bi monthly from june october to determine e coli counts harris 2017 they found out that e coli counts exceeded the regulatory limit of 126 mpn 100 ml most probable number of e coli organisms per 100 ml at all locations except one idapa 2014 although the high e coli counts coincided with cattle movement there were spikes in coliform counts at several sites weeks to months after the cattle had left the adjacent grazing units given that wildlife and humans periodically inhabit areas within the watershed the dominant source of coliforms remained unresolved this study s objective was to determine how the timing of cattle grazing and human recreation influenced the source and quantity of e coli in the mink creek watershed 2 methods 2 1 sampling locations and timing the mink creek watershed predominately contains lands managed by the caribou targhee national forest with smaller sections of private and state managed land in which grazing and recreation co occur samples were collected from 14 locations across the watershed in 2019 of which ideq had previously sampled seven sites in 2017 fig 1 the sites sampled by ideq in 2017 include site 2 site 4 site 5 site 6 site 7 site 9 and site 11 the sites added for this study include site 1 site 3 site 8 site 10 site 12 site 13 and site 14 the new seven sites were selected based on cattle grazing and recreational locations the temperature and precipitation anomaly for the years 2017 and 2019 compared to the period 1981 2010 are shown in table 1 noaa 2020 both the years have negative precipitation anomalies indicating low rainfall compared to the mean rainfall of 1981 to 2010 the year 2019 has a positive temperature anomaly for june july and august the year 2017 has a negative temperature anomaly for june and a positive temperature anomaly for july and august in comparison between 2017 and 2019 the year 2019 was warmer and received relatively high rainfall recreation activities mountain biking hiking dog walking camping day use occurred throughout the watershed while target shooting was mostly confined to sites 9 and 10 some sites were in closer proximity to camping site 11 and site 13 while other sites were close to day use activities site 7 site 8 was near summer homes grazing occurred adjacent to site 1 site 2 site 3 site 5 site 9 site 10 site 11 site 12 site 13 and site 14 each location was sampled seven times over six months may october resulting in 98 total samples the first sampling period was at the end of may before the start of the grazing and recreational seasons the remaining sampling periods were set to mirror the movement of cattle and recreationists throughout the watershed the primary goal was to sample at each site before during and after the cattle were present the secondary goal was to time the sampling before and after holiday weekends fig 2 shows the spatial maps of cattle and humans movement with e coli exceedances marked for various measurement days there were two herds of cattle in the watershed table 2 shows the movement of cattle in the watershed the west herd had 362 cow calf pairs they were in the catch unit 758 ha from june 1 to june 30 14 animal unit days per hectare aud ha and the highway unit 1298 ha july 1 to august 15 13 aud ha the middle herd had 588 cow calf pairs they were in the lead draw unit 1350 ha from june 3 to june 23 9 aud ha the lower cow camp unit 670 ha from june 24 to july 9 13 aud ha the upper cow camp unit 1800 ha from july 10 to august 12 11 aud ha and the scout mountain unit 2030 ha from august 13 to october 2 14 aud ha sites 4 6 7 and 8 were areas fenced off and free from grazing cattle site 4 was located in west fork mink creek where a substantial recreational activity occurred site 8 was located in the east fork mink creek directly downstream from units with grazing activity and adjacent to several homes with septic systems site 6 was located on the mink creek s main stem downstream of the east fork and mink creek intersection finally site 7 was located at cherry springs which hosts considerable recreational activity as e coli tends not to be carried far downstream clark et al 2012 there is less possibility of cumulative loading of e coli on the streams while there is evidence that e coli can survive for months in soil ishii et al 2007 its survival in streams is typically measured in weeks unless they become part of the sediments at the bottom of the stream garzio hadzick et al 2010 hence the e coli from upstream grazing activity on the downstream area was minimal 2 2 sample collection two replicate water samples of 350 ml each were collected at each sampling location for e coli enumeration and mst marker quantification standard protocols per iso 19458 2006 was followed for sample collection and samples were immediately placed on ice until analysis standardization 2006 efforts were taken to prevent cross contamination among the sites the samples collected for e coli quantification were processed the same day the collected samples were put in a 80 c freezer and analyzed with qpcr quantitative polymerase chain reaction after collection the physical water quality parameters including dissolved oxygen do mg l water temperature c specific conductivity s cm and ph ysi pro20 and ysi pro1030 instruments ysi inc yellow springs oh usa were also measured at each site following calibration of the equipment in addition to the water quality parameters daily maximum air temperature c average air temperature c and daily rain accumulation converted to cm were obtained from the pocatello airport weather station a distance of approximately 25 km from the sampled areas 2 3 e coli enumeration and dna extraction e coli counts mpn 100 ml were determined according to iso 9308 2 2012 with an idexx colilert 18 quantification system idexx laboratories maine usa pitkänen 2012 in one case at site 7 the difference between the two replicate estimates of e coli exceeded 1000 mpn 100 ml hence this data was excluded from additional analysis an additional 250 ml of each sample was filtered through 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate membranes 47 mm diameter the resulting filter for each sample was aseptically transferred to 2 ml cryovials and stored at 80 c until dna extraction negative control was generated during each sampling period by running sterile water through the same procedures conducted on the samples dna from the filters was extracted using mobio powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories california usa following the manufacturer s instructions the total amount of dna present in each sample was quantified using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fischer scientific new york usa 2 4 quantitative pcr quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was used to assess the human and bovine contribution to the bacterial load in the water the amplified genes are from bacteroides bacteria and are strain specific to human or cattle digestive tracks bernhard and field 2000 each sample was screened for the bovine bacterial gene cowm2 following the protocol of shanks et al 2008 similarly the human bacterial gene hf183 was identified following the protocol of green et al 2014 table 3 lists the primers and probes used for each assay for each sample we created 25 µl qpcr reactions that comprised of 10 µl of taqman environmental master mix version 2 0 applied biosystems thermo fischer new york usa 1 µl of 1 µm of each primer 0 1 µl of 1 µm of the probe 4 9 µl of nuclease free h2o and 3 µl of 3 ng µl 1 dna template pcr conditions were 10 mins at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 30 s and 30 s at 60 c for annealing each sample was run in triplicate with appropriate negative controls to confirm that no contamination primer dimers or other artifacts amplified if dna amplification occurred in only one of the three triplicates in the rare case those data were excluded from further analysis a double stranded gblock standard integrated dna technologies iowa usa fragment of dna was designed for each target region to generate our standard curves table 3 standard curves were generated using 10 fold dilutions that ranged from 10 10 8 to 10 10 2 ng of dna reaction 1 the target copy number for each gene target was then estimated from the respective standard curve in this study we use the term cattle dna and human dna throughout the manuscript which corresponds to the bacteroide markers associated with cattle and human sources respectively 2 5 statistical analysis data collected were analyzed as either continuous data ph do conductivity maximum air temperature and pocatello precipitation data or as binary presence absence data cattle dna human dna grazing holiday or as count based e coli since three out of eleven variables under consideration were temperature variables stream temperature maximum air temperature and average air temperature which are highly correlated with each other average correlation coefficient r 0 7 we selected the maximum air temperature we excluded the other two temperature variables for the remaining analysis the maximum air temperature was selected as it showed the highest correlation with the e coli table 4 shows the correlation matrix of the datasets used and it is evident that most of these datasets are cross correlated among the 45 comparisons 20 were significant at the p value 0 01 suggesting considerable cross correlation among the variables e coli was significantly correlated with cattle dna holiday grazing do and conductivity since the variables include continuous binary and count based a mixed effects regression approach was adopted to model this dataset matlab r2019a tool was used in this study for model simulation matlab 2019 since the outcomes are discrete counts either poisson or negative binomial distribution could be adopted pearson chi squared dispersion statistic was then used to choose between poisson and negative binomial distribution loukas and kemp 1986 since the statistic was equal to one poisson distribution was selected for this study table 5 shows the model details adopted for the mixed regression approach since the distribution selected was poisson the link function selected to map the relationship between the mean response and the linear combination of the predictors was logarithmic the fit method selected was laplace with site and sample date as intercepts the number of random intercepts was 21 which includes 14 sites and 7 dates the binary variables cattle dna human dna holiday and grazing were considered as categorical variables a generalized mixed effects model was developed and the model coefficients were evaluated using t statistics p value and confidence intervals the model output e coli was calibrated against 97 observations from the 14 sites in mink creek the model output was further evaluated using r squared and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the random effects were analyzed using covariance parameters for site and sample date the model performance was also evaluated using k fold cross validation fushiki 2011 this validation scheme was applied to each site by randomly choosing 70 training data and 30 testing data this was repeated for the maximum possible combinations of training and testing datasets 21 simulations per each site to avoid selection bias rodriguez et al 2009 the model results were further evaluated based on the statistical performance indices the statistical performance indices used in this study as a measure of model validation include the coefficient of determination r2 glantz and slinker 1990 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 results 3 1 e coli exceedances the variation of e coli by 14 sites and seven measurement days are shown in fig 3 a and fig 3b of the 98 water samples collected e coli counts exceeded the ideq primary contact regulatory limit of 126 mpn 100 ml 34 times 35 the number of exceedances by date and site is also listed in table 6 all 14 sites had at least one exceedance while sites 1 and 2 experiencing exceedances four out of the seven sampling dates 57 of the seven sample dates only may 29 had no exceedances the sampling dates of july 8 and september 5 experienced 10 exceedances out of the 14 sites sampled on that date 71 relative to the secondary contact regulatory limit of 576 mpn 100 ml eight sites exceeded the limit the highest number of sites exceeding this limit occurred on july 8 with five out of 14 sites 36 showing values over 576 mpn 100 ml the highest e coli count was recorded at site 7 on september 5 with 1732 mpn 100 ml fig 4 shows the e coli values for the 14 sites in the forward axes with cattle dna and human dna presented on the reverse axes of the 34 sites that exceeded the ideq primary contact standard human dna was detected at 20 of those sites 58 8 and cattle dna was detected at two sites 5 9 both human and cattle dna were detected at two sites 5 9 neither human nor cattle specific dna was found at ten sites 29 41 the non specific dna may have been contributed by wildlife or domestic canines human dna was found most frequently on the september 5th sampling date with nine sites 3 2 e coli model results a mixed effects regression model using poisson distribution was applied for all 14 sample sites at mink creek table 7 shows the fixed effects coefficients and confidence intervals for the variables cattle dna human dna holiday grazed ph do conductivity maximum air temperature precipitation and intercept the degree of freedom was 87 obtained by subtracting the number of variables 9 variables and intercept from the total number of observations 97 the t statistic for these variables was also estimated and it was identified that cattle dna grazing and do have higher t statistic tstat 10 the p value of these variable coefficients was also small p value 0 01 suggesting high significance for these variables additionally variables such as human dna ph conductivity and intercept shows high significance with p value 0 01 the coefficients of the variables such as holiday maximum air temperature and precipitation were found to hold a less significant impact as evidenced by low t statistic and high p value the random covariance estimated was positive with the covariance of 0 43 for site and 0 31 and sample date the random effect was high for site 12 and site 3 and dates july 8 and june 20 fig 5 shows the modeled and observed e coli at each of the 14 sites the dots within each site represents the progression of the sampling season at that site the model results agree with the observed data for most sites by estimating the low e coli counts and peak values reasonably good nevertheless the e coli peak for sites 5 6 8 9 and 13 were slightly underestimated the model against observed e coli counts is also shown in fig 6 the model results agree with the observed data for most of the observations further a k fold cross validation scheme was adopted to verify the model results using the available datasets based on the cross validation scheme r squared and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse measures were also estimated as 0 83 and 0 69 respectively supporting the model selection 4 discussion the findings of this study suggest that e coli exceedances have a close association with the presence of human recreation followed by unknown sources and cattle grazing out of the 34 e coli exceedances 20 exceedances corresponded to human dna alone two exceedances corresponded to cattle dna alone two exceedances corresponded to both cattle and human dna and ten exceedances corresponded unknown sources the contribution of humans cattle unknown sources and dissolved oxygen are further discussed in sections 4 1 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 respectively 4 1 human contribution to e coli counts human dna was found at 65 of the instances that had e coli counts over 126 mpn 100 ml 22 out of 34 sites among this 58 8 20 instances corresponded to human dna alone and 5 9 2 instances corresponded to both human and cattle dna the dates with the highest number of e coli exceedances were july 8 and september 5 10 exceedances each human dna was found at 4 and 9 sites respectively those dates were also immediately after the summer holidays the correlation matrix showed that the human dna holds a statistically significant relationship with e coli in mink creek moreover the mixed effects regression model found that a holiday s presence positively influenced e coli and the regression coefficient is statistically significant at p value 0 01 this study s results reinforce the findings of previous studies e g cao et al 2018 who inferred that exposure to human waste poses a higher health risk than other sources 4 2 cattle contribution to e coli counts cattle dna was found at 12 of the instances that had e coli counts that exceeded 126 mpn 100 ml 4 out of 34 instances out of which two instances corresponded to cattle dna alone and the remaining two instances corresponded to both cattle and human dna issues with stream loading of e coli from cattle are strongly associated with periods in which ambient air temperatures are elevated similar to humans cattle favor shady spots closer to water under these high temperature conditions sprinkle et al 2019 cattle are considered to move into mild heat load when the temperature humidity index exceeds 72 du preez et al 1990 for idaho this occurs at around 79 to 80 f the date with the most cattle driven e coli exceedances was july 8 3 all of which exceeded the secondary regulatory limit 576 mpn 100 ml it should be noted that climate data on july 7 indicated that cattle on mink creek likely experienced mild heat load for at least 6 h from mid day to late afternoon 4 3 instances when the source of e coli was not found the dna analysis did not find either human or cattle specific dna in 29 of the

17131,the united states national forests are mixed use lands that support human recreation and cattle grazing overuse by humans or cattle however can lead to the fecal contamination of local waterways until recently the source of these contaminants was a subject of conjecture however microbial source tracking tools have become widely used and are proving to be a valid methodology to identify the contamination source this study aims to analyze and model the quantity and sources of fecal contamination in the mink creek watershed in southeastern idaho the u s forest service caribou targhee national forest usfs manages this watershed previous research has indicated that some localities within the watershed exceed us epa standards for coliform bacteria in 2019 water samples were collected before livestock began grazing and throughout the spring summer and fall after livestock grazing had ended fourteen sites were sampled seven times during the field season allowing the water to be analyzed for total coliforms and e coli bacteria microbial source tracking techniques using bacteroides bacteria which are known to live in specific digestive tracks were used to identify the source of e coli at each sampling location the analysis indicated that e coli counts exceeded state regulatory limits 35 of the time these exceedances were associated with dna source tracking markers for humans 58 8 cattle 5 9 or both cattle and humans 5 9 unknown sources were responsible for the bacteroides bacteria 29 4 of the time a statistical model was developed to estimate e coli using the datasets of microbial source tracking measures the presence or absence of humans cattle the proximity of the sampling date to a holiday and other seasonal factors the resulting model showed good performance indices at all the 14 sites based on a k fold cross validation scheme r2 0 83 and nse 0 69 the results demonstrated that e coli exceedances have a close association with human recreation

reaction cattle dna human dna 1 introduction united states forest service usfs supports human recreation and livestock grazing on national forest system lands williams 2000 approximately 1 8 million livestock graze across the national forests of the western united states alone roche et al 2013 this substantial grazing activity is part of the usfs s multiple use mandate and frequently co occurs with recreational use and wildlife activity usfs 2011 recent studies identified that recreation in the u s has increased by 7 from 2000 to 2009 and the number of days public lands utilized for recreation has increased by 30 wolf et al 2017 however fecal contamination of water resources often occurs when there is heavy use by cattle humans and wildlife in rangeland watersheds roche et al 2013 fecal contamination especially by e coli e coli can occur when fecal matter is deposited on or near streams and waterways and can lead to deterioration of water quality and water supply impairment petersen and hubbart 2020 several studies have focused on the impact of human recreation and livestock grazing on chemical and bacteriological water quality in rangelands e g roche et al 2013 most of these assessments used fecal indicator bacteria fib to monitor fecal contamination in drinking water who 2011 world health organization who and joint monitoring program for water supply and sanitation jmp lists e coli as the commonly used fib for monitoring fecal contamination who unicef 2015 however it has been historically difficult if not impossible to identify the primary source s of fecal pollution in watersheds with multiple potential inputs as is often the case in rangeland watersheds leclerc et al 2001 microbial source tracking mst has been developed to differentiate various animal sources of fecal pollution and has been used to determine sources of fecal pollution in streams harwood et al 2014 several studies have employed mst to track the target members of contamination from humans e g reischer et al 2007 ruminant e g mieszkin et al 2010 and other sources e g green et al 2012 from the collected water samples library independent source tracking methods using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has increased in popularity since they are cost effective rapid and do not require organisms culturing scott et al 2002 supporting this several model validation studies have identified that qpcr is a better tool in identifying markers associated with various sources e g layton et al 2013 various studies have employed qpcr methods to track human marker genes and identified that human recreation and its associated fecal contamination pose significant public health issues harwood et al 2014 ponce terashima et al 2014 devane et al 2019 senkbeil et al 2019 recent studies such as devane et al 2019 identified that human associated qpcr markers hold a significant positive correlation with e coli in water samples similar to human recreation cattle grazing cycles have a critical role in microbial contamination measured by e coli concentrations allocca et al 2018 for example derlet and carlson 2006 analyzed water samples collected downstream of grazed and non grazed sites in sierra nevada california and found that detectable e coli concentrations are highly probable in grazed relative to non grazed areas besides human and cattle sources seasonal changes and other abiotic factors influence the microbial indicators in surface water valeo et al 2016 e coli counts are found to hold a strong relationship with meteorological conditions such as solar radiation temperature cho et al 2010 and precipitation buckerfield et al 2019 similarly e coli growth and metabolism are strongly related to dissolved oxygen in streams baez and shiloach 2014 an increase in organic matter increases the microbes and their metabolism in the streams thereby lowering dissolved oxygen mulholland et al 2005 on the other hand high dissolved oxygen in streams corresponds with reduced e coli growth and results in a higher removal rate of coliform bacteria baez and shiloach 2017 moreover dissolved oxygen in streams drops during hot summer days coinciding with low stream flows creating an ideal environment for e coli to grow khaengraeng and reed 2005 public land managers including those with the usfs seek ways to reduce the potential impairment of waterways and watersheds in their jurisdiction in southeastern idaho the mink creek watershed had a history of e coli contamination in 2017 the idaho department of environmental quality ideq monitored seven locations in the watershed bi monthly from june october to determine e coli counts harris 2017 they found out that e coli counts exceeded the regulatory limit of 126 mpn 100 ml most probable number of e coli organisms per 100 ml at all locations except one idapa 2014 although the high e coli counts coincided with cattle movement there were spikes in coliform counts at several sites weeks to months after the cattle had left the adjacent grazing units given that wildlife and humans periodically inhabit areas within the watershed the dominant source of coliforms remained unresolved this study s objective was to determine how the timing of cattle grazing and human recreation influenced the source and quantity of e coli in the mink creek watershed 2 methods 2 1 sampling locations and timing the mink creek watershed predominately contains lands managed by the caribou targhee national forest with smaller sections of private and state managed land in which grazing and recreation co occur samples were collected from 14 locations across the watershed in 2019 of which ideq had previously sampled seven sites in 2017 fig 1 the sites sampled by ideq in 2017 include site 2 site 4 site 5 site 6 site 7 site 9 and site 11 the sites added for this study include site 1 site 3 site 8 site 10 site 12 site 13 and site 14 the new seven sites were selected based on cattle grazing and recreational locations the temperature and precipitation anomaly for the years 2017 and 2019 compared to the period 1981 2010 are shown in table 1 noaa 2020 both the years have negative precipitation anomalies indicating low rainfall compared to the mean rainfall of 1981 to 2010 the year 2019 has a positive temperature anomaly for june july and august the year 2017 has a negative temperature anomaly for june and a positive temperature anomaly for july and august in comparison between 2017 and 2019 the year 2019 was warmer and received relatively high rainfall recreation activities mountain biking hiking dog walking camping day use occurred throughout the watershed while target shooting was mostly confined to sites 9 and 10 some sites were in closer proximity to camping site 11 and site 13 while other sites were close to day use activities site 7 site 8 was near summer homes grazing occurred adjacent to site 1 site 2 site 3 site 5 site 9 site 10 site 11 site 12 site 13 and site 14 each location was sampled seven times over six months may october resulting in 98 total samples the first sampling period was at the end of may before the start of the grazing and recreational seasons the remaining sampling periods were set to mirror the movement of cattle and recreationists throughout the watershed the primary goal was to sample at each site before during and after the cattle were present the secondary goal was to time the sampling before and after holiday weekends fig 2 shows the spatial maps of cattle and humans movement with e coli exceedances marked for various measurement days there were two herds of cattle in the watershed table 2 shows the movement of cattle in the watershed the west herd had 362 cow calf pairs they were in the catch unit 758 ha from june 1 to june 30 14 animal unit days per hectare aud ha and the highway unit 1298 ha july 1 to august 15 13 aud ha the middle herd had 588 cow calf pairs they were in the lead draw unit 1350 ha from june 3 to june 23 9 aud ha the lower cow camp unit 670 ha from june 24 to july 9 13 aud ha the upper cow camp unit 1800 ha from july 10 to august 12 11 aud ha and the scout mountain unit 2030 ha from august 13 to october 2 14 aud ha sites 4 6 7 and 8 were areas fenced off and free from grazing cattle site 4 was located in west fork mink creek where a substantial recreational activity occurred site 8 was located in the east fork mink creek directly downstream from units with grazing activity and adjacent to several homes with septic systems site 6 was located on the mink creek s main stem downstream of the east fork and mink creek intersection finally site 7 was located at cherry springs which hosts considerable recreational activity as e coli tends not to be carried far downstream clark et al 2012 there is less possibility of cumulative loading of e coli on the streams while there is evidence that e coli can survive for months in soil ishii et al 2007 its survival in streams is typically measured in weeks unless they become part of the sediments at the bottom of the stream garzio hadzick et al 2010 hence the e coli from upstream grazing activity on the downstream area was minimal 2 2 sample collection two replicate water samples of 350 ml each were collected at each sampling location for e coli enumeration and mst marker quantification standard protocols per iso 19458 2006 was followed for sample collection and samples were immediately placed on ice until analysis standardization 2006 efforts were taken to prevent cross contamination among the sites the samples collected for e coli quantification were processed the same day the collected samples were put in a 80 c freezer and analyzed with qpcr quantitative polymerase chain reaction after collection the physical water quality parameters including dissolved oxygen do mg l water temperature c specific conductivity s cm and ph ysi pro20 and ysi pro1030 instruments ysi inc yellow springs oh usa were also measured at each site following calibration of the equipment in addition to the water quality parameters daily maximum air temperature c average air temperature c and daily rain accumulation converted to cm were obtained from the pocatello airport weather station a distance of approximately 25 km from the sampled areas 2 3 e coli enumeration and dna extraction e coli counts mpn 100 ml were determined according to iso 9308 2 2012 with an idexx colilert 18 quantification system idexx laboratories maine usa pitkänen 2012 in one case at site 7 the difference between the two replicate estimates of e coli exceeded 1000 mpn 100 ml hence this data was excluded from additional analysis an additional 250 ml of each sample was filtered through 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate membranes 47 mm diameter the resulting filter for each sample was aseptically transferred to 2 ml cryovials and stored at 80 c until dna extraction negative control was generated during each sampling period by running sterile water through the same procedures conducted on the samples dna from the filters was extracted using mobio powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories california usa following the manufacturer s instructions the total amount of dna present in each sample was quantified using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fischer scientific new york usa 2 4 quantitative pcr quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was used to assess the human and bovine contribution to the bacterial load in the water the amplified genes are from bacteroides bacteria and are strain specific to human or cattle digestive tracks bernhard and field 2000 each sample was screened for the bovine bacterial gene cowm2 following the protocol of shanks et al 2008 similarly the human bacterial gene hf183 was identified following the protocol of green et al 2014 table 3 lists the primers and probes used for each assay for each sample we created 25 µl qpcr reactions that comprised of 10 µl of taqman environmental master mix version 2 0 applied biosystems thermo fischer new york usa 1 µl of 1 µm of each primer 0 1 µl of 1 µm of the probe 4 9 µl of nuclease free h2o and 3 µl of 3 ng µl 1 dna template pcr conditions were 10 mins at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 30 s and 30 s at 60 c for annealing each sample was run in triplicate with appropriate negative controls to confirm that no contamination primer dimers or other artifacts amplified if dna amplification occurred in only one of the three triplicates in the rare case those data were excluded from further analysis a double stranded gblock standard integrated dna technologies iowa usa fragment of dna was designed for each target region to generate our standard curves table 3 standard curves were generated using 10 fold dilutions that ranged from 10 10 8 to 10 10 2 ng of dna reaction 1 the target copy number for each gene target was then estimated from the respective standard curve in this study we use the term cattle dna and human dna throughout the manuscript which corresponds to the bacteroide markers associated with cattle and human sources respectively 2 5 statistical analysis data collected were analyzed as either continuous data ph do conductivity maximum air temperature and pocatello precipitation data or as binary presence absence data cattle dna human dna grazing holiday or as count based e coli since three out of eleven variables under consideration were temperature variables stream temperature maximum air temperature and average air temperature which are highly correlated with each other average correlation coefficient r 0 7 we selected the maximum air temperature we excluded the other two temperature variables for the remaining analysis the maximum air temperature was selected as it showed the highest correlation with the e coli table 4 shows the correlation matrix of the datasets used and it is evident that most of these datasets are cross correlated among the 45 comparisons 20 were significant at the p value 0 01 suggesting considerable cross correlation among the variables e coli was significantly correlated with cattle dna holiday grazing do and conductivity since the variables include continuous binary and count based a mixed effects regression approach was adopted to model this dataset matlab r2019a tool was used in this study for model simulation matlab 2019 since the outcomes are discrete counts either poisson or negative binomial distribution could be adopted pearson chi squared dispersion statistic was then used to choose between poisson and negative binomial distribution loukas and kemp 1986 since the statistic was equal to one poisson distribution was selected for this study table 5 shows the model details adopted for the mixed regression approach since the distribution selected was poisson the link function selected to map the relationship between the mean response and the linear combination of the predictors was logarithmic the fit method selected was laplace with site and sample date as intercepts the number of random intercepts was 21 which includes 14 sites and 7 dates the binary variables cattle dna human dna holiday and grazing were considered as categorical variables a generalized mixed effects model was developed and the model coefficients were evaluated using t statistics p value and confidence intervals the model output e coli was calibrated against 97 observations from the 14 sites in mink creek the model output was further evaluated using r squared and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the random effects were analyzed using covariance parameters for site and sample date the model performance was also evaluated using k fold cross validation fushiki 2011 this validation scheme was applied to each site by randomly choosing 70 training data and 30 testing data this was repeated for the maximum possible combinations of training and testing datasets 21 simulations per each site to avoid selection bias rodriguez et al 2009 the model results were further evaluated based on the statistical performance indices the statistical performance indices used in this study as a measure of model validation include the coefficient of determination r2 glantz and slinker 1990 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 results 3 1 e coli exceedances the variation of e coli by 14 sites and seven measurement days are shown in fig 3 a and fig 3b of the 98 water samples collected e coli counts exceeded the ideq primary contact regulatory limit of 126 mpn 100 ml 34 times 35 the number of exceedances by date and site is also listed in table 6 all 14 sites had at least one exceedance while sites 1 and 2 experiencing exceedances four out of the seven sampling dates 57 of the seven sample dates only may 29 had no exceedances the sampling dates of july 8 and september 5 experienced 10 exceedances out of the 14 sites sampled on that date 71 relative to the secondary contact regulatory limit of 576 mpn 100 ml eight sites exceeded the limit the highest number of sites exceeding this limit occurred on july 8 with five out of 14 sites 36 showing values over 576 mpn 100 ml the highest e coli count was recorded at site 7 on september 5 with 1732 mpn 100 ml fig 4 shows the e coli values for the 14 sites in the forward axes with cattle dna and human dna presented on the reverse axes of the 34 sites that exceeded the ideq primary contact standard human dna was detected at 20 of those sites 58 8 and cattle dna was detected at two sites 5 9 both human and cattle dna were detected at two sites 5 9 neither human nor cattle specific dna was found at ten sites 29 41 the non specific dna may have been contributed by wildlife or domestic canines human dna was found most frequently on the september 5th sampling date with nine sites 3 2 e coli model results a mixed effects regression model using poisson distribution was applied for all 14 sample sites at mink creek table 7 shows the fixed effects coefficients and confidence intervals for the variables cattle dna human dna holiday grazed ph do conductivity maximum air temperature precipitation and intercept the degree of freedom was 87 obtained by subtracting the number of variables 9 variables and intercept from the total number of observations 97 the t statistic for these variables was also estimated and it was identified that cattle dna grazing and do have higher t statistic tstat 10 the p value of these variable coefficients was also small p value 0 01 suggesting high significance for these variables additionally variables such as human dna ph conductivity and intercept shows high significance with p value 0 01 the coefficients of the variables such as holiday maximum air temperature and precipitation were found to hold a less significant impact as evidenced by low t statistic and high p value the random covariance estimated was positive with the covariance of 0 43 for site and 0 31 and sample date the random effect was high for site 12 and site 3 and dates july 8 and june 20 fig 5 shows the modeled and observed e coli at each of the 14 sites the dots within each site represents the progression of the sampling season at that site the model results agree with the observed data for most sites by estimating the low e coli counts and peak values reasonably good nevertheless the e coli peak for sites 5 6 8 9 and 13 were slightly underestimated the model against observed e coli counts is also shown in fig 6 the model results agree with the observed data for most of the observations further a k fold cross validation scheme was adopted to verify the model results using the available datasets based on the cross validation scheme r squared and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse measures were also estimated as 0 83 and 0 69 respectively supporting the model selection 4 discussion the findings of this study suggest that e coli exceedances have a close association with the presence of human recreation followed by unknown sources and cattle grazing out of the 34 e coli exceedances 20 exceedances corresponded to human dna alone two exceedances corresponded to cattle dna alone two exceedances corresponded to both cattle and human dna and ten exceedances corresponded unknown sources the contribution of humans cattle unknown sources and dissolved oxygen are further discussed in sections 4 1 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 respectively 4 1 human contribution to e coli counts human dna was found at 65 of the instances that had e coli counts over 126 mpn 100 ml 22 out of 34 sites among this 58 8 20 instances corresponded to human dna alone and 5 9 2 instances corresponded to both human and cattle dna the dates with the highest number of e coli exceedances were july 8 and september 5 10 exceedances each human dna was found at 4 and 9 sites respectively those dates were also immediately after the summer holidays the correlation matrix showed that the human dna holds a statistically significant relationship with e coli in mink creek moreover the mixed effects regression model found that a holiday s presence positively influenced e coli and the regression coefficient is statistically significant at p value 0 01 this study s results reinforce the findings of previous studies e g cao et al 2018 who inferred that exposure to human waste poses a higher health risk than other sources 4 2 cattle contribution to e coli counts cattle dna was found at 12 of the instances that had e coli counts that exceeded 126 mpn 100 ml 4 out of 34 instances out of which two instances corresponded to cattle dna alone and the remaining two instances corresponded to both cattle and human dna issues with stream loading of e coli from cattle are strongly associated with periods in which ambient air temperatures are elevated similar to humans cattle favor shady spots closer to water under these high temperature conditions sprinkle et al 2019 cattle are considered to move into mild heat load when the temperature humidity index exceeds 72 du preez et al 1990 for idaho this occurs at around 79 to 80 f the date with the most cattle driven e coli exceedances was july 8 3 all of which exceeded the secondary regulatory limit 576 mpn 100 ml it should be noted that climate data on july 7 indicated that cattle on mink creek likely experienced mild heat load for at least 6 h from mid day to late afternoon 4 3 instances when the source of e coli was not found the dna analysis did not find either human or cattle specific dna in 29 of the instances 10 out of 34 the qpcr design looked for bacteroides specific to and ubiquitous in either cattle or humans thus we are confident that those two groups were not the source of this

17132,quorum sensing qs plays a crucial role during initial biofilm formation however the qs threshold and the response of biofilm formation towards n acyl homoserine lactones ahls remains largely unknown due to the limitation of nondestructive online methods for monitoring bacterial adherence and the complexity of qs system which limits the application of qs signal reagents in biofilm reactors in this study bacterial qs threshold and its response of biofilm formation to ahls in purely cultured sphingomonas rubra biofilm as well as in three different wastewater biofilms 1 3 were investigated via real time cell analysis rtca the main perspective was to study the biomass adherence in response to 12 different forms of ahls at different concentrations results showed that bacterial adhesion was significantly improved by exogenous ahls with the maximum increase of 2 26 2 36 2 52 and 2 80 times biomass production in the four respective biofilms although the preferred form of ahl differed for various biofilms the long chain ahls 12 14 carbons resulted in an overall improvement of bacterial adhesion due to their stronger hydrophobicity and hydrolysis resistance in addition bacterial qs threshold of ahls was observed to have a wide range of concentration from 10 ng l to 10 μg l meanwhile qs response time to ahls also showed a significant difference in different biofilms biofilm 2 inoculated with bulking sludge had lower qs threshold of 10 ng l and faster response to most ahls that is less than 6 h thus considering the improvement of biofilm adhesion by ahls 10 ng l of c12 hsl 10 ng l of c12 hsl and 10 ng l of c6 hsl were preferentially selected for wastewater biofilms 1 3 respectively unexpectedly adding high concentration of ahls detected in sludges did not significantly improved the bacterial adhesion infact the addition of these ahls at low concentrations or even undetected concentrations substantially improved bacterial adhesion which could be explained by bacterial communities composition according to the pearson correlation analysis 62 of the top 50 most abundant genera in bacterial communities were significantly negatively related to the response time of multiple ahls representing their fast qs response the qs bacteria dechloromonas and nitrospira have fast qs response for c4 hsl and c8 hsl while comamonadaceae has fast qs response for 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl in contrast the rest 38 of the top most abundant genera such as ferruginibacter hyphomicrobium and terrimonas quickly responded to only one ahl showing significant negative relationship with the response time of c6 hsl overall this study provides an effective and convenient means to select appropriate ahl reagents to promote bacterial adhesion in biofilm systems moreover it also suggests that exogenous ahls may be useful in improving the settling property of bulking sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacterial initial adhesion quorum sensing threshold quorum sensing response rtca sludge bulking 1 introduction effective and rapid start up of biofilm based reactors in wastewater treatment processes is highly desirable liu et al 2017 young et al 2017 however the foundation for the development of the biofilm in these reactors lay in initial bacterial adhesion hori and matsumoto 2010 peterson et al 2015 the process of bacterial adhesion can be divided into two stages the primary or reversible stage and the secondary or irreversible phase primary adhesion is quite a serendipitous event between planktonic bacteria and substratum surfaces marshall 1985 according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory the initial contact of bacteria on nascent substratum surfaces is influenced by the surface properties of both bacterial cell and substratum as well as physicochemical forces bayoudh et al 2006 nguyen et al 2016 primary adhesion is further influenced by environmental factors such as the presence of cations in inoculated sludge wang et al 2018 hence the process of bacterial adhesion can be improved by optimizing surface properties for example increasing surface roughness and hydrophobicity habimana et al 2014 lorite et al 2011 this reversible stage of bacterial adhesion is nonspecific dunne 2002 and the repeated contacts between bacterial cells and the surface provide opportunities for bacteria to adapt to the surface lee et al 2018 wang et al 2020b resulting in the strong instability during initial bacterial adhesion during the secondary or irreversible phase of adhesion loosely bound bacteria produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to consolidate their adhesion interestingly planktonic bacteria can also stick to each other or different species of surface bound members forming aggregates on the substratum dunne 2002 the presence of this cooperation behaviors among the microorganisms can promote initial adhesion which emphasizes the importance of biological interactions in bacterial communities recently bacterial community composition and biological interactions have been reported to play a substantial role in this process liu et al 2020 proposed that the initial unstable bacterial adhesion was regulated by the abundant members of the microbial community and at the same time was also regulated by the bacterial cooperation conclusively the bacterial adhesion can be promoted by enhancing the biological cooperation during initial biofilm formation measures to optimize the surface properties of substratum have been widely proposed to facilitate bacterial primary adhesion however strategies to promote the irreversible adhesion phase of initial biofilm formation by regulating the biological interactions are still lacking n acyl homoserine lactones ahls mediated quorum sensing qs is a crucial mechanism used by gram negative bacteria for cell to cell communication this process has long been recognized to control biofilm development due to its generic role in cell density dependent gene regulation bryers 2008 shrout et al 2012 it is known that various qs regulated genes are expressed only once a critical threshold concentration of extracellular ahl signals is attained resulting in the activation of qs controlled function seet and zhang 2011 williams et al 2007 although the threshold ahl concentration is crucial for qs activation qs threshold remains largely unknown due to the complex circuitry of qs regulated genes xiao et al 2006 in previous studies the qs threshold in pure culture of pseudomonas aeruginosa was estimated siehnel et al 2010 reported that the cell density thresholds for qs controlled genes rsal lasb pa1656 and lasl in p aeruginosa had the respective od600 values of 0 34 0 87 0 32 and 0 61 additionally seet and zhang 2011 proposed a new mechanism governing the qs threshold in p aeruginosa which is that the presence of qsla gene related to the production of an anti activator resulted in a nine fold increase in the required 3oc12 hsl to reach the qs threshold moreover since bacteria can use multiple qs signals to infer both their social and physical environment cornforth et al 2014 proposed that in case bacteria use two different ahls a bistable threshold is reached depending on the quantities of both ahl molecules considering the high complexity of qs network and the differences in qs system of different bacteria it is extremely difficult to determine whether the qs threshold is reached in multiple bacteria biofilms from the perspective of gene expression recently with the help of emerging monitoring methods the initial bacterial adhesion process has been quantitatively investigated from the perspective of biomass population liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020b given that biomass is a generic property regulated by bacterial qs using it as an indicator is a feasible way to comprehensively describe the qs threshold adding the ahls exogenously cause the qs threshold to reach in advance strengthening the qs controlled functions thus the addition of exogenous ahls has been widely applied in biofilm based reactors nealson et al 1970 wang et al 2020c exogenous ahls at a level of μg l were found to significantly promote extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and accelerate the granulation of aerobic granular sludge li et al 2017 tan et al 2014 hu et al 2016 and wang et al 2020b also reported the effect of exogenous ahls on the increase in biofilm formation and biofilm activity however it is also reported that the biofilm formation is influenced at low ahl concentrations while it gets inhibited at high ahl concentrations a linear relationship between ahl concentration and biofilm formation thus exists only at low ahl concentrations wang et al 2020c moreover if too many exogenous ahls molecules exist for too long in the vicinity of a bacterial community the ability of the bacterial community to respond to environmental changes is limited tait et al 2005 which again emphasizes the importance of ahl concentration meanwhile to avoid the invalidation of ahl signals caused by the delay of qs response fast qs response is desired to realize expected functions in time when the different forms of ahls are considered the ahl activity varies depending upon its form the decay rate of short chain ahl is reported to be higher than that of long chain ahls cornforth et al 2014 and ahls with a substituent 3 oxo or 3 hydroxy are reported to be more active than the unsubstituted ahls tait et al 2005 different ahls have different influence on biofilm formation and hence it is crucial to select the appropriate ahl forms moreover for multi species biofilms required ahl types and qs response to different ahls are dictated by bacterial communities especially the qs bacteria responsible for producing or sensing ahl signals hence the relationship between ahls and microbial communities also needs to be focused in this study the effect of 12 kinds of ahls on a pure cultured biofilm and on wastewater biofilms during initial biofilm formation was investigated via real time cell analysis rtca the qs threshold and response to various ahls was characterized from the perspective of biomass adherence which is a generic property regulated by bacterial qs in addition the relationship between qs response and bacterial community was investigated considering the biofilm property qs response and ahls concentration an effective method to promote bacterial adhesion during initial biofilm formation was thus proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 rtca assays the initial adhesion process of bacterial biofilms was monitored via rtca system dp agilent usa an rtca assay mainly consists of the following steps a preparation of bacterial culture fig 1 a an individual strain and three mixed bacterial cultures from different municipal wwtps were used in this study sphingomonas rubra sp nov ncbi genbank accession number fj834325 preservation no 1 9113 possessing an excellent quorum sensing system was purchased from the china general microbiological culture collection center three mixed bacterial strains were obtained from aerobic activated sludge sampled from the aerobic tanks of three wwtps and were named as 1 2 and 3 detailed in table s1 all the samples were homogenized and filtered according to a previously reported method wang et al 2018 subsequently 1 ml of the bacterial suspensions of s rubra and samples 1 2 and 3 were transferred to 100 ml each of sterile luria broth lb under sterile conditions the lb media consisted of 1 g peptone sigma aldrich germany 0 5 g yeast extract sigma aldrich germany and 0 5 g nacl each sample mixture was then incubated at 25 c for 18 h with rotary shaking at 120 rpm to obtain uniform bacterial culture since the initial bacterial concentration for rtca assays is recommended to be diluted to an optical density of 0 05 at 600 nm od600 wang et al 2020b the od600 was determined prior to the test b preparation of different concentrations of ahls fig 1b twelve kinds of standard ahl reagents including c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl c12 hsl c14 hsl 3oc6 hsl 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl were purchased from sigma aldrich usa to prepare 20 mg l stock solutions each ahl was dissolved in methanol hplc grade 99 9 and stored in tightly sealed vials at 20 c the vials were taken out 1 hour before use allowing solutions to equilibrate to room temperature subsequently 1 mg l 100 μg l 10 μg l 1 μg l 100 ng l and 10 ng l solutions of different ahls were prepared by diluting the stock solutions with sterile lb medium this step was carried out under sterile conditions c operation of rtca fig 1c rtca system consists of two core parts the microelectrodes based e plate and the real time monitor positioned in a 25 c incubator the control workstation a computer with rtca software version 2 1 2 agilent usa installed was placed outside the incubator and connected to the monitor all the liquids used for the assay were preheated to 25 c in an incubator first ahl solutions with different concentrations were added to the e plate under sterile conditions clean bench which was then placed in the monitor to clear the background impedance of ahl solutions the e plate was subsequently removed from the container and placed on a clean bench bacterial culture was added to the e plate which was then sealed with parafilm and put back into the monitor immediately it is to be noted that the working volume of a single well of the e plate is 260 μl therefore the volume of the bacterial culture must be derived based on the original od600 while the volume of ahl solution to be added to each well can be subsequently calculated once the e plate is placed into the monitor the monitoring test is set to take a reading every 5 min for 24 h via the rtca software experiment groups eg refer to the rtca assay with the addition of exogenous ahls and the control groups include assays without exogenous ahls all the experiments were performed in triplicates 2 2 analysis of sludge properties the dissolved oxygen do ph and conductivity of sludge samples

toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany spatial structures of extracellular polymeric substance eps produced in the sludge samples were measured according to a previous study xu et al 2020 sludge eps extraction was conducted using the formaldehyde naoh method briefly around 200 ml of resuspended sludge sample was taken into ten 50 ml centrifugal tubes to each centrifuge tube 0 1 ml formaldehyde 37 was added and was allowed to stand for 1 h at 4 c thereafter 8 ml naoh 1 mol l was added into each centrifugal tube and allowed to stand for 3 h at 4 c subsequently the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 12 000 g and 4 c and the supernatants were collected finally the entire supernatant collected was filtrated using a 0 45 um membrane and purified using a dialysis membrane 3500 dalton for 24 h at 4 c the spatial configuration of eps was determined by using a multiangle static and dynamic light scattering instrument bi 200sm brookhaven instruments corporation usa according to a previous study xu et al 2020 parameter ρ rg rh was used to reflect the spatial configuration of eps here rg represents the z average root mean square radius of gyration of eps and rh represents the hydrodynamic radius of eps in brief these two parameters were respectively obtained via the static laser scatterer sls and dynamic laser scatterer dls to measure rg samples were placed on the loading platform under the sls pattern and the measurement angle was set in a range of 15º to 135º to determine rh samples were positioned on the loading platform for 2 min under the dls pattern at the measurement angle of 90º 2 3 ahls extraction and determination the homogenized sludge was centrifuged at 6000 g for 5 min extracellular ahls present in the supernatant were extracted

was automatically calculated by the supporting software rtca version 2 1 2 agilent usa statistical analyses of the data from rtca assays were carried out via pearson s correlation analysis using ibm spss version 26 0 ibm corp usa the level of statistical significance was set to p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial adhesion characteristics during initial biofilm formation activated sludge from the aerobic tanks of the three wwtps 1 2 and 3 were collected and were used as the inoculating sludge for biofilm formation tests the process of initial biofilm formation by s rubra 1 2 and 3 was quantified using microelectrode based rtca it has been reported in the previous studies that the process of biomass adhesion on the microelectrode surface can result in impedance increase and hence augment the cell index ci value ferrer et al 2017 gutierrez et al 2016 specifically the increase in ci value represents that the probability of bacterial adhesion is greater than that of their detachment and vice versa as shown in fig 2 ci values of s rubra 1 2 and 3 fluctuated in varying degrees and reached maximum in 6 to 7 h however the ci values of s rubra 1 and 3 thereafter decreased and reached stable values after 14 44 h 10 76 h and 11 69 h respectively in contrast the ci value of 2 showed a higher instability during the entire process of initial biofilm formation in fact the ci of 2 was instable and showed a continuous decrease even at 18 49 h to be specific it was observed that only one significant decrease in ci of s rubra 1 and 3 was detected before the maximum value was obtained whereas three significant reductions in ci was observed for 2 biofilms derived from the three activated sludge samples were multispecies while the pure culture biofilm consisted of only one species according to previous studies the initial adhesion process is highly regulated by microbial interactions liu et al 2020 and planktonic bacteria can stick to different species of surface bound bacteria to form aggregates on the substratum dunne 2002 in conclusion microbial interactions among different species are important to initial biofilm formation hence the difference between initial adhesion characteristics of pure culture biofilms and multiple multi species biofilms in this study may be mainly attributed to the significant difference in community composition in addition the initial bacterial adhesion has been widely reported to be influenced by eps secretion in the sludge the components of eps such as ps and pn contribute towards the formation of a conditioning layer on the substratum surface altering its properties and hence assisting a quick and firm bacterial adhesion garrett et al 2008 the unstable adhesion time during initial biofilm formation however could not be explained well by the eps content by a previous study liu et al 2020 thus to better understand the initial bacterial adhesion the influence of sludge properties including the settling property and spatial configuration of eps were considered in this study table s2 herein the parameter ρ related to the chain architecture and conformation of biopolymer was used to describe the spatial shape of the eps the ρ value for completely extended chains is around 1 50 xu et al 2018b for a random coil it changes from 1 50 to 2 00 and for a rigid rod it is greater than 2 00 kazakov et al 2002 in the current work it was observed that the ρ values of eps in sludge 1 2 and 3 were 2 27 0 09 1 66 0 06 and 1 94 0 04 respectively therefore it can be deduced that the shape of sludge 1 eps was rigid rod and the shape of sludge 2 and 3 tended to be random coils moreover it can be noted that the ρ value of eps in sludge 2 eps was smaller than that of 1 and 3 which indicated that the spatial structure of eps from sludge 1 and 3 was less dense than that from sludge 2 according to a previous study xu et al 2020 the loose physical structure of the sludge flocs results in larger pores in the sludge interior and subsequently results in higher mobility of organic molecules hence loose structured eps could provide more opportunities for macromolecular substances to form a conditioning layer on the substrate surface to promote bacterial adhesion it was also observed that the svi of sludge 1 3 had huge difference the svi of 1 and 3 was 39 3 2 8 ml g and 56 3 7 5 ml g respectively representing that these two types of sludge possessed good settling properties while 2 showed a higher svi of 196 1 23 1 ml g the initial increase of ci value is highly attributed to the mass transport of biomass towards the microelectrode surface which is determined by bacterial sedimentation li et al 2011 the good settling properties of 1 and 3 resulted in high rates of biomass augmentation in the first 4 h however the poor settling property of sludge 2 suggested that the mass transport of both biopolymer and bacteria towards the microelectrode surface was weak in this case accordingly the possibility of bacterial adhesion to the microelectrode surface was relatively reduced which may account for the strong instability of initial biofilm formation of sludge 2 in addition to the physico chemical properties of sludge another important factor that influences bacterial adhesion is the bacterial community composition especially the abundant population that can determine bacterial unstable adhesion time liu et al 2020 in this study the unstable adhesion time of 1 and 3 was found to be similar while that of 2 was significantly higher as represented in fig s1 tetrasphaera and microtrichales the frequently reported filamentous bacteria griffin and wells 2017 b wang et al 2020a s xu et al 2018a zhang et al 2019 existed in sludge 2 with a total abundance of up to 10 43 also considering the poor settling property and the presence of filamentous flocs under the microscope figure s2 sludge 2 belonged to filamentous bulking accounting for the long unstable adhesion time of sludge 2 overall since the occurrence of filamentous bacteria and the poor settling property of sludge the initial biofilm formation process with filamentous bulking sludge as the inoculated sludge was highly unstable 3 2 regulation of initial bacterial adhesion by ahl mediated quorum sensing ahl mediated qs was reported to play an important role in the process of initial biofilm formation thus the addition of exogenous ahls has been proposed to promote biofilm formation in biofilm reactors lv et al 2014 wang et al 2020b however the threshold ahls concentration and its response time remains unclear due to the complicated nature of biofilms in this study 12 types of ahls were separately added to the rtca system to investigate the effect of exogenous ahls on both pure culture biofilms and complicated wastewater biofilms herein the threshold concentration was defined as the lowest ahl concentration required for experimental groups to exhibit significantly higher ci level as compared to the control groups the response time was defined as the time needed for ci values of experiment groups to be significantly higher than the control groups 3 2 1 quorum sensing threshold in biofilms to ahls as shown in fig 3 the ahls detected in pure culture s rubra as sorted by their concentrations from high to low were c4 hsl 3oc10 hsl c10 hsl c6 hsl and c14 hsl with a total concentration of 687 65 45 82 ng l on the other hand the total ahl concentration of sludge 1 2 and 3 was 141 19 16 32 ng l 195 73 19 60 ng l and 190 38 14 23 ng l respectively specifically four kinds of ahls were detected in sludge 1 represented in a decreasing order of concentration as 3oc6 hsl c7 hsl c4 hsl and 3oc8 hsl in sludge 2 apart from these four ahls c14 hsl was detected at a higher concentration and c12 hsl was detected at a lower concentration besides c14 hsl was also detected in sludge 3 the concentration of c7 hsl was the highest in sludge 3 followed by 3oc6 hsl as shown in fig 4 ci values of s rubra were improved with the addition of exogenous c4 hsl c7 hsl 3oc10 hsl and c14 hsl the threshold concentrations of these four ahls were 100 ng l 10 µg l 1000 µg l and 1 µg l respectively while their optimal concentrations resulting in maximum promotion of adhering biomass were 100 ng l 100 µg l 1000 µg l and 10 µg l respectively in case of the biofilm 1 seven ahls were observed to enhance the biomass adhesion including c7 hsl c12 hsl c14 hsl 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl among these the threshold concentration of c12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl was 10 ng l while that of the other five ahls was 10 µg l the optimal concentration for all the ahls with respect to biomass adherence was found to be similar to their threshold concentration the most significant increase in the biofilm adherence of s rubra and 1 were observed when supplemented with 10 µg l of c14 hsl at this time the ci values of the s rubra and 1 experimental groups were 2 26 0 33 and 2 36 0 21 times that of the control groups respectively on the other hand multiple forms of ahls except c6 hsl and c14 hsl significantly promoted the bacterial adhesion in wastewater biofilms 2 at the same low threshold concentration of 10 ng l in this case the optimal concentration of c10 hsl c12 hsl and 3oc12 hsl was 1 µg l 10 µg l and 1 µg l respectively while that of the other kinds of ahls was only 10 ng l biofilms 2 exhibited the largest ci value which was 2 52 0 11 times that of the control in the presence of 10 µg l of exogenous 3oc14 hsl in biofilm 3 the biomass adhesion was significantly increased with the addition of the following seven ahls c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c10 hsl c14 hsl 3oc6 hsl and 3oc14 hsl the corresponding threshold concentrations of the respective ahls were 1 µg l 10 ng l 1 µg l 10 µg l 1 µg l 10 ng l and 1 µg l while their optimal concentrations were also similar to the threshold concentrations it was observed that the ci values increased by more than 2 7 fold in response to 10 ng l of c6 hsl 1 µg l of c7 hsl and 10 µg l of c10 hsl initial bacterial adhesion in case of the pure cultured s rubra was found to be increased by the exogenous addition of only four kinds of ahls while other wastewater biofilms responded to most of the different ahls this clearly indicates the complexity of ahl driven qs in wastewater biofilm communities in addition the result confirms the cross communication among the bacterial community that various ahls produced by different members could be shared among gram negative bacteria in heterogenous biofilms gonzález et al 2013 this cooperative behavior mediated by ahl molecules is conducive to initial bacterial adhesion liu et al 2020 however adding high concentration of ahls in sludge did not bring about significant enhancement in bacterial adhesion but adding the low or even undetected concentrations substantially promoted the process which might be due to the succession of bacterial communities it has also been reported that the ahls profile of sessile biofilm communities differed greatly from that of the suspended sludge communities due to the differences in community composition bao et al 2020 apart from this since ahl producing bacteria are in dynamic succession during biofilm formation dominant ahls also vary continuously hu et al 2016 huang et al 2009 moreover the threshold concentrations of the predominant ahls observed in the different types of sludge were observed to be overall higher it is thus reflected that ahls with low concentrations in sludges limited the rapid adhesion of bacteria previous studies have also reported that the effect of various ahls on bacterial adhesion was related to the chemical structure of ahls in one such study tait et al 2005 proposed that ahls with a 3 oxo or 3 hydroxy substituent were more active in promoting bacterial adhesion than the un substituted ahls similarly li et al 2015 reported that ahls with β position substituent group have more significant effect on promoting the attached growth of autotrophic nitrifying sludge in the current study ahls with carbonyl as the substituent group such as 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl significantly affected the bacterial adhesion in case of biofilms 1 and 2 while for wastewater biofilms 3 a clear predominance of unsubstituted ahls was observed additionally the long chain ahls 12 14 carbons despite having a lower molar concentration than their shorter chain counterparts had a significantly higher promoting influence over bacterial adhesion this was attributed to the relative stability of long chain ahls against hydrolysis decho et al 2010 conclusively due to the complexity of biofilm communities it is difficult to determine the universal ahl forms of different biofilms that can promote initial bacterial adhesion thus for a better understanding of the appropriate ahls required for various biofilms the respective bacterial community composition needs to be considered 3 2 2 quorum sensing response in biofilms to ahls the rapid start up of biofilm reactors and biofilm formation has always been desired liu et al 2017 young et al 2017 thus apart from the biofilm promoting effect of exogenous ahls the response time of bacteria to ahls also needs to be considered herein the response time was defined as the time required for ci values of experimental groups to be significantly higher than that of the control groups as shown in fig 5 supplementing the s rubra biofilms with the optimal concentrations of exogenous c14 hsl resulted in the shortest response time of 5 99 h in case of biofilms 1 3oc10 hsl resulted in the shortest response time of 1 93 h while c10 hsl resulted in the shortest response time of 1 00 h and 5 85 h in case of biofilms 2 and 3 respectively comparing fig 4 and fig 5 it is apparent that ahls showing the greatest effect on biomass adhesion were not necessarily the ones showing the fastest response to promote adhesion specifically long chain ahls with 12 to 14 carbons showed stronger effect on biomass adhesion while medium chain ahls with 10 carbons had the fastest effect which is presumed to be the composite outcome of hydrophobicity hydrolysis resistance and molarity of ahl molecules in detail long chain ahls 12 14 carbons possess stronger hydrophobicity and hydrolysis resistance which contributes to their long term effectiveness and thus showed stronger effects on biomass adhesion compared with long chain ahls the medium chain ahls with 10 carbons despite having relatively poor hydrolysis resistance have higher molarity owing to the same mass concentration and smaller molecular mass hence ahls with 10 carbons showed faster promotion of bacterial adhesion than long chain ahls proceeding to analyze wastewater biofilms faster biomass increment that is shorter response time was found in biofilm 2 with overall response time within 6 h nevertheless the response time of biofilm 2 and 3 to various ahls varied significantly especially the response time in biofilm 3 was more than 6 h qs is a cell density dependent mechanism of communication in bacterial population in terms of gram negative bacteria it is activated when extracellular concentration of ahls reaches the threshold hence adding exogenous ahl reagents can reduce the time required to reach a threshold concentration for the auto induction and eps production gonzález et al 2013 thus accelerating the bacterial adhesion fig 4 adding exogenous ahls proved to be an effective way to improve the initial bacterial adhesion during biofilm formation it must be noted that for ahl reagents to be effective they must have a finite life that is in accordance with the function they control if exogenous ahls exist for too long the ability of the bacterial community to respond to various environmental changes would be limited tait et al 2005 therefore apart from achieving a stronger promotion of bacterial adhesion and fast response low concentration of ahls is an essential factor to be considered which is also important from the perspective of cost reduction taken together c12 hsl is preferentially selected for the improved adhesion of wastewater biofilms 1 and 2 and c6 hsl is the preferred form of ahl for wastewater biofilms 3 with optimal concentration of only 10 ng l in addition it is noteworthy that for biofilm 2 not only the threshold concentration of ahl is low 10 ng l in fig 4 but the qs response is also faster than that in the case of biofilms 1 and 3 fig 5 meanwhile the svi of bulking sludge 2 reduced from 196 1 23 1 ml g to 129 3 17 1 ml g when 10 ng l of c12 hsl was added these results suggested an effective way to improve the settling property of bulking sludge by adding ahls 3 3 influence of community composition on quorum sensing response to better understand the differences in qs response of different biofilms to ahls bacterial community structure needs to be investigated as shown in fig 6 pearson correlation coefficients were calculated by comparing the response time and the relative abundance of the top 50 most abundant genera in activated sludge communities since longer response time represents slower qs response the negative correlation between genus abundance and a specific ahl indicates a faster response of bacteria to that ahl most bacteria in cluster 1 such as phaeodactylibacter dechloromonas and nitrospira showed significantly negative relationship with c4 hsl and c8 hsl suggesting that they could quickly sense these two ahls and activate their qs system comamonadaceae in cluster 1 were significantly negatively related to 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl indicating the bacterial ability to utilize medium and long chain ahls with a carbonyl substituent members of a4b steroidobacteraceae caldilineaceae and methylotenera belonged to cluster 2 and ferruginibacter candidatus competibacter hyphomicrobium defluviicoccus defluviimonas tetrasphaera piscinibacter ellin6067 and terrimonas were classified into cluster 3 bacteria in cluster 2 showed a significant negative correlation with c14 hsl while genera in cluster 3 showed a negative correlation with c6 hsl upon comparing these results it was observed that the bacteria in cluster 1 could quickly sense a variety of ahls and hence their existence was advantageous to biofilm formation in stark contrast members in the other two clusters especially in cluster 3 were highly specific with respect to ahl molecules this suggests that if such bacteria have an absolute predominance in the bacterial communities adding the corresponding ahl might be an effective way to promote biofilm formation the genera dechloromonas nitrospira and ferruginibacter commonly exist in both activated sludge and biofilms of wastewater treatment systems as qs bacteria jo et al 2016 li et al 2019 dechloromonas is important to qs systems due to their diverse qs and qq functions li et al 2019 hu et al 2016 have reported the dechloromonas to be positively associated with following three ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl and 3oc12 hsl even in the current study dechloromonas were observed to have a fast response to c4 hsl and c8 hsl these results confirm that c8 hsl can be efficiently used by dechloromonas in addition nitrospira was also observed to quickly sense c8 hsl in this study since it possesses ahl synthesis gene and can produce c8 hsl mellbye et al 2017 sun et al 2019 it has been proposed that nitrospira as the initial colonizers in biofilms could provide relatively stable attachment sites for other microorganisms matar et al 2017 although the members of comamonadaceae family are known to be qs bacteria panchavinin et al 2019 they have also been reported to possess ahl degrading properties tan et al 2014 this might be the reason for the observation in the current study that comamonadaceae showed no response to several ahls such as c4 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl and c14 hsl similarly terrimonas were also identified to possess ahl degradation genes feng et al 2019 intriguingly caldilineaceae was reported to result in filamentous bulking choi et al 2017 while it was observed to have a fast response to c14 hsl in the current study this suggests that the addition of exogenous c14 hsl is likely to be an effective and fast way to alleviate sludge bulking caused by caldilineaceae on the other hand phaeodactylibacter romboutsia methylotenera and most other specific genera in cluster 3 have not been reported in previous studies which need pure culture analysis and further identification 3 4 implications the threshold concentration of qs signals is crucial for qs activation this threshold differ for various qs bacteria frederick et al 2011 perez velazquez et al 2016 in previous studies qs threshold was inventigated from the perspective of qs gene expression seet and zhang 2011 siehnel et al 2010 however due to the complex circuitry of qs regulated genes this technique results in bacterial qs threshold to remain largely unknown xiao et al 2006 this limits the application of qs signal related agents in biological wastewater treatment systems in this study the qs threshold as well as qs response to various exogeneuous ahls was estimated with respect to biomass adhesion during initial biofilm formation in wastewater treatment notably qs threshold usually refers to the minimum concentration of qs signals that activate qs related gene expression however in this study it was investigated from the perspective of biomass adhesion which is different from its traditional meaning results showed that adding exogenous ahls is an effective way to promote initial biofilm formation meanwhile considering the qs response ahls concentration and the promotion of bacterial adhesion the most effective strategy of adding ahls was determined in case of three different wastewater biofilms notably qs homeostasis is important for the maintaince of qs function rampioni et al 2007 proposed that the biosynthesis of ahls is limited when the optimal qs response is reached in fact inhibition of bacterial adhesion through high concentration of ahls was observed in this study fig 2 accordingly it is crucial to determine the appropriate ahl concentration to prevent bacteria from losing their ability to respond to environmental changes therefore a low ahl concentration of 10 ng l was preferred in this study in addition since the most effective ahl forms might not be the ones dominant in the activated sludge they can be determined through bacterial community analysis since most bacteria had fast qs response to various kinds of ahls it is reasonable to speculate that the use of multiple ahls might be desirable in biofilm reactors which needs further research moreover the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of ahls on different microbial communities or the response of various microbial communities towards multiple ahls to avoid the interference of environmental factors on initial bacterial adhesion lb medium a relatively simple system was used to cultivate bacteria meanwhile it can provide favorable nutritional conditions for bacteria to grow and proliferate well to confirm the effect of exogenous ahl validation experiments were performed using synthetic wastewater fig s3 results showed that the time needed to achieve stable biomass in the experimental group adding 10 ng l of c12 hsl was 11 17 h less than that in the control group at the same time the adhesion of biomass increased by 1 49 times hence adding exogenous ahls can promote bacterial adhesion while its effect on biofilm development and the practical function of mature biofilms needs further study furthermore results showed that the ahl threshold for bulking sludge 2 was lower and the qs response was faster when compared to activated sludge 1 and 3 with good settling performance and hence this study provided a useful measure to improve the settling property of bulking sludge 4 conclusions this study investigated the qs threshold and qs response of pure cultured s rubra biofilm and three different wastewater biofilms during the initial biofilm formation the major conclusions are as follows initial bacterial adhesion process was investigated via rtca system the time required for stable adhesion of four biofilms varied significantly ranging from 10 76 h to 18 49 h biofilm 2 inoculated with bulking sludge showed a stronger instability of biomass variation during initial biofilm formation bacterial adhesion was significantly promoted by the addition of ahl reagents the preferred ahl forms differed for different biofilms ahls with a carbonyl substituent were preferred for wastewater biofilms 1 and 2 while unsubstituted ahls showed predominance in wastewater biofilms 3 long chain ahls 12 14 carbons had stronger effect on the promotion of bacterial adhesion bacterial qs threshold of ahls was observed to be in a wide range of 10 ng l to 10 μg l qs response time also significantly varied in different biofilms biofilms with bulking sludge as inoculated sludge had faster qs response to most kinds of ahls during the initial biofilm formation the qs threshold and response time is controlled by the nature of bacterial community members responding to multiple ahls and those sensing only one form of ahl

17132,quorum sensing qs plays a crucial role during initial biofilm formation however the qs threshold and the response of biofilm formation towards n acyl homoserine lactones ahls remains largely unknown due to the limitation of nondestructive online methods for monitoring bacterial adherence and the complexity of qs system which limits the application of qs signal reagents in biofilm reactors in this study bacterial qs threshold and its response of biofilm formation to ahls in purely cultured sphingomonas rubra biofilm as well as in three different wastewater biofilms 1 3 were investigated via real time cell analysis rtca the main perspective was to study the biomass adherence in response to 12 different forms of ahls at different concentrations results showed that bacterial adhesion was significantly improved by exogenous ahls with the maximum increase of 2 26 2 36 2 52 and 2 80 times biomass production in the four respective biofilms although the preferred form of ahl differed for various biofilms the long chain ahls 12 14 carbons resulted in an overall improvement of bacterial adhesion due to their stronger hydrophobicity and hydrolysis resistance in addition bacterial qs threshold of ahls was observed to have a wide range of concentration from 10 ng l to 10 μg l meanwhile qs response time to ahls also showed a significant difference in different biofilms biofilm 2 inoculated with bulking sludge had lower qs threshold of 10 ng l and faster response to most ahls that is less than 6 h thus considering the improvement of biofilm adhesion by ahls 10 ng l of c12 hsl 10 ng l of c12 hsl and 10 ng l of c6 hsl were preferentially selected for wastewater biofilms 1 3 respectively unexpectedly adding high concentration of ahls detected in sludges did not significantly improved the bacterial adhesion infact the addition of these ahls at low concentrations or even undetected concentrations substantially improved bacterial adhesion which could be explained by bacterial communities composition according to the pearson correlation analysis 62 of the top 50 most abundant genera in bacterial communities were significantly negatively related to the response time of multiple ahls representing their fast qs response the qs bacteria dechloromonas and nitrospira have fast qs response for c4 hsl and c8 hsl while comamonadaceae has fast qs response for 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl in contrast the rest 38 of the top most abundant genera such as ferruginibacter hyphomicrobium and terrimonas quickly responded to only one ahl showing significant negative relationship with the response time of c6 hsl overall this study provides an effective and convenient means to select appropriate ahl reagents to promote bacterial adhesion in biofilm systems moreover it also suggests that exogenous ahls may be useful in improving the settling property of bulking sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacterial initial adhesion quorum sensing threshold quorum sensing response rtca sludge bulking 1 introduction effective and rapid start up of biofilm based reactors in wastewater treatment processes is highly desirable liu et al 2017 young et al 2017 however the foundation for the development of the biofilm in these reactors lay in initial bacterial adhesion hori and matsumoto 2010 peterson et al 2015 the process of bacterial adhesion can be divided into two stages the primary or reversible stage and the secondary or irreversible phase primary adhesion is quite a serendipitous event between planktonic bacteria and substratum surfaces marshall 1985 according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory the initial contact of bacteria on nascent substratum surfaces is influenced by the surface properties of both bacterial cell and substratum as well as physicochemical forces bayoudh et al 2006 nguyen et al 2016 primary adhesion is further influenced by environmental factors such as the presence of cations in inoculated sludge wang et al 2018 hence the process of bacterial adhesion can be improved by optimizing surface properties for example increasing surface roughness and hydrophobicity habimana et al 2014 lorite et al 2011 this reversible stage of bacterial adhesion is nonspecific dunne 2002 and the repeated contacts between bacterial cells and the surface provide opportunities for bacteria to adapt to the surface lee et al 2018 wang et al 2020b resulting in the strong instability during initial bacterial adhesion during the secondary or irreversible phase of adhesion loosely bound bacteria produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to consolidate their adhesion interestingly planktonic bacteria can also stick to each other or different species of surface bound members forming aggregates on the substratum dunne 2002 the presence of this cooperation behaviors among the microorganisms can promote initial adhesion which emphasizes the importance of biological interactions in bacterial communities recently bacterial community composition and biological interactions have been reported to play a substantial role in this process liu et al 2020 proposed that the initial unstable bacterial adhesion was regulated by the abundant members of the microbial community and at the same time was also regulated by the bacterial cooperation conclusively the bacterial adhesion can be promoted by enhancing the biological cooperation during initial biofilm formation measures to optimize the surface properties of substratum have been widely proposed to facilitate bacterial primary adhesion however strategies to promote the irreversible adhesion phase of initial biofilm formation by regulating the biological interactions are still lacking n acyl homoserine lactones ahls mediated quorum sensing qs is a crucial mechanism used by gram negative bacteria for cell to cell communication this process has long been recognized to control biofilm development due to its generic role in cell density dependent gene regulation bryers 2008 shrout et al 2012 it is known that various qs regulated genes are expressed only once a critical threshold concentration of extracellular ahl signals is attained resulting in the activation of qs controlled function seet and zhang 2011 williams et al 2007 although the threshold ahl concentration is crucial for qs activation qs threshold remains largely unknown due to the complex circuitry of qs regulated genes xiao et al 2006 in previous studies the qs threshold in pure culture of pseudomonas aeruginosa was estimated siehnel et al 2010 reported that the cell density thresholds for qs controlled genes rsal lasb pa1656 and lasl in p aeruginosa had the respective od600 values of 0 34 0 87 0 32 and 0 61 additionally seet and zhang 2011 proposed a new mechanism governing the qs threshold in p aeruginosa which is that the presence of qsla gene related to the production of an anti activator resulted in a nine fold increase in the required 3oc12 hsl to reach the qs threshold moreover since bacteria can use multiple qs signals to infer both their social and physical environment cornforth et al 2014 proposed that in case bacteria use two different ahls a bistable threshold is reached depending on the quantities of both ahl molecules considering the high complexity of qs network and the differences in qs system of different bacteria it is extremely difficult to determine whether the qs threshold is reached in multiple bacteria biofilms from the perspective of gene expression recently with the help of emerging monitoring methods the initial bacterial adhesion process has been quantitatively investigated from the perspective of biomass population liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020b given that biomass is a generic property regulated by bacterial qs using it as an indicator is a feasible way to comprehensively describe the qs threshold adding the ahls exogenously cause the qs threshold to reach in advance strengthening the qs controlled functions thus the addition of exogenous ahls has been widely applied in biofilm based reactors nealson et al 1970 wang et al 2020c exogenous ahls at a level of μg l were found to significantly promote extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and accelerate the granulation of aerobic granular sludge li et al 2017 tan et al 2014 hu et al 2016 and wang et al 2020b also reported the effect of exogenous ahls on the increase in biofilm formation and biofilm activity however it is also reported that the biofilm formation is influenced at low ahl concentrations while it gets inhibited at high ahl concentrations a linear relationship between ahl concentration and biofilm formation thus exists only at low ahl concentrations wang et al 2020c moreover if too many exogenous ahls molecules exist for too long in the vicinity of a bacterial community the ability of the bacterial community to respond to environmental changes is limited tait et al 2005 which again emphasizes the importance of ahl concentration meanwhile to avoid the invalidation of ahl signals caused by the delay of qs response fast qs response is desired to realize expected functions in time when the different forms of ahls are considered the ahl activity varies depending upon its form the decay rate of short chain ahl is reported to be higher than that of long chain ahls cornforth et al 2014 and ahls with a substituent 3 oxo or 3 hydroxy are reported to be more active than the unsubstituted ahls tait et al 2005 different ahls have different influence on biofilm formation and hence it is crucial to select the appropriate ahl forms moreover for multi species biofilms required ahl types and qs response to different ahls are dictated by bacterial communities especially the qs bacteria responsible for producing or sensing ahl signals hence the relationship between ahls and microbial communities also needs to be focused in this study the effect of 12 kinds of ahls on a pure cultured biofilm and on wastewater biofilms during initial biofilm formation was investigated via real time cell analysis rtca the qs threshold and response to various ahls was characterized from the perspective of biomass adherence which is a generic property regulated by bacterial qs in addition the relationship between qs response and bacterial community was investigated considering the biofilm property qs response and ahls concentration an effective method to promote bacterial adhesion during initial biofilm formation was thus proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 rtca assays the initial adhesion process of bacterial biofilms was monitored via rtca system dp agilent usa an rtca assay mainly consists of the following steps a preparation of bacterial culture fig 1 a an individual strain and three mixed bacterial cultures from different municipal wwtps were used in this study sphingomonas rubra sp nov ncbi genbank accession number fj834325 preservation no 1 9113 possessing an excellent quorum sensing system was purchased from the china general microbiological culture collection center three mixed bacterial strains were obtained from aerobic activated sludge sampled from the aerobic tanks of three wwtps and were named as 1 2 and 3 detailed in table s1 all the samples were homogenized and filtered according to a previously reported method wang et al 2018 subsequently 1 ml of the bacterial suspensions of s rubra and samples 1 2 and 3 were transferred to 100 ml each of sterile luria broth lb under sterile conditions the lb media consisted of 1 g peptone sigma aldrich germany 0 5 g yeast extract sigma aldrich germany and 0 5 g nacl each sample mixture was then incubated at 25 c for 18 h with rotary shaking at 120 rpm to obtain uniform bacterial culture since the initial bacterial concentration for rtca assays is recommended to be diluted to an optical density of 0 05 at 600 nm od600 wang et al 2020b the od600 was determined prior to the test b preparation of different concentrations of ahls fig 1b twelve kinds of standard ahl reagents including c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl c12 hsl c14 hsl 3oc6 hsl 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl were purchased from sigma aldrich usa to prepare 20 mg l stock solutions each ahl was dissolved in methanol hplc grade 99 9 and stored in tightly sealed vials at 20 c the vials were taken out 1 hour before use allowing solutions to equilibrate to room temperature subsequently 1 mg l 100 μg l 10 μg l 1 μg l 100 ng l and 10 ng l solutions of different ahls were prepared by diluting the stock solutions with sterile lb medium this step was carried out under sterile conditions c operation of rtca fig 1c rtca system consists of two core parts the microelectrodes based e plate and the real time monitor positioned in a 25 c incubator the control workstation a computer with rtca software version 2 1 2 agilent usa installed was placed outside the incubator and connected to the monitor all the liquids used for the assay were preheated to 25 c in an incubator first ahl solutions with different concentrations were added to the e plate under sterile conditions clean bench which was then placed in the monitor to clear the background impedance of ahl solutions the e plate was subsequently removed from the container and placed on a clean bench bacterial culture was added to the e plate which was then sealed with parafilm and put back into the monitor immediately it is to be noted that the working volume of a single well of the e plate is 260 μl therefore the volume of the bacterial culture must be derived based on the original od600 while the volume of ahl solution to be added to each well can be subsequently calculated once the e plate is placed into the monitor the monitoring test is set to take a reading every 5 min for 24 h via the rtca software experiment groups eg refer to the rtca assay with the addition of exogenous ahls and the control groups include assays without exogenous ahls all the experiments were performed in triplicates 2 2 analysis of sludge properties the dissolved oxygen do ph and conductivity of sludge samples

sludge volume index svi were determined according to the standard methods carranzo 2012 sludge samples were filtered through 0 22 μm filters prior to the total organic carbon toc measurement using a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany spatial structures of extracellular polymeric substance eps produced in the sludge samples were measured according to a previous study xu et al 2020 sludge eps extraction was conducted using the formaldehyde naoh method briefly around 200 ml of resuspended sludge sample was taken into ten 50 ml centrifugal tubes to each centrifuge tube 0 1 ml formaldehyde 37 was added and was allowed to stand for 1 h at 4 c thereafter 8 ml naoh 1 mol l was added into each centrifugal tube and allowed to stand for 3 h at 4 c subsequently the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 12 000 g and 4 c and the supernatants were collected finally the entire supernatant collected was filtrated using a 0 45 um membrane and purified using a dialysis membrane 3500 dalton for 24 h at 4 c the spatial configuration of eps was determined by using a multiangle static and dynamic light scattering instrument bi 200sm brookhaven instruments corporation usa according to a previous study xu et al 2020 parameter ρ rg rh was used to reflect the spatial configuration of eps here rg represents the z average root mean square radius of gyration of eps and rh represents the hydrodynamic radius of eps in brief these two parameters were respectively obtained via the static laser scatterer sls and dynamic laser scatterer dls to measure rg samples were placed on the loading platform under the sls pattern and the measurement angle was set in a range of 15º to 135º to determine rh samples were positioned on the loading platform for 2 min under the dls pattern at the measurement angle of 90º 2 3 ahls extraction and determination the homogenized sludge was centrifuged at 6000 g for 5 min extracellular ahls present in the supernatant were extracted

was automatically calculated by the supporting software rtca version 2 1 2 agilent usa statistical analyses of the data from rtca assays were carried out via pearson s correlation analysis using ibm spss version 26 0 ibm corp usa the level of statistical significance was set to p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial adhesion characteristics during initial biofilm formation activated sludge from the aerobic tanks of the three wwtps 1 2 and 3 were collected and were used as the inoculating sludge for biofilm formation tests the process of initial biofilm formation by s rubra 1 2 and 3 was quantified using microelectrode based rtca it has been reported in the previous studies that the process of biomass adhesion on the microelectrode surface can result in impedance increase and hence augment the cell index ci value ferrer et al 2017 gutierrez et al 2016 specifically the increase in ci value represents that the probability of bacterial adhesion is greater than that of their detachment and vice versa as shown in fig 2 ci values of s rubra 1 2 and 3 fluctuated in varying degrees and reached maximum in 6 to 7 h however the ci values of s rubra 1 and 3 thereafter decreased and reached stable values after 14 44 h 10 76 h and 11 69 h respectively in contrast the ci value of 2 showed a higher instability during the entire process of initial biofilm formation in fact the ci of 2 was instable and showed a continuous decrease even at 18 49 h to be specific it was observed that only one significant decrease in ci of s rubra 1 and 3 was detected before the maximum value was obtained whereas three significant reductions in ci was observed for 2 biofilms derived from the three activated sludge samples were multispecies while the pure culture biofilm consisted of only one species according to previous studies the initial adhesion process is highly regulated by microbial interactions liu et al 2020 and planktonic bacteria can stick to different species of surface bound bacteria to form aggregates on the substratum dunne 2002 in conclusion microbial interactions among different species are important to initial biofilm formation hence the difference between initial adhesion characteristics of pure culture biofilms and multiple multi species biofilms in this study may be mainly attributed to the significant difference in community composition in addition the initial bacterial adhesion has been widely reported to be influenced by eps secretion in the sludge the components of eps such as ps and pn contribute towards the formation of a conditioning layer on the substratum surface altering its properties and hence assisting a quick and firm bacterial adhesion garrett et al 2008 the unstable adhesion time during initial biofilm formation however could not be explained well by the eps content by a previous study liu et al 2020 thus to better understand the initial bacterial adhesion the influence of sludge properties including the settling property and spatial configuration of eps were considered in this study table s2 herein the parameter ρ related to the chain architecture and conformation of biopolymer was used to describe the spatial shape of the eps the ρ value for completely extended chains is around 1 50 xu et al 2018b for a random coil it changes from 1 50 to 2 00 and for a rigid rod it is greater than 2 00 kazakov et al 2002 in the current work it was observed that the ρ values of eps in sludge 1 2 and 3 were 2 27 0 09 1 66 0 06 and 1 94 0 04 respectively therefore it can be deduced that the shape of sludge 1 eps was rigid rod and the shape of sludge 2 and 3 tended to be random coils moreover it can be noted that the ρ value of eps in sludge 2 eps was smaller than that of 1 and 3 which indicated that the spatial structure of eps from sludge 1 and 3 was less dense than that from sludge 2 according to a previous study xu et al 2020 the loose physical structure of the sludge flocs results in larger pores in the sludge interior and subsequently results in higher mobility of organic molecules hence loose structured eps could provide more opportunities for macromolecular substances to form a conditioning layer on the substrate surface to promote bacterial adhesion it was also observed that the svi of sludge 1 3 had huge difference the svi of 1 and 3 was 39 3 2 8 ml g and 56 3 7 5 ml g respectively representing that these two types of sludge possessed good settling properties while 2 showed a higher svi of 196 1 23 1 ml g the initial increase of ci value is highly attributed to the mass transport of biomass towards the microelectrode surface which is determined by bacterial sedimentation li et al 2011 the good settling properties of 1 and 3 resulted in high rates of biomass augmentation in the first 4 h however the poor settling property of sludge 2 suggested that the mass transport of both biopolymer and bacteria towards the microelectrode surface was weak in this case accordingly the possibility of bacterial adhesion to the microelectrode surface was relatively reduced which may account for the strong instability of initial biofilm formation of sludge 2 in addition to the physico chemical properties of sludge another important factor that influences bacterial adhesion is the bacterial community composition especially the abundant population that can determine bacterial unstable adhesion time liu et al 2020 in this study the unstable adhesion time of 1 and 3 was found to be similar while that of 2 was significantly higher as represented in fig s1 tetrasphaera and microtrichales the frequently reported filamentous bacteria griffin and wells 2017 b wang et al 2020a s xu et al 2018a zhang et al 2019 existed in sludge 2 with a total abundance of up to 10 43 also considering the poor settling property and the presence of filamentous flocs under the microscope figure s2 sludge 2 belonged to filamentous bulking accounting for the long unstable adhesion time of sludge 2 overall since the occurrence of filamentous bacteria and the poor settling property of sludge the initial biofilm formation process with filamentous bulking sludge as the inoculated sludge was highly unstable 3 2 regulation of initial bacterial adhesion by ahl mediated quorum sensing ahl mediated qs was reported to play an important role in the process of initial biofilm formation thus the addition of exogenous ahls has been proposed to promote biofilm formation in biofilm reactors lv et al 2014 wang et al 2020b however the threshold ahls concentration and its response time remains unclear due to the complicated nature of biofilms in this study 12 types of ahls were separately added to the rtca system to investigate the effect of exogenous ahls on both pure culture biofilms and complicated wastewater biofilms herein the threshold concentration was defined as the lowest ahl concentration required for experimental groups to exhibit significantly higher ci level as compared to the control groups the response time was defined as the time needed for ci values of experiment groups to be significantly higher than the control groups 3 2 1 quorum sensing threshold in biofilms to ahls as shown in fig 3 the ahls detected in pure culture s rubra as sorted by their concentrations from high to low were c4 hsl 3oc10 hsl c10 hsl c6 hsl and c14 hsl with a total concentration of 687 65 45 82 ng l on the other hand the total ahl concentration of sludge 1 2 and 3 was 141 19 16 32 ng l 195 73 19 60 ng l and 190 38 14 23 ng l respectively specifically four kinds of ahls were detected in sludge 1 represented in a decreasing order of concentration as 3oc6 hsl c7 hsl c4 hsl and 3oc8 hsl in sludge 2 apart from these four ahls c14 hsl was detected at a higher concentration and c12 hsl was detected at a lower concentration besides c14 hsl was also detected in sludge 3 the concentration of c7 hsl was the highest in sludge 3 followed by 3oc6 hsl as shown in fig 4 ci values of s rubra were improved with the addition of exogenous c4 hsl c7 hsl 3oc10 hsl and c14 hsl the threshold concentrations of these four ahls were 100 ng l 10 µg l 1000 µg l and 1 µg l respectively while their optimal concentrations resulting in maximum promotion of adhering biomass were 100 ng l 100 µg l 1000 µg l and 10 µg l respectively in case of the biofilm 1 seven ahls were observed to enhance the biomass adhesion including c7 hsl c12 hsl c14 hsl 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl among these the threshold concentration of c12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl was 10 ng l while that of the other five ahls was 10 µg l the optimal concentration for all the ahls with respect to biomass adherence was found to be similar to their threshold concentration the most significant increase in the biofilm adherence of s rubra and 1 were observed when supplemented with 10 µg l of c14 hsl at this time the ci values of the s rubra and 1 experimental groups were 2 26 0 33 and 2 36 0 21 times that of the control groups respectively on the other hand multiple forms of ahls except c6 hsl and c14 hsl significantly promoted the bacterial adhesion in wastewater biofilms 2 at the same low threshold concentration of 10 ng l in this case the optimal concentration of c10 hsl c12 hsl and 3oc12 hsl was 1 µg l 10 µg l and 1 µg l respectively while that of the other kinds of ahls was only 10 ng l biofilms 2 exhibited the largest ci value which was 2 52 0 11 times that of the control in the presence of 10 µg l of exogenous 3oc14 hsl in biofilm 3 the biomass adhesion was significantly increased with the addition of the following seven ahls c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c10 hsl c14 hsl 3oc6 hsl and 3oc14 hsl the corresponding threshold concentrations of the respective ahls were 1 µg l 10 ng l 1 µg l 10 µg l 1 µg l 10 ng l and 1 µg l while their optimal concentrations were also similar to the threshold concentrations it was observed that the ci values increased by more than 2 7 fold in response to 10 ng l of c6 hsl 1 µg l of c7 hsl and 10 µg l of c10 hsl initial bacterial adhesion in case of the pure cultured s rubra was found to be increased by the exogenous addition of only four kinds of ahls while other wastewater biofilms responded to most of the different ahls this clearly indicates the complexity of ahl driven qs in wastewater biofilm communities in addition the result confirms the cross communication among the bacterial community that various ahls produced by different members could be shared among gram negative bacteria in heterogenous biofilms gonzález et al 2013 this cooperative behavior mediated by ahl molecules is conducive to initial bacterial adhesion liu et al 2020 however adding high concentration of ahls in sludge did not bring about significant enhancement in bacterial adhesion but adding the low or even undetected concentrations substantially promoted the process which might be due to the succession of bacterial communities it has also been reported that the ahls profile of sessile biofilm communities differed greatly from that of the suspended sludge communities due to the differences in community composition bao et al 2020 apart from this since ahl producing bacteria are in dynamic succession during biofilm formation dominant ahls also vary continuously hu et al 2016 huang et al 2009 moreover the threshold concentrations of the predominant ahls observed in the different types of sludge were observed to be overall higher it is thus reflected that ahls with low concentrations in sludges limited the rapid adhesion of bacteria previous studies have also reported that the effect of various ahls on bacterial adhesion was related to the chemical structure of ahls in one such study tait et al 2005 proposed that ahls with a 3 oxo or 3 hydroxy substituent were more active in promoting bacterial adhesion than the un substituted ahls similarly li et al 2015 reported that ahls with β position substituent group have more significant effect on promoting the attached growth of autotrophic nitrifying sludge in the current study ahls with carbonyl as the substituent group such as 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl significantly affected the bacterial adhesion in case of biofilms 1 and 2 while for wastewater biofilms 3 a clear predominance of unsubstituted ahls was observed additionally the long chain ahls 12 14 carbons despite having a lower molar concentration than their shorter chain counterparts had a significantly higher promoting influence over bacterial adhesion this was attributed to the relative stability of long chain ahls against hydrolysis decho et al 2010 conclusively due to the complexity of biofilm communities it is difficult to determine the universal ahl forms of different biofilms that can promote initial bacterial adhesion thus for a better understanding of the appropriate ahls required for various biofilms the respective bacterial community composition needs to be considered 3 2 2 quorum sensing response in biofilms to ahls the rapid start up of biofilm reactors and biofilm formation has always been desired liu et al 2017 young et al 2017 thus apart from the biofilm promoting effect of exogenous ahls the response time of bacteria to ahls also needs to be considered herein the response time was defined as the time required for ci values of experimental groups to be significantly higher than that of the control groups as shown in fig 5 supplementing the s rubra biofilms with the optimal concentrations of exogenous c14 hsl resulted in the shortest response time of 5 99 h in case of biofilms 1 3oc10 hsl resulted in the shortest response time of 1 93 h while c10 hsl resulted in the shortest response time of 1 00 h and 5 85 h in case of biofilms 2 and 3 respectively comparing fig 4 and fig 5 it is apparent that ahls showing the greatest effect on biomass adhesion were not necessarily the ones showing the fastest response to promote adhesion specifically long chain ahls with 12 to 14 carbons showed stronger effect on biomass adhesion while medium chain ahls with 10 carbons had the fastest effect which is presumed to be the composite outcome of hydrophobicity hydrolysis resistance and molarity of ahl molecules in detail long chain ahls 12 14 carbons possess stronger hydrophobicity and hydrolysis resistance which contributes to their long term effectiveness and thus showed stronger effects on biomass adhesion compared with long chain ahls the medium chain ahls with 10 carbons despite having relatively poor hydrolysis resistance have higher molarity owing to the same mass concentration and smaller molecular mass hence ahls with 10 carbons showed faster promotion of bacterial adhesion than long chain ahls proceeding to analyze wastewater biofilms faster biomass increment that is shorter response time was found in biofilm 2 with overall response time within 6 h nevertheless the response time of biofilm 2 and 3 to various ahls varied significantly especially the response time in biofilm 3 was more than 6 h qs is a cell density dependent mechanism of communication in bacterial population in terms of gram negative bacteria it is activated when extracellular concentration of ahls reaches the threshold hence adding exogenous ahl reagents can reduce the time required to reach a threshold concentration for the auto induction and eps production gonzález et al 2013 thus accelerating the bacterial adhesion fig 4 adding exogenous ahls proved to be an effective way to improve the initial bacterial adhesion during biofilm formation it must be noted that for ahl reagents to be effective they must have a finite life that is in accordance with the function they control if exogenous ahls exist for too long the ability of the bacterial community to respond to various environmental changes would be limited tait et al 2005 therefore apart from achieving a stronger promotion of bacterial adhesion and fast response low concentration of ahls is an essential factor to be considered which is also important from the perspective of cost reduction taken together c12 hsl is preferentially selected for the improved adhesion of wastewater biofilms 1 and 2 and c6 hsl is the preferred form of ahl for wastewater biofilms 3 with optimal concentration of only 10 ng l in addition it is noteworthy that for biofilm 2 not only the threshold concentration of ahl is low 10 ng l in fig 4 but the qs response is also faster than that in the case of biofilms 1 and 3 fig 5 meanwhile the svi of bulking sludge 2 reduced from 196 1 23 1 ml g to 129 3 17 1 ml g when 10 ng l of c12 hsl was added these results suggested an effective way to improve the settling property of bulking sludge by adding ahls 3 3 influence of community composition on quorum sensing response to better understand the differences in qs response of different biofilms to ahls bacterial community structure needs to be investigated as shown in fig 6 pearson correlation coefficients were calculated by comparing the response time and the relative abundance of the top 50 most abundant genera in activated sludge communities since longer response time represents slower qs response the negative correlation between genus abundance and a specific ahl indicates a faster response of bacteria to that ahl most bacteria in cluster 1 such as phaeodactylibacter dechloromonas and nitrospira showed significantly negative relationship with c4 hsl and c8 hsl suggesting that they could quickly sense these two ahls and activate their qs system comamonadaceae in cluster 1 were significantly negatively related to 3oc8 hsl 3oc10 hsl 3oc12 hsl and 3oc14 hsl indicating the bacterial ability to utilize medium and long chain ahls with a carbonyl substituent members of a4b steroidobacteraceae caldilineaceae and methylotenera belonged to cluster 2 and ferruginibacter candidatus competibacter hyphomicrobium defluviicoccus defluviimonas tetrasphaera piscinibacter ellin6067 and terrimonas were classified into cluster 3 bacteria in cluster 2 showed a significant negative correlation with c14 hsl while genera in cluster 3 showed a negative correlation with c6 hsl upon comparing these results it was observed that the bacteria in cluster 1 could quickly sense a variety of ahls and hence their existence was advantageous to biofilm formation in stark contrast members in the other two clusters especially in cluster 3 were highly specific with respect to ahl molecules this suggests that if such bacteria have an absolute predominance in the bacterial communities adding the corresponding ahl might be an effective way to promote biofilm formation the genera dechloromonas nitrospira and ferruginibacter commonly exist in both activated sludge and biofilms of wastewater treatment systems as qs bacteria jo et al 2016 li et al 2019 dechloromonas is important to qs systems due to their diverse qs and qq functions li et al 2019 hu et al 2016 have reported the dechloromonas to be positively associated with following three ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl and 3oc12 hsl even in the current study dechloromonas were observed to have a fast response to c4 hsl and c8 hsl these results confirm that c8 hsl can be efficiently used by dechloromonas in addition nitrospira was also observed to quickly sense c8 hsl in this study since it possesses ahl synthesis gene and can produce c8 hsl mellbye et al 2017 sun et al 2019 it has been proposed that nitrospira as the initial colonizers in biofilms could provide relatively stable attachment sites for other microorganisms matar et al 2017 although the members of comamonadaceae family are known to be qs bacteria panchavinin et al 2019 they have also been reported to possess ahl degrading properties tan et al 2014 this might be the reason for the observation in the current study that comamonadaceae showed no response to several ahls such as c4 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl and c14 hsl similarly terrimonas were also identified to possess ahl degradation genes feng et al 2019 intriguingly caldilineaceae was reported to result in filamentous bulking choi et al 2017 while it was observed to have a fast response to c14 hsl in the current study this suggests that the addition of exogenous c14 hsl is likely to be an effective and fast way to alleviate sludge bulking caused by caldilineaceae on the other hand phaeodactylibacter romboutsia methylotenera and most other specific genera in cluster 3 have not been reported in previous studies which need pure culture analysis and further identification 3 4 implications the threshold concentration of qs signals is crucial for qs activation this threshold differ for various qs bacteria frederick et al 2011 perez velazquez et al 2016 in previous studies qs threshold was inventigated from the perspective of qs gene expression seet and zhang 2011 siehnel et al 2010 however due to the complex circuitry of qs regulated genes this technique results in bacterial qs threshold to remain largely unknown xiao et al 2006 this limits the application of qs signal related agents in biological wastewater treatment systems in this study the qs threshold as well as qs response to various exogeneuous ahls was estimated with respect to biomass adhesion during initial biofilm formation in wastewater treatment notably qs threshold usually refers to the minimum concentration of qs signals that activate qs related gene expression however in this study it was investigated from the perspective of biomass adhesion which is different from its traditional meaning results showed that adding exogenous ahls is an effective way to promote initial biofilm formation meanwhile considering the qs response ahls concentration and the promotion of bacterial adhesion the most effective strategy of adding ahls was determined in case of three different wastewater biofilms notably qs homeostasis is important for the maintaince of qs function rampioni et al 2007 proposed that the biosynthesis of ahls is limited when the optimal qs response is reached in fact inhibition of bacterial adhesion through high concentration of ahls was observed in this study fig 2 accordingly it is crucial to determine the appropriate ahl concentration to prevent bacteria from losing their ability to respond to environmental changes therefore a low ahl concentration of 10 ng l was preferred in this study in addition since the most effective ahl forms might not be the ones dominant in the activated sludge they can be determined through bacterial community analysis since most bacteria had fast qs response to various kinds of ahls it is reasonable to speculate that the use of multiple ahls might be desirable in biofilm reactors which needs further research moreover the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of ahls on different microbial communities or the response of various microbial communities towards multiple ahls to avoid the interference of environmental factors on initial bacterial adhesion lb medium a relatively simple system was used to cultivate bacteria meanwhile it can provide favorable nutritional conditions for bacteria to grow and proliferate well to confirm the effect of exogenous ahl validation experiments were performed using synthetic wastewater fig s3 results showed that the time needed to achieve stable biomass in the experimental group adding 10 ng l of c12 hsl was 11 17 h less than that in the control group at the same time the adhesion of biomass increased by 1 49 times hence adding exogenous ahls can promote bacterial adhesion while its effect on biofilm development and the practical function of mature biofilms needs further study furthermore results showed that the ahl threshold for bulking sludge 2 was lower and the qs response was faster when compared to activated sludge 1 and 3 with good settling performance and hence this study provided a useful measure to improve the settling property of bulking sludge 4 conclusions this study investigated the qs threshold and qs response of pure cultured s rubra biofilm and three different wastewater biofilms during the initial biofilm formation the major conclusions are as follows initial bacterial adhesion process was investigated via rtca system the time required for stable adhesion of four biofilms varied significantly ranging from 10 76 h to 18 49 h biofilm 2 inoculated with bulking sludge showed a stronger instability of biomass variation during initial biofilm formation bacterial adhesion was significantly promoted by the addition of ahl reagents the preferred ahl forms differed for different biofilms ahls with a carbonyl substituent were preferred for wastewater biofilms 1 and 2 while unsubstituted ahls showed predominance in wastewater biofilms 3 long chain ahls 12 14 carbons had stronger effect on the promotion of bacterial adhesion bacterial qs threshold of ahls was observed to be in a wide range of 10 ng l to 10 μg l qs response time also significantly varied in different biofilms biofilms with bulking sludge as inoculated sludge had faster qs response to most kinds of ahls during the initial biofilm formation the qs threshold and response time is controlled by the nature of bacterial community members responding to multiple ahls and those sensing only one form of ahl

suspended sludge p 0 001 batch tests showed that anammox within anoxic carrier biofilms contributed to significant nitrogen removal coupled with partial denitrification no3 no2 the anammox genus ca brocadia was highly enriched when suspended sludge was accidentally lost further batch tests found that reducing suspended biomass helped anammox enrichment in anoxic carrier biofilms because the suspended sludge had strong no2 competition no2 n2 with anammox increased nirk metagenomic sequencing revealed that ca brocadia dominates in the anoxic carrier biofilms and is the most important narg contributor to no3 no2 which could have promoted the competition of no2 with heterotrophic bacteria for this a2 o process the low effluent total nitrogen 8 9 mg 1 0 mg n l was attributed to partial

enriched within red biofilms on the anoxic mixer in a full scale separate centrate treatment system and also highlighted the potential role of partial denitrification studies have also confirmed that the anammox in anoxic biofilms actively enhances nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater without carbon and nitrogen separation and have reported that anammox bacterial abundance was higher in anoxic biofilms than in suspended sludge li et al 2020 li et al 2019 in summary research suggests that survival of anammox bacteria is higher in anoxic biofilms in partial denitrification anammox systems

actual municipal wastewater fig 1 in phase ⅰ day 280 to 325 the reactor operated in anaerobic aerobic oxic mode as previously described li et al 2020 after inoculating the carriers the effluent no3 n gradually decreased over one month and the average concentrations remained at 14 1 mg 4 0 mg n l fig 1b in phase ⅱ day 326 to 442 a large volume of suspended sludge was unexpectedly lost 2873 mg vss l to 534 mg vss l fig s2 due to erroneous operation on day 326 sludge loss seriously affected the nitrification capacity of the a2 o system and the effluent nh4 n rapidly deteriorated from 1 3 mg n l to 31 8 mg n l fig 1a during the next 53 days the nitrification performance gradually recovered and the effluent tin concentration was 13 7 mg 2 8 mg n l from day 379 to day 442 to investigate the effect of influent loads on the maintenance of anammox bacteria the influent nh4 n was reduced from 46 1 mg 3 7 mg n l to 29 0 mg 2 4 mg n l in phase ⅲ day 443 to 500 fig 1a after this adjustment the effluent tin concentrations decreased rapidly and remained relatively stable over the next eight weeks the average effluent no3 n was 7 6 mg 1 0 mg n l tin 8 9 mg 1 0 mg n l the actual municipal wastewater was continuously fed during the whole test and the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor was relatively stable under normal operating conditions previous study demonstrated that partial nitrogen loss was attributed to anammox when the influent nh4 n was approximately 50 mg n l contributing higher nitrogen removal than traditional a2 o processes li et al 2020 different from previous findings the influent nh4 n in this study decreased from 46 1 mg 3 7 mg n l to 29 0 mg 2 4 mg n l but the nitrogen removal performance remained stable and satisfactory demonstrating that this process is applicable within the general influent nitrogen concentration range 30 mg 50 mg nh4 n l of municipal wwtps 3 2 anammox activity and contribution to nitrogen removal to determine the nitrogen transformation process within anoxic carrier biofilms batch tests were conducted to simulate an anoxic zone with nh4 no3 and sodium acetate fig 2 a fig s3 as illustrated on day 448 no3 n and cod rapidly decreased and a significant accumulation of no2 n was observed with a peak of 13 4 mg n l subsequently no2 n and nh4 n gradually decreased at a removal rate of 2 6 mg n l h and 1 4 mg n l h respectively when the organic matter had almost been completely consumed no2 n and nh4 n continued to decrease at a removal rate of 0 4 mg n l h and 0 4 mg n l h respectively during this period the ratio of removed no2 n and nh4 n was 1 09 and the ratio of produced no3 n and removed nh4 n was 0 12 which was close to the reported values of 1 14 and 0 16 lotti et al 2014a during this test the proportion of n2o remained extremely low and could be ignored fig s4 these results suggest that anoxic carrier biofilms are more significant to nitrate to nitrite and to specific anammox activity anoxic biofilms had a higher reduction rate of no3 than no2 at the initial stage of the test no2 n was rapidly produced then accumulated rather than immediately converting into dinitrogen the ratio of no2 n nh4 n could reflect the nonlinear rate change between anammox activity and reaction time implying that the presence of organic matter affects no2 competition the batch test lasted over 10 hours but the hrt of the anoxic zone in the a2 o system was far shorter 2 86 h suggesting that proper extension of hrt might improve the nitrogen removal performance by anammox under a lower concentration of organic matter variations were observed in different phases and specific anammox activity and contribution to nitrogen loss fluctuated with the operational status suspended sludge biomass and influent nh4 n fig 2a specially batch tests showed that anammox activity was 0 17 kg n m3 d on day 280 and its contribution to nitrogen removal was 68 on day 430 the anammox activity of anoxic carrier biofilms increased to 0 20 kg n m3 d and its contribution to nitrogen removal was 70 6 except for the concentrations of suspended sludge there were no other changes on the operating parameters thus increased anammox activity in anoxic biofilms might be related to the biomass loss of suspended sludge when the influent nh4 n was reduced in phase ⅲ anammox activity increased to 0 21 kg n m3 d fig 2a with 73 4 of its nitrogen loss on day 462 this might be due to an improvement in the mass transfer efficiency caused by the shedding of the outer biofilms anammox bacteria in anoxic carrier biofilms positively contributed to partial nitrogen removal as detailed below firstly anammox contributed to 68 73 4 of nitrogen removal in different batch tests with anoxic carrier biofilms fig 2a secondly in the a2 o system anammox contributed to approximately 29 2 6 7 of nitrogen loss based on the mass balance table s1 the nitrogen removal rate nrr in this biosystem ranged from 0 04 kg n m3 d to 0 08 kg n m3 d under a cod n ratio 3 0 which is comparable to the reported performance of traditional nitrification denitrification processes even in sewage anammox systems table s2 thirdly over 400 days of operation anammox bacteria were still active in anoxic carrier biofilms rather than in the elution which strongly suggests that anammox cannot be ignored in nitrogen removal furthermore the nitrogen removal generally improved due to increased anammox biomass laureni et al 2015 tao et al 2019 in this study anammox bacterial abundance fig 2b see section 3 3 1 is significantly higher than the previous level reported in a similar a2 o process wang et al 2015 which could have contributed to increased autotrophic nitrogen removal 3 3 highly enriched anammox in the anoxic carrier biofilms the abundance of anammox in the anoxic carrier biofilms 0 74 4 34 fig 2b was significantly higher than in the suspended sludge 0 03 0 08 p 0 001 fig 2c according to the qpcr results in phase ⅰ day 280 anammox abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms and suspended sludge was 2 29 109 copies g dry sludge 0 74 and 2 26 107 copies g dry sludge 0 04 respectively when the suspended sludge was lost in phase ⅱ this increased to a maximum of 1 47 1010 copies g dry sludge 4 34 in the anoxic carrier biofilms on day 430 reducing the influent nh4 n anammox abundance in the anoxic carrier biofilms still maintained 8 35 109 copies g dry sludge 2 87 on day 462 this concurs with previous studies li et al 2020 and shows that the anammox bacteria have a significant niche preference for anoxic carrier biofilms these results are important as they confirm that anammox bacteria can survive long term in low ammonia wastewater with high abundance the in situ enrichment as well as further long term maintenance of anammox bacteria is one of the major bottlenecks in sewage anammox based processes kartal et al 2010 van der star et al 2007 previous studies have demonstrated that anammox bacteria are widespread in traditional full scale municipal wwtps nejidat et al 2018 shu et al 2015b but that the abundance is very low less than 0 003 wang et al 2015 or 0 01 guo et al 2017 according to qpcr results the anammox bacterial abundance 0 74 4 34 in this study is comparable to previous systems that inoculated mature anammox sludge du et al 2017 miao et al 2018 wang et al 2016 the high anammox bacterial abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms explains the positive autotrophic nitrogen removal section 3 2 therefore the results of this study combined with previous studies li et al 2019 ma et al 2017 demonstrate that the a2 o system could consistently maintain relatively high level abundance of anammox bacteria in mainstream biosystem 3 4 key for high anammox enrichment in mainstream biosystem along with losing suspended sludge fig 1 anammox bacterial abundance in the anoxic carrier biofilms increased to an extremely high level fig 2b for the special high enrichment process of anammox batch tests were conducted to simulate the anoxic zone nh4 no3 and sodium acetate designed with three modes anoxic carrier biofilms suspended sludge and a combination of both in the anoxic carrier biofilms concentrations of no3 n and cod decreased rapidly and no2 n significantly accumulated with a peak of 15 5 mg n l fig 3 a no2 n and nh4 n then gradually decreased with removal rates of 2 03 mg n l h and 0 89 mg n l h respectively by contrast in the suspended only sludge the no2 n accumulation reduced by no3 n was very weak fig 3b and the downward trend of nh4 n was significantly slower results on the coexistence of suspended sludge and anoxic biofilms showed that no3 n did not decrease after 0 5 h during which only a small amount of no2 n accumulated the addition of suspended sludge enhanced the nitrite reduction process no2 n2 fig 3c these results show that the nh4 n consumption rates were significantly different with anoxic biofilms or suspended sludge batch tests confirm that the existence of suspended sludge is a key factor for the coupling of denitrification and anammox and controlling suspended biomass might shorten the debugging period of anammox in situ enrichment in mainstream namely suspended sludge strengthens the role of nitrite reduction no2 n2 and weakens the competitiveness of anammox to further understand the niche difference between anoxic carrier biofilms and suspended sludge the microbial community structure was analyzed the dynamic changes in anammox abundance measured by 16s rrna sequencing fig 4 were consistent with the qpcr results fig 2 on the whole the results fig 4 show that ca brocadia were the dominant known nitrogen transforming functional microorganisms in the anoxic carrier biofilms while nitrospira dechloromonas and nitrosomonas were dominant in the suspended sludge in addition to ca brocadia enrichment in anoxic biofilms the proportion of dechloromonas azospira and thauera did not completely recover in suspended sludge day 430 which was significantly different from that before sludge loss day 280 fisher s exact test p 0 01 these results show that suspended sludge contains more denitrifying bacteria and less anammox this is the opposite of the microflora distribution in the anoxic carrier biofilms the unexpected anammox enrichment could be because more denitrifying bacteria survive in suspended sludge than anoxic carrier biofilms the loss of suspended sludge in the bioreactor caused a sharp decrease in denitrifying bacteria especially for no2 reduction and the heterotrophic reduction of no2 weakened this increased the opportunities for anammox bacteria to compete for no2 and further proliferate in a short period when the suspended sludge increased to the previous level the anammox abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms fell off with the decrease of influent nh4 n besides the batch tests and microbial analysis reconfirmed that the anoxic carrier biofilms were crucial to nitrate to nitrite conversion and maintenance of anammox activity 3 5 profile of ca brocadia genus enriched within the anoxic carrier biofilms in the anoxic carrier biofilms the abundance of the ca brocadia reached a maximum level on day 430 fig 2 fig 4 the metagenomic sequencing results fig s5 further reveal that the species ca brocadia fulgida 4 14 and ca brocadia sinica 2 17 were found in significantly higher abundance in the anoxic carrier biofilms than in the suspended sludge 0 22 and 0 13 respectively p 0 001 the dominance of ca brocadia in this study agrees with the typical genus observed in sewage anammox based systems gilbert et al 2015 winkler et al 2012 xie et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 especially for treating actual municipal wastewater laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014b reino et al 2018 studies have reported that ca brocadia consistently dominates in diverse treatment units of municipal wwtps cao et al 2017 nejidat et al 2018 wang et al 2015 while ca jettenia or ca kuenenia are usually dominant in treating high strength wastewater feng et al 2018 guo et al 2016 however the high enrichment of ca brocadia in this study is only a superficial phenomenon and further information is required the reason of enriching anammox dominant species ca brocadia rather than another genus deserves attention to elucidate the enrichment mechanism of the ca brocadia genus the key enzymes for nitrification denitrification and anammox involved in the dominant bacteria were analyzed fig 5 fig s6 for nitrification the responsible amoa 470 hits was closely related to nitrosomonas 438 hits and only observed in suspended sludge none in anoxic carrier biofilms in accordance with microbial community differences fig s5 considering the synergy process of denitrification and anammox fig 3 fig s3 key enzymes of functional bacteria were investigated further denitrification involves multiple nitrogen forms no3 no2 no n2o and n2 therefore the overall metabolic process requires a selection of enzymes kuypers et al 2018 for example narg which are involved in nitrate to nitrite processes were related to a diverse range of bacteria specifically narg was mainly assigned to ca brocadia 3618 hits in anoxic carrier biofilms whereas in suspended sludge it was mostly distributed to nitrospira 6314 hits another nitrate to nitrite enzyme napa was mainly involved in suspended sludge and was most closely related to dechloromonas 1724 hits followed by sulfuritalea 566 hits for nirs the total abundance of samples showed little difference but its distribution was mainly related to dechloromonas 1472 hits in suspended sludge and chloroflexi 878 hits in anoxic carrier biofilms interestingly these results show that the relative abundance of nirk in suspended sludge was 2 6 times higher than in anoxic carrier biofilms table s3 and was mainly assigned to nitrospira 1976 hits of suspended sludge recent research has shown that nitrospira has significant potential for no2 oxidation black and just 2018 and increased nirk in suspended sludge might increase the no2 competition ability with anoxic carrier biofilms for anammox the unique coding gene hzs kartal et al 2011 kuypers et al 2018 was closely related to the most dominant genera ca brocadia 5156 hits in anoxic carrier biofilms yet rarely detected in suspended sludge 170 hits fig 5 similarly hdh a key enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the intermediate hydrazine to dinitrogen during the anammox reaction kartal et al 2011 strous et al 2006 was also significantly more abundant in anoxic carrier biofilms 3264 hits than in suspended sludge 106 hits the higher anammox abundance survival in anoxic carrier biofilms the higher bacteria abundance of hzs and hdh these results are in line with the microbial community analyses and support the niche preference of anammox bacteria comprehensive understanding of the no2 loop through partial denitrification could be discerned based on the coding genes functional microorganisms and specific metabolic mechanisms firstly from the perspective of nitrogen conversion gene the narg nirk nirs ratio in anoxic carrier biofilms 2 45 was higher than in suspended sludge 1 75 table s3 which favored the no2 production over no3 reduction in anoxic biofilms crucially nirk was highly abundant in suspended sludge but almost absent in anoxic carrier biofilms the nirk was assigned to nitrospira 1976 hits of suspended sludge fig 5 while anoxic carrier biofilms were not conducive to its growth due to the oxygen free conditions secondly the most abundant anammox genus ca brocadia was the key narg contributor to nitrate to nitrite in anoxic carrier biofilms fig 5 fig s7 therefore ca brocadia might promote the competition of no2 when losing suspended sludge and then facilitate its dominant position in the anoxic carrier biofilms thirdly the nrfa gene 876 hits linked to some ca brocadia strains could reduce no3 to no2 or nh4 couple to the oxidation of acetate kartal et al 2008 therefore dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra by anammox bacteria might positively contribute to some nitrogen loss finally previous studies have reported that the denitrifying bacteria thauera is crucial as it contributes more to no3 reduction than no2 reduction du et al 2016 ma et al 2017 wang et al 2019b thauera proliferated at a much higher rate in anoxic carrier biofilms than in suspended sludge 2 94 compared to 1 06 respectively fig 4 fig s5 and contained more narg in anoxic carrier biofilms than in suspended sludge 430 hits compared to 134 hits respectively fig 5 indicating the potential role in the no2 supply on anammox based on the above results a preliminary profile of anoxic carrier biofilms is presented in fig 6 to describe the enrichment mechanism of ca brocadia genus through morphology fig s8 chemistry fig 3a fig s3 and the microbial community analysis fig 4 fig 5 anammox metabolism requires no2 as the electron acceptor van der graaf et al 1995 in this study although no2 was not externally fed to the anoxic zone it could be produced by no3 reduction in anoxic carrier biofilms and partially consumed by anammox fig 3 under these preconditions two factors further accelerate the anammox enrichment the loss of suspended sludge rich in nirk s increases the no2 competition ability of ca brocadia in anoxic carrier biofilms fig 5 while the special metabolic characteristics of ca brocadia closely related to narg strengthens the nitrate to nitrite conversion contributing to the rapid enrichment of anammox fig 5 fig s6 3 6 engineering applications in municipal wwtps regarding engineering applications current and previous study on different a2 o processes provide the experimental foundation for in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria in wwtps li et al 2019 experimental evidence has confirmed the theoretical basis including long term performance batch tests microbial community and functional genes analysis the no2 from the no3 reduction could be partially consumed by anammox fig 3 fig s3 particularly under anoxic conditions e g anaerobic or anoxic zones this coupling process also corresponds with the observed nitrate to nitrite reaction in recent anammox based studies du et al 2017 ma et al 2017 furthermore heterotrophic denitrification generally undergoes the production process of no nitric oxide kuypers et al 2018 thereby creating a macro environment for anammox using nh4 and no anoxic carrier biofilms improve stability tolerance of anammox bacteria in mainstream because of their spontaneous enrichment rather than inoculation lab or pilot scale experiments have usually been implemented with the inoculation of mature anammox sludge from side stream or other bioreactors lemaire 2014 lotti et al 2014b stefansdottir 2014 but it is impractical to directly inoculate into full scale wwtps despite that this work provides solid evidence for treating municipal wastewater via in situ enrichment of anammox and this is expected to be further verified in future long term lab scale and pilot scale tests controlling the suspended sludge is simpler and does not require a complex multi factor control and high tech professional managers in addition comammox has recently been reported as the predominant nitrifier nh4 directly to no3 in a traditional nitrification denitrification wwtp yang et al 2020 its presence poses a threat to stable nitritation in aerobic zones of continuous flow biosystems but it might be beneficial for partial denitrification via a return to the anoxic zone the work presented here is just the tip of the iceberg on the partial anammox direction future research and engineering projects that are expected to be implemented in municipal wwtps optimization of the synergistic relationship between anoxic carrier biofilms and suspended sludge might be conducive to improving the nitrogen removal performance the interpretation of the metagenomic analysis implies the potential of these microbes rather than actual activity thus further studies on metabolite levels rna or protein hu et al 2019 lawson et al 2017 lv et al 2019 are necessary to characterize the active functions of these microorganisms e g ca brocadia nitrospira thauera furthermore when the anoxic carrier biofilm thickness was reduced fig 2a anammox abundance in suspended sludge was enhanced fig 2c and its quantitative influence on nitrogen loss requires further investigation from a broader perspective anammox bacteria could be involved not only in nitrogen conversion but also in carbon metabolism kuypers et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 meaning that the regulation of complex environmental conditions is necessary e g cod n do spatial pattern 4 conclusions this study investigated the niche differences on anoxic biofilms and suspended sludge in a continuous flow partial denitrification anammox system the introduction of biofilms in the anoxic zone could hold a relatively high abundance of anammox bacteria 0 74 4 34 within the general influent n concentration range 30 mg 50 mg nh4 n l ca brocadia dominated the anoxic carrier biofilms while nitrospira dominated in suspended sludge the unexpectedly enriched anammox was attributed to the abrupt loss of suspended sludge higher nirk in suspended sludge supported the rapid no2 reduction and higher abundance of narg linked to ca brocadia might further enhance the nitrate to nitrite within anoxic carrier biofilms the microbial community and batch tests suggest that controlling suspended biomass could help anammox enrichment

17133,this study proposes a novel strategy of stably enriching anammox in mainstream based on the competitive difference to no2 between anoxic biofilms and suspended sludge a modified anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process run for 500 days with actual municipal wastewater microbial analysis revealed that anoxic carrier biofilms had a significantly higher abundance of anammox qpcr 0 74 4 34 than suspended sludge p 0 001 batch tests showed that anammox within anoxic carrier biofilms contributed to significant nitrogen removal coupled with partial denitrification no3 no2 the anammox genus ca brocadia was highly enriched when suspended sludge was accidentally lost further batch tests found that reducing suspended biomass helped anammox enrichment in anoxic carrier biofilms because the suspended sludge had strong no2 competition no2 n2 with anammox increased nirk metagenomic sequencing revealed that ca brocadia dominates in the anoxic carrier biofilms and is the most important narg contributor to no3 no2 which could have promoted the competition of no2 with heterotrophic bacteria for this a2 o process the low effluent total nitrogen 8 9 mg 1 0 mg n l was attributed to partial denitrification coupling with anammox demonstrating that this process is applicable to the general influent n concentration range 30 mg 50 mg nh4 n l of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps based on the special competitive preference of anammox for no2 this study provides a promising and practical alternative for enriching anammox bacteria in municipal wwtps graphical abstracts image

bacteria outbreaks of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and temperature constraints jin et al 2012 li et al 2018 updated bioprocesses and more stable control strategies need further investigation in mainstream anammox technology anammox coupling with partial denitrification no3 no2 has recently been developed as a promising method for reliable autotrophic nitrogen removal du et al 2016 li et al 2016 ammonia is removed at the expense of nitrate no3 no2 with anammox occurring in a denitrifying fluidized bed reactor kuenen 2008 integrating partial denitrification and anammox has been demonstrated in treating high strength wastewater via sulphide driven kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 mulder 2006 and acetate driven kalyuzhnyi et al 2008 nitrate reduction coupling partial denitrification with anammox as the dominant pathway could enhance nitrogen removal in high strength wastewater du et al 2016 gao et al 2012 mulder et al 2012 avoid no2 toxicity and bypass the explosion of nob there has been very little research into partial denitrification coupled with anammox in treating low ammonium wastewater zhang et al 2019 xu et al 2020 ma et al 2017 demonstrated that integrating anammox with no3 to no2 achieved 70 autotrophic nitrogen removal in a biofilm based system in a sequencing batch reactor sbr system fed with synthetic wastewater high no2 by no3 reduction was also utilized by anammox du et al 2017 and a high no3 to no2 transformation 68 2 by endogenous partial denitrification was shown in treating synthetic wastewater wang et al 2019a however these mainstream anammox tests were conducted using synthetic wastewater experiments using actual municipal wastewater with varying influent n concentrations could provide direct evidence for the potential of the partial denitrification anammox process in mainstream processes biofilms are crucial in partial denitrification anammox bioreactors the anoxic oxic a o system successfully achieves mainstream anammox by coupling denitrification with a high n removal efficiency of 80 4 and anammox in anoxic biofilms contributes to the main nitrogen loss ma et al 2017 park et al 2017 found that anammox was highly enriched within red biofilms on the anoxic mixer in a full scale separate centrate treatment system and also highlighted the potential role of partial denitrification studies have also confirmed that the anammox in anoxic biofilms actively enhances nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater without carbon and nitrogen separation and have reported that anammox bacterial abundance was higher in anoxic biofilms than in suspended sludge li et al 2020 li et al 2019 in summary research suggests that survival of anammox bacteria is higher in anoxic biofilms in partial denitrification anammox systems however specific niche information on anoxic biofilms remains unclear data on functional bacteria and metabolic pathways could contribute to revolutionizing the anammox based sewage process due to the difficulty in purifying and culturing anammox strains park et al 2017 strous et al 2006 there has been significant interest in alternative techniques metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool for

and suspended sludge in the partial anammox system the phenomena of highly enriched anammox bacteria in anoxic biofilms of the a2 o process were analyzed and the mechanisms of highly enriched anammox

actual municipal wastewater fig 1 in phase ⅰ day 280 to 325 the reactor operated in anaerobic aerobic oxic mode as previously described li et al 2020 after inoculating the carriers the effluent no3 n gradually decreased over one month and the average concentrations remained at 14 1 mg 4 0 mg n l fig 1b in phase ⅱ day 326 to 442 a large volume of suspended sludge was unexpectedly lost 2873 mg vss l to 534 mg vss l fig s2 due to erroneous operation on day 326 sludge loss seriously affected the nitrification capacity of the a2 o system and the effluent nh4 n rapidly deteriorated from 1 3 mg n l to 31 8 mg n l fig 1a during the next 53 days the nitrification performance gradually recovered and the effluent tin concentration was 13 7 mg 2 8 mg n l from day 379 to day 442 to investigate the effect of influent loads on the maintenance of anammox bacteria the influent nh4 n was reduced from 46 1 mg 3 7 mg n l to 29 0 mg 2 4 mg n l in phase ⅲ day 443 to 500 fig 1a after this adjustment the effluent tin concentrations decreased rapidly and remained relatively stable over the next eight weeks the average effluent no3 n was 7 6 mg 1 0 mg n l tin 8 9 mg 1 0 mg n l the actual municipal wastewater was continuously fed during the whole test and the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor was relatively stable under normal operating conditions previous study demonstrated that partial nitrogen loss was attributed to anammox when the influent nh4 n was approximately 50 mg n l contributing higher nitrogen removal than traditional a2 o processes li et al 2020 different from previous findings the influent nh4 n in this study decreased from 46 1 mg 3 7 mg n l to 29 0 mg 2 4 mg n l but the nitrogen removal performance remained stable and satisfactory demonstrating that this process is applicable within the general influent nitrogen concentration range 30 mg 50 mg nh4 n l of municipal wwtps 3 2 anammox activity and contribution to nitrogen removal to determine the nitrogen transformation process within anoxic carrier biofilms batch tests were conducted to simulate an anoxic zone with nh4 no3 and sodium acetate fig 2 a fig s3 as illustrated on day 448 no3 n and cod rapidly decreased and a significant accumulation of no2 n was observed with a peak of 13 4 mg n l subsequently no2 n and nh4 n gradually decreased at a removal rate of 2 6 mg n l h and 1 4 mg n l h respectively when the organic matter had almost been completely consumed no2 n and nh4 n continued to decrease at a removal rate of 0 4 mg n l h and 0 4 mg n l h respectively during this period the ratio of removed no2 n and nh4 n was 1 09 and the ratio of produced no3 n and removed nh4 n was 0 12 which was close to the reported values of 1 14 and 0 16 lotti et al 2014a during this test the proportion of n2o remained extremely low and could be ignored fig s4 these results suggest that anoxic carrier biofilms are more significant to nitrate to nitrite and to specific anammox activity anoxic biofilms had a higher reduction rate of no3 than no2 at the initial stage of the test no2 n was rapidly produced then accumulated rather than immediately converting into dinitrogen the ratio of no2 n nh4 n could reflect the nonlinear rate change between anammox activity and reaction time implying that the presence of organic matter affects no2 competition the batch test lasted over 10 hours but the hrt of the anoxic zone in the a2 o system was far shorter 2 86 h suggesting that proper extension of hrt might improve the nitrogen removal performance by anammox under a lower concentration of organic matter variations were observed in different phases and specific anammox activity and contribution to nitrogen loss fluctuated with the operational status suspended sludge biomass and influent nh4 n fig 2a specially batch tests showed that anammox activity was 0 17 kg n m3 d on day 280 and its contribution to nitrogen removal was 68 on day 430 the anammox activity of anoxic carrier biofilms increased to 0 20 kg n m3 d and its contribution to nitrogen removal was 70 6 except for the concentrations of suspended sludge there were no other changes on the operating parameters thus increased anammox activity in anoxic biofilms might be related to the biomass loss of suspended sludge when the influent nh4 n was reduced in phase ⅲ anammox activity increased to 0 21 kg n m3 d fig 2a with 73 4 of its nitrogen loss on day 462 this might be due to an improvement in the mass transfer efficiency caused by the shedding of the outer biofilms anammox bacteria in anoxic carrier biofilms positively contributed to partial nitrogen removal as detailed below firstly anammox contributed to 68 73 4 of nitrogen removal in different batch tests with anoxic carrier biofilms fig 2a secondly in the a2 o system anammox contributed to approximately 29 2 6 7 of nitrogen loss based on the mass balance table s1 the nitrogen removal rate nrr in this biosystem ranged from 0 04 kg n m3 d to 0 08 kg n m3 d under a cod n ratio 3 0 which is comparable to the reported performance of traditional nitrification denitrification processes even in sewage anammox systems table s2 thirdly over 400 days of operation anammox bacteria were still active in anoxic carrier biofilms rather than in the elution which strongly suggests that anammox cannot be ignored in nitrogen removal furthermore the nitrogen removal generally improved due to increased anammox biomass laureni et al 2015 tao et al 2019 in this study anammox bacterial abundance fig 2b see section 3 3 1 is significantly higher than the previous level reported in a similar a2 o process wang et al 2015 which could have contributed to increased autotrophic nitrogen removal 3 3 highly enriched anammox in the anoxic carrier biofilms the abundance of anammox in the anoxic carrier biofilms 0 74 4 34 fig 2b was significantly higher than in the suspended sludge 0 03 0 08 p 0 001 fig 2c according to the qpcr results in phase ⅰ day 280 anammox abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms and suspended sludge was 2 29 109 copies g dry sludge 0 74 and 2 26 107 copies g dry sludge 0 04 respectively when the suspended sludge was lost in phase ⅱ this increased to a maximum of 1 47 1010 copies g dry sludge 4 34 in the anoxic carrier biofilms on day 430 reducing the influent nh4 n anammox abundance in the anoxic carrier biofilms still maintained 8 35 109 copies g dry sludge 2 87 on day 462 this concurs with previous studies li et al 2020 and shows that the anammox bacteria have a significant niche preference for anoxic carrier biofilms these results are important as they confirm that anammox bacteria can survive long term in low ammonia wastewater with high abundance the in situ enrichment as well as further long term maintenance of anammox bacteria is one of the major bottlenecks in sewage anammox based processes kartal et al 2010 van der star et al 2007 previous studies have demonstrated that anammox bacteria are widespread in traditional full scale municipal wwtps nejidat et al 2018 shu et al 2015b but that the abundance is very low less than 0 003 wang et al 2015 or 0 01 guo et al 2017 according to qpcr results the anammox bacterial abundance 0 74 4 34 in this study is comparable to previous systems that inoculated mature anammox sludge du et al 2017 miao et al 2018 wang et al 2016 the high anammox bacterial abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms explains the positive autotrophic nitrogen removal section 3 2 therefore the results of this study combined with previous studies li et al 2019 ma et al 2017 demonstrate that the a2 o system could consistently maintain relatively high level abundance of anammox bacteria in mainstream biosystem 3 4 key for high anammox enrichment in mainstream biosystem along with losing suspended sludge fig 1 anammox bacterial abundance in the anoxic carrier biofilms increased to an extremely high level fig 2b for the special high enrichment process of anammox batch tests were conducted to simulate the anoxic zone nh4 no3 and sodium acetate designed with three modes anoxic carrier biofilms suspended sludge and a combination of both in the anoxic carrier biofilms concentrations of no3 n and cod decreased rapidly and no2 n significantly accumulated with a peak of 15 5 mg n l fig 3 a no2 n and nh4 n then gradually decreased with removal rates of 2 03 mg n l h and 0 89 mg n l h respectively by contrast in the suspended only sludge the no2 n accumulation reduced by no3 n was very weak fig 3b and the downward trend of nh4 n was significantly slower results on the coexistence of suspended sludge and anoxic biofilms showed that no3 n did not decrease after 0 5 h during which only a small amount of no2 n accumulated the addition of suspended sludge enhanced the nitrite reduction process no2 n2 fig 3c these results show that the nh4 n consumption rates were significantly different with anoxic biofilms or suspended sludge batch tests confirm that the existence of suspended sludge is a key factor for the coupling of denitrification and anammox and controlling suspended biomass might shorten the debugging period of anammox in situ enrichment in mainstream namely suspended sludge strengthens the role of nitrite reduction no2 n2 and weakens the competitiveness of anammox to further understand the niche difference between anoxic carrier biofilms and suspended sludge the microbial community structure was analyzed the dynamic changes in anammox abundance measured by 16s rrna sequencing fig 4 were consistent with the qpcr results fig 2 on the whole the results fig 4 show that ca brocadia were the dominant known nitrogen transforming functional microorganisms in the anoxic carrier biofilms while nitrospira dechloromonas and nitrosomonas were dominant in the suspended sludge in addition to ca brocadia enrichment in anoxic biofilms the proportion of dechloromonas azospira and thauera did not completely recover in suspended sludge day 430 which was significantly different from that before sludge loss day 280 fisher s exact test p 0 01 these results show that suspended sludge contains more denitrifying bacteria and less anammox this is the opposite of the microflora distribution in the anoxic carrier biofilms the unexpected anammox enrichment could be because more denitrifying bacteria survive in suspended sludge than anoxic carrier biofilms the loss of suspended sludge in the bioreactor caused a sharp decrease in denitrifying bacteria especially for no2 reduction and the heterotrophic reduction of no2 weakened this increased the opportunities for anammox bacteria to compete for no2 and further proliferate in a short period when the suspended sludge increased to the previous level the anammox abundance in anoxic carrier biofilms fell off with the decrease of influent nh4 n besides the batch tests and microbial analysis reconfirmed that the anoxic carrier biofilms were crucial to nitrate to nitrite conversion and maintenance of anammox activity 3 5 profile of ca brocadia genus enriched within the anoxic carrier biofilms in the anoxic carrier biofilms the abundance of the ca brocadia reached a maximum level on day 430 fig 2 fig 4 the metagenomic sequencing results fig s5 further reveal that the species ca brocadia fulgida 4 14 and ca brocadia sinica 2 17 were found in significantly higher abundance in the anoxic carrier biofilms than in the suspended sludge 0 22 and 0 13 respectively p 0 001 the dominance of ca brocadia in this study agrees with the typical genus observed in sewage anammox based systems gilbert et al 2015 winkler et al 2012 xie et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 especially for treating actual municipal wastewater laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014b reino et al 2018 studies have reported that ca brocadia consistently dominates in diverse treatment units of municipal wwtps cao et al 2017 nejidat et al 2018 wang et al 2015 while ca jettenia or ca kuenenia are usually dominant in treating high strength wastewater feng et al 2018 guo et al 2016 however the high enrichment of ca brocadia in this study is only a superficial phenomenon and further information is required the reason of enriching anammox dominant species ca brocadia rather than another genus deserves attention to elucidate the enrichment mechanism of the ca brocadia genus the key enzymes for nitrification denitrification and anammox involved in the dominant bacteria were analyzed fig 5 fig s6 for nitrification the responsible amoa 470 hits was closely related to nitrosomonas 438 hits and only observed in suspended sludge none in anoxic carrier biofilms in accordance with microbial community differences fig s5 considering the synergy process of denitrification and anammox fig 3 fig s3 key enzymes of functional bacteria were investigated further denitrification involves multiple nitrogen forms no3 no2 no n2o and n2 therefore the overall metabolic process requires a selection of enzymes kuypers et al 2018 for example narg which are involved in nitrate to nitrite processes were related to a diverse range of bacteria specifically narg was mainly assigned to ca brocadia 3618 hits in anoxic carrier biofilms whereas in suspended sludge it was mostly distributed to nitrospira 6314 hits another nitrate to nitrite enzyme napa was mainly involved in suspended sludge and was most closely related to dechloromonas 1724 hits followed by sulfuritalea 566 hits for nirs the total abundance of samples showed little difference but its distribution was mainly related to dechloromonas 1472 hits in suspended sludge and chloroflexi 878 hits in anoxic carrier biofilms interestingly these results show that the relative abundance of nirk in suspended sludge was 2 6 times higher than in anoxic carrier biofilms table s3 and was mainly assigned to nitrospira 1976 hits of suspended sludge recent research has shown that nitrospira has significant potential for no2 oxidation black and just 2018 and increased nirk in suspended sludge might increase the no2 competition ability with anoxic carrier biofilms for anammox the unique coding gene hzs kartal et al 2011 kuypers et al 2018 was closely related to the most dominant genera ca brocadia 5156 hits in anoxic carrier biofilms yet rarely detected in suspended sludge 170 hits fig 5 similarly hdh a key enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the intermediate hydrazine to dinitrogen during the anammox reaction kartal et al 2011 strous et al 2006 was also significantly more abundant in anoxic carrier biofilms 3264 hits than in suspended sludge 106 hits the higher anammox abundance survival in anoxic carrier biofilms the higher bacteria abundance of hzs and hdh these results are in line with the microbial community analyses and support the niche preference of anammox bacteria comprehensive understanding of the no2 loop through partial denitrification could be discerned based on the coding genes functional microorganisms and specific metabolic mechanisms firstly from the perspective of nitrogen conversion gene the narg nirk nirs ratio in anoxic carrier biofilms 2 45 was higher than in suspended sludge 1 75 table s3 which favored the no2 production over no3 reduction in anoxic biofilms crucially nirk was highly abundant in suspended sludge but almost absent in anoxic carrier biofilms the nirk was assigned to nitrospira 1976 hits of suspended sludge fig 5 while anoxic carrier biofilms were not conducive to its growth due to the oxygen free conditions secondly the most abundant anammox genus ca brocadia was the key narg contributor to nitrate to nitrite in anoxic carrier biofilms fig 5 fig s7 therefore ca brocadia might promote the competition of no2 when losing suspended sludge and then facilitate its dominant position in the anoxic carrier biofilms thirdly the nrfa gene 876 hits linked to some ca brocadia strains could reduce no3 to no2 or nh4 couple to the oxidation of acetate kartal et al 2008 therefore dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra by anammox bacteria might positively contribute to some nitrogen loss finally previous studies have reported that the denitrifying bacteria thauera is crucial as it contributes more to no3 reduction than no2 reduction du et al 2016 ma et al 2017 wang et al 2019b thauera proliferated at a much higher rate in anoxic carrier biofilms than in suspended sludge 2 94 compared to 1 06 respectively fig 4 fig s5 and contained more narg in anoxic carrier biofilms than in suspended sludge 430 hits compared to 134 hits respectively fig 5 indicating the potential role in the no2 supply on anammox based on the above results a preliminary profile of anoxic carrier biofilms is presented in fig 6 to describe the enrichment mechanism of ca brocadia genus through morphology fig s8 chemistry fig 3a fig s3 and the microbial community analysis fig 4 fig 5 anammox metabolism requires no2 as the electron acceptor van der graaf et al 1995 in this study although no2 was not externally fed to the anoxic zone it could be produced by no3 reduction in anoxic carrier biofilms and partially consumed by anammox fig 3 under these preconditions two factors further accelerate the anammox enrichment the loss of suspended sludge rich in nirk s increases the no2 competition ability of ca brocadia in anoxic carrier biofilms fig 5 while the special metabolic characteristics of ca brocadia closely related to narg strengthens the nitrate to nitrite conversion contributing to the rapid enrichment of anammox fig 5 fig s6 3 6 engineering applications in municipal wwtps regarding engineering applications current and previous study on different a2 o processes provide the experimental foundation for in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria in wwtps li et al 2019 experimental evidence has confirmed the theoretical basis including long term performance batch tests microbial community and functional genes analysis the no2 from the no3 reduction could be partially consumed by anammox fig 3 fig s3 particularly under anoxic conditions e g anaerobic or anoxic zones this coupling process also corresponds with the observed nitrate to nitrite reaction in recent anammox based studies du et al 2017 ma et al 2017 furthermore heterotrophic denitrification generally undergoes the production process of no nitric oxide kuypers et al 2018 thereby creating a macro environment for anammox using nh4 and no anoxic carrier biofilms improve stability tolerance of anammox bacteria in mainstream because of their spontaneous enrichment rather than inoculation lab or pilot scale experiments have usually been implemented with the inoculation of mature anammox sludge from side stream or other bioreactors lemaire 2014 lotti et al 2014b stefansdottir 2014 but it is impractical to directly inoculate into full scale wwtps despite that this work provides solid evidence for treating municipal wastewater via in situ enrichment of anammox and this is expected to be further verified in future long term lab scale and pilot scale tests controlling the suspended sludge is simpler and does not require a complex multi factor control and high tech professional managers in addition comammox has recently been reported as the predominant nitrifier nh4 directly to no3 in a traditional nitrification denitrification wwtp yang et al 2020 its presence poses a threat to stable nitritation in aerobic zones of continuous flow biosystems but it might be beneficial for partial denitrification via a return to the anoxic zone the work presented here is just the tip of the iceberg on the partial anammox direction future research and engineering projects that are expected to be implemented in municipal wwtps optimization of the synergistic relationship between anoxic carrier biofilms and suspended sludge might be conducive to improving the nitrogen removal performance the interpretation of the metagenomic analysis implies the potential of these microbes rather than actual activity thus further studies on metabolite levels rna or protein hu et al 2019 lawson et al 2017 lv et al 2019 are necessary to characterize the active functions of these microorganisms e g ca brocadia nitrospira thauera furthermore when the anoxic carrier biofilm thickness was reduced fig 2a anammox abundance in suspended sludge was enhanced fig 2c and its quantitative influence on nitrogen loss requires further investigation from a broader perspective anammox bacteria could be involved not only in nitrogen conversion but also in carbon metabolism kuypers et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 meaning that the regulation of complex environmental conditions is necessary e g cod n do spatial pattern 4 conclusions this study investigated the niche differences on anoxic biofilms and suspended sludge in a continuous flow partial denitrification anammox system the introduction of biofilms in the anoxic zone could hold a relatively high abundance of anammox bacteria 0 74 4 34 within the general influent n concentration range 30 mg 50 mg nh4 n l ca brocadia dominated the anoxic carrier biofilms while nitrospira dominated in suspended sludge the unexpectedly enriched anammox was attributed to the abrupt loss of suspended sludge higher nirk in suspended sludge supported the rapid no2 reduction and higher abundance of narg linked to ca brocadia might further enhance the nitrate to nitrite within anoxic carrier biofilms the microbial community and batch tests suggest that controlling suspended biomass could help anammox enrichment

17134,the global increase in cyanobacterial blooms poses environmental and health threats selected cyanobacterial strains reveal toxicities despite a lack of synthesis of known toxic metabolites and the mechanisms of these toxicities are not well understood here we investigated the toxicity of non cylindrospermopsin and non microcystin producing aphanizomenon gracile and raphidiopsis raciborskii of central european origin to zebrafish exposed for 14 days to their extracts toxicological screening revealed the presence of anabaenopeptins and a lack of anatoxin a ß methylamino l alanine or

cyanotoxins such as anabaenopeptins spoof et al 2016 accumulating evidence indicates that the toxicity of selected species is geographically diversified strain dependent and in some cases linked to the biosynthesis of hitherto unknown metabolites hrouzek et al 2016 rzymski and poniedzialek 2014 cyanobacteria species raphidiopsis raciborskii woloszynska aguilera berrendero gómez kaštovský echenique and salerno formerly cylindrospermopsis raciborskii wołoszyńska seenaya and subba raju and members of the aphanizomenon genus such as a gracile lemmermann belong to the most widely studied cyanobacteria of the order nostocales cirés and ballot 2016 rzymski and poniedzialek 2014 this research focus is due to the global distribution of these cyanobacteria species their ability to form dense blooms and produce different potent toxins the biosynthesis of cyn has been shown for r raciborskii strains occurring in australia new zealand and selected regions of asia e g in china whereas brazilian strains are responsible for stxs production hawkins et al 1997 hoff risseti et al 2013 wood and stirling 2003 xie et al 2018 despite extensive research efforts strains associated with the temperate zone were never shown to produce any known cyanotoxins although studies have shown that their extracts and exudates are toxic in experimental in vitro and in vivo models for example exudates of hungarian strains of r raciborskii have been shown to act as acetylcholine agonists in mollusks vehovszky et al 2012 vehovszky et al 2015 an extract of french and german strains induced liver necrosis in rodents bernard et al 2003 fastner et al 2003 while polish strains caused modulation of acetylcholinesterase activity in the fish brain and exhibited cytotoxicity in different types of human cells falfushynska et al 2019 poniedziałek et al 2015 rzymski et al 2017 in turn a gracile has been recognized as a primary producer of cyn in some regions of the temperate zone in poland ukraine and russia while other strains were shown to synthesize stxs in germany france and spain ballot et al 2010 cirés et al 2014 kokociński et al 2013 ledreux et al 2010 rzymski et al 2018 sidelev et al 2020 however previous studies have shown that selected strains of a gracile from poland can cause significant toxicities in different experimental models due to hitherto unknown bioactive compounds rzymski et al 2017 falfushynska et al 2019 wejnerowski et al 2020 these findings demonstrate that no strain of r raciborskii or a gracile should be assumed nontoxic based on the lack of production of known cyanotoxins there is an urgent need to further explore the toxicities of such strains to understand the threats that may arise from their presence in freshwaters notably over 600 different peptides and peptidic metabolites were isolated from cyanobacteria their biological activity often remains unknown while their chemical detection in different species and strains is challenging and not commonly conducted kust et al 2020 welker and von döhren 2006 moreover toxicity may also be due to the presence of non peptide compounds such as polymethoxyalkenes jaja chimedza et al 2015 rzymski et al 2019 the present study seeks to gain insight into the diversity of the toxic mechanisms of freshwater cyanobacteria by investigating the effect of extracts of selected central european strains of r raciborskii and a gracile on the molecular responses in the zebrafish danio rerio the chosen strains were previously confirmed to cause in vitro toxicity in fish cells and not to produce cyn or mcs wejnerowski et al 2020 here we screened three cyanobacterial strains of r raciborskii and a gracile from central europe for the presence of ana a stx bmaa and anabaenopeptins and examined whether the extracts of these strains can induce the adverse effects in fish during in vivo exposures based on the earlier published reports about the mechanisms of toxicity of known cyanobacterial toxins reviewed in buratti et al 2017 we have chosen a battery of biochemical and molecular biomarkers targeting the potential toxicity pathways including oxidative stress cyto neuro and geno toxicity oxidative stress was assessed by determining the levels of oxidatively damaged proteins measured by the concentration of the carbonyl groups and lipids assessed as the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances the tissue levels of key antioxidants glutathione catalase and glutathione s transferase and the transcript levels of a master regulator of the antioxidant response the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 nrf2 in the liver of the fish exposed to the extracts of the three studied cyanobacterial strains activities of acetylcholine esterase in the brain and lactate dehydrogenase in the blood plasma were used as common markers of the neuro and hepatotoxicity respectively to assess the general cytotoxicity of the cyanobacterial extracts we measured the transcript levels of the critical genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis caspase 3a and 3b bax and bcl 2 cellular stress signaling stress kinases p53 mapk activated protein kinase 2 and jun

in the liver furthermore based on the earlier reports identifying the protein phosphatases buratti et al 2017 and the lipid metabolism pathways zhang et al 2020 as important targets of cyanotoxins we determined the effects of the selected cyanobacterial extracts on the transcript levels of the protein phosphatases ppp6c and ppm1h as well as on the lipid metabolism biomarkers including the proliferator activated receptor α pparα fatty acid binding protein 1b and phospholipase a2 to test whether exposures to cyanobacterial extracts induce xenobiotics detoxification pathways as a possible

3 5 fold respectively in the liver of d rerio fig 4f g 3 8 lipid metabolism markers exposure to the extract of a gracile amu dh 1 strain led to upregulation of the transcript levels for the fatty acid binding protein 1b fabp1b and phospholipase a2 pla2g but did not affect the mrna levels of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α b pparab in the liver of d rerio fig 5 a similar pattern was found in the fish exposed to cyn fig 5 transcript levels of fabp1b were upregulated and those of pparab downregulated by exposures to the a gracile sag 31 79 extract and mc lr the r raciborskii sag 1

purified cyanotoxins or to a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 extracts were considerably larger d2 814 1279 fig 8 of all the studied exposure groups those exposed to mc lr and cyn were located most closely together in the plane of the two main roots fig 8 4 discussion in our study the model aquatic vertebrate the zebrafish d rerio showed significant toxic responses to extracts of common central european strains of a gracile and r raciborskii table 2 the studied extracts did not contain cyn mcs wejnerowski et al 2020 ana a stxs or bmaa although the presence of anabaenopeptins was confirmed in all cases this is the first time that the production of these cyclic peptides has been demonstrated for a gracile and r raciborskii however previous research has shown that these compounds for which over 115 isoforms have been reported are found in the genera anabaena aphanizomenon lyngbya microcystis nodularia nostoc oscillatoria planktothrix and schizothrix saha et al 2020 lima et al 2017 it is worth noting that the toxic effects of the extracts in d rerio cannot be directly attributed to the anabaenopeptins as the extracts are a rich chemical matrix nevertheless the present study highlights that the production of anabaenopeptins should be taken into account during risk assessments of a gracile and r raciborskii occurring in central europe it is known that they act as inhibitors of serine proteases and protein phosphatases and via these pathways can potentially disrupt various metabolic processes spoof et al 2016 one should note that although most of anabaenopeptins have been labelled as nontoxic at environmentally relevant concentrations it is unknown whether their toxicity can be modified when they occur in mixtures with other cyanobacterial compounds lenz et al 2019 miller et al 2017 as shown in the present work and discussed in subsequent sections cyanobacterial extracts containing anabaenopeptins can induce a wide array of toxic effects in fish the multivariate analyses indicated that the extracts of a gracile amu dh 1 were the least toxic i e most similar to the control unexposed group of the three studied cyanobacterial strains whereas the extracts of a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 showed higher toxicity the studied biomarkers indicated some similarities and many differences in the toxic response patterns between the purified toxins and the cyanobacterial extracts as well as among the extracts from the different cyanobacterial strains generally purified mc lr and cyn showed overlapping multi biomarker profiles indicating similar toxic mechanisms in zebrafish that involve oxidative stress induction of apoptosis and dna damage sensing pathways downregulation of xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms interference with the cell signaling via stress kinases and serine threonine protein phosphatases and negative impacts on the cytoskeleton some of these toxic mechanisms including oxidative stress neurotoxicity as well as suppression of xenobiotic detoxification pathways and tubulin expression were shared between the purified cyanotoxins and the studied cyanobacterial extracts other toxicity biomarkers including those related to apoptosis cellular stress signaling lipid metabolism and hepatotoxicity showed considerable strain to strain variation as well as differences between the cyanobacterial extracts and purified cyn and mc lr this variability in the toxic mechanisms might reflect the chemical complexity of the crude cyanobacterial extracts used in this study that likely contain multiple bioactive compounds our present findings demonstrate the utility of the multi biomarker toxicity assessments for determining toxicity of the native cyanobacterial strains when the chemical nature of the toxic compound s remains elusive 4 1 oxidative stress induced by cyanotoxins and nostocales extracts oxidative stress indicated by the accumulation of the oxidative lesions and shifts in the levels of antioxidants appeared a common response of d rerio to the cyanobacterial strain extracts as well as purified cyn and mc lr table 2 generally the oxidative stress signature was stronger in the fish exposed to the purified toxins than in those exposed to the crude cyanobacterial extracts furthermore the degree of oxidative stress varied among the fish exposed to different cyanobacterial extracts a considerable increase in the oxidative lesions to proteins and lipids in d rerio exposed to 20 µg l 1 of mc lr or cyn indicated a misbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species ros and activity of antioxidants that went hand in hand with the suppression of the activity of two key antioxidant enzymes gst and catalase in these fish accumulation of the oxidative lesions in the proteins was also found in the fish exposed to all three studied cyanobacterial extracts while an increase in tbars levels was found in the fish exposed to a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 extracts notably in the fish exposed to the least toxic of the three studied cyanobacterial strains a gracile amu dh 1 upregulation of two important antioxidant enzymes gst and catalase was observed probably as a mechanism to protect against excessive ros production this mechanism was at least partially successful as shown by the lower levels of oxidative lesions in the livers of the fish exposed to a gracile amu dh 1 compared with those exposed to a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 or to purified mc lr or cyn an increase in the reduced glutathione pool was observed in all experimental treatments in this study glutathione is an important cellular ros scavenger in fish grim et al 2013 hermes lima and zenteno savín 2002 and upregulation of the glutathione pool might be a protective mechanism against excess ros however this mechanism was insufficient to prevent the accumulation of oxidative lesions in the liver of d rerio exposed to the cyanobacterial extracts or purified mc lr or cyn transcript levels of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 nrf2 a key regulator of the cellular antioxidant protection were suppressed in the liver of the fish exposed to the bioactive compounds from all three studied cyanobacterial strains as well as to the purified cyanotoxins nrf2 is an evolutionarily conserved leucine zipper transcription factor that controls the expression of an array of antioxidant response element are dependent genes to counterbalance an increase in the ros production induced by toxins ma 2013 in vertebrates including zebrafish nrf2 transcriptionally regulates expression of detoxification and antioxidant enzymes including cyp1a ephx1 and gst as well as non enzymatic antioxidants thioredoxins and sulfiredoxins but not glutathione ma 2013 sant et al 2017 suppression of nrf2 expression in the fish exposed to the bioactive cyanobacterial compounds may interfere with the redox signaling and consequently suppress the antioxidant activity in the cell leading to a misbalance between ros generation and removal this misbalance might explain the suppression of catalase and gst activities and the accumulation of oxidative lesions in the fish exposed to cyanotoxins and the extracts of the two more toxic strains a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 however exposure to the extract of the least toxic strain a gracile amu dh 1 did not result in suppression of transcription of antioxidant gst and cat or detoxification cyp1a enzymes despite a decrease in the nrf2 transcript levels these data indicate that other signaling mechanisms are in place to compensate for the suppressed nrf2 expression and maintain a strong antioxidant response in the a gracile amu dh 1 exposed fish 4 2 hepato and neurotoxicity of cyanotoxins and nostocales extracts liver injury is considered a hallmark of mcs and cyn toxicity in vertebrates bláha et al 2009 and our present study corroborates these findings by showing an increase in the levels of a biochemical marker of liver damage the serum ldh activity in the fish exposed to mc lr or cyn unlike purified cyn and mc lr hepatotoxicity of the cyanobacterial strain extracts showed considerable strain to strain variation table 2 measurements of the serum ldh activity indicated that the bioactive compounds from the a gracile sag 31 79 and a gracile amu dh 1 are much less hepatotoxic than purified mc lr and cyn in contrast fish exposed to the r raciborskii sag 1 97 showed signs of acute hepatotoxicity that were stronger than in the case of mc lr and cyn our results are in line with previous findings emphasizing the prominent hepatotoxicity of r raciborskii extracts against primary rat hepatocytes and human hepatoblastoma hep g2 fastner et al 2003 like the strains used in our present study neither of the seven strains isolated from melangsee germany used in the research on hep g2 cells contained cyn or mc fastner et al 2003 all cyanobacterial extracts caused a significant decrease of acetylcholinesterase ache activity in the brain of d rerio indicating neurotoxicity a similar decrease was caused by cyn exposure whereas exposure to mc lr led to elevated ache activity these findings agree with the earlier reports of ache inhibition by cyn hinojosa et al 2019 but not mc lrs kist et al 2012 wu et al 2016 in the rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss exposure to the crude extract and or to the culture of an mc lr producing strain of microcystis aeruginosa inhibited ache activity gélinas et al 2012 qian et al 2018 however in the latter studies it remains unclear whether the ache inhibition is due to mc lr or some other bioactive compounds present in the cultures or the crude cell extracts our present study shows that ache suppression can be elicited by the extracts of cyanobacteria not producing mc lr or cyn the mechanisms of ache suppression by bioactive metabolites of the studied cyanobacterial extracts are currently not known and require further investigation possible mechanisms might involve chemical modification of the enzyme via hyperphosphorylation of the serine residues in the active site colović et al 2013 e g due to transcriptional downregulation of protein phosphatases such as found in the fish exposed to the a gracile and r raciborskii extracts in our present study and or disruption of the lipid protein interactions of the membrane bound ache due to lipid peroxidation tsukamoto et al 1998 regardless of the exact molecular mechanisms suppression of ache activity in fish exposed to the a gracile and r raciborskii extracts can cause failure of the synaptic transmission and negatively affect the physiology and behavior of the fish furthermore inhibition of ache in fish might serve as a robust albeit non specific biomarker of cyanobacterial toxicity as it is elicited by multiple cyanobacterial strains including a gracile r raciborskii this study and m aeruginosa gélinas et al 2012 qian et al 2018 4 3 xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification exposure to the two studied a gracile extracts as well as the purified mc lr and cyn led to transcriptional suppression of a marker enzyme in the xenobiotic biotransformation pathway encoding cytochrome p450 cyp450 monooxygenase cyp1a a similar albeit statistically non significant trend was found in the fish exposed to r raciborskii sag 1 97 extract cyp1a is a key enzyme involved in phase i biotransformation of xenobiotics sarasquete and segner 2000 and transcriptionally induced through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr binding to xenobiotics such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons pah polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and other planar organic compounds mescher and haarmann stemmann 2018 a lack of cyp1a induction indicates that the bioactive compounds in the three studied cyanobacterial strains as well as mc lr or cyn do not act as ahr ligands and inducers of cyp450 enzymes this is consistent with the notion that cyanotoxins such as mc lr and cyn do not undergo phase i metabolism in vertebrates but are detoxified through glutathione dependent pathways kittler et al 2016 schmidt et al 2014 earlier studies in the larval zebrafish and murine models also showed transcriptional suppression of cyp1a in response to mc lr exposures rogers et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 furthermore the treatment of mice with mc lr lr led to a decrease in the levels of cytochrome p450 and an increase in the inactivated form of cyp450 cyp420 brooks and codd 1987 taken together these findings indicate that exposure to a broad range of bioactive cyanobacterial compounds can suppress the function of cyp450 monooxygenase in vertebrates including fish and mammals and thus act as chemosensitizers potentiating the toxicity of drugs or organic pollutants metabolized by the cyp450 system expression of another cyp450 enzyme the retinoic acid hydroxylase cyp26b1 in the liver of d rerio was suppressed by exposure to all the studied cyanobacterial extracts as well as to purified mc lr and cyn cyp26b1 plays a key role in the metabolism of vitamin a regulating the tissue levels of retinoic acid ra the active metabolite of vitamin a and a critical signaling molecule in vertebrates nelson et al 2013 retinoid acid is involved in the regulation of cell homeostasis growth reproduction skeletal development and vision of vertebrates including fish laue et al 2008 lie et al 2019 our study shows a strong inhibition of cyp26b1transcripts by cyanobacterial active compounds and indicates that interference with the retinoid signaling might be an important toxic mechanism of cyanobacterial toxins transcript levels of epoxide hydrolase 1 ephx1 were not affected by exposures to the cyanobacterial strain extracts or the purified model cyanotoxins in the liver of d rerio ephx1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of toxic epoxides to less reactive and more water soluble dihydrodiol compounds argiriadi et al 1999 it is involved in the biotransformation of various xenobiotics including carcinogenic compounds such as benzene or styrene decker et al 2009 václavíková et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge no study has directly investigated the role of ephx1 in detoxification of cyanobacterial toxins our present study indicates that this enzyme is not responsive to cyn mc lr and the studied european strains of a gracile and r raciborskii and is not suitable as a biomarker for cyanobacterial toxicity 4 4 dna damage repair and apoptosis the marker genes in the dna damage sensing and repair pathways did not show a coherent response to the studied cyanotoxins or cyanobacterial extracts in d rerio the only consistent change observed in all experimental exposures was a significant upregulation of gadd45 mrna in the liver of d rerio table 2 gadd45 are highly conserved proteins implicated in sensing transducing and mediating cellular stress response particularly genotoxic stress liebermann and hoffmann 2008 gadd45 proteins play a key role in dna excision repair through interactions with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna and control the balance between cell survival and death acting as positive modulators of apoptosis during stress exposures in multiple cell types liebermann and hoffmann 2008 our finding of gadd45 upregulation in the liver cells of d rerio exposed to the cyanobacterial extracts and purified cyanotoxins indicates pro apoptotic action of these compounds this notion is supported by the induction of the apoptotic pathways in the liver of d rerio exposed to the purified cyanotoxins and to the studied a gracile and r raciborskii extracts shown by the elevated expression of the executor caspases 3a and in the case of the purified toxins 3b and suppression of the anti apoptotic regulator bcl 2 similarly the expression of jun mrna encoding an anti apoptotic regulator c jun wisdom et al 1999 was suppressed in the fish exposed to the purified cyanotoxins and to the most toxic of the three studied cyanobacterial strains a gracile sag 31 79 interestingly mrna expression of an apoptotic activator bax decreased in the liver of the fish exposed to the purified cyanotoxins and to the a gracile sag 31 79 extract this decrease went hand in hand with the transcriptional downregulation of the tumor suppression protein p53 a key positive modulator of bax expression in animals indicating a possible compensatory mechanism to prevent excessive apoptosis this compensatory mechanism appears to be sufficient to suppress the upregulation of the executor caspases 3a and 3b in the fish exposed to the a gracile sag 31 79 extract but not in those exposed to purified mc lr and cyn transcripts of two proteins playing important roles in dna damage repair xpc and rad51 were strongly downregulated by 2 5 fold and 3 5 fold in the liver of d rerio exposed to cyn but not to mc lr these results are consistent with the earlier findings in human cell lines and murine models that show higher genotoxicity of cyn compared with mc lr hercog et al 2017 díez quijada et al 2020 exposure of d rerio to the a gracile and r raciborskii extracts generally did not affect the mrna expression levels of xpc and rad51 except for a 2 1 fold decrease in rad51 in the a gracile amu dh 1 exposed fish indicating that the bioactive compounds from these strains are not genotoxic 4 5 cell signaling cyanobacterial mcs are potent and specific inhibitors of eukaryotic phosphoprotein phosphatases pp2a and pp1 that play critical regulatory roles in multiple cellular signaling cascades mackintosh et al 1990 the inhibitory effect is due to the direct binding of mc lr to pp2a and pp1 and results in excessive phosphorylation of structural filaments leading to the degradation of the cytoskeleton pearson et al 2010 unlike mc lr cyn does not act as a pp2a and pp1 inhibitor chong et al 2002 pearson et al 2010 in our present study we did not measure the activity of phosphoprotein phosphatases in d rerio liver however our results show that the two studied cyanotoxins as well as the crude cyanobacterial extracts can impair the phosphoprotein metabolism at the transcriptional level by strongly suppressing the mrna levels of ppp6c encoding the catalytic subunit of a phosphoprotein phosphatase 6 pp6 involved in cell cycle regulation dna damage repair inflammation and immunity ohama 2019 ziembik et al 2017 furthermore exposure to purified mc lr and cyn as well as to the crude r raciborskii sag 1 97 extract downregulated the mrna expression of another important protein phosphatase protein phosphatase 1h ppm1h in the zebrafish liver the ppm1h is a gatekeeper phosphatase involved in regulation of cell proliferation differentiation migration and apoptosis in vertebartes shen et al 2014 a decrease in the transcript levels of ppp6c and ppm1h can have a negative impact on the amount and therefore the activity of these important signaling enzymes with pleiotropic downstream effects on multiple cellular functions interestingly while the ppp6c expression was suppressed in all experimental exposures transcriptional downregulation of ppm1h was not observed in the fish exposed to the a gracile amu dh 1 and sag 31 79 extracts altogether these data indicate that the cyanobacterial toxins including mc lr cyn and unidentified biologically active compounds from european r raciborskii might have broad adverse effects on the phosphorylation dependent cellular signaling through transcriptional mechanisms beyond the direct inhibitory effects on the enzymatic activity of phosphoprotein phosphatases a stress responsive ser thr protein kinase mk2 was also transcriptionally downregulated in the liver of d rerio exposed to purified mc lr and cyn or to the extract of a gracile sag 31 79 mk2 plays a crucial role in p38 map kinase dependent cellular stress signaling regulating cytokine production inflammation and actin remodeling kotlyarov and gaestel 2002 a decrease in mk2 expression and by inference activity might result in destabilization of the cytoskeleton and an impaired immune response hitti et al 2006 kotlyarov and gaestel 2002 generally little is known about the effects of cyanotoxins and bioactive metabolites of cyanobacteria on the mapk pathway and to the best of our knowledge these effects have not yet been explored in fish in mammals the responses of the mapk pathway appear to vary among the experimental models and the type of cyanotoxins thus mc lr exposure activated p38 and erk1 2 kinases in the mapk pathway and altered the cytoskeleton in a549 human non small lung cancer cells and mice alveolar type ii epithelial cells wang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 in contrast in human bronchial epithelial cells exposure to mc lr 20 µm initially downregulated activity of the mitogen activated protein kinases erk1 2 and p38 after 2 8 h with a subsequent return to the baseline activity levels after 48 h of exposure brózman et al 2020 overall our present data indicate that the purified cyanotoxins as well as the bioactive compounds from the three studied a gracile and r raciborskii strains can interfere with cellular signaling and negatively affect cytoskeleton stability and function in exposed fish through modifying mapks expression levels the latter notion is supported by our findings of strongly suppressed tubulin mrna expression in all experimental treatments and a decrease in the actin mrna levels in the livers of fish exposed to mc lr or r raciborskii sag 1 97 extract 4 6 lipid metabolism analysis of the transcript levels of the lipid metabolism biomarkers fabp1b pparab and pla2g indicate that the bioactive compounds of a gracile and r raciborskii as well as mc lr and cyn affect lipid metabolism however changes in the lipid biomarker profile revealed stark differences between the two studied cyanotoxins as well as the different strain extracts thus mrna expression levels of a fatty acid binding protein fabp1b and phospholipase a2g were strongly upregulated in the livers of fish exposed to cyn and the a gracile amu dh 1 extract phospholipases a2 including pla2g catalyze the hydrolysis of the ester bond at the sn 2 position of phospholipid substrates releasing free fatty acids such as arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids burke and dennis 2009 dennis et al 2011 elevated expression of pla2g might lead to the accumulation of toxic levels of free fatty acids in the cell concomitant upregulation of the mrna expression of the fatty acid binding protein fabp1 found in all experimental exposures except the a gracile amu dh 1 exposure may therefore assist in fatty acids sequestration thereby protecting the cells against the potentially harmful effects of excess free fatty acids sharma et al 2006 peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α pparab mrna expression was suppressed in the fish exposed to mc lr or to the a gracile sag 31 79 extracts pparα is a master regulator of fatty acid oxidation in vertebrate tissues controlling the expression of numerous genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways in the liver bougarne et al 2018 activation of pparα promotes catabolism of fatty acids so downregulation of pparα in the livers of mc lr and a gracile sag 31 79 exposed fish might decrease the β oxidation of fatty acids and increase the free fatty acid content of the cells contributing to the toxicity of these cyanobacterial compounds the lack of suppression of pparα mrna in the fish exposed to the a gracile amu dh 1 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 extracts is consistent with the lower toxicity of these strains compared to a gracile sag 31 79 further studies are needed to determine whether these shifts in the transcriptional profiles of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism translate to the respective changes in the free fatty acid content of the cells in the fish exposed to different cyanobacterial toxins and bioactive compounds 5 conclusions our study using the experimental zebrafish model and a battery of biochemical and molecular markers showed that three strains of a gracile and r raciborskii from different localities in central europe exhibit signs of toxicity at the cellular and organ levels the presence of cyn mcs ana a bmaa and stxs in these extracts was excluded but the results show that a gracile and r raciborskii are capable of producing anabaenopeptins the present study demonstrates the multifaceted toxic effects that can be induced by cyn mc lr as well as the bioactive compounds in the extracts of the selected strains of cyanobacteria that involve oxidative stress hepato neuro and genotoxicity interference with the cellular signaling and reversible phosphorylation pathways alterations of lipid metabolism and induction of apoptosis the specific toxicity mechanisms of different strains assessed by the biomarker profiles were different from each other and from the two common cyanobacterial toxins mc lr and cyn furthermore the two strains of the same species a gracile revealed different toxicity profiles this shows that the central european strains of common cyanobacterial species a gracile and r raciborskii produce potentially toxic bioactive compounds so that no a priori assumption of a lack of toxicity can be made based on the lack of the production of known cyanotoxins by these and similar strains it is important to stress that our present study does not relate the observed effects to any particular compound but to a mixture present in the crude cyanobacterial extracts this approach does not allow us to mechanistically link the observed toxicity with a specific compound s yet it more closely mimics the potential toxicity caused by the termination of blooms of the studied cyanobacteria species thus the assessment of toxicity and associated risks of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters cannot be based on the analytical screening of established toxins or amplification of the marker genes of their biosynthesis alone but should involve multibiomarker based toxicity assessment in experimental in vitro and in vivo models credit

17134,the global increase in cyanobacterial blooms poses environmental and health threats selected cyanobacterial strains reveal toxicities despite a lack of synthesis of known toxic metabolites and the mechanisms of these toxicities are not well understood here we investigated the toxicity of non cylindrospermopsin and non microcystin producing aphanizomenon gracile and raphidiopsis raciborskii of central european origin to zebrafish exposed for 14 days to their extracts toxicological screening revealed the presence of anabaenopeptins and a lack of anatoxin a ß methylamino l alanine or saxitoxins in examined extracts the responses were compared to 20 μg l 1 of common cyanobacterial toxins cylindrospermopsin cyn and microcystin lr mc lr the expression of the marker genes involved in

and lactate dehydrogenase activity were measured in the liver and acetylcholinesterase activity was determined as an index of neurotoxicity in the brain the extracts of three cyanobacterial strains that produce no known cyanotoxins caused marked toxicity in d rerio and the biomarker profiles indicate different toxic mechanisms between the bioactive compounds extracted from these strains and the purified cyanotoxins all studied cyanobacterial extracts and purified cyanotoxins induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity downregulated nrf2 and cyp26b1 disrupted phosphorylation dephosphorylation processes and actin tubulin cytoskeleton and upregulated apoptotic activity in the liver the tested strains and purified toxins displayed distinctively different effects on lipid metabolism unlike cyn

human driven eutrophication and climate change contribute to the increased incidence and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters burford et al 2020 townhill et al 2018 these events characterized by the massive proliferation of cyanobacteria can severely affect aquatic ecosystems and pose a threat to human health due to the production of toxic metabolites by some species and

and potentially toxic compounds du et al 2019 henao et al 2020 huang and zimba 2019 rzymski et al 2014 more recently there has been an interest in identifying new and less frequently studied bioactive cyanotoxins such as anabaenopeptins spoof et al 2016 accumulating evidence indicates that the toxicity of selected species is geographically diversified strain dependent and in some cases linked to the biosynthesis of hitherto unknown metabolites hrouzek et al 2016 rzymski and poniedzialek 2014 cyanobacteria species raphidiopsis raciborskii woloszynska aguilera berrendero gómez kaštovský echenique and salerno formerly cylindrospermopsis raciborskii wołoszyńska seenaya and subba raju and members of the aphanizomenon genus such as a gracile lemmermann belong to the most widely studied cyanobacteria of the order nostocales cirés and ballot 2016 rzymski and poniedzialek 2014 this research focus is due to the global distribution of these cyanobacteria species their ability to form dense blooms and produce different potent toxins the biosynthesis of cyn has been shown for r raciborskii strains occurring in australia new zealand and selected regions of asia e g in china whereas brazilian strains are responsible for stxs production hawkins et al 1997 hoff risseti et al 2013 wood and stirling 2003 xie et al 2018 despite extensive research efforts strains associated with the temperate zone were never shown to produce any known cyanotoxins although studies have shown that their extracts and exudates are toxic in experimental in vitro and in vivo models for example exudates of hungarian strains of r raciborskii have been shown to act as acetylcholine agonists in mollusks vehovszky et al 2012 vehovszky et al 2015 an extract of french and german strains induced liver necrosis in rodents bernard et al 2003 fastner et al 2003 while polish strains caused modulation of acetylcholinesterase activity in the fish brain and exhibited cytotoxicity in different types of human cells falfushynska et al 2019 poniedziałek et al 2015 rzymski et al 2017 in turn a gracile has been recognized as a primary producer of cyn in some regions of the temperate zone in poland ukraine and russia while other strains were shown to synthesize stxs in germany france and spain ballot et al 2010 cirés et al 2014 kokociński et al 2013 ledreux et al 2010 rzymski et al 2018 sidelev et al 2020 however previous studies have shown that selected strains of a gracile from poland can cause significant toxicities in different experimental models due to hitherto unknown bioactive compounds rzymski et al 2017 falfushynska et al 2019 wejnerowski et al 2020 these findings demonstrate that no strain of r raciborskii or a gracile should be assumed nontoxic based on the lack of production of known cyanotoxins there is an urgent need to further explore the toxicities of such strains to understand the threats that may arise from their presence in freshwaters notably over 600 different peptides and peptidic metabolites were isolated from cyanobacteria their biological activity often remains unknown while their chemical detection in different species and strains is challenging and not commonly conducted kust et al 2020 welker and von döhren 2006 moreover toxicity may also be due to the presence of non peptide compounds such as polymethoxyalkenes jaja chimedza et al 2015 rzymski et al 2019 the present study seeks to gain insight into the diversity of the toxic mechanisms of freshwater cyanobacteria by investigating the effect of extracts of selected central european strains of r raciborskii and a gracile on the molecular responses in the zebrafish danio rerio the chosen strains were previously confirmed to cause in vitro toxicity in fish cells and not to produce cyn or mcs wejnerowski et al 2020 here we screened three cyanobacterial strains of r raciborskii and a gracile from central europe for the presence of ana a stx bmaa and anabaenopeptins and examined whether the extracts of these strains can induce the adverse effects in fish during in vivo exposures based on the earlier published reports about the mechanisms of toxicity of known cyanobacterial toxins reviewed in buratti et al 2017 we have chosen a battery of biochemical and molecular biomarkers targeting the potential toxicity pathways including oxidative stress cyto neuro and geno toxicity oxidative stress was assessed by determining the levels of oxidatively damaged proteins measured by the concentration of the carbonyl groups and lipids assessed as the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances the tissue levels of key antioxidants glutathione catalase and glutathione s transferase and the transcript levels of a master regulator of the antioxidant response the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 nrf2 in the liver of the fish exposed to the extracts of the three studied cyanobacterial strains activities of acetylcholine esterase in the brain and lactate dehydrogenase in the blood plasma were used as common markers of the neuro and hepatotoxicity respectively to assess the general cytotoxicity of the cyanobacterial extracts we measured the transcript levels of the critical genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis caspase 3a and 3b bax and bcl 2 cellular stress signaling stress kinases p53 mapk activated protein kinase 2 and jun protooncogene dna damage and repair xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group c protein growth arrest and dna damage inducible gadd45 protein and rad51 and cytoskeleton remodeling actin and tubulin in the liver furthermore based on the earlier reports identifying the protein phosphatases buratti et al 2017 and the lipid metabolism pathways zhang et al 2020 as important targets of cyanotoxins we determined the effects of the selected cyanobacterial extracts on the transcript levels of the protein phosphatases ppp6c and ppm1h as well as on the lipid metabolism biomarkers including the proliferator activated receptor α pparα fatty acid binding protein 1b and phospholipase a2 to test whether exposures to cyanobacterial extracts induce xenobiotics detoxification pathways as a possible protective mechanism mrna levels of phase i biotransformation enzymes cytochrome p450 1a cytochrome p450 family 26 subfamily b member 1 and epoxide hydrolase 1 were measured in the liver of the control and cyanobacteria exposed zebrafish to better understand the magnitude of the observed toxicities the effects were compared to those induced by mc lr and cyn based on the implementation of a

livers of fish exposed to the a gracile amu dh 1 extract and upregulated by 2 3 fold in the mc lr exposed fish fig 4g cyn exposure led to the downregulation of the xpc and rad51 mrna levels by 2 5 and 3 5 fold respectively in the liver of d rerio fig 4f g 3 8 lipid metabolism markers exposure to the extract of a gracile amu dh 1 strain led to upregulation of the transcript levels for the fatty acid binding protein 1b fabp1b and phospholipase a2 pla2g but did not affect the mrna levels of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α b pparab in the liver of d rerio fig 5 a similar pattern was found in the fish exposed to cyn fig 5 transcript levels of fabp1b were upregulated and those of pparab downregulated by exposures to the a gracile sag 31 79 extract and mc lr the r raciborskii sag 1

the mrna levels of β actin did not change fig 6c exposure to the cyanobacterial extracts and the purified cyanotoxins led to a downregulation of tubulin expression with the smallest decrease 1 7 fold caused by the exposure to the a gracile amu dh 1 extract an intermediate suppression by 3 8 fold by exposure to the r raciborskii sag 1 97 extract and the strongest decrease by 9 18 fold caused by

purified cyanotoxins or to a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 extracts were considerably larger d2 814 1279 fig 8 of all the studied exposure groups those exposed to mc lr and cyn were located most closely together in the plane of the two main roots fig 8 4 discussion in our study the model aquatic vertebrate the zebrafish d rerio showed significant toxic responses to extracts of common central european strains of a gracile and r raciborskii table 2 the studied extracts did not contain cyn mcs wejnerowski et al 2020 ana a stxs or bmaa although the presence of anabaenopeptins was confirmed in all cases this is the first time that the production of these cyclic peptides has been demonstrated for a gracile and r raciborskii however previous research has shown that these compounds for which over 115 isoforms have been reported are found in the genera anabaena aphanizomenon lyngbya microcystis nodularia nostoc oscillatoria planktothrix and schizothrix saha et al 2020 lima et al 2017 it is worth noting that the toxic effects of the extracts in d rerio cannot be directly attributed to the anabaenopeptins as the extracts are a rich chemical matrix nevertheless the present study highlights that the production of anabaenopeptins should be taken into account during risk assessments of a gracile and r raciborskii occurring in central europe it is known that they act as inhibitors of serine proteases and protein phosphatases and via these pathways can potentially disrupt various metabolic processes spoof et al 2016 one should note that although most of anabaenopeptins have been labelled as nontoxic at environmentally relevant concentrations it is unknown whether their toxicity can be modified when they occur in mixtures with other cyanobacterial compounds lenz et al 2019 miller et al 2017 as shown in the present work and discussed in subsequent sections cyanobacterial extracts containing anabaenopeptins can induce a wide array of toxic effects in fish the multivariate analyses indicated that the extracts of a gracile amu dh 1 were the least toxic i e most similar to the control unexposed group of the three studied cyanobacterial strains whereas the extracts of a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 showed higher toxicity the studied biomarkers indicated some similarities and many differences in the toxic response patterns between the purified toxins and the cyanobacterial extracts as well as among the extracts from the different cyanobacterial strains generally purified mc lr and cyn showed overlapping multi biomarker profiles indicating similar toxic mechanisms in zebrafish that involve oxidative stress induction of apoptosis and dna damage sensing pathways downregulation of xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms interference with the cell signaling via stress kinases and serine threonine protein phosphatases and negative impacts on the cytoskeleton some of these toxic mechanisms including oxidative stress neurotoxicity as well as suppression of xenobiotic detoxification pathways and tubulin expression were shared between the purified cyanotoxins and the studied cyanobacterial extracts other toxicity biomarkers including those related to apoptosis cellular stress signaling lipid metabolism and hepatotoxicity showed considerable strain to strain variation as well as differences between the cyanobacterial extracts and purified cyn and mc lr this variability in the toxic mechanisms might reflect the chemical complexity of the crude cyanobacterial extracts used in this study that likely contain multiple bioactive compounds our present findings demonstrate the utility of the multi biomarker toxicity assessments for determining toxicity of the native cyanobacterial strains when the chemical nature of the toxic compound s remains elusive 4 1 oxidative stress induced by cyanotoxins and nostocales extracts oxidative stress indicated by the accumulation of the oxidative lesions and shifts in the levels of antioxidants appeared a common response of d rerio to the cyanobacterial strain extracts as well as purified cyn and mc lr table 2 generally the oxidative stress signature was stronger in the fish exposed to the purified toxins than in those exposed to the crude cyanobacterial extracts furthermore the degree of oxidative stress varied among the fish exposed to different cyanobacterial extracts a considerable increase in the oxidative lesions to proteins and lipids in d rerio exposed to 20 µg l 1 of mc lr or cyn indicated a misbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species ros and activity of antioxidants that went hand in hand with the suppression of the activity of two key antioxidant enzymes gst and catalase in these fish accumulation of the oxidative lesions in the proteins was also found in the fish exposed to all three studied cyanobacterial extracts while an increase in tbars levels was found in the fish exposed to a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 extracts notably in the fish exposed to the least toxic of the three studied cyanobacterial strains a gracile amu dh 1 upregulation of two important antioxidant enzymes gst and catalase was observed probably as a mechanism to protect against excessive ros production this mechanism was at least partially successful as shown by the lower levels of oxidative lesions in the livers of the fish exposed to a gracile amu dh 1 compared with those exposed to a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 or to purified mc lr or cyn an increase in the reduced glutathione pool was observed in all experimental treatments in this study glutathione is an important cellular ros scavenger in fish grim et al 2013 hermes lima and zenteno savín 2002 and upregulation of the glutathione pool might be a protective mechanism against excess ros however this mechanism was insufficient to prevent the accumulation of oxidative lesions in the liver of d rerio exposed to the cyanobacterial extracts or purified mc lr or cyn transcript levels of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 nrf2 a key regulator of the cellular antioxidant protection were suppressed in the liver of the fish exposed to the bioactive compounds from all three studied cyanobacterial strains as well as to the purified cyanotoxins nrf2 is an evolutionarily conserved leucine zipper transcription factor that controls the expression of an array of antioxidant response element are dependent genes to counterbalance an increase in the ros production induced by toxins ma 2013 in vertebrates including zebrafish nrf2 transcriptionally regulates expression of detoxification and antioxidant enzymes including cyp1a ephx1 and gst as well as non enzymatic antioxidants thioredoxins and sulfiredoxins but not glutathione ma 2013 sant et al 2017 suppression of nrf2 expression in the fish exposed to the bioactive cyanobacterial compounds may interfere with the redox signaling and consequently suppress the antioxidant activity in the cell leading to a misbalance between ros generation and removal this misbalance might explain the suppression of catalase and gst activities and the accumulation of oxidative lesions in the fish exposed to cyanotoxins and the extracts of the two more toxic strains a gracile sag 31 79 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 however exposure to the extract of the least toxic strain a gracile amu dh 1 did not result in suppression of transcription of antioxidant gst and cat or detoxification cyp1a enzymes despite a decrease in the nrf2 transcript levels these data indicate that other signaling mechanisms are in place to compensate for the suppressed nrf2 expression and maintain a strong antioxidant response in the a gracile amu dh 1 exposed fish 4 2 hepato and neurotoxicity of cyanotoxins and nostocales extracts liver injury is considered a hallmark of mcs and cyn toxicity in vertebrates bláha et al 2009 and our present study corroborates these findings by showing an increase in the levels of a biochemical marker of liver damage the serum ldh activity in the fish exposed to mc lr or cyn unlike purified cyn and mc lr hepatotoxicity of the cyanobacterial strain extracts showed considerable strain to strain variation table 2 measurements of the serum ldh activity indicated that the bioactive compounds from the a gracile sag 31 79 and a gracile amu dh 1 are much less hepatotoxic than purified mc lr and cyn in contrast fish exposed to the r raciborskii sag 1 97 showed signs of acute hepatotoxicity that were stronger than in the case of mc lr and cyn our results are in line with previous findings emphasizing the prominent hepatotoxicity of r raciborskii extracts against primary rat hepatocytes and human hepatoblastoma hep g2 fastner et al 2003 like the strains used in our present study neither of the seven strains isolated from melangsee germany used in the research on hep g2 cells contained cyn or mc fastner et al 2003 all cyanobacterial extracts caused a significant decrease of acetylcholinesterase ache activity in the brain of d rerio indicating neurotoxicity a similar decrease was caused by cyn exposure whereas exposure to mc lr led to elevated ache activity these findings agree with the earlier reports of ache inhibition by cyn hinojosa et al 2019 but not mc lrs kist et al 2012 wu et al 2016 in the rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss exposure to the crude extract and or to the culture of an mc lr producing strain of microcystis aeruginosa inhibited ache activity gélinas et al 2012 qian et al 2018 however in the latter studies it remains unclear whether the ache inhibition is due to mc lr or some other bioactive compounds present in the cultures or the crude cell extracts our present study shows that ache suppression can be elicited by the extracts of cyanobacteria not producing mc lr or cyn the mechanisms of ache suppression by bioactive metabolites of the studied cyanobacterial extracts are currently not known and require further investigation possible mechanisms might involve chemical modification of the enzyme via hyperphosphorylation of the serine residues in the active site colović et al 2013 e g due to transcriptional downregulation of protein phosphatases such as found in the fish exposed to the a gracile and r raciborskii extracts in our present study and or disruption of the lipid protein interactions of the membrane bound ache due to lipid peroxidation tsukamoto et al 1998 regardless of the exact molecular mechanisms suppression of ache activity in fish exposed to the a gracile and r raciborskii extracts can cause failure of the synaptic transmission and negatively affect the physiology and behavior of the fish furthermore inhibition of ache in fish might serve as a robust albeit non specific biomarker of cyanobacterial toxicity as it is elicited by multiple cyanobacterial strains including a gracile r raciborskii this study and m aeruginosa gélinas et al 2012 qian et al 2018 4 3 xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification exposure to the two studied a gracile extracts as well as the purified mc lr and cyn led to transcriptional suppression of a marker enzyme in the xenobiotic biotransformation pathway encoding cytochrome p450 cyp450 monooxygenase cyp1a a similar albeit statistically non significant trend was found in the fish exposed to r raciborskii sag 1 97 extract cyp1a is a key enzyme involved in phase i biotransformation of xenobiotics sarasquete and segner 2000 and transcriptionally induced through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr binding to xenobiotics such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons pah polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and other planar organic compounds mescher and haarmann stemmann 2018 a lack of cyp1a induction indicates that the bioactive compounds in the three studied cyanobacterial strains as well as mc lr or cyn do not act as ahr ligands and inducers of cyp450 enzymes this is consistent with the notion that cyanotoxins such as mc lr and cyn do not undergo phase i metabolism in vertebrates but are detoxified through glutathione dependent pathways kittler et al 2016 schmidt et al 2014 earlier studies in the larval zebrafish and murine models also showed transcriptional suppression of cyp1a in response to mc lr exposures rogers et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 furthermore the treatment of mice with mc lr lr led to a decrease in the levels of cytochrome p450 and an increase in the inactivated form of cyp450 cyp420 brooks and codd 1987 taken together these findings indicate that exposure to a broad range of bioactive cyanobacterial compounds can suppress the function of cyp450 monooxygenase in vertebrates including fish and mammals and thus act as chemosensitizers potentiating the toxicity of drugs or organic pollutants metabolized by the cyp450 system expression of another cyp450 enzyme the retinoic acid hydroxylase cyp26b1 in the liver of d rerio was suppressed by exposure to all the studied cyanobacterial extracts as well as to purified mc lr and cyn cyp26b1 plays a key role in the metabolism of vitamin a regulating the tissue levels of retinoic acid ra the active metabolite of vitamin a and a critical signaling molecule in vertebrates nelson et al 2013 retinoid acid is involved in the regulation of cell homeostasis growth reproduction skeletal development and vision of vertebrates including fish laue et al 2008 lie et al 2019 our study shows a strong inhibition of cyp26b1transcripts by cyanobacterial active compounds and indicates that interference with the retinoid signaling might be an important toxic mechanism of cyanobacterial toxins transcript levels of epoxide hydrolase 1 ephx1 were not affected by exposures to the cyanobacterial strain extracts or the purified model cyanotoxins in the liver of d rerio ephx1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of toxic epoxides to less reactive and more water soluble dihydrodiol compounds argiriadi et al 1999 it is involved in the biotransformation of various xenobiotics including carcinogenic compounds such as benzene or styrene decker et al 2009 václavíková et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge no study has directly investigated the role of ephx1 in detoxification of cyanobacterial toxins our present study indicates that this enzyme is not responsive to cyn mc lr and the studied european strains of a gracile and r raciborskii and is not suitable as a biomarker for cyanobacterial toxicity 4 4 dna damage repair and apoptosis the marker genes in the dna damage sensing and repair pathways did not show a coherent response to the studied cyanotoxins or cyanobacterial extracts in d rerio the only consistent change observed in all experimental exposures was a significant upregulation of gadd45 mrna in the liver of d rerio table 2 gadd45 are highly conserved proteins implicated in sensing transducing and mediating cellular stress response particularly genotoxic stress liebermann and hoffmann 2008 gadd45 proteins play a key role in dna excision repair through interactions with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna and control the balance between cell survival and death acting as positive modulators of apoptosis during stress exposures in multiple cell types liebermann and hoffmann 2008 our finding of gadd45 upregulation in the liver cells of d rerio exposed to the cyanobacterial extracts and purified cyanotoxins indicates pro apoptotic action of these compounds this notion is supported by the induction of the apoptotic pathways in the liver of d rerio exposed to the purified cyanotoxins and to the studied a gracile and r raciborskii extracts shown by the elevated expression of the executor caspases 3a and in the case of the purified toxins 3b and suppression of the anti apoptotic regulator bcl 2 similarly the expression of jun mrna encoding an anti apoptotic regulator c jun wisdom et al 1999 was suppressed in the fish exposed to the purified cyanotoxins and to the most toxic of the three studied cyanobacterial strains a gracile sag 31 79 interestingly mrna expression of an apoptotic activator bax decreased in the liver of the fish exposed to the purified cyanotoxins and to the a gracile sag 31 79 extract this decrease went hand in hand with the transcriptional downregulation of the tumor suppression protein p53 a key positive modulator of bax expression in animals indicating a possible compensatory mechanism to prevent excessive apoptosis this compensatory mechanism appears to be sufficient to suppress the upregulation of the executor caspases 3a and 3b in the fish exposed to the a gracile sag 31 79 extract but not in those exposed to purified mc lr and cyn transcripts of two proteins playing important roles in dna damage repair xpc and rad51 were strongly downregulated by 2 5 fold and 3 5 fold in the liver of d rerio exposed to cyn but not to mc lr these results are consistent with the earlier findings in human cell lines and murine models that show higher genotoxicity of cyn compared with mc lr hercog et al 2017 díez quijada et al 2020 exposure of d rerio to the a gracile and r raciborskii extracts generally did not affect the mrna expression levels of xpc and rad51 except for a 2 1 fold decrease in rad51 in the a gracile amu dh 1 exposed fish indicating that the bioactive compounds from these strains are not genotoxic 4 5 cell signaling cyanobacterial mcs are potent and specific inhibitors of eukaryotic phosphoprotein phosphatases pp2a and pp1 that play critical regulatory roles in multiple cellular signaling cascades mackintosh et al 1990 the inhibitory effect is due to the direct binding of mc lr to pp2a and pp1 and results in excessive phosphorylation of structural filaments leading to the degradation of the cytoskeleton pearson et al 2010 unlike mc lr cyn does not act as a pp2a and pp1 inhibitor chong et al 2002 pearson et al 2010 in our present study we did not measure the activity of phosphoprotein phosphatases in d rerio liver however our results show that the two studied cyanotoxins as well as the crude cyanobacterial extracts can impair the phosphoprotein metabolism at the transcriptional level by strongly suppressing the mrna levels of ppp6c encoding the catalytic subunit of a phosphoprotein phosphatase 6 pp6 involved in cell cycle regulation dna damage repair inflammation and immunity ohama 2019 ziembik et al 2017 furthermore exposure to purified mc lr and cyn as well as to the crude r raciborskii sag 1 97 extract downregulated the mrna expression of another important protein phosphatase protein phosphatase 1h ppm1h in the zebrafish liver the ppm1h is a gatekeeper phosphatase involved in regulation of cell proliferation differentiation migration and apoptosis in vertebartes shen et al 2014 a decrease in the transcript levels of ppp6c and ppm1h can have a negative impact on the amount and therefore the activity of these important signaling enzymes with pleiotropic downstream effects on multiple cellular functions interestingly while the ppp6c expression was suppressed in all experimental exposures transcriptional downregulation of ppm1h was not observed in the fish exposed to the a gracile amu dh 1 and sag 31 79 extracts altogether these data indicate that the cyanobacterial toxins including mc lr cyn and unidentified biologically active compounds from european r raciborskii might have broad adverse effects on the phosphorylation dependent cellular signaling through transcriptional mechanisms beyond the direct inhibitory effects on the enzymatic activity of phosphoprotein phosphatases a stress responsive ser thr protein kinase mk2 was also transcriptionally downregulated in the liver of d rerio exposed to purified mc lr and cyn or to the extract of a gracile sag 31 79 mk2 plays a crucial role in p38 map kinase dependent cellular stress signaling regulating cytokine production inflammation and actin remodeling kotlyarov and gaestel 2002 a decrease in mk2 expression and by inference activity might result in destabilization of the cytoskeleton and an impaired immune response hitti et al 2006 kotlyarov and gaestel 2002 generally little is known about the effects of cyanotoxins and bioactive metabolites of cyanobacteria on the mapk pathway and to the best of our knowledge these effects have not yet been explored in fish in mammals the responses of the mapk pathway appear to vary among the experimental models and the type of cyanotoxins thus mc lr exposure activated p38 and erk1 2 kinases in the mapk pathway and altered the cytoskeleton in a549 human non small lung cancer cells and mice alveolar type ii epithelial cells wang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 in contrast in human bronchial epithelial cells exposure to mc lr 20 µm initially downregulated activity of the mitogen activated protein kinases erk1 2 and p38 after 2 8 h with a subsequent return to the baseline activity levels after 48 h of exposure brózman et al 2020 overall our present data indicate that the purified cyanotoxins as well as the bioactive compounds from the three studied a gracile and r raciborskii strains can interfere with cellular signaling and negatively affect cytoskeleton stability and function in exposed fish through modifying mapks expression levels the latter notion is supported by our findings of strongly suppressed tubulin mrna expression in all experimental treatments and a decrease in the actin mrna levels in the livers of fish exposed to mc lr or r raciborskii sag 1 97 extract 4 6 lipid metabolism analysis of the transcript levels of the lipid metabolism biomarkers fabp1b pparab and pla2g indicate that the bioactive compounds of a gracile and r raciborskii as well as mc lr and cyn affect lipid metabolism however changes in the lipid biomarker profile revealed stark differences between the two studied cyanotoxins as well as the different strain extracts thus mrna expression levels of a fatty acid binding protein fabp1b and phospholipase a2g were strongly upregulated in the livers of fish exposed to cyn and the a gracile amu dh 1 extract phospholipases a2 including pla2g catalyze the hydrolysis of the ester bond at the sn 2 position of phospholipid substrates releasing free fatty acids such as arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids burke and dennis 2009 dennis et al 2011 elevated expression of pla2g might lead to the accumulation of toxic levels of free fatty acids in the cell concomitant upregulation of the mrna expression of the fatty acid binding protein fabp1 found in all experimental exposures except the a gracile amu dh 1 exposure may therefore assist in fatty acids sequestration thereby protecting the cells against the potentially harmful effects of excess free fatty acids sharma et al 2006 peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α pparab mrna expression was suppressed in the fish exposed to mc lr or to the a gracile sag 31 79 extracts pparα is a master regulator of fatty acid oxidation in vertebrate tissues controlling the expression of numerous genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways in the liver bougarne et al 2018 activation of pparα promotes catabolism of fatty acids so downregulation of pparα in the livers of mc lr and a gracile sag 31 79 exposed fish might decrease the β oxidation of fatty acids and increase the free fatty acid content of the cells contributing to the toxicity of these cyanobacterial compounds the lack of suppression of pparα mrna in the fish exposed to the a gracile amu dh 1 and r raciborskii sag 1 97 extracts is consistent with the lower toxicity of these strains compared to a gracile sag 31 79 further studies are needed to determine whether these shifts in the transcriptional profiles of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism translate to the respective changes in the free fatty acid content of the cells in the fish exposed to different cyanobacterial toxins and bioactive compounds 5 conclusions our study using the experimental zebrafish model and a battery of biochemical and molecular markers showed that three strains of a gracile and r raciborskii from different localities in central europe exhibit signs of toxicity at the cellular and organ levels the presence of cyn mcs ana a bmaa and stxs in these extracts was excluded but the results show that a gracile and r raciborskii are capable of producing anabaenopeptins the present study demonstrates the multifaceted toxic effects that can be induced by cyn mc lr as well as the bioactive compounds in the extracts of the selected strains of cyanobacteria that involve oxidative stress hepato neuro and genotoxicity interference with the cellular signaling and reversible phosphorylation pathways alterations of lipid metabolism and induction of apoptosis the specific toxicity mechanisms of different strains assessed by the biomarker profiles were different from each other and from the two common cyanobacterial toxins mc lr and cyn furthermore the two strains of the same species a gracile revealed different toxicity profiles this shows that the central european strains of common cyanobacterial species a gracile and r raciborskii produce potentially toxic bioactive compounds so that no a priori assumption of a lack of toxicity can be made based on the lack of the production of known cyanotoxins by these and similar strains it is important to stress that our present study does not relate the observed effects to any particular compound but to a mixture present in the crude cyanobacterial extracts this approach does not allow us to mechanistically link the observed toxicity with a specific compound s yet it more closely mimics the potential toxicity caused by the termination of blooms of the studied cyanobacteria species thus the assessment of toxicity and associated risks of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters cannot be based on the analytical screening of established toxins or amplification of the marker genes of their biosynthesis alone but should involve multibiomarker based toxicity assessment in experimental in vitro and in vivo models credit
