a 300 m long bottom set gillnet with an equivalent drag net model are extensively performed various wave conditions as well as numerous damaged scenarios are considered in the numerical simulations and extensive data are collected for the training and testing of the ann based machine learning scheme in training representative sea states net assembly accelerations and location buoy displacements

designed by using the digital twins technology with the applied ann model and machine learning scheme for the detection of damages and malfunctions keywords digital twins artificial neural network ann machine learning gillnet damage detection real time monitoring 1 introduction marine environmental pollution by many marine activities has been regarded as a serious matter in particular lost and abandoned fishing gears i e ghost gears cause serious problems worldwide these gears remain undecomposed resulting in ghost fishing which seriously destroys the marine ecosystem also they cause a potential threat to the safety of divers as well as hinder ship and submarine operation kim et al 2014 matsuoka et al 2005 in korea 20 of fishing gears are lost or abandoned and only approximately 15 of them are recollected lee and an 2007 besides the gillnet occupies the largest portion of ghost gears among all fishing gears an et al 2001 kim et al 2010a in this regard the research for the automatic monitoring of gillnet is needed the automatic monitoring system with sensors can be employed to prevent and recollect ghost gears in general the monitoring system requires tools not only to collect deliver and store the data but also to analyze the data and build a decision making algorithm gps and accelerometers are often used for big data acquisition in the ocean with high accuracy also recent significant advancements in mobile devices and data storage technologies such as the cloud based service make delivering and storing big data possible while people interpret the data and make their decision previously ai artificial intelligence such as machine learning and computer vision application can improve the accuracy of monitoring systems and save analysis time significantly bradley et al 2019 besides the improved performance of computers also increases the potential of machine generated big data from computer simulations therefore the ai based real time monitoring system can be feasible through these recent developments which was our motivation in this research the first step for the design of the gillnet monitoring system is to understand the underwater dynamics of the system to analyze the relevant data while data acquisition from real measurements can be most reliable it takes a lot of time and efforts to collect a meaningful amount of data instead numerical simulation tools can be a time and cost effective solution to get meaningful global performance data for different types of fishing cages and gears in the target environmental conditions when investigating the dynamic behaviors of fishing cages and gears using numerical simulations morison and screen force models were the two most popular approaches to estimate hydrodynamic force on the net kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 chen and christensen 2018 in particular the well designed morison force model is a validated tool against scaled experiments regarding fishing cages and nets in currents and ocean waves lee et al 2008 zhao et al 2009 2013 cifuentes and kim 2017a jin et al 2018 also the morison force model has been successfully utilized to better understand the dynamic behaviors of different cages and nets chen and christensen 2018 huang et al 2018 jin et al 2019 xu et al 2013 the validated numerical simulation tools can then be repeatedly used for numerous failure malfunction scenarios to build up a big database for the given net system and sea environments monitoring algorithm development is an ensuing step after the data acquisition is completed while people can develop a man made deterministic algorithm based on a large number of accumulated data it may be extremely cumbersome and cause errors in the processing and decision making the possible alternative is using the machine learning algorithm in the ocean engineering industry several machine learning based solutions have been suggested guarize et al guarize et al 2007 christiansen et al christiansen et al 2015 and sidarta et al sidarta et al 2017 predicted the mooring and or riser tensions from the responses of floating structures using artificial neural network ann chaves et al chaves et al 2015 utilized ann to estimate the tension and fatigue life of underwater flexible pipes sidarta et al sidarta et al 2018 detected the damage of mooring lines from floater responses using ann ship motions were estimated from wave elevations using the long short term memory deep learning by duan et al duan et al 2019 in this study we developed an automatic monitoring system for a bottom set gillnet using an ann based machine learning scheme with simulation generated data in various environmental conditions the purpose of this study is to detect the initial failure of the bottom set gillnet so that fishermen can collect the net before progressive failures happen first extensive sensor signals for numerous failure and non failure scenarios were collected using time domain numerical simulations for representative environmental conditions on the southwest coast of korea the morison force model was utilized for the computations of hydrodynamic forces on the entire net system the equivalent drag net model was designed for time efficient simulations later a high performance ann algorithm was developed for the present purpose and used with the extensively generated numerical sensor data lastly the testing of the ann algorithm was completed by using different environmental conditions that were not used for training authors previously validated the morison force and equivalent drag net models against various experimental results for fishing cages and net systems cifuentes and kim 2017a 2017b jin et al 2018 several studies were also done by other researchers regarding the dynamic behaviors of the gillnet by experiments stewart 1988 savina et al 2017 and numerical simulations takagi et al 2007 wan et al 2004 these studies were focused on a section of the gillnet in practice the net length can be up to several kilometers which needs more computational time and effort in big data collection an example of the dynamic simulation of a bottom set gillnet and the corresponding deterministic monitoring with similar sensor combinations was given in the authors previous paper jin et al 2019 in this study the ann algorithm based automatic monitoring technology with fewer sensors was further developed with the validated numerical simulation tool 2 method fig 1 demonstrates the process of damage detection of the bottom set gillnet using ann first sensor signals from the system are needed and thus the numerical simulation was carried out to obtain the numerical sensor signals second the ann algorithm was built and utilized for the monitoring system with reliable failure detection performance and training was conducted by using the developed tools third testing was conducted to validate the developed failure detection algorithm with several cases that were not used for training in this section we explain the procedures of the developed monitoring system in detail 2 1 configuration of bottom set gillnet fig 2 shows the design of the bottom set gillnet used in this study material properties and design parameters are presented in table 1 the proposed net system is one of the actual designs used in korea an and huh 2003 kim et al 2010b the bottom set gillnet was composed of the net assembly mooring lines with a 50 m interval 3 location buoys at two end and central locations and ropes to connect the net assembly to buoys the length and height of the net assembly were 300 m and 2 m respectively the hanging ratio of the net i e the actual gillnet length divided by the fully stretched length was set as 0 5 which is a widely used value to the gillnet gray et al 2005 wood bars were installed with a 50 m interval in the net assembly to increase stretching performance water depth was fixed to be 25 m 2 2 time domain simulations we developed the time domain numerical model and conducted extensive numerical simulations using orcaflex a well known commercial program however a sophisticated build up of the numerical model by using proper elements was essential to correctly simulate the dynamics of the entire net system fig 3 shows the side front and top views of the numerical model 3 degree of freedom dof buoy and line models were used to build the entire system while the net assembly ropes mooring lines were all modeled by the line model the 3 dof buoy model was used to connect several lines and to model location buoys the line model was based on the lumped mass method the morison force model estimated the hydrodynamic force on the entire system the added mass coefficient was fixed to be 1 0 for all lines faltinsen 1993 the drag coefficient of the net assembly was based on reynold number dependency formulations suggested by decew et al decew et al 2010 the drag coefficient of mooring lines and ropes was set to be 1 2 veritas 2010 an equivalent drag net model is necessary since it is infeasible to model all the net twines considering that the net is a very slender object the keulegan carpenter kc number is large under given environmental conditions in this condition the inertia force term in the morison equation can be neglected then matching the drag force between the physical net and the numerical net is a key issue in this regard the projected area and wet weight were matched between physical and numerical nets during the process to match the projected area the net assembly becomes heavier and stiffer than the physical net while the modified young s modulus can compensate for the stiffer net the heavier net was balanced by changing the weight and buoyancy of 3 dof buoys used for the connection of the line elements the total numbers of lines and 3 dof buoys to create the entire net model were 568 and 308 respectively detailed formulations and descriptions can be found in references jin et al 2018 2019 since our simulation program is done in the time domain the line broken case at a given time can be straightforwardly implemented 2 3 artificial neural network the ann is similar to that of a biological neural network consisting of several interconnected neurons in many fields this ann model is used for representation pattern recognition and classification of complex nonlinear systems that are difficult to formulate fig 4 shows an example of the multi layered ann model it has a multi layered neural network with two hidden layers the model consists of an input layer two hidden layers and an output layer the neurons are also referred to as nodes the basic unit of computation in the ann is the neuron fig 5 shows the process to acquire output from the input for the single neuron it receives inputs from other nodes and computes an output each input has an associated weight w assigned according to its relative importance to other inputs the node applies a function ƒ to the weighted sum of its inputs not all input signals are sent to the next layer a kind of threshold called an activation function is used to suppress weak signals the s shaped sigmoid function is mainly used as the activation function thus if the summed signal value is not large enough the sigmoid function suppresses the output signal on the other hand if the summation of inputs is large enough the sigmoid function sends a signal to the next layer rashid 2016 in this way the input signal propagates through the hidden layer and reaches the output layer producing the output signal of the ann model 2 4 training of artificial neural network model the goal of developing the ann model is to discover an unknown relationship between a given input signal and an output signal from big data in other words the weights and biases associated with each neuron are properly assigned to ensure that a given data set is well implemented the acquired information is stored in the weights of the connections between neurons the development of an ann model is often referred to as training the first step in developing an ann model is the model representation in other words it is a process to define input and output variables in the given model then we select the data to be used for training good learning requires a large amount of data with fewer errors next the numbers of layers and neurons included in each layer are to be determined and we choose one of many kinds of learning algorithms the learning time takes longer as the number of data layers and neurons increases finally after the training is completed the ann can verify performance with different data from the training data sidarta et al 2018 practically it is very difficult to determine a good network topology with just the number of inputs and outputs it decisively depends on not only the number of training examples but also the complexity of the classification we are trying to learn karsoliya 2012 traditionally the identification of network topologies has been based on trial and error or heuristics followed by trial and error none of these methodologies have the theoretical rigor to give the optimal or at least near optimal solutions thus many researchers proposed methods for estimating the number of neurons and hidden layer requirements but there has been no cure all solution karsoliya 2012 stathakis 2009 liu and lv 2020 also mentioned that the number of nodes can be determined using an empirical formula or the method of multiple trials and errors in this study the number of inputs and outputs was large so the number of hidden layers was set to two for the number of neurons trial and error were used to compare prediction performance in each case this is covered in detail in section 5 training data used for learning should consist of input target pairs when learning of the ann model starts the input signal puts into the initial network besides the output calculated from the network is compared with the target to find the error between them this output error is then used to modify the connected weights backward in the network according to the determined learning rules this training method is called backpropagation hertz 2018 haykin 1994 this process is repeated until the model successfully finds the relationship between the presented input and output there are many ways to update connected weights and biases hertz 2018 haykin 1994 the scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation method was used in this study this method updates weight and bias values according to the scaled conjugate gradient method the algorithm is based on conjugate directions proposed by møller 1993 all process stages were implemented on 32 0 gb 3 40 ghz pc with the 64 bit operating system equipped with matlab r2018a since the various locations of gillnet failures should be classified the pattern recognition network was applied as the ann model the pattern recognition network is the feedforward network that can be trained to classify inputs according to targets patternnet 2019 3 data for training and testing training data on the comprehensive ann model for the detection of the net dynamics signals should cover the environmental conditions in the target area and the conditions of the net assembly i e intact or damaged locations this requirement is necessary to train the ann model to detect and identify damaged locations on the net assembly for the specified environmental and net conditions also determining the proper inputs can lead to a big difference in detecting failures table 2 presents the sea states used for training marked as tr and testing marked as te of the ann model we considered waves and currents as environmental conditions we analyzed the measured wave current data on the southwest coast of korea and proper environmental conditions were selected jin et al 2018 i e significant wave heights hs in the range of 6 8 m and peak periods tp of 1 3 s the pierson moskowitz spectrum which can be used for fully developed seas was selected to generate wave time histories as given in table 2 the training data consists of nine sea states with three significant wave heights and three peak periods the test data consists of two sea states which are different from those used in the training data surface current velocity was fixed to be 0 6 m s while seabed current velocity was 0 06 m s the 1 7 power law was used for the current profile in the vertical direction the directions of current and wave were assumed to be collinear in the numerical simulations fig 6 shows 23 indicators according to the damaged locations this study includes 23 conditions of the net i e an intact and 22 damaged conditions the damaged conditions are defined as the failures of mooring lines or a rope otherwise it is in intact condition for example indicator 1 corresponds to the breakage of the location buoy rope indicator 2 is when the top mooring at y 150 m is broken and indicator 4 is when both top and bottom moorings at y 150 m are broken the ann training uses outputs of 1 and 0 to indicate damaged and intact nets respectively it should be recalled that the validation of a trained ann model is to test the model s capability to associate input and output that are not part of the training cases but are still within the boundaries of the parameters used for training sidarta et al 2018 the total number of simulations for training was 198 for 9 sea states and 22 failure scenarios the total number of simulations for testing was 22 for 22 failure scenarios in 2 sea states i e 12 failure scenarios for hs of 1 5 m and 10 failure scenarios for hs of 2 5 m therefore a total of 220 simulations were performed for training and testing the simulation time for a specific case was about 30 min with a time step of 0 2 s damage occurs at 10 min and only post damage simulations are needed for the damaged cases therefore the total simulation time for 23 cases of a given sea state was 39 604 s 198 022 steps a total of 17 inputs were selected which were hs tp x y z accelerations at four locations and x y z displacements of the location buoy center to be specific moving standard deviations of accelerations were calculated and given as inputs they are the standard deviation within the moving window we can recursively compute it from fresh every time the window is advanced in time probably the best input may be the mooring rope tensions however tension sensors are generally less durable and reliable on the other hand when the ann model is deployed all of the selected inputs can easily be obtained by using the location buoy s gps with wave estimation system and acceleration sensors attached to the net authors developed a real time inverse estimation of hs and tp from buoy motion sensors kim et al 2019 which can directly be applied to the present ann scheme fig 7 shows the positions of the numerical accelerometers this paper does not discuss how to physically collect the real time sensor signals through acoustic devices etc since it is not directly related to the present content 4 convergence test convergence test with respect to the numbers of lines and 3 dof buoys was conducted to validate our equivalent drag net model for that two numerical models model a cruder and b denser were established cruder model a consists of 568 lines and 308 3 dof buoys while the numbers of lines and 3 dof buoys for denser model b are approximately three times larger than those of model a lateral displacements of the net assembly and mooring tensions were compared between the two models in steady currents which are presented in fig 8 the lateral displacements at current velocity 0 6 m s show that the convergence is excellent and even the cruder model a can produce reliable results in addition the tension comparisons at various current velocities further demonstrate that model a can be utilized for the data acquisition of machine learning the denser model b took ten times more computational time than model a the maximum difference is 3 2 percent for the top mooring line at a current velocity of 0 4 m s the numerical models also compared well with various experiments proving that the proposed equivalent drag net model is reliable cifuentes and kim 2017a when generating the big data set for training model a was used 5 results and discussions if the net is set over a large sea area like gillnet it is important to identify the damaged location first for local repair authors by using the traditionally programmed algorithm previously developed a methodology to approximately detect the damaged locations of the bottom set gillnet from the pattern changes in acceleration tension and buoy displacement sensor signals jin et al 2019 on the other hand this study attempts to detect damage positions more accurately from the trained ann model by using acceleration sensors on the net and gps sensor on the buoy the ann model can be trained for selected wave conditions to recognize patterns of changes in sensor signals so that the prediction model can identify damaged locations the trained ann model can then be further applied to more general wave conditions to do the same mission as mentioned before there are 17 input variables in the present ann model which include hs tp x y z displacements of the buoy and twelve moving standard deviations of the acceleration four locations multiplied by three directions i e x y z directions figs 9 and 10 show the time histories of the accelerations of the net assembly at the top and bottom of the middle location y 0 m where accelerometers are positioned the failure of mooring lines occurs at 600 s 3000 steps as mooring lines at y 0 m are broken the magnitude and trend of x acceleration signals are sharply changed as shown in fig 9 similarly mooring line breakages at y 50 m lead to y acceleration variations as shown in fig 10 each damage case results in unique magnitudes and trends of all acceleration signals such that failure locations can be detected through the machine learning algorithm fig 11 shows x displacements of the central location buoy under different failure scenarios as the rope or mooring lines at the middle location are broken the location buoy s displacements can help to detect the respective failure with their unique signal trends in particular the rope breakage results in a continuous drift along the x direction since it freely floats on the water without any restriction which makes the machine learning algorithm detect the rope s failure better fig 12 shows an example of input signals for hs 1 m and tp 6 s where the failure of top mooring line at y 150 m occurs at 600 s 3000 steps initially the acceleration signal itself was used but the classification performance was not good therefore instead of the raw acceleration signal the moving standard deviations of accelerations as a statistical feature were used in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the test cases fig 13 shows the receiver operating characteristic roc curves using the raw accelerations left and using the moving standard deviations of accelerations right the signal detection theory was first developed during world war ii the radar operator had to determine whether it was an enemy or friendly ship from the detected signal the term roc was used to quantify the radar operator s capability to distinguish signals calì and longobardi 2015 the roc curve measures classification performance in two dimensional space and it is often applied to biomedical research for measuring the performance of diagnostic tests witten et al 1999 zhou and harezlak 2002 it is also used as a performance measure for machine learning algorithms bradley 1997 the roc curve is a plot of sensitivity vs 1 specificity or the true positive rate tpr vs the false positive rate fpr it plots 1 specificity on the x axis and sensitivity on the y axis for the probability prediction model for the binary dependent variable i e true or false the prediction can be either positive or negative for actually true for an actually false the prediction can also be either positive or negative the sensitivity in the roc curve means the ratio of correctly predicted as positive to actual true cases and the specificity is the ratio of correctly predicted as negative to the actual false cases for example suppose blood pressure is used as an indicator for diagnosing myocardial infarction then tpr is the rate at which a patient is diagnosed as a patient fpr 1 specificity on the other hand is the rate at which a non patient is diagnosed as a patient in general trying to increase tpr also increases fpr in other words if the standard of blood pressure is alleviated to increase tpr more non patients are also diagnosed as being patients therefore in order to assess the classification performance of the indicator used it is necessary to measure both tpr and frp of the data for each criterion by changing the indicator criteria blood pressure 80 120 the graph of this is the roc curve from the curve we can find the optimum criteria corresponding to the appropriate tpr and frp for the case when taking a test the higher the sensitivity and the specificity the better the test since the x axis is not specificity but 1 specificity if the roc curve passes through the upper left corner or if the area under the curve is large the performance of classification is satisfactory the area under the roc curve of the perfect test is 1 in fig 13 we can see the improved classification performance when using the moving standard deviations of accelerations instead of accelerations itself it means that in the process to choose the input variables proper statistical values can enhance the machine learning performance the training and testing of the ann model were performed using the extensive data generated under the sea states shown in table 2 for 23 conditions of the net figs 14 and 15 show the order and numbering of training for each sea state and test cases for 2 sea states respectively the development of the classification ann model can be updated using cross entropy calculated based on the following equation 1 in other words the cross entropy function is used to calculate the decreasing error in the training process lang and witbrock 1988 van ooyen and nienhuis 1992 1 c e p i t p i log y p i 2 f i 1 k p 1 c c e p i k c where c e is cross entropy t p i 0 or 1 is a target value for a case i at output unit p y p i is the output of the ann for a case i at output unit p k is the number of the case c is the number of output unit and f is the aggregate cross entropy performance in equation 2 f i e an average of the c e gives an overall indication of how close the output y from the ann model is to the target t for all training or test cases in one case the ann predicts a value between 0 and 1 for all 23 output nodes an output of 1 means a damaged net whereas that of 0 indicates an intact net the node number having the largest prediction value among the 23 nodes becomes the predicted damage indicator for example if the prediction value of 1 22nd output nodes is 0 5 and that of the 23rd node is 0 8 the predicted condition is 23 i e the intact condition fig 16 shows the cross entropy for each stage of the ann model with two hidden layers for training and testing cases the prediction performance of the ann model increases as the number of hidden neurons increases in general adding hidden neurons reduces the average of cross entropy the lower cross entropy of the training cases compared to the test cases indicates that the ann model provides a better prediction for the training cases than the test cases as expected this is because the test cases were not included in the training of the ann model the best ann model with the minimum cross entropy for the test case is the case with 180 hidden neurons in each layer after 60 hidden neurons the variation is not significant the development of the ann model was based on the ann with two hidden layers besides the training began with 10 neurons and ended with 300 neurons the best prediction accuracy in equation 3 of the trained ann model was 99 5 and 91 1 for the test cases respectively this is when there are 180 hidden neurons in each layer 3 prediction accuracy m n 100 where m is the number of matched cases and n is the total number of cases in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the test cases the median filter was further applied to the predicted damage indicator the median filter is a non linear digital filtering technique which is widely applied for the removal of noise from images or signals wikipedia median filter 2019 this filter replaces a point s value with the median in the window around that point it is effective for removing random or spike like noise in practical use a moving median filter can be applied to the predicted indicator from the trained ann model after the median filtering the prediction accuracy increased to 99 7 and 96 0 for training and test cases with the 180 hidden neurons in each layer respectively fig 17 compares the target and predicted damage indicators marked as blue diamond and red circle for the training cases only for three sea states of the ann model with 180 hidden neurons with the median filtering the trained ann model accepts input sensor data five times a second and provides a damage location indicator to the user at the same time interval in the graph the horizontal axis is the time steps for a series of failure scenarios in which the data transmission occurs each failure case corresponds to 1800 s 9000 steps portion of the horizontal axis including a 600 sec intact condition then the next failure case is given as a consecutive series on the same horizontal axis and so on the red circles on the blue diamond background mean correct prediction otherwise red circle alone they are false predictions although not clear in the figure due to numerous overlaps the number of red circles on blue background is greatly larger than off marked red circles figs 18 22 are similarly constructed for the test cases not covered in the training cases again the red circle is the predicted indicator that is sent out each time step the blue diamond is the real indicator if the blue diamond and the red circle coincide it means an accurate prediction figs 18 21 show the prediction of the ann model with 10 30 60 90 and 180 hidden neurons for the test cases without the median filtering as the number of neurons increases the classification performance of the ann model also improves fig 22 shows the prediction for the test cases with 180 neurons with the median filtering when compared with fig 21 the ann model with the median filter better predicts the target indicators at the same number of neurons specifically out of the 198 022 trial cases estimated from the ann every time step 190 089 matched the actual or target state which is an accuracy of 96 since many circles are overlapped on top of each other on blue backgrounds for the correctly predicted cases the correctly predicted number can hardly be counted from the figure it took about 18 h to train 180 hidden neurons on a pc with a 3 4 ghz processor and 32 gb of memory for the 1 782 198 steps 356 440 s this comes from a combination of 198 022 steps and nine sea states from these results the accuracy of damage detection is high enough 96 and the developed machine learning based monitoring system can successfully be applied to the real time monitoring of physical net systems besides in this study it is shown that the moving standard deviation the median filter the optimal number of neurons can improve the detecting performance significantly these factors demonstrate that the selection of appropriate data and learning algorithm is essential for enhanced detection performance if more simulation data is acquired for training from massive computations the detecting performance can also be improved 6 conclusions this paper presents the development of a digital twin model with an ann based machine learning scheme for detecting and classifying the position of a damaged net by recognizing changes in signals from 4 accelerometers on the net assembly this task can be considered as pattern recognition and classification problems and ann is appropriate for the task the input variables of the ann model were sea state hs tp accelerations on the net assembly and buoy location the real time monitoring is possible by using the sensed data the ann model was first trained for several sea states and multiple failure scenarios the trained ann model was then tested for the cases not included in the training to demonstrate its damage detection capability for more general sea states 220 numerical simulations were performed for training and testing when training the ann model the data should be comprehensive for good prediction that means it should cover a wide range of environmental and gillnet conditions also the data needs to be of high quality so that the developed ann algorithms can reliably be applied to the real system this study shows the development of a high performance ann model for real time net system monitoring by employing the optimal number of neurons proper median filter and moving standard deviation of accelerometer signals instead of acceleration raw data itself the ann model was well trained from the simulated signals for representative sea states and damage scenarios and proved to be excellent 96 success rate in predicting the test cases not included in the training the performance of the developed digital twin and machine learning models may further be enhanced by simultaneously using both time series and spectra of the sensor signals which is

21810,this paper presents a method for detecting damage of a bottom set gillnet based on sensor fusion and the artificial neural network ann model in this regard time domain numerical simulations for a 300 m long bottom set gillnet with an equivalent drag net model are extensively performed various wave conditions as well as numerous damaged scenarios are considered in the numerical simulations and extensive data are collected for the training and testing of the ann based machine learning scheme in training representative sea states net assembly accelerations and location buoy displacements

designed by using the digital twins technology with the applied ann model and machine learning scheme for the detection of damages and malfunctions keywords digital twins artificial neural network ann machine learning gillnet damage detection real time monitoring 1 introduction marine environmental pollution by many marine activities has been regarded as a serious matter in particular lost and abandoned fishing gears i e ghost gears cause serious problems worldwide these gears remain undecomposed resulting in ghost fishing which seriously destroys the marine ecosystem also they cause a potential threat to the safety of divers as well as hinder ship and submarine operation kim et al 2014 matsuoka et al 2005 in korea 20 of fishing gears are lost or abandoned and only approximately 15 of them are recollected lee and an 2007 besides the gillnet occupies the largest portion of ghost gears among all fishing gears an et al 2001 kim et al 2010a in this regard the research for the automatic monitoring of gillnet is needed the automatic monitoring system with sensors can be employed to prevent and recollect ghost gears in general the monitoring system requires tools not only to collect deliver and store the data but also to analyze the data and build a decision making algorithm gps and accelerometers are often used for big data acquisition in the ocean with high accuracy also recent significant advancements in mobile devices and data storage technologies such as the cloud based service make delivering and storing big data possible while people interpret the data and make their decision previously ai artificial intelligence such as machine learning and computer vision application can improve the accuracy of monitoring systems and save analysis time significantly bradley et al 2019 besides the improved performance of computers also increases the potential of machine generated big data from computer simulations therefore the ai based real time monitoring system can be feasible through these recent developments which was our motivation in this research the first step for the design of the gillnet monitoring system is to understand the underwater dynamics of the system to analyze the relevant data while data acquisition from real measurements can be most reliable it takes a lot of time and efforts to collect a meaningful amount of data instead numerical simulation tools can be a time and cost effective solution to get meaningful global performance data for different types of fishing cages and gears in the target environmental conditions when investigating the dynamic behaviors of fishing cages and gears using numerical simulations morison and screen force models were the two most popular approaches to estimate hydrodynamic force on the net kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 chen and christensen 2018 in particular the well designed morison force model is a validated tool against scaled experiments regarding fishing cages and nets in currents and ocean waves lee et al 2008 zhao et al 2009 2013 cifuentes and kim 2017a jin et al 2018 also the morison force model has been successfully utilized to better understand the dynamic behaviors of different cages and nets chen and christensen 2018 huang et al 2018 jin et al 2019 xu et al 2013 the validated numerical simulation tools can then be repeatedly used for numerous failure malfunction scenarios to build up a big database for the given net system and sea environments monitoring algorithm development is an ensuing step after the data acquisition is completed while people can develop a man made deterministic algorithm based on a large number of accumulated data it may be extremely cumbersome and cause errors in the processing and decision making the possible alternative is using the machine learning algorithm in the ocean engineering industry several machine learning based solutions have been suggested guarize et al guarize et al 2007 christiansen et al christiansen et al 2015 and sidarta et al sidarta et al 2017 predicted the mooring and or riser tensions from the responses of floating structures using artificial neural network ann chaves et al chaves et al 2015 utilized ann to estimate the tension and fatigue life of underwater flexible pipes sidarta et al sidarta et al 2018 detected the damage of mooring lines from floater responses using ann ship motions were estimated from wave elevations using the long short term memory deep learning by duan et al duan et al 2019 in this study we developed an automatic monitoring system for a bottom set gillnet using an ann based machine learning scheme with simulation generated data in various environmental conditions the purpose of this study is to detect the initial failure of the bottom set gillnet so that fishermen can collect the net before progressive failures happen first extensive sensor signals for numerous failure and non failure scenarios were collected using time domain numerical simulations for representative environmental conditions on the southwest coast of korea the morison force model was utilized for the computations of hydrodynamic forces on the entire net system the equivalent drag net model was designed for time efficient simulations later a high performance ann algorithm was developed for the present purpose and used with the extensively generated numerical sensor data lastly the testing of the ann algorithm was completed by using different environmental conditions that were not used for training authors previously validated the morison force and equivalent drag net models against various experimental results for fishing cages and net systems cifuentes and kim 2017a 2017b jin et al 2018 several studies were also done by other researchers regarding the dynamic behaviors of the gillnet by experiments stewart 1988 savina et al 2017 and numerical simulations takagi et al 2007 wan et al 2004 these studies were focused on a section of the gillnet in practice the net length can be up to several kilometers which needs more computational time and effort in big data collection an example of the dynamic simulation of a bottom set gillnet and the corresponding deterministic monitoring with similar sensor combinations was given in the authors previous paper jin et al 2019 in this study the ann algorithm based automatic monitoring technology with fewer sensors was further developed with the validated numerical simulation tool 2 method fig 1 demonstrates the process of damage detection of the bottom set gillnet using ann first sensor signals from the system are needed and thus the numerical simulation was carried out to obtain the numerical sensor signals second the ann algorithm was built and utilized for the monitoring system with reliable failure detection performance and training was conducted by using the developed tools third testing was conducted to validate the developed failure detection algorithm with several cases that were not used for training in this section we explain the procedures of the developed monitoring system in detail 2 1 configuration of bottom set gillnet fig 2 shows the design of the bottom set gillnet used in this study material properties and design parameters are presented in table 1 the proposed net system is one of the actual designs used in korea an and huh 2003 kim et al 2010b the bottom set gillnet was composed of the net assembly mooring lines with a 50 m interval 3 location buoys at two end and central locations and ropes to connect the net assembly to buoys the length and height of the net assembly were 300 m and 2 m respectively the hanging ratio of the net i e the actual gillnet length divided by the fully stretched length was set as 0 5 which is a widely used value to the gillnet gray et al 2005 wood bars were installed with a 50 m interval in the net assembly to increase stretching performance water depth was fixed to be 25 m 2 2 time domain simulations we developed the time domain numerical model and conducted extensive numerical simulations using orcaflex a well known commercial program however a sophisticated build up of the numerical model by using proper elements was essential to correctly simulate the dynamics of the entire net system fig 3 shows the side front and top views of the numerical model 3 degree of freedom dof buoy and line models were used to build the entire system while the net assembly ropes mooring lines were all modeled by the line model the 3 dof buoy model was used to connect several lines and to model location buoys the line model was based on the lumped mass method the morison force model estimated the hydrodynamic force on the entire system the added mass coefficient was fixed to be 1 0 for all lines faltinsen 1993 the drag coefficient of the net assembly was based on reynold number dependency formulations suggested by decew et al decew et al 2010 the drag coefficient of mooring lines and ropes was set to be 1 2 veritas 2010 an equivalent drag net model is necessary since it is infeasible to model all the net twines considering that the net is a very slender object the keulegan carpenter kc number is large under given environmental conditions in this condition the inertia force term in the morison equation can be neglected then matching the drag force between the physical net and the numerical net is a key issue in this regard the projected area and wet weight were matched between physical and numerical nets during the process to match the projected area the net assembly becomes heavier and stiffer than the physical net while the modified young s modulus can compensate for the stiffer net the heavier net was balanced by changing the weight and buoyancy of 3 dof buoys used for the connection of the line elements the total numbers of lines and 3 dof buoys to create the entire net model were 568 and 308 respectively detailed formulations and descriptions can be found in references jin et al 2018 2019 since our simulation program is done in the time domain the line broken case at a given time can be straightforwardly implemented 2 3 artificial neural network the ann is similar to that of a biological neural network consisting of several interconnected neurons in many fields this ann model is used for representation pattern recognition and classification of complex nonlinear systems that are difficult to formulate fig 4 shows an example of the multi layered ann model it has a multi layered neural network with two hidden layers the model consists of an input layer two hidden layers and an output layer the neurons are also referred to as nodes the basic unit of computation in the ann is the neuron fig 5 shows the process to acquire output from the input for the single neuron it receives inputs from other nodes and computes an output each input has an associated weight w assigned according to its relative importance to other inputs the node applies a function ƒ to the weighted sum of its inputs not all input signals are sent to the next layer a kind of threshold called an activation function is used to suppress weak signals the s shaped sigmoid function is mainly used as the activation function thus if the summed signal value is not large enough the sigmoid function suppresses the output signal on the other hand if the summation of inputs is large enough the sigmoid function sends a signal to the next layer rashid 2016 in this way the input signal propagates through the hidden layer and reaches the output layer producing the output signal of the ann model 2 4 training of artificial neural network model the goal of developing the ann model is to discover an unknown relationship between a given input signal and an output signal from big data in other words the weights and biases associated with each neuron are properly assigned to ensure that a given data set is well implemented the acquired information is stored in the weights of the connections between neurons the development of an ann model is often referred to as training the first step in developing an ann model is the model representation in other words it is a process to define input and output variables in the given model then we select the data to be used for training good learning requires a large amount of data with fewer errors next the numbers of layers and neurons included in each layer are to be determined and we choose one of many kinds of learning algorithms the learning time takes longer as the number of data layers and neurons increases finally after the training is completed the ann can verify performance with different data from the training data sidarta et al 2018 practically it is very difficult to determine a good network topology with just the number of inputs and outputs it decisively depends on not only the number of training examples but also the complexity of the classification we are trying to learn karsoliya 2012 traditionally the identification of network topologies has been based on trial and error or heuristics followed by trial and error none of these methodologies have the theoretical rigor to give the optimal or at least near optimal solutions thus many researchers proposed methods for estimating the number of neurons and hidden layer requirements but there has been no cure all solution karsoliya 2012 stathakis 2009 liu and lv 2020 also mentioned that the number of nodes can be determined using an empirical formula or the method of multiple trials and errors in this study the number of inputs and outputs was large so the number of hidden layers was set to two for the number of neurons trial and error were used to compare prediction performance in each case this is covered in detail in section 5 training data used for learning should consist of input target pairs when learning of the ann model starts the input signal puts into the initial network besides the output calculated from the network is compared with the target to find the error between them this output error is then used to modify the connected weights backward in the network according to the determined learning rules this training method is called backpropagation hertz 2018 haykin 1994 this process is repeated until the model successfully finds the relationship between the presented input and output there are many ways to update connected weights and biases hertz 2018 haykin 1994 the scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation method was used in this study this method updates weight and bias values according to the scaled conjugate gradient method the algorithm is based on conjugate directions proposed by møller 1993 all process stages were implemented on 32 0 gb 3 40 ghz pc with the 64 bit operating system equipped with matlab r2018a since the various locations of gillnet failures should be classified the pattern recognition network was applied as the ann model the pattern recognition network is the feedforward network that can be trained to classify inputs according to targets patternnet 2019 3 data for training and testing training data on the comprehensive ann model for the detection of the net dynamics signals should cover the environmental conditions in the target area and the conditions of the net assembly i e intact or damaged locations this requirement is necessary to train the ann model to detect and identify damaged locations on the net assembly for the specified environmental and net conditions also determining the proper inputs can lead to a big difference in detecting failures table 2 presents the sea states used for training marked as tr and testing marked as te of the ann model we considered waves and currents as environmental conditions we analyzed the measured wave current data on the southwest coast of korea and proper environmental conditions were selected jin et al 2018 i e significant wave heights hs in the range of 6 8 m and peak periods tp of 1 3 s the pierson moskowitz spectrum which can be used for fully developed seas was selected to generate wave time histories as given in table 2 the training data consists of nine sea states with three significant wave heights and three peak periods the test data consists of two sea states which are different from those used in the training data surface current velocity was fixed to be 0 6 m s while seabed current velocity was 0 06 m s the 1 7 power law was used for the current profile in the vertical direction the directions of current and wave were assumed to be collinear in the numerical simulations fig 6 shows 23 indicators according to the damaged locations this study includes 23 conditions of the net i e an intact and 22 damaged conditions the damaged conditions are defined as the failures of mooring lines or a rope otherwise it is in intact condition for example indicator 1 corresponds to the breakage of the location buoy rope indicator 2 is when the top mooring at y 150 m is broken and indicator 4 is when both top and bottom moorings at y 150 m are broken the ann training uses outputs of 1 and 0 to indicate damaged and intact nets respectively it should be recalled that the validation of a trained ann model is to test the model s capability to associate input and output that are not part of the training cases but are still within the boundaries of the parameters used for training sidarta et al 2018 the total number of simulations for training was 198 for 9 sea states and 22 failure scenarios the total number of simulations for testing was 22 for 22 failure scenarios in 2 sea states i e 12 failure scenarios for hs of 1 5 m and 10 failure scenarios for hs of 2 5 m therefore a total of 220 simulations were performed for training and testing the simulation time for a specific case was about 30 min with a time step of 0 2 s damage occurs at 10 min and only post damage simulations are needed for the damaged cases therefore the total simulation time for 23 cases of a given sea state was 39 604 s 198 022 steps a total of 17 inputs were selected which were hs tp x y z accelerations at four locations and x y z displacements of the location buoy center to be specific moving standard deviations of accelerations were calculated and given as inputs they are the standard deviation within the moving window we can recursively compute it from fresh every time the window is advanced in time probably the best input may be the mooring rope tensions however tension sensors are generally less durable and reliable on the other hand when the ann model is deployed all of the selected inputs can easily be obtained by using the location buoy s gps with wave estimation system and acceleration sensors attached to the net authors developed a real time inverse estimation of hs and tp from buoy motion sensors kim et al 2019 which can directly be applied to the present ann scheme fig 7 shows the positions of the numerical accelerometers this paper does not discuss how to physically collect the real time sensor signals through acoustic devices etc since it is not directly related to the present content 4 convergence test convergence test with respect to the numbers of lines and 3 dof buoys was conducted to validate our equivalent drag net model for that two numerical models model a cruder and b denser were established cruder model a consists of 568 lines and 308 3 dof buoys while the numbers of lines and 3 dof buoys for denser model b are approximately three times larger than those of model a lateral displacements of the net assembly and mooring tensions were compared between the two models in steady currents which are presented in fig 8 the lateral displacements at current velocity 0 6 m s show that the convergence is excellent and even the cruder model a can produce reliable results in addition the tension comparisons at various current velocities further demonstrate that model a can be utilized for the data acquisition of machine learning the denser model b took ten times more computational time than model a the maximum difference is 3 2 percent for the top mooring line at a current velocity of 0 4 m s the numerical models also compared well with various experiments proving that the proposed equivalent drag net model is reliable cifuentes and kim 2017a when generating the big data set for training model a was used 5 results and discussions if the net is set over a large sea area like gillnet it is important to identify the damaged location first for local repair authors by using the traditionally programmed algorithm previously developed a methodology to approximately detect the damaged locations of the bottom set gillnet from the pattern changes in acceleration tension and buoy displacement sensor signals jin et al 2019 on the other hand this study attempts to detect damage positions more accurately from the trained ann model by using acceleration sensors on the net and gps sensor on the buoy the ann model can be trained for selected wave conditions to recognize patterns of changes in sensor signals so that the prediction model can identify damaged locations the trained ann model can then be further applied to more general wave conditions to do the same mission as mentioned before there are 17 input variables in the present ann model which include hs tp x y z displacements of the buoy and twelve moving standard deviations of the acceleration four locations multiplied by three directions i e x y z directions figs 9 and 10 show the time histories of the accelerations of the net assembly at the top and bottom of the middle location y 0 m where accelerometers are positioned the failure of mooring lines occurs at 600 s 3000 steps as mooring lines at y 0 m are broken the magnitude and trend of x acceleration signals are sharply changed as shown in fig 9 similarly mooring line breakages at y 50 m lead to y acceleration variations as shown in fig 10 each damage case results in unique magnitudes and trends of all acceleration signals such that failure locations can be detected through the machine learning algorithm fig 11 shows x displacements of the central location buoy under different failure scenarios as the rope or mooring lines at the middle location are broken the location buoy s displacements can help to detect the respective failure with their unique signal trends in particular the rope breakage results in a continuous drift along the x direction since it freely floats on the water without any restriction which makes the machine learning algorithm detect the rope s failure better fig 12 shows an example of input signals for hs 1 m and tp 6 s where the failure of top mooring line at y 150 m occurs at 600 s 3000 steps initially the acceleration signal itself was used but the classification performance was not good therefore instead of the raw acceleration signal the moving standard deviations of accelerations as a statistical feature were used in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the test cases fig 13 shows the receiver operating characteristic roc curves using the raw accelerations left and using the moving standard deviations of accelerations right the signal detection theory was first developed during world war ii the radar operator had to determine whether it was an enemy or friendly ship from the detected signal the term roc was used to quantify the radar operator s capability to distinguish signals calì and longobardi 2015 the roc curve measures classification performance in two dimensional space and it is often applied to biomedical research for measuring the performance of diagnostic tests witten et al 1999 zhou and harezlak 2002 it is also used as a performance measure for machine learning algorithms bradley 1997 the roc curve is a plot of sensitivity vs 1 specificity or the true positive rate tpr vs the false positive rate fpr it plots 1 specificity on the x axis and sensitivity on the y axis for the probability prediction model for the binary dependent variable i e true or false the prediction can be either positive or negative for actually true for an actually false the prediction can also be either positive or negative the sensitivity in the roc curve means the ratio of correctly predicted as positive to actual true cases and the specificity is the ratio of correctly predicted as negative to the actual false cases for example suppose blood pressure is used as an indicator for diagnosing myocardial infarction then tpr is the rate at which a patient is diagnosed as a patient fpr 1 specificity on the other hand is the rate at which a non patient is diagnosed as a patient in general trying to increase tpr also increases fpr in other words if the standard of blood pressure is alleviated to increase tpr more non patients are also diagnosed as being patients therefore in order to assess the classification performance of the indicator used it is necessary to measure both tpr and frp of the data for each criterion by changing the indicator criteria blood pressure 80 120 the graph of this is the roc curve from the curve we can find the optimum criteria corresponding to the appropriate tpr and frp for the case when taking a test the higher the sensitivity and the specificity the better the test since the x axis is not specificity but 1 specificity if the roc curve passes through the upper left corner or if the area under the curve is large the performance of classification is satisfactory the area under the roc curve of the perfect test is 1 in fig 13 we can see the improved classification performance when using the moving standard deviations of accelerations instead of accelerations itself it means that in the process to choose the input variables proper statistical values can enhance the machine learning performance the training and testing of the ann model were performed using the extensive data generated under the sea states shown in table 2 for 23 conditions of the net figs 14 and 15 show the order and numbering of training for each sea state and test cases for 2 sea states respectively the development of the classification ann model can be updated using cross entropy calculated based on the following equation 1 in other words the cross entropy function is used to calculate the decreasing error in the training process lang and witbrock 1988 van ooyen and nienhuis 1992 1 c e p i t p i log y p i 2 f i 1 k p 1 c c e p i k c where c e is cross entropy t p i 0 or 1 is a target value for a case i at output unit p y p i is the output of the ann for a case i at output unit p k is the number of the case c is the number of output unit and f is the aggregate cross entropy performance in equation 2 f i e an average of the c e gives an overall indication of how close the output y from the ann model is to the target t for all training or test cases in one case the ann predicts a value between 0 and 1 for all 23 output nodes an output of 1 means a damaged net whereas that of 0 indicates an intact net the node number having the largest prediction value among the 23 nodes becomes the predicted damage indicator for example if the prediction value of 1 22nd output nodes is 0 5 and that of the 23rd node is 0 8 the predicted condition is 23 i e the intact condition fig 16 shows the cross entropy for each stage of the ann model with two hidden layers for training and testing cases the prediction performance of the ann model increases as the number of hidden neurons increases in general adding hidden neurons reduces the average of cross entropy the lower cross entropy of the training cases compared to the test cases indicates that the ann model provides a better prediction for the training cases than the test cases as expected this is because the test cases were not included in the training of the ann model the best ann model with the minimum cross entropy for the test case is the case with 180 hidden neurons in each layer after 60 hidden neurons the variation is not significant the development of the ann model was based on the ann with two hidden layers besides the training began with 10 neurons and ended with 300 neurons the best prediction accuracy in equation 3 of the trained ann model was 99 5 and 91 1 for the test cases respectively this is when there are 180 hidden neurons in each layer 3 prediction accuracy m n 100 where m is the number of matched cases and n is the total number of cases in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the test cases the median filter was further applied to the predicted damage indicator the median filter is a non linear digital filtering technique which is widely applied for the removal of noise from images or signals wikipedia median filter 2019 this filter replaces a point s value with the median in the window around that point it is effective for removing random or spike like noise in practical use a moving median filter can be applied to the predicted indicator from the trained ann model after the median filtering the prediction accuracy increased to 99 7 and 96 0 for training and test cases with the 180 hidden neurons in each layer respectively fig 17 compares the target and predicted damage indicators marked as blue diamond and red circle for the training cases only for three sea states of the ann model with 180 hidden neurons with the median filtering the trained ann model accepts input sensor data five times a second and provides a damage location indicator to the user at the same time interval in the graph the horizontal axis is the time steps for a series of failure scenarios in which the data transmission occurs each failure case corresponds to 1800 s 9000 steps portion of the horizontal axis including a 600 sec intact condition then the next failure case is given as a consecutive series on the same horizontal axis and so on the red circles on the blue diamond background mean correct prediction otherwise red circle alone they are false predictions although not clear in the figure due to numerous overlaps the number of red circles on blue background is greatly larger than off marked red circles figs 18 22 are similarly constructed for the test cases not covered in the training cases again the red circle is the predicted indicator that is sent out each time step the blue diamond is the real indicator if the blue diamond and the red circle coincide it means an accurate prediction figs 18 21 show the prediction of the ann model with 10 30 60 90 and 180 hidden neurons for the test cases without the median filtering as the number of neurons increases the classification performance of the ann model also improves fig 22 shows the prediction for the test cases with 180 neurons with the median filtering when compared with fig 21 the ann model with the median filter better predicts the target indicators at the same number of neurons specifically out of the 198 022 trial cases estimated from the ann every time step 190 089 matched the actual or target state which is an accuracy of 96 since many circles are overlapped on top of each other on blue backgrounds for the correctly predicted cases the correctly predicted number can hardly be counted from the figure it took about 18 h to train 180 hidden neurons on a pc with a 3 4 ghz processor and 32 gb of memory for the 1 782 198 steps 356 440 s this comes from a combination of 198 022 steps and nine sea states from these results the accuracy of damage detection is high enough 96 and the developed machine learning based monitoring system can successfully be applied to the real time monitoring of physical net systems besides in this study it is shown that the moving standard deviation the median filter the optimal number of neurons can improve the detecting performance significantly these factors demonstrate that the selection of appropriate data and learning algorithm is essential for enhanced detection performance if more simulation data is acquired for training from massive computations the detecting performance can also be improved 6 conclusions this paper presents the development of a digital twin model with an ann based machine learning scheme for detecting and classifying the position of a damaged net by recognizing changes in signals from 4 accelerometers on the net assembly this task can be considered as pattern recognition and classification problems and ann is appropriate for the task the input variables of the ann model were sea state hs tp accelerations on the net assembly and buoy location the real time monitoring is possible by using the sensed data the ann model was first trained for several sea states and multiple failure scenarios the trained ann model was then tested for the cases not included in the training to demonstrate its damage detection capability for more general sea states 220 numerical simulations were performed for training and testing when training the ann model the data should be comprehensive for good prediction that means it should cover a wide range of environmental and gillnet conditions also the data needs to be of high quality so that the developed ann algorithms can reliably be applied to the real system this study shows the development of a high performance ann model for real time net system monitoring by employing the optimal number of neurons proper median filter and moving standard deviation of accelerometer signals instead of acceleration raw data itself the ann model was well trained from the simulated signals for representative sea states and damage scenarios and proved to be excellent 96 success rate in predicting the test cases not included in the training the performance of the developed digital twin and machine learning models may further be enhanced by simultaneously using both time series and spectra of the sensor signals which is

21811,scour that removes soils around foundations supporting bridges and marine structures is the major cause for structural failures recently many studies have been conducted to investigate scour effects on lateral behavior of single piles using numerical analyses laboratory model tests or centrifuge tests however very limited research is focused on scour effects on lateral behavior of pile groups no simple method is currently available for practicing engineers to analyze pile groups under scour conditions in this study a simple and practical method was proposed based on the existing p y curve theory to facilitate the design of laterally loaded pile groups under scour conditions feasibility of the proposed method was examined against 3d finite element fe analyses through a series of parametric studies by varying scour hole dimensions soil properties and pile group configurations the results showed that the proposed method generally produced agreeable results with the 3d fe analyses scour induced lateral capacity loss of pile groups was 10 13 more in dense sands than in loose sands pile groups were more susceptible to scour than single piles under the equivalent scour

waves scour causes significant reduction in foundation capacity due to the loss of soil supports lin and lin 2019 it is reported that flood and scour related bridge failures account for approximately 60 of total bridge failures in the u s and 80 in china kan et al 1998 lagasse et al 2007 liang et al 2017 marine structures are also vulnerable to scour whitehouse 1998 therefore it is critically important to design foundations against scour damage a complete design of foundations against scour requires the integration of hydraulic geotechnical and structural analyses arneson et al 2012 scour depth due to general scour erosion across the stream or sea bed and local scour erosion around foundations is estimated based on hydraulic study at sites and engineers judgement prior to the conventional foundation design arneson et al 2012 aashto 2012 local scour caused by accelerated flow and vortex usually develops greater scour depth than the general scour which thus induces more significant capacity loss of foundations however in current pile design practice local scour that develops a scour hole around the foundation is simply considered by totally removing the top soil layer to the estimated local scour depth for convenience i e simplifying the local scour as a general scour ignoring the contribution of the remaining soils apart from the foundation according to lin et al 2014 this method leads to 49 68 higher groundline lateral displacement of single piles in sands under a typical range of lateral loads recently the importance of dimensions of local scour hole for economical foundation design has been recognized numerous research has been conducted to investigate the effects of scour hole dimensions on lateral responses of single piles chortis et al 2020 qi et al 2016 liang et al 2018 lin et al 2016 in which the scour hole is idealized as an inverted truncated cone with dimensions of scour depth s d bottom scour width s w b and scour hole slope angle β lin and lin 2019 lin et al 2014 investigated the effects of local scour on a laterally loaded steel pipe pile in dense sands φ 39 using three dimensional finite difference method a wide range of scour hole dimensions s d 0 8 d s w b 0 18 d and β 0 39 where d pile diameter were evaluated in their research it was found that an increase in scour depth significantly increased pile lateral displacement and maximum bending moment effects of scour width and scour hole slope angle were relatively less significant especially when s w b 8 d lin and lin 2019 further studied the problem by varying soil properties from dense sands φ 39 medium dense sands φ 33 to loose sands φ 29 using commercial 3d finite element fe software plaxis 3d they concluded that the loss of pile lateral capacity due to scour was approximately 10 more in dense sands than that in loose sands in addition to 3d numerical simulations a simple and practical method was also developed for analysis of laterally loaded single piles under local scour conditions lin et al 2014 lin and wu 2019 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 this method known as modified p y method was developed by modifying the ultimate soil resistance p u l t based on either wedge failure model or derivation of soil vertical effective stress around piles after scour it enables the engineers to incorporate the effect of various scour hole dimensions into the routine design of piles in practice piles are more commonly installed in groups and the behavior of pile groups is more complex than that of single piles especially under lateral loads reese and van impe 2001 as compared with single isolated piles piles in a closely spaced pile group undergo a significant reduction in lateral capacity in both sands and clays ashour and ardalan 2011 brown et al 1988 fayyazi et al 2014 mcvay et al 1995 rollins et al 1998 2005 this phenomenon termed as group effect is due to the overlapped soil reaction zones between neighbouring piles similarly there is also a group effect regarding the scour potential for a pile group that is scour extent around individual piles in a pile group would be intensified as compared with that around single isolated piles due to the increased flow velocity and the turbulence between piles in the pile group such a double group effect is anticipated to impose a more severe scour consequence for pile groups than single piles however to the best of authors knowledge there is no study available concerning the scour effects on lateral responses of pile groups furthermore although there exist modified p y methods for analysis of single piles under local scour no such a simple and practical method is available for analyzing laterally loaded pile groups under scour conditions this study aims to propose a simple and practical method for analyzing laterally loaded pile groups in sands under scour conditions this method was developed based on the modified p y method for scoured single piles lin and lin 2019 a matlab program was developed to implement the proposed method the computed results were compared with those from 3d finite element fe analyses in a series of parametric studies to ensure its validity this paper starts with a summary of the existing research on the pile group effect and the scour hole dimensions for a pile group followed by development of the proposed method the 3d fe analyses were carried out to verify the proposed method through a series of parametric analyses considering the effects of scour depth scour hole slope angle soil properties and pile group configurations the results that are relevant to the design of laterally loaded pile groups under scour conditions are discussed 2 review of pile group effects pile groups under lateral loading develop a group effect because of the shared shear zones of soils between neighbouring piles the group effect may consist of shallowing effect due to overlapped soil reaction zones between piles in different pile rows and edge effect due to overlapped soil reaction zones between piles in the same pile row brown et al 1988 fayyazi et al 2012 rollins et al 1998 based on the full scale load tests on a 3 3 free head pile group with the spacing of 3 d in dense sands brown et al 1988 found that leading row middle row and back row illustrated in fig 1 a carried significantly different percentages of the total load i e 45 32 and 23 respectively this demonstrates that soils surrounding different pile rows were disturbed in various degrees indicating the shallowing effect mcvay et al 1995 investigated the shadowing effect through centrifuge tests on 3 d and 5 d spaced free head pile groups 3 3 in both medium dense sands d r 55 and medium loose sands d r 33 their tests showed that larger spaced pile groups showed less shadowing effect based on both studies of brown et al 1988 and mcvay et al 1995 the shallowing effect tended to be less noticeable in looser sands in addition to cohesionless soils rollins et al 1998 tested the lateral behavior of a free head 3 3 pile group s 3 d in soft to medium stiff clays piles in the pile group underwent twice the lateral displacement and 50 100 more maximum bending moment than the corresponding single isolated piles piles in the same row were found to respond differently to the lateral load i e edge effect exterior piles in the same row were found to carry more lateral load and experience larger bending moment than interior piles probably because of less overlapped shear zones at the exterior piles than at the interior piles similar observations were also obtained in 3d numerical simulations and centrifuge tests fayyazi et al 2012 ilyas et al 2004 to analyze the pile group effect the method of p multiplier was proposed by brown et al 1988 which is widely accepted in practice the p multiplier method includes applying a reduction factor i e p multiplier f m to the p y curves for a single pile for analysis of pile groups under lateral loads fig 2 brown et al 1988 reese and van impe 2001 in general the value of f m varies with pile spacing pile location in the pile group soil properties and pile head conditions ashour and ardalan 2011 brown et al 1988 fayyazi et al 2012 2014 the f m is normally back calculated from the full scale tests centrifuge tests or full 3d numerical simulations brown et al 1988 ilyas et al 2004 in the absence of field test data for back calculation p multipliers may also be obtained using an empirical correlation with pile spacing mokwa et al 2000 or simply taken to be 0 6 as often used in practice it should be mentioned that edge effect is often neglected as it is relatively insignificant compared with the shadowing effect therefore as will be discussed the edge effect is not considered in this research 3 review of scour hole dimensions for pile groups the dimensions of scour hole developed around pile groups depend not only on flow conditions and soil properties but also on pile group configurations amini et al 2012 lança et al 2013 liang et al 2017 sumer et al 2005 based on the tests at six pile groups s 2 3 5 d where s pile spacing sumer et al 2005 found that the scour around the large spaced pile group s 5 d developed pits around individual piles plus a big saucer shaped depression around the pile group the depression is called global scour for the small spaced pile groups s 2 d or 3 d individual pits overlapped with each other in a series of laboratory tests on 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 pile groups s 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 d lança et al 2013 observed that when pile spacing was small i e s 3 d individual pits were fully interconnected forming only a global scour hole around the pile group when the pile spacing was increased to s 4 5 d although the individual pits were partially interconnected the global scour hole still dominated the overall shape of scour hole when the pile spacing was further increased to s 6 d the individual pits were fully disconnected in a field survey made at ajigaura beach in japan bayram and larson 2000 a large single global scour hole was also observed around several pile groups with the pile spacing of s 4 5 d since a pile group is commonly designed with the spacing of 3d or 4d in general practice a single global scour hole can be reasonably used to represent the local scour around a pile group while the individual pits can be ignored amini et al 2012 presented several photographs of scour holes generated around 3 5 pile groups s 1 2 3 5 and 5 d during the flume tests showing the rounded square shape of the scour holes therefore in the 3d fe analyses scour hole around pile groups may be modelled as an inverted rounded square pyramid frustum with dimensions illustrated in fig 1 a similar to scour around single piles scour depth s d g bottom scour width s w b g and scour hole slope angle β g are used to describe the dimensions of the scour hole around a pile group as with the expression of scour depth for single piles scour depth around pile groups is commonly normalized to the pile diameter for convenience however different from that for single piles scour depth developed at pile groups is dependent on pile group configuration lin and lin 2019 to reflect the effect of pile group configuration the scour depth may be better normalized to effective diameter of pile group the effective diameter of a pile group d e f f is essentially the diameter of an equivalent single pile that can develop the same local scour depth as the pile group under the same flow conditions sheppard 2003 therefore scour depth around the pile group after normalized to the effective diameter i e s d g d e f f is comparable to scour depth around the single pile that is normalized to the pile diameter i e s d d in other words if both ratios are equal the extents of scour are equivalent between pile groups and singe piles the calculation of the effective diameter is briefly described below while the details can be found in sheppard 2003 1 d e f f w p k s p k h k r 2 k s p 1 4 3 1 w p i w p 1 1 s d 0 6 in eqs 1 and 2 w p is the sum of the non overlapped projected widths of piles in the first column and the first two rows onto the

diameter and effective diameter of pile group in the table specific flow and soil properties are not given as the motivation in this study is to obtain the typical range of scour depth around pile groups from table 1 scour depth around pile group ranges from 0 86 to 2 63 d e f f with an average value of 1 68 0 16 d e f f in marine foundation design scour depth around single piles is normally suggested to be s d 1 5 d api 2011 this is comparable to s d g 1 68 d e f f summarised here for pile groups in other words it may be suitable to consider s d g 1 5 2 0 d e f f for the design of pile group under local scour conditions compared with the scour depth the typical ranges of the bottom scour width and scour hole slope angle at pile group are still not well studied consequently the typical values of bottom scour width and scour hole slope angle around single piles may be used for pile groups in absence of specific measurement data i e s w b g 0 lin and wu 2019 and β g 0 12 to φ 1 butch 1996 lin and lin 2019 4 proposed method considering both scour effects and pile group effects lin and lin 2019 proposed an analytical solution for laterally loaded single piles considering different scour hole dimensions this method known as modified p y method is essentially modifying the ultimate soil resistance p u l t in p y curves based on the estimation of soil vertical effective stress around piles in post scour conditions using the boussinesq point load solution the analytical solution was compared with the 3d fe analyses showing satisfactory estimates of pile lateral capacity and bending moment however this method is only applicable to the analyses of single piles 4 1 development in this research a simple and practical method is proposed for laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions by combining the modified p y method lin and lin 2019 and p multiplier f m brown et al 1988 several assumptions are necessary to develop this proposed method 1 soil vertical effective stress around individual piles within the pile group is assumed equal to that surrounding the center pile e g the pile located in the middle row and middle column in fig 1 a 2 in deriving vertical effective stress around the center pile of the pile group scour hole is simply approximated as an inverted truncated cone fig 1 b having the same scour depth and scour hole slope angle as well as the same bottom area of the scour hole as the inverted rounded square pyramid frustum fig 1 a the inverted truncated cone is only used for derivation of post scour vertical effective stress as it helps to ease the derivation and to draw on the modified p y method for single piles developed by lin and lin 2019 3 p multipliers f m are assumed unchanged by scour i e the values remain the same before and after scour 4 bottom scour width around the pile group is assumed to be zero s w b g 0 assumptions 1 and 3 are made based on the observations of the 3d fe analysis results as will be discussed later the key of the proposed method is to determine an equivalent depth z e below the post scour ground line eq 6 which is dependent on the post scour vertical effective stress eq 7 by substituting z e for z in the original reese s p y curve equations for sands reese and van impe 2001 the p y curves are modified to consider different scour hole dimensions around pile groups eqs 8 12 to consider the group effect the curves need to be further modified by multiplying them with f m as presented in eq 8 the equivalent depth is calculated as 6 z e σ v a γ s following the first and second assumptions the vertical effective stress around individual piles in the pile group σ v a is equal to that around the center pile of the pile group therefore the equation of lin and lin 2019 that was derived for scour hole around single isolated piles can be extended to the pile group by substituting s w b in the original equation with s w c 7 σ v a δ σ v γ s z γ s z 1 t a n β g s d g t a n β g s w c s d g t a n β g s w c 2 z 2 s w c s w c 2 z 2 in eq 7 s d g and β g are the scour depth and sour hole slope angle for the pile group respectively s w c is the distance between the toe of the inverted truncated cone and the side of the center pile fig 1 b i e s w c a b g π d 2 where a b g is the bottom area of the scour hole once z e is determined in eqs 6 and 7 the new suite of p y curves modified for scoured pile groups can be developed by using z e in conjunction with f m as given in eqs 8 12 8 p k p y z e y f m y y k c f m y 1 n y k y y m p m p m p u y u y m y y m f m y m y y u f m p u y y u in eq 8 values of k p y depend on the properties of sands reese and van impe 2001 the displacements of y m and y u are d 60 and 3d 80 respectively while the other coefficients y k c n p m and p u are determined in eqs 9 12 9 p u a s p u l t 10 p m b s p u l t 11 p u l t c 1 z e c 2 d γ s z e c 3 d γ s z e m i n where c 1 tan θ 2 tan α tan θ φ k o tan φ sin θ tan θ φ cos α tan θ tan

for determining coefficients in modified reese s p y curves can be found in lin and lin 2019 in eq 8 y k is determined by 12 y k c k p y z e n n 1 where c p m y m 1 n n p m m y m and m p u p m y u y m overall once scour hole dimensions are known post scour vertical effective stress σ v a around individual piles within the pile group may be estimated using eq 7 once soil properties e g k py φ and p multiplier f m are available utilizing eqs 6 8 to 12 a series of modified p y curves considering both scour hole dimensions and pile group effect can be generated normally k p y and φ can be back calculated from field test on a single pile while f m from field test on a pile group in the absence of field test data for back calculation k p y and φ may be estimated based on the empirical correlations with the data of in situ tests while f m can also be estimated using empirical correlations as discussed previously in section 2 4 2 implementation the proposed method is essentially the modification of the p y curves for sands to account for various scour hole dimensions and pile group effects the modified p y curves are incorporated to the euler bernoulli beam equation with which the lateral responses of a pile group under various scour hole dimensions can be calculated to solve the nonlinear fourth order beam equation a finite difference algorithm with newton s iteration was developed and implemented in matlab 5 3d finite element analysis a series of 3d fe analyses was performed using plaxis 3d to verify the proposed method prior to the verification a baseline fe model was established for a no scour or pre scour case utilizing the published data from the full scale load test brown et al 1988 the baseline model was then scoured to form a scour hole around the pile group the effects of various scour hole dimensions were then evaluated using the 3d fe analyses and the proposed method moreover the dependence of lateral responses of scoured pile groups on soil properties pile spacing and pile numbers was also investigated 5 1 baseline fe model the lateral load tests for single pile and pile group performed on the campus of university of houston brown et al 1988 were used to establish the baseline fe model in no scour condition the load test results for single pile were used to back calculate the soil parameters such as frictional angle and elastic modulus while the load test results for pile group were used to validate the baseline fe model table 2 shows the properties of steel pipe piles used in the test the piles were arranged in a 3 by 3 group with the pile spacing approximately equal to 3d typical values of poisson s ratio and elastic modulus for steel were used for the test piles as listed in table 2 the soils underlain the site consisted of a 2 9 m compacted and submerged dense sand layer underlain by natural stiff clays since the depth of sands exceeded 10 times pile diameter the lateral behavior of piles was dominated by the sand properties therefore piles were assumed to be embedded in a single sand layer brown et al 1988 soil properties of friction angle and elastic modulus dense sand in table 2 were back calculated by fitting the fe analyses for the single pile to the measured field test data fig 4 a the internal friction angle of sands was measured to be 38 5 based on the direct shear test and was approximately 30 to 45 when correlated with the data from standard penetration test spt brown et al 1988 as seen in table 2 the backed calculated friction angle from pile load test fell in the range of spt correlated values soil dilation angles were determined by ψ φ 30 brinkgreve et al 2016 effective unit weight was calculated using a typical specific gravity value for sands g s 2 65 in the 3d fe baseline model for pile group shown in fig 5 a soils were modelled as an elastic perfectly plastic material with the mohr coulomb as a failure criterion groundwater table was set at the ground surface the pipe piles were simulated as an equivalent solid pile with the same outer diameter d pile length l and flexural stiffness ei using linear elastic stress strain relation it should be noted that to measure the bending moment of the test piles in the load tests a small steel tube with outer diameter of 16 8 cm and thickness of 1 6 cm was inserted inside the test pile with the gap between the tube and the interior wall of the test pile being grouted brown et al 1988 thus contributions of grout and small steel tube to the overall flexural stiffness were considered by using typical material properties for the tube and grout i e e t 2 02 10 8 kpa ν t 0 3 e g 2 2 10 7 kpa ν g 0 3 in the field test piles in the pile group were pin connected to a frame which allowed the pile head to rotate freely and the pile head was located 0 305 m above the ground surface therefore a free head condition was simulated interactions between soils and piles were simulated with interface elements which were composed of node pairs two elastic perfectly plastic springs were applied to each pair of nodes to model the gap displacement and slip displacement respectively brinkgreve et al 2016 the strength reduction factor r i n t e r of 0 7 was specified to account for the roughness of interfaces based on the types of soils and structures brinkgreve and shen 2011 the pile group was laterally loaded with a prescribed incremental displacement of 6 35 mm 0 25 inch at the pile head until the total lateral displacement reached 38 1 mm 1 5 inches in plaxis 3d the geometry of finite elements is restricted to 10 node tetrahedron leading to difficulties in computing bending moments using the direct integration of normal stress over the cross section of pile lin and lin 2019 consequently a special massless structural beam dummy beam was inserted to the pile to assist with the calculation of bending moments the dummy beam has the same diameter as the test pile but a negligible modulus equal to 10 6 times that of the equivalent solid piles the bending moment of the test pile was then determined by multiplying the bending moment of the dummy beam by 10 6 dao 2011 the default meshing function in plaxis 3d i e medium dense was used to create a mesh in the 3d fe model where the pile elements along the pile length and the soil elements in the upper 4 88 m were refined using a coarseness factor of 0 1 and 0 6 respectively overall more than 150 000 elements were generated in the 3d fe model for pile group analyses the boundaries of the model were set sufficiently far from the pile group to avoid the boundary effects on the numerical modelling in this research the horizontal boundaries were set at a distance of 60d parallel to the horizontal loads and 40d perpendicular to the horizontal loads from the center of the pile group while the vertical boundary was located 10d below the pile toe the results of lateral displacement at pile head and lateral responses along pile shaft from the baseline fe model are presented in figs 4 b and fig 6 respectively fig 4 b indicates that as compared with the field test data the baseline fe model produced agreeable but slightly conservative results especially for the leading row in other words 3d fe model overestimated the shadowing effect behind the leading row fig 6 shows the calculated bending moment for a single isolated pile and the averaged value for each row in the pile group overall the computed bending moments were in agreement with the measured data the baseline fe model also predicted well the maximum bending moment and the locations of maximum bending moment at different rows overall the above comparison to field test data validates the baseline fe model 6 simulation of scour hole and parametric analyses the validated baseline fe model was used to simulate the lateral behavior of pile group under various scour hole conditions for the proposed method the input values of k p y and φ were back calculated from the load tests for single pile and f m was back calculated from the load test for pile group the p y method was used for the back calculation see fig 4 a and b the back calculated k p y was 34 mn m 3 the back calculated φ was 48 which is higher than the 3d fe back calculated i e 43 in table 2 the φ back calculated from the p y method could be different from that from the 3d fe method fem due to the different constitutive relationships and numerical solutions used in these two methods the back calculated f m for the leading row middle row and back row was 0 8 0 4 and 0 25 respectively fig 6 shows the relatively good comparison of bending moment profiles between p y method and the field measurement note that the proposed method is reduced to the p y method for pile group in no scour or pre scour conditions therefore results from fig 6 confirm that the proposed method is competent for evaluation for pile group effects while its feasibility to evaluate effects of scour hole dimensions need to be further verified by the 3d fe model scour hole around a pile group was simulated as an inverted rounded square pyramid frustum with 3d fem illustrated in fig 1 a and as an equivalent inverted truncated cone with the proposed method shown in fig 1 b fig 5 indicates the distribution of vertical effective stress in both pre scour and post scour condition it is shown that vertical effective stress beneath the scour hole is reduced due to the removal of soils moreover variation of vertical effective stress between piles was small which confirms the first assumption of the proposed method the dimensions of a scour hole were defined by scour depth s d g scour bottom width s w b g and scour hole slope angle β g to investigate the effects of scour hole dimensions on lateral responses of pile group in both 3d fem and the proposed method s d g was varied from 0 0 7d eff 1 4d eff 2 1d eff to 2 8d eff which corresponded to 0 1 5d 3d 4 5d to 6d the s w b g was set to 0 and β g varied from 0 12 to φ 1 where φ is soil friction angle note that the scour hole slope angle should not be set equal to or greater than the internal friction angle of soils to avoid soil failure in addition to varying scour hole dimensions the effects of various soil properties pile spacing and pile number on the scour susceptibility of pile groups were also investigated by using both 3d fem and the proposed method for the variation of soil properties besides the dense sands from the test site medium dense and loose sands were added for consideration typical values of internal friction angle and elastic modulus table 2 were assumed for the medium dense and loose sands kulhawy and mayne 1990 for the effect of pile spacing a 3 by 3 pile group with the pile spacing varied from 2d 3d 4d 5d to 6d was evaluated for the pile number effect three groups of 2 by 2 3 by 3 and 4 by 4 with the same pile spacing of 3d were investigated 7 results and discussion results from the proposed method and 3d fem included lateral capacity ratio bending moment profiles and load distribution of piles within the pile group the pile lateral capacity is defined as an applied lateral load yielding 25 mm lateral displacement at the head of the pile group lin and wu 2019 instead of directly using lateral capacity the lateral capacity ratio which is a ratio of lateral capacity of pile group after scour to that before scour is presented in this research to better indicate the loss of pile lateral capacity due to scour lin and lin 2019 the bending moment is presented as the averaged value in each row of pile group 7 1 effects of scour depth fig 7 presents the averaged load displacement curves of 3 3 pile group s 3 d under various scour depth s d g 0 to 2 8 d e f f or 0 to 6 d while s w b g 0 and β g 26 6 the averaged load of pile group is calculated by dividing the total lateral load of the pile group by the number of piles the proposed method and 3d fem resulted in reasonably agreeable results as discussed in the baseline model verification 3d fem overestimated the shadowing effect shown in fig 4 b especially in the leading row therefore the calculated averaged load was relatively smaller than that from the proposed method in the pre scour condition however the opposite results were observed as scour depth increased as seen in fig 7 this change may be explained by that as with the modified p y method for scoured single pile lin and lin 2019 the proposed method herein also failed to account for the soil pile interface friction that could potentially reduce the scour induced release of vertical stress of soils surrounding piles in other words the proposed method underestimated the vertical effective stress of soils around piles leading to a lower estimated lateral resistance to piles than the 3d fem this effect can be more pronounced in group piles than in single piles due to the pile group effects fig 8 presents variations of lateral capacity ratios with scour depth computed by the proposed method and 3d fem showing good agreement as the scour depth increased from 0 to 2 8d eff 0 to 6d the lateral capacity ratio was decreased from 1 to 0 42 according to the 3d fe analyses meaning 58 loss of lateral capacity of the pile group as compared with 3d fem the proposed method underestimated the lateral capacity ratio by 12 22 such an underestimate was also found in single piles but less significant i e 10 18 lin and lin 2019 as discussed above this is attributed to the under estimated post scour vertical effective stress of soils around piles by the proposed method which is amplified in pile group analysis fig 8 also indicates that when s d g 1 5 d e f f s w b g 0 and β g 26 6 the lateral capacity ratio was calculated to be 0 52 and 0 68 by the proposed method and 3d fem respectively these numbers were lower than those estimated using the modified p y method and 3d fem for single piles 0 73 and 0 82 respectively in similarly dense sands φ 39 and equivalent scour conditions s d 1 5 d s w b 0 and β 26 6 lin and lin 2019 this comparison demonstrates that the scour induced lateral capacity loss was more severe in pile groups than in single piles fig 9 shows the load distribution within the pile group varied with scour depth two methods predicted agreeable load share at different pile rows it is shown that leading row carried the largest lateral load as the surrounding soils were least disturbed as scour depth increased from 0 to 2 8d eff 0 to 6d only slight variations in load distribution were observed in both the proposed method and 3d fem in which the load share decreased by 2 4 in the leading row increased by 2 5 in the back row while remained unchanged in the middle row this result indicates that variation of scour depth had a negligible effect on the pile group effect therefore it would be reasonable to assume that p multipliers are not changed by the increase in scour depth this is consistent to the third assumption made for the proposed method fig 10 depicts the profiles of averaged bending moment of each row at two different scour depths s d 1 4 d e f f and 2 8 d e f f when the pile group was subjected to a lateral pile head displacement of 25 mm bending moment profiles obtained by the proposed method and 3d fem match well as with the results in the pre scour conditions in fig 6 the leading row had the largest bending moment than the other rows in the post scour conditions the 3d fe analyses show that as scour depth increased from 1 4 to 2 8 d eff 3 to 6d the maximum bending moment decreased by 18 16 and 14 in the leading row middle row and back row respectively and the corresponding locations moved toward a deeper depth by about 2 2d 2 0d and 1 6d respectively similar change in maximum bending moment and corresponding location were also captured by the proposed method this result indicates that the change in the location of maximum bending moment did not keep up with the increase in scour depth i e 3d which agreed with the findings for the scoured single piles lin and lin 2019 in other words as scour depth increased the locations of m m a x would move toward the post scour ground line with the location in the back and middle rows being closer to the post scour ground line than in the leading row fig 11 shows contours of horizontal displacement and effective stress of soils in both pre scour and post scour conditions when the top of the pile group was mobilized laterally by one inch 25 mm displacement and stress distributions show that the pile group under the scoured condition developed smaller passive influence zone than under the pre scour condition this may be attributed to that at the same lateral deflection at pile head less lateral displacement was applied to the ground in the post scour condition than in the pre scour condition as the cantilever portion of pile group was increased by scour fig 11 b indicates that in the post scour condition the lateral movement of soils on the passive side was restrained by the unscoured overburden away from the piles showing a prograde pattern this is in contrast to the wedge pattern on the passive side in the pre scour condition in fig 11 a fig 11 a and b also indicate that pre scour and post scour soil displacement fields within the pile group and on the active side were in a similar pattern fig 11 c and d indicate that although the area of soil reactions was different the distribution of soil reactions exhibited similar patterns before and after scour this may explain why similar load share was observed under various scour depths in fig 9 7 2 effects of scour hole slope angle fig 12 shows variations of lateral capacity ratio with scour hole slope angle when it varied from β g 0 to 42 while the scour depth remained at s d g 1 4 d e f f or 3d the upper bound of β g was limited to 42 as it should not exceed the internal friction angle of sands 43 to avoid soil failure the value of β g 0 corresponded to the case where the local scour is simplified as a general scour hole which is often used in general design practice of pile foundations under scour conditions the results yielded by the two methods showed a similar trend but an increasing deviation as the β g increased for example the discrepancy increased from 7 8 at β g 0 to 20 6 at β g 42 however compared to 3d fem results the results from the proposed method were conservative the insensitivity of the proposed method against scour hole slope angle may be primarily due to its underestimation of the vertical effective stress of soils around piles as discussed before and secondarily due to its inability to evaluate the difference of passive and active earth pressures between the perimeter piles at various β g which will be discussed later the total decrease in lateral capacity ratio with the decrease in β g was estimated to be 0 05 and 0 15 based on the proposed method and 3d fem respectively in other words the loss of lateral capacity by varying β g was only 5 and 15 which are much smaller than the loss of lateral capacity due to scour depth 63 with the proposed method and 58 with 3d fem in fig 8 this indicates that the effect of scour hole slope angle was much less noticeable than the effect of scour depth fig 12 also shows that simplifying the local scour as a general scour i e β g 0 underestimated the lateral capacity of pile group by 17 as compared with the typical local scour i e β g 26 6 fig 13 shows the load share at different pile rows varied with different scour hole slope angles from the proposed method the load share at each row did not change with the increase of β g the reason is that the post scour vertical effective stress around individual piles in the pile group was approximated by that around the center pile according to lin et al 2014 the effect of scour hole slope angle on laterally loaded single pile was less significant when the bottom scour width was greater than 3d in this research the value of s w c was 3 4 d which thus led to the calculated lateral responses less prone to the change of scour hole slope angle technically speaking the increase in scour hole slope angle would provide a higher lateral resistance to the leading row passive earth resistance and a higher active earth pressure to the back row therefore as the slope angle increased load share would increase in the leading row but decrease in the back row this effect was captured by the 3d fe analyses however it was insignificant for example the results of fe analyses in fig 13 indicate that as β g increased from 0 to 42 the load share of the leading row increased by 4 4 and the amount of lateral load increased at the leading row was equal to the amount decreased in the back row this result also reveals that the effect of change in β g on pile group effect is small therefore it is reasonable to assume that p multipliers are not affected by the changes in scour hole slope angle which confirms the third assumption for the proposed method fig 14 shows similar bending moment profiles computed by the two methods for two typical scour hole slope angles β g 0 and 26 6 which are often used in general practice this result indicates that by simply treating local scour as a general scour the maximum bending moment was underestimated by 8 15 moreover the computed location of m m a x when β g 0 was 0 9d 0 4d and 0 2d deeper in the leading row middle row and back row respectively than that when β g 26 6 overall the computed results of lateral deflections load distribution in the pile group and bending moments using the proposed method were agreeable with those from the 3d fe analyses this validates the effectiveness of the proposed method in the assessment of scour hole dimension effects on the lateral behavior of a pile group 7 3 effects of soil properties besides the scour hole dimensions scour effects on lateral responses i e lateral capacity ratio and bending moment of the pile group were further investigated in different soil properties using the proposed method and 3d fem sands of various densities φ 43 33 and 29 were considered in the 3d fe model and the specific soil properties are summarised in table 2 for the proposed method the corresponding soil properties for dense medium dense and loose sands were φ 48 35 and 26 respectively and k p y 34 mn m 3 16 3 mn m 3 and 5 4 m n m 3 respectively it should be noted that in the proposed method the parameters in dense sands were back calculated based on the pile load test data while those in medium dense and loose sands were determined by fitting the 3d fe analysis results in the pre scour conditions fig 15 depicts the relationship of lateral capacity ratio with scour depth in different sand properties it is shown that lateral capacity ratio was different between dense and loose sands and the proposed method yielded lower lateral capacity ratio than 3d fem but with similar trends as the scour depth increased from 0 to 2 8d eff scour induced lateral capacity loss in dense sands medium dense sands and loose sands was 67 61 and 57 respectively in the proposed method but 58 50 and 45 respectively in 3d fem this result demonstrates that pile groups were more sensitive to scour in denser sands similar conclusion was also found for the scoured single piles in sands of varying relative density lin and lin 2019 under the similar soil conditions and scour hole dimensions i e s d 1 5 d s w b 0 a n d β 26 6 for single piles versus s d g 1 5 d e f f s w b g 0 a n d β g 26 6 for pile groups a pile group was found to undergo greater lateral capacity losses than a single pile i e 22 32 in the pile group vs 15 18 in the single pile lin and lin 2019 in other words scour impact was more severe on pile groups than on single piles the computed lateral capacity ratios of the pile group when β g 0 and 26 6 and s d g 1 4 d e f f or 3 d are presented in table 3 it is shown that the lateral capacity ratio estimated for various sand properties in the case of β g 0 was 11 17 lower than that in the case of β g 26 6 indicating the conservatism caused by simplifying the local scour as a general scour in contrast to 3d fem the proposed method estimated much less difference of lateral capacity ratio between β g 0 and β g 26 6 i e 5 8 in various sand properties as it was less sensitive to the changes in scour hole slope angle fig 16 shows profiles of bending moment varied with properties of sands when s d g 1 4 d e f f and β g 26 6 both the proposed method and 3d fem showed the variations of maximum bending moments with different rows and sand density as the sand relative density increased the maximum bending moment in the leading middle and back row was increased by 71 68 and 57 respectively moreover the locations of m m a x in dense sands were about 2d closer to the bottom of scour hole than in loose sands 7 4 effects of pile spacing and pile numbers the effects of pile spacing on the lateral behavior of the scoured pile group in dense sands were investigated by varying the pile spacing from 2d to 6d pile spacing beyond this range is not commonly seen in practice as it would lead to either installation difficulties or high cost of construction of the pile cap the spacing of 3d or 4d is most commonplace in design and construction practice of pile groups to facilitate the analyses and comparison only a single global scour hole was considered herein even the pile spacing exceeded 4 5d fig 17 shows the relationship between lateral capacity ratio and pile spacing for the 3 by 3 pile group when s d g 1 4 d e f f or 3d and β g 0 and 26 6 although the proposed method produced less lateral capacity ratio than 3d fem the trends from both methods were consistent from the 3d fe analyses the increase in pile spacing resulted in the increase in lateral capacity loss by 3 and 9 respectively when β g 0 and 26 6 in other words pile groups of smaller pile spacing experienced less lateral capacity loss which was more obvious at β g 26 6 the discrepancy in calculated lateral capacity ratio for β g 0 and 26 6 diminished as pile spacing increased the effect of pile numbers on the lateral behavior of the scoured pile group was also examined using both the proposed method and 3d fem table 4 presents the computed lateral capacity ratio of 2 by 2 3 by 3 and 4 by 4 pile groups with pile spacing of 3d under the same scour condition s d g 1 4 d e f f β g 0 and 26 6 in dense sands overall the proposed method yielded agreeable results as compared with the 3d fem however the results calculated by the proposed method became more conservative at a larger size of pile group in the case of β g 26 6 this might be attributed to the approximation of post scour vertical effective stress around the individual piles by that around the center pile table 4 also shows that the 2 by 2 pile group underwent 6 and 16 more lateral capacity loss when β g 0 and 26 6 respectively than the 4 4 pile group based on the 3d fe analyses this result indicates that the lateral capacity loss due to local scour was more pronounced in the smaller pile group 8 conclusions this study proposes a simple and practical method to evaluate lateral behavior of a pile group under scour conditions which was developed based on the modified p y method for single piles in various scour hole geometries the proposed method was verified with the full 3d finite element analyses whose baseline model was validated against the load test of a pile group a series of parametric studies was performed through varying scour hole dimensions soil properties pile spacing and pile numbers of the pile group comparisons of the results between the proposed method and 3d finite element method showed satisfactory agreement validating the effectiveness of the proposed method the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the increase in scour depth from s d g 0 to 2 8d eff or 0 to 6d resulted in approximately 58 67 loss of lateral capacity for a 3 by 3 pile group with pile spacing of 3d as scour depth increased from 1 4 to 2 8d eff or 3 to 6d the maximum bending moment m max in the leading row middle row and back row decreased by 18 16 and 14 respectively the corresponding locations of m max also moved toward the post scour ground line with the increase in scour depth 2 at a given scour depth s d g 1 4 d e f f simplifying the local scour as a general scour i e β g 0 underestimated lateral capacity of pile groups in dense sands by 17 and m max by 8 15 as compared with when β g 26 6 the underestimates were more pronounced in dense sands than in loose sands 3 pile groups were found to be more prone to scour impact in denser sands scour induced lateral capacity loss of pile groups was 10 13 more in dense sands than that in loose sands moreover the locations of m max in dense sands were approximately 2d closer to the bottom of scour hole than in loose sands 4 pile groups tended to be more susceptible to local scour than single piles in similar soil conditions lateral capacity loss of pile groups was 22 32 when s d g 1 5 d e f f while that of single piles was 15 18 when s d 1 5 d 5 pile groups with smaller pile spacing experienced less lateral capacity loss when subjected to the same changes in scour hole dimensions a smaller pile group e g 2 by 2 pile group tended to undergo a greater lateral capacity loss than a larger pile group e g 4 by 4 pile group consequently the design of pile groups with smaller pile spacing and larger pile numbers may help alleviate the scour impact 6 a limitation of the proposed method is that the estimated results were insensitive to the changes in scour hole slope angle a further study would be warranted to improve the proposed method credit authorship contribution statement yunjie lin conceptualization software

21811,scour that removes soils around foundations supporting bridges and marine structures is the major cause for structural failures recently many studies have been conducted to investigate scour effects on lateral behavior of single piles using numerical analyses laboratory model tests or centrifuge tests however very limited research is focused on scour effects on lateral behavior of pile groups no simple method is currently available for practicing engineers to analyze pile groups under scour conditions in this study a simple and practical method was proposed based on the existing p y curve theory to facilitate the design of laterally loaded pile groups under scour conditions feasibility of the proposed method was examined against 3d finite element fe analyses through a series of parametric studies by varying scour hole dimensions soil properties and pile group configurations the results showed that the proposed method generally produced agreeable results with the 3d fe analyses scour induced lateral capacity loss of pile groups was 10 13 more in dense sands than in loose sands pile groups were more susceptible to scour than single piles under the equivalent scour

waves scour causes significant reduction in foundation capacity due to the loss of soil supports lin and lin 2019 it is reported that flood and scour related bridge failures account for approximately 60 of total bridge failures in the u s and 80 in china kan et al 1998 lagasse et al 2007 liang et al 2017 marine structures are also vulnerable to scour whitehouse 1998 therefore it is critically important to design foundations against scour damage a complete design of foundations against scour requires the integration of hydraulic geotechnical and structural analyses arneson et al 2012 scour depth due to general scour erosion across the stream or sea bed and local scour erosion around foundations is estimated based on hydraulic study at sites and engineers judgement prior to the conventional foundation design arneson et al 2012 aashto 2012 local scour caused by accelerated flow and vortex usually develops greater scour depth than the general scour which thus induces more significant capacity loss of foundations however in current pile design practice local scour that develops a scour hole around the foundation is simply considered by totally removing the top soil layer to the estimated local scour depth for convenience i e simplifying the local scour as a general scour ignoring the contribution of the remaining soils apart from the foundation according to lin et al 2014 this method leads to 49 68 higher groundline lateral displacement of single piles in sands under a typical range of lateral loads recently the importance of dimensions of local scour hole for economical foundation design has been recognized numerous research has been conducted to investigate the effects of scour hole dimensions on lateral responses of single piles chortis et al 2020 qi et al 2016 liang et al 2018 lin et al 2016 in which the scour hole is idealized as an inverted truncated cone with dimensions of scour depth s d bottom scour width s w b and scour hole slope angle β lin and lin 2019 lin et al 2014 investigated the effects of local scour on a laterally loaded steel pipe pile in dense sands φ 39 using three dimensional finite difference method a wide range of scour hole dimensions s d 0 8 d s w b 0 18 d and β 0 39 where d pile diameter were evaluated in their research it was found that an increase in scour depth significantly increased pile lateral displacement and maximum bending moment effects of scour width and scour hole slope angle were relatively less significant especially when s w b 8 d lin and lin 2019 further studied the problem by varying soil properties from dense sands φ 39 medium dense sands φ 33 to loose sands φ 29 using commercial 3d finite element fe software plaxis 3d they concluded that the loss of pile lateral capacity due to scour was approximately 10 more in dense sands than that in loose sands in addition to 3d numerical simulations a simple and practical method was also developed for analysis of laterally loaded single piles under local scour conditions lin et al 2014 lin and wu 2019 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 this method known as modified p y method was developed by modifying the ultimate soil resistance p u l t based on either wedge failure model or derivation of soil vertical effective stress around piles after scour it enables the engineers to incorporate the effect of various scour hole dimensions into the routine design of piles in practice piles are more commonly installed in groups and the behavior of pile groups is more complex than that of single piles especially under lateral loads reese and van impe 2001 as compared with single isolated piles piles in a closely spaced pile group undergo a significant reduction in lateral capacity in both sands and clays ashour and ardalan 2011 brown et al 1988 fayyazi et al 2014 mcvay et al 1995 rollins et al 1998 2005 this phenomenon termed as group effect is due to the overlapped soil reaction zones between neighbouring piles similarly there is also a group effect regarding the scour potential for a pile group that is scour extent around individual piles in a pile group would be intensified as compared with that around single isolated piles due to the increased flow velocity and the turbulence between piles in the pile group such a double group effect is anticipated to impose a more severe scour consequence for pile groups than single piles however to the best of authors knowledge there is no study available concerning the scour effects on lateral responses of pile groups furthermore although there exist modified p y methods for analysis of single piles under local scour no such a simple and practical method is available for analyzing laterally loaded pile groups under scour conditions this study aims to propose a simple and practical method for analyzing laterally loaded pile groups in sands under scour conditions this method was developed based on the modified p y method for scoured single piles lin and lin 2019 a matlab program was developed to implement the proposed method the computed results were compared with those from 3d finite element fe analyses in a series of parametric studies to ensure its validity this paper starts with a summary of the existing research on the pile group effect and the scour hole dimensions for a pile group followed by development of the proposed method the 3d fe analyses were carried out to verify the proposed method through a series of parametric analyses considering the effects of scour depth scour hole slope angle soil properties and pile group configurations the results that are relevant to the design of laterally loaded pile groups under scour conditions are discussed 2 review of pile group effects pile groups under lateral loading develop a group effect because of the shared shear zones of soils between neighbouring piles the group effect may consist of shallowing effect due to overlapped soil reaction zones between piles in different pile rows and edge effect due to overlapped soil reaction zones between piles in the same pile row brown et al 1988 fayyazi et al 2012 rollins et al 1998 based on the full scale load tests on a 3 3 free head pile group with the spacing of 3 d in dense sands brown et al 1988 found that leading row middle row and back row illustrated in fig 1 a carried significantly different percentages of the total load i e 45 32 and 23 respectively this demonstrates that soils surrounding different pile rows were disturbed in various degrees indicating the shallowing effect mcvay et al 1995 investigated the shadowing effect through centrifuge tests on 3 d and 5 d spaced free head pile groups 3 3 in both medium dense sands d r 55 and medium loose sands d r 33 their tests showed that larger spaced pile groups showed less shadowing effect based on both studies of brown et al 1988 and mcvay et al 1995 the shallowing effect tended to be less noticeable in looser sands in addition to cohesionless soils rollins et al 1998 tested the lateral behavior of a free head 3 3 pile group s 3 d in soft to medium stiff clays piles in the pile group underwent twice the lateral displacement and 50 100 more maximum bending moment than the corresponding single isolated piles piles in the same row were found to respond differently to the lateral load i e edge effect exterior piles in the same row were found to carry more lateral load and experience larger bending moment than interior piles probably because of less overlapped shear zones at the exterior piles than at the interior piles similar observations were also obtained in 3d numerical simulations and centrifuge tests fayyazi et al 2012 ilyas et al 2004 to analyze the pile group effect the method of p multiplier was proposed by brown et al 1988 which is widely accepted in practice the p multiplier method includes applying a reduction factor i e p multiplier f m to the p y curves for a single pile for analysis of pile groups under lateral loads fig 2 brown et al 1988 reese and van impe 2001 in general the value of f m varies with pile spacing pile location in the pile group soil properties and pile head conditions ashour and ardalan 2011 brown et al 1988 fayyazi et al 2012 2014 the f m is normally back calculated from the full scale tests centrifuge tests or full 3d numerical simulations brown et al 1988 ilyas et al 2004 in the absence of field test data for back calculation p multipliers may also be obtained using an empirical correlation with pile spacing mokwa et al 2000 or simply taken to be 0 6 as often used in practice it should be mentioned that edge effect is often neglected as it is relatively insignificant compared with the shadowing effect therefore as will be discussed the edge effect is not considered in this research 3 review of scour hole dimensions for pile groups the dimensions of scour hole developed around pile groups depend not only on flow conditions and soil properties but also on pile group configurations amini et al 2012 lança et al 2013 liang et al 2017 sumer et al 2005 based on the tests at six pile groups s 2 3 5 d where s pile spacing sumer et al 2005 found that the scour around the large spaced pile group s 5 d developed pits around individual piles plus a big saucer shaped depression around the pile group the depression is called global scour for the small spaced pile groups s 2 d or 3 d individual pits overlapped with each other in a series of laboratory tests on 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 pile groups s 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 d lança et al 2013 observed that when pile spacing was small i e s 3 d individual pits were fully interconnected forming only a global scour hole around the pile group when the pile spacing was increased to s 4 5 d although the individual pits were partially interconnected the global scour hole still dominated the overall shape of scour hole when the pile spacing was further increased to s 6 d the individual pits were fully disconnected in a field survey made at ajigaura beach in japan bayram and larson 2000 a large single global scour hole was also observed around several pile groups with the pile spacing of s 4 5 d since a pile group is commonly designed with the spacing of 3d or 4d in general practice a single global scour hole can be reasonably used to represent the local scour around a pile group while the individual pits can be ignored amini et al 2012 presented several photographs of scour holes generated around 3 5 pile groups s 1 2 3 5 and 5 d during the flume tests showing the rounded square shape of the scour holes therefore in the 3d fe analyses scour hole around pile groups may be modelled as an inverted rounded square pyramid frustum with dimensions illustrated in fig 1 a similar to scour around single piles scour depth s d g bottom scour width s w b g and scour hole slope angle β g are used to describe the dimensions of the scour hole around a pile group as with the expression of scour depth for single piles scour depth around pile groups is commonly normalized to the pile diameter for convenience however different from that for single piles scour depth developed at pile groups is dependent on pile group configuration lin and lin 2019 to reflect the effect of pile group configuration the scour depth may be better normalized to effective diameter of pile group the effective diameter of a pile group d e f f is essentially the diameter of an equivalent single pile that can develop the same local scour depth as the pile group under the same flow conditions sheppard 2003 therefore scour depth around the pile group after normalized to the effective diameter i e s d g d e f f is comparable to scour depth around the single pile that is normalized to the pile diameter i e s d d in other words if both ratios are equal the extents of scour are equivalent between pile groups and singe piles the calculation of the effective diameter is briefly described below while the details can be found in sheppard 2003 1 d e f f w p k s p k h k r 2 k s p 1 4 3 1 w p i w p 1 1 s d 0 6 in eqs 1 and 2 w p is the sum of the non overlapped projected widths of piles in the first column and the first two rows onto the

diameter and effective diameter of pile group in the table specific flow and soil properties are not given as the motivation in this study is to obtain the typical range of scour depth around pile groups from table 1 scour depth around pile group ranges from 0 86 to 2 63 d e f f with an average value of 1 68 0 16 d e f f in marine foundation design scour depth around single piles is normally suggested to be s d 1 5 d api 2011 this is comparable to s d g 1 68 d e f f summarised here for pile groups in other words it may be suitable to consider s d g 1 5 2 0 d e f f for the design of pile group under local scour conditions compared with the scour depth the typical ranges of the bottom scour width and scour hole slope angle at pile group are still not well studied consequently the typical values of bottom scour width and scour hole slope angle around single piles may be used for pile groups in absence of specific measurement data i e s w b g 0 lin and wu 2019 and β g 0 12 to φ 1 butch 1996 lin and lin 2019 4 proposed method considering both scour effects and pile group effects lin and lin 2019 proposed an analytical solution for laterally loaded single piles considering different scour hole dimensions this method known as modified p y method is essentially modifying the ultimate soil resistance p u l t in p y curves based on the estimation of soil vertical effective stress around piles in post scour conditions using the boussinesq point load solution the analytical solution was compared with the 3d fe analyses showing satisfactory estimates of pile lateral capacity and bending moment however this method is only applicable to the analyses of single piles 4 1 development in this research a simple and practical method is proposed for laterally loaded pile groups under local scour conditions by combining the modified p y method lin and lin 2019 and p multiplier f m brown et al 1988 several assumptions are necessary to develop this proposed method 1 soil vertical effective stress around individual piles within the pile group is assumed equal to that surrounding the center pile e g the pile located in the middle row and middle column in fig 1 a 2 in deriving vertical effective stress around the center pile of the pile group scour hole is simply approximated as an inverted truncated cone fig 1 b having the same scour depth and scour hole slope angle as well as the same bottom area of the scour hole as the inverted rounded square pyramid frustum fig 1 a the inverted truncated cone is only used for derivation of post scour vertical effective stress as it helps to ease the derivation and to draw on the modified p y method for single piles developed by lin and lin 2019 3 p multipliers f m are assumed unchanged by scour i e the values remain the same before and after scour 4 bottom scour width around the pile group is assumed to be zero s w b g 0 assumptions 1 and 3 are made based on the observations of the 3d fe analysis results as will be discussed later the key of the proposed method is to determine an equivalent depth z e below the post scour ground line eq 6 which is dependent on the post scour vertical effective stress eq 7 by substituting z e for z in the original reese s p y curve equations for sands reese and van impe 2001 the p y curves are modified to consider different scour hole dimensions around pile groups eqs 8 12 to consider the group effect the curves need to be further modified by multiplying them with f m as presented in eq 8 the equivalent depth is calculated as 6 z e σ v a γ s following the first and second assumptions the vertical effective stress around individual piles in the pile group σ v a is equal to that around the center pile of the pile group therefore the equation of lin and lin 2019 that was derived for scour hole around single isolated piles can be extended to the pile group by substituting s w b in the original equation with s w c 7 σ v a δ σ v γ s z γ s z 1 t a n β g s d g t a n β g s w c s d g t a n β g s w c 2 z 2 s w c s w c 2 z 2 in eq 7 s d g and β g are the scour depth and sour hole slope angle for the pile group respectively s w c is the distance between the toe of the inverted truncated cone and the side of the center pile fig 1 b i e s w c a b g π d 2 where a b g is the bottom area of the scour hole once z e is determined in eqs 6 and 7 the new suite of p y curves modified for scoured pile groups can be developed by using z e in conjunction with f m as given in eqs 8 12 8 p k p y z e y f m y y k c f m y 1 n y k y y m p m p m p u y u y m y y m f m y m y y u f m p u y y u in eq 8 values of k p y depend on the properties of sands reese and van impe 2001 the displacements of y m and y u are d 60 and 3d 80 respectively while the other coefficients y k c n p m and p u are determined in eqs 9 12 9 p u a s p u l t 10 p m b s p u l t 11 p u l t c 1 z e c 2 d γ s z e c 3 d γ s z e m i n where c 1 tan θ 2 tan α tan θ φ k o tan φ sin θ tan θ φ cos α tan θ tan

for determining coefficients in modified reese s p y curves can be found in lin and lin 2019 in eq 8 y k is determined by 12 y k c k p y z e n n 1 where c p m y m 1 n n p m m y m and m p u p m y u y m overall once scour hole dimensions are known post scour vertical effective stress σ v a around individual piles within the pile group may be estimated using eq 7 once soil properties e g k py φ and p multiplier f m are available utilizing eqs 6 8 to 12 a series of modified p y curves considering both scour hole dimensions and pile group effect can be generated normally k p y and φ can be back calculated from field test on a single pile while f m from field test on a pile group in the absence of field test data for back calculation k p y and φ may be estimated based on the empirical correlations with the data of in situ tests while f m can also be estimated using empirical correlations as discussed previously in section 2 4 2 implementation the proposed method is essentially the modification of the p y curves for sands to account for various scour hole dimensions and pile group effects the modified p y curves are incorporated to the euler bernoulli beam equation with which the lateral responses of a pile group under various scour hole dimensions can be calculated to solve the nonlinear fourth order beam equation a finite difference algorithm with newton s iteration was developed and implemented in matlab 5 3d finite element analysis a series of 3d fe analyses was performed using plaxis 3d to verify the proposed method prior to the verification a baseline fe model was established for a no scour or pre scour case utilizing the published data from the full scale load test brown et al 1988 the baseline model was then scoured to form a scour hole around the pile group the effects of various scour hole dimensions were then evaluated using the 3d fe analyses and the proposed method moreover the dependence of lateral responses of scoured pile groups on soil properties pile spacing and pile numbers was also investigated 5 1 baseline fe model the lateral load tests for single pile and pile group performed on the campus of university of houston brown et al 1988 were used to establish the baseline fe model in no scour condition the load test results for single pile were used to back calculate the soil parameters such as frictional angle and elastic modulus while the load test results for pile group were used to validate the baseline fe model table 2 shows the properties of steel pipe piles used in the test the piles were arranged in a 3 by 3 group with the pile spacing approximately equal to 3d typical values of poisson s ratio and elastic modulus for steel were used for the test piles as listed in table 2 the soils underlain the site consisted of a 2 9 m compacted and submerged dense sand layer underlain by natural stiff clays since the depth of sands exceeded 10 times pile diameter the lateral behavior of piles was dominated by the sand properties therefore piles were assumed to be embedded in a single sand layer brown et al 1988 soil properties of friction angle and elastic modulus dense sand in table 2 were back calculated by fitting the fe analyses for the single pile to the measured field test data fig 4 a the internal friction angle of sands was measured to be 38 5 based on the direct shear test and was approximately 30 to 45 when correlated with the data from standard penetration test spt brown et al 1988 as seen in table 2 the backed calculated friction angle from pile load test fell in the range of spt correlated values soil dilation angles were determined by ψ φ 30 brinkgreve et al 2016 effective unit weight was calculated using a typical specific gravity value for sands g s 2 65 in the 3d fe baseline model for pile group shown in fig 5 a soils were modelled as an elastic perfectly plastic material with the mohr coulomb as a failure criterion groundwater table was set at the ground surface the pipe piles were simulated as an equivalent solid pile with the same outer diameter d pile length l and flexural stiffness ei using linear elastic stress strain relation it should be noted that to measure the bending moment of the test piles in the load tests a small steel tube with outer diameter of 16 8 cm and thickness of 1 6 cm was inserted inside the test pile with the gap between the tube and the interior wall of the test pile being grouted brown et al 1988 thus contributions of grout and small steel tube to the overall flexural stiffness were considered by using typical material properties for the tube and grout i e e t 2 02 10 8 kpa ν t 0 3 e g 2 2 10 7 kpa ν g 0 3 in the field test piles in the pile group were pin connected to a frame which allowed the pile head to rotate freely and the pile head was located 0 305 m above the ground surface therefore a free head condition was simulated interactions between soils and piles were simulated with interface elements which were composed of node pairs two elastic perfectly plastic springs were applied to each pair of nodes to model the gap displacement and slip displacement respectively brinkgreve et al 2016 the strength reduction factor r i n t e r of 0 7 was specified to account for the roughness of interfaces based on the types of soils and structures brinkgreve and shen 2011 the pile group was laterally loaded with a prescribed incremental displacement of 6 35 mm 0 25 inch at the pile head until the total lateral displacement reached 38 1 mm 1 5 inches in plaxis 3d the geometry of finite elements is restricted to 10 node tetrahedron leading to difficulties in computing bending moments using the direct integration of normal stress over the cross section of pile lin and lin 2019 consequently a special massless structural beam dummy beam was inserted to the pile to assist with the calculation of bending moments the dummy beam has the same diameter as the test pile but a negligible modulus equal to 10 6 times that of the equivalent solid piles the bending moment of the test pile was then determined by multiplying the bending moment of the dummy beam by 10 6 dao 2011 the default meshing function in plaxis 3d i e medium dense was used to create a mesh in the 3d fe model where the pile elements along the pile length and the soil elements in the upper 4 88 m were refined using a coarseness factor of 0 1 and 0 6 respectively overall more than 150 000 elements were generated in the 3d fe model for pile group analyses the boundaries of the model were set sufficiently far from the pile group to avoid the boundary effects on the numerical modelling in this research the horizontal boundaries were set at a distance of 60d parallel to the horizontal loads and 40d perpendicular to the horizontal loads from the center of the pile group while the vertical boundary was located 10d below the pile toe the results of lateral displacement at pile head and lateral responses along pile shaft from the baseline fe model are presented in figs 4 b and fig 6 respectively fig 4 b indicates that as compared with the field test data the baseline fe model produced agreeable but slightly conservative results especially for the leading row in other words 3d fe model overestimated the shadowing effect behind the leading row fig 6 shows the calculated bending moment for a single isolated pile and the averaged value for each row in the pile group overall the computed bending moments were in agreement with the measured data the baseline fe model also predicted well the maximum bending moment and the locations of maximum bending moment at different rows overall the above comparison to field test data validates the baseline fe model 6 simulation of scour hole and parametric analyses the validated baseline fe model was used to simulate the lateral behavior of pile group under various scour hole conditions for the proposed method the input values of k p y and φ were back calculated from the load tests for single pile and f m was back calculated from the load test for pile group the p y method was used for the back calculation see fig 4 a and b the back calculated k p y was 34 mn m 3 the back calculated φ was 48 which is higher than the 3d fe back calculated i e 43 in table 2 the φ back calculated from the p y method could be different from that from the 3d fe method fem due to the different constitutive relationships and numerical solutions used in these two methods the back calculated f m for the leading row middle row and back row was 0 8 0 4 and 0 25 respectively fig 6 shows the relatively good comparison of bending moment profiles between p y method and the field measurement note that the proposed method is reduced to the p y method for pile group in no scour or pre scour conditions therefore results from fig 6 confirm that the proposed method is competent for evaluation for pile group effects while its feasibility to evaluate effects of scour hole dimensions need to be further verified by the 3d fe model scour hole around a pile group was simulated as an inverted rounded square pyramid frustum with 3d fem illustrated in fig 1 a and as an equivalent inverted truncated cone with the proposed method shown in fig 1 b fig 5 indicates the distribution of vertical effective stress in both pre scour and post scour condition it is shown that vertical effective stress beneath the scour hole is reduced due to the removal of soils moreover variation of vertical effective stress between piles was small which confirms the first assumption of the proposed method the dimensions of a scour hole were defined by scour depth s d g scour bottom width s w b g and scour hole slope angle β g to investigate the effects of scour hole dimensions on lateral responses of pile group in both 3d fem and the proposed method s d g was varied from 0 0 7d eff 1 4d eff 2 1d eff to 2 8d eff which corresponded to 0 1 5d 3d 4 5d to 6d the s w b g was set to 0 and β g varied from 0 12 to φ 1 where φ is soil friction angle note that the scour hole slope angle should not be set equal to or greater than the internal friction angle of soils to avoid soil failure in addition to varying scour hole dimensions the effects of various soil properties pile spacing and pile number on the scour susceptibility of pile groups were also investigated by using both 3d fem and the proposed method for the variation of soil properties besides the dense sands from the test site medium dense and loose sands were added for consideration typical values of internal friction angle and elastic modulus table 2 were assumed for the medium dense and loose sands kulhawy and mayne 1990 for the effect of pile spacing a 3 by 3 pile group with the pile spacing varied from 2d 3d 4d 5d to 6d was evaluated for the pile number effect three groups of 2 by 2 3 by 3 and 4 by 4 with the same pile spacing of 3d were investigated 7 results and discussion results from the proposed method and 3d fem included lateral capacity ratio bending moment profiles and load distribution of piles within the pile group the pile lateral capacity is defined as an applied lateral load yielding 25 mm lateral displacement at the head of the pile group lin and wu 2019 instead of directly using lateral capacity the lateral capacity ratio which is a ratio of lateral capacity of pile group after scour to that before scour is presented in this research to better indicate the loss of pile lateral capacity due to scour lin and lin 2019 the bending moment is presented as the averaged value in each row of pile group 7 1 effects of scour depth fig 7 presents the averaged load displacement curves of 3 3 pile group s 3 d under various scour depth s d g 0 to 2 8 d e f f or 0 to 6 d while s w b g 0 and β g 26 6 the averaged load of pile group is calculated by dividing the total lateral load of the pile group by the number of piles the proposed method and 3d fem resulted in reasonably agreeable results as discussed in the baseline model verification 3d fem overestimated the shadowing effect shown in fig 4 b especially in the leading row therefore the calculated averaged load was relatively smaller than that from the proposed method in the pre scour condition however the opposite results were observed as scour depth increased as seen in fig 7 this change may be explained by that as with the modified p y method for scoured single pile lin and lin 2019 the proposed method herein also failed to account for the soil pile interface friction that could potentially reduce the scour induced release of vertical stress of soils surrounding piles in other words the proposed method underestimated the vertical effective stress of soils around piles leading to a lower estimated lateral resistance to piles than the 3d fem this effect can be more pronounced in group piles than in single piles due to the pile group effects fig 8 presents variations of lateral capacity ratios with scour depth computed by the proposed method and 3d fem showing good agreement as the scour depth increased from 0 to 2 8d eff 0 to 6d the lateral capacity ratio was decreased from 1 to 0 42 according to the 3d fe analyses meaning 58 loss of lateral capacity of the pile group as compared with 3d fem the proposed method underestimated the lateral capacity ratio by 12 22 such an underestimate was also found in single piles but less significant i e 10 18 lin and lin 2019 as discussed above this is attributed to the under estimated post scour vertical effective stress of soils around piles by the proposed method which is amplified in pile group analysis fig 8 also indicates that when s d g 1 5 d e f f s w b g 0 and β g 26 6 the lateral capacity ratio was calculated to be 0 52 and 0 68 by the proposed method and 3d fem respectively these numbers were lower than those estimated using the modified p y method and 3d fem for single piles 0 73 and 0 82 respectively in similarly dense sands φ 39 and equivalent scour conditions s d 1 5 d s w b 0 and β 26 6 lin and lin 2019 this comparison demonstrates that the scour induced lateral capacity loss was more severe in pile groups than in single piles fig 9 shows the load distribution within the pile group varied with scour depth two methods predicted agreeable load share at different pile rows it is shown that leading row carried the largest lateral load as the surrounding soils were least disturbed as scour depth increased from 0 to 2 8d eff 0 to 6d only slight variations in load distribution were observed in both the proposed method and 3d fem in which the load share decreased by 2 4 in the leading row increased by 2 5 in the back row while remained unchanged in the middle row this result indicates that variation of scour depth had a negligible effect on the pile group effect therefore it would be reasonable to assume that p multipliers are not changed by the increase in scour depth this is consistent to the third assumption made for the proposed method fig 10 depicts the profiles of averaged bending moment of each row at two different scour depths s d 1 4 d e f f and 2 8 d e f f when the pile group was subjected to a lateral pile head displacement of 25 mm bending moment profiles obtained by the proposed method and 3d fem match well as with the results in the pre scour conditions in fig 6 the leading row had the largest bending moment than the other rows in the post scour conditions the 3d fe analyses show that as scour depth increased from 1 4 to 2 8 d eff 3 to 6d the maximum bending moment decreased by 18 16 and 14 in the leading row middle row and back row respectively and the corresponding locations moved toward a deeper depth by about 2 2d 2 0d and 1 6d respectively similar change in maximum bending moment and corresponding location were also captured by the proposed method this result indicates that the change in the location of maximum bending moment did not keep up with the increase in scour depth i e 3d which agreed with the findings for the scoured single piles lin and lin 2019 in other words as scour depth increased the locations of m m a x would move toward the post scour ground line with the location in the back and middle rows being closer to the post scour ground line than in the leading row fig 11 shows contours of horizontal displacement and effective stress of soils in both pre scour and post scour conditions when the top of the pile group was mobilized laterally by one inch 25 mm displacement and stress distributions show that the pile group under the scoured condition developed smaller passive influence zone than under the pre scour condition this may be attributed to that at the same lateral deflection at pile head less lateral displacement was applied to the ground in the post scour condition than in the pre scour condition as the cantilever portion of pile group was increased by scour fig 11 b indicates that in the post scour condition the lateral movement of soils on the passive side was restrained by the unscoured overburden away from the piles showing a prograde pattern this is in contrast to the wedge pattern on the passive side in the pre scour condition in fig 11 a fig 11 a and b also indicate that pre scour and post scour soil displacement fields within the pile group and on the active side were in a similar pattern fig 11 c and d indicate that although the area of soil reactions was different the distribution of soil reactions exhibited similar patterns before and after scour this may explain why similar load share was observed under various scour depths in fig 9 7 2 effects of scour hole slope angle fig 12 shows variations of lateral capacity ratio with scour hole slope angle when it varied from β g 0 to 42 while the scour depth remained at s d g 1 4 d e f f or 3d the upper bound of β g was limited to 42 as it should not exceed the internal friction angle of sands 43 to avoid soil failure the value of β g 0 corresponded to the case where the local scour is simplified as a general scour hole which is often used in general design practice of pile foundations under scour conditions the results yielded by the two methods showed a similar trend but an increasing deviation as the β g increased for example the discrepancy increased from 7 8 at β g 0 to 20 6 at β g 42 however compared to 3d fem results the results from the proposed method were conservative the insensitivity of the proposed method against scour hole slope angle may be primarily due to its underestimation of the vertical effective stress of soils around piles as discussed before and secondarily due to its inability to evaluate the difference of passive and active earth pressures between the perimeter piles at various β g which will be discussed later the total decrease in lateral capacity ratio with the decrease in β g was estimated to be 0 05 and 0 15 based on the proposed method and 3d fem respectively in other words the loss of lateral capacity by varying β g was only 5 and 15 which are much smaller than the loss of lateral capacity due to scour depth 63 with the proposed method and 58 with 3d fem in fig 8 this indicates that the effect of scour hole slope angle was much less noticeable than the effect of scour depth fig 12 also shows that simplifying the local scour as a general scour i e β g 0 underestimated the lateral capacity of pile group by 17 as compared with the typical local scour i e β g 26 6 fig 13 shows the load share at different pile rows varied with different scour hole slope angles from the proposed method the load share at each row did not change with the increase of β g the reason is that the post scour vertical effective stress around individual piles in the pile group was approximated by that around the center pile according to lin et al 2014 the effect of scour hole slope angle on laterally loaded single pile was less significant when the bottom scour width was greater than 3d in this research the value of s w c was 3 4 d which thus led to the calculated lateral responses less prone to the change of scour hole slope angle technically speaking the increase in scour hole slope angle would provide a higher lateral resistance to the leading row passive earth resistance and a higher active earth pressure to the back row therefore as the slope angle increased load share would increase in the leading row but decrease in the back row this effect was captured by the 3d fe analyses however it was insignificant for example the results of fe analyses in fig 13 indicate that as β g increased from 0 to 42 the load share of the leading row increased by 4 4 and the amount of lateral load increased at the leading row was equal to the amount decreased in the back row this result also reveals that the effect of change in β g on pile group effect is small therefore it is reasonable to assume that p multipliers are not affected by the changes in scour hole slope angle which confirms the third assumption for the proposed method fig 14 shows similar bending moment profiles computed by the two methods for two typical scour hole slope angles β g 0 and 26 6 which are often used in general practice this result indicates that by simply treating local scour as a general scour the maximum bending moment was underestimated by 8 15 moreover the computed location of m m a x when β g 0 was 0 9d 0 4d and 0 2d deeper in the leading row middle row and back row respectively than that when β g 26 6 overall the computed results of lateral deflections load distribution in the pile group and bending moments using the proposed method were agreeable with those from the 3d fe analyses this validates the effectiveness of the proposed method in the assessment of scour hole dimension effects on the lateral behavior of a pile group 7 3 effects of soil properties besides the scour hole dimensions scour effects on lateral responses i e lateral capacity ratio and bending moment of the pile group were further investigated in different soil properties using the proposed method and 3d fem sands of various densities φ 43 33 and 29 were considered in the 3d fe model and the specific soil properties are summarised in table 2 for the proposed method the corresponding soil properties for dense medium dense and loose sands were φ 48 35 and 26 respectively and k p y 34 mn m 3 16 3 mn m 3 and 5 4 m n m 3 respectively it should be noted that in the proposed method the parameters in dense sands were back calculated based on the pile load test data while those in medium dense and loose sands were determined by fitting the 3d fe analysis results in the pre scour conditions fig 15 depicts the relationship of lateral capacity ratio with scour depth in different sand properties it is shown that lateral capacity ratio was different between dense and loose sands and the proposed method yielded lower lateral capacity ratio than 3d fem but with similar trends as the scour depth increased from 0 to 2 8d eff scour induced lateral capacity loss in dense sands medium dense sands and loose sands was 67 61 and 57 respectively in the proposed method but 58 50 and 45 respectively in 3d fem this result demonstrates that pile groups were more sensitive to scour in denser sands similar conclusion was also found for the scoured single piles in sands of varying relative density lin and lin 2019 under the similar soil conditions and scour hole dimensions i e s d 1 5 d s w b 0 a n d β 26 6 for single piles versus s d g 1 5 d e f f s w b g 0 a n d β g 26 6 for pile groups a pile group was found to undergo greater lateral capacity losses than a single pile i e 22 32 in the pile group vs 15 18 in the single pile lin and lin 2019 in other words scour impact was more severe on pile groups than on single piles the computed lateral capacity ratios of the pile group when β g 0 and 26 6 and s d g 1 4 d e f f or 3 d are presented in table 3 it is shown that the lateral capacity ratio estimated for various sand properties in the case of β g 0 was 11 17 lower than that in the case of β g 26 6 indicating the conservatism caused by simplifying the local scour as a general scour in contrast to 3d fem the proposed method estimated much less difference of lateral capacity ratio between β g 0 and β g 26 6 i e 5 8 in various sand properties as it was less sensitive to the changes in scour hole slope angle fig 16 shows profiles of bending moment varied with properties of sands when s d g 1 4 d e f f and β g 26 6 both the proposed method and 3d fem showed the variations of maximum bending moments with different rows and sand density as the sand relative density increased the maximum bending moment in the leading middle and back row was increased by 71 68 and 57 respectively moreover the locations of m m a x in dense sands were about 2d closer to the bottom of scour hole than in loose sands 7 4 effects of pile spacing and pile numbers the effects of pile spacing on the lateral behavior of the scoured pile group in dense sands were investigated by varying the pile spacing from 2d to 6d pile spacing beyond this range is not commonly seen in practice as it would lead to either installation difficulties or high cost of construction of the pile cap the spacing of 3d or 4d is most commonplace in design and construction practice of pile groups to facilitate the analyses and comparison only a single global scour hole was considered herein even the pile spacing exceeded 4 5d fig 17 shows the relationship between lateral capacity ratio and pile spacing for the 3 by 3 pile group when s d g 1 4 d e f f or 3d and β g 0 and 26 6 although the proposed method produced less lateral capacity ratio than 3d fem the trends from both methods were consistent from the 3d fe analyses the increase in pile spacing resulted in the increase in lateral capacity loss by 3 and 9 respectively when β g 0 and 26 6 in other words pile groups of smaller pile spacing experienced less lateral capacity loss which was more obvious at β g 26 6 the discrepancy in calculated lateral capacity ratio for β g 0 and 26 6 diminished as pile spacing increased the effect of pile numbers on the lateral behavior of the scoured pile group was also examined using both the proposed method and 3d fem table 4 presents the computed lateral capacity ratio of 2 by 2 3 by 3 and 4 by 4 pile groups with pile spacing of 3d under the same scour condition s d g 1 4 d e f f β g 0 and 26 6 in dense sands overall the proposed method yielded agreeable results as compared with the 3d fem however the results calculated by the proposed method became more conservative at a larger size of pile group in the case of β g 26 6 this might be attributed to the approximation of post scour vertical effective stress around the individual piles by that around the center pile table 4 also shows that the 2 by 2 pile group underwent 6 and 16 more lateral capacity loss when β g 0 and 26 6 respectively than the 4 4 pile group based on the 3d fe analyses this result indicates that the lateral capacity loss due to local scour was more pronounced in the smaller pile group 8 conclusions this study proposes a simple and practical method to evaluate lateral behavior of a pile group under scour conditions which was developed based on the modified p y method for single piles in various scour hole geometries the proposed method was verified with the full 3d finite element analyses whose baseline model was validated against the load test of a pile group a series of parametric studies was performed through varying scour hole dimensions soil properties pile spacing and pile numbers of the pile group comparisons of the results between the proposed method and 3d finite element method showed satisfactory agreement validating the effectiveness of the proposed method the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the increase in scour depth from s d g 0 to 2 8d eff or 0 to 6d resulted in approximately 58 67 loss of lateral capacity for a 3 by 3 pile group with pile spacing of 3d as scour depth increased from 1 4 to 2 8d eff or 3 to 6d the maximum bending moment m max in the leading row middle row and back row decreased by 18 16 and 14 respectively the corresponding locations of m max also moved toward the post scour ground line with the increase in scour depth 2 at a given scour depth s d g 1 4 d e f f simplifying the local scour as a general scour i e β g 0 underestimated lateral capacity of pile groups in dense sands by 17 and m max by 8 15 as compared with when β g 26 6 the underestimates were more pronounced in dense sands than in loose sands 3 pile groups were found to be more prone to scour impact in denser sands scour induced lateral capacity loss of pile groups was 10 13 more in dense sands than that in loose sands moreover the locations of m max in dense sands were approximately 2d closer to the bottom of scour hole than in loose sands 4 pile groups tended to be more susceptible to local scour than single piles in similar soil conditions lateral capacity loss of pile groups was 22 32 when s d g 1 5 d e f f while that of single piles was 15 18 when s d 1 5 d 5 pile groups with smaller pile spacing experienced less lateral capacity loss when subjected to the same changes in scour hole dimensions a smaller pile group e g 2 by 2 pile group tended to undergo a greater lateral capacity loss than a larger pile group e g 4 by 4 pile group consequently the design of pile groups with smaller pile spacing and larger pile numbers may help alleviate the scour impact 6 a limitation of the proposed method is that the estimated results were insensitive to the changes in scour hole slope angle a further study would be warranted to improve the proposed method credit authorship contribution statement yunjie lin conceptualization software

21812,the low frequency 1 400 1 30 hz oscillations within the hambantota port sri lanka are investigated based on the in situ measured water surface elevations in and outside the harbor by combining analyses of spectra derived from the in situ measurement and modal analyses solving the extended mild slope equation four natural frequencies of the port are identified and their modal structures are obtained it is found that the low frequency oscillations within the port were dominated by its natural frequencies i e the eigen oscillations instead of the frequencies of external waves subsequently the correlation analysis is carried out to determine the generation of the low frequency oscillations although both the offshore low frequency and short waves contributed to the low frequency oscillations the low frequency energy spectrum within the port is found to be more significantly correlated with the offshore total low frequency wave energy than with the offshore total short wave energy moreover the empirical formula and artificial neural network models are presented to efficiently estimate the low frequency waves inside the harbor in terms of the offshore wave parameters although both methods give excellent results the artificial neural network performs slightly better keywords hambantota port low frequency oscillations north indian ocean southwest monsoon modal analysis 1 introduction long waves with periods greater than tens of seconds can be trapped and significantly amplified within a harbor thereby resulting in detrimental effects on port operations rabinovich 2009 this phenomenon is referred to as harbor resonance or coastal oscillations the natural periods of a harbor depend on its layout and bathymetry in general the natural periods range from o 100 s for a small harbor to o 1000 s for a large harbor owing to the broad and continuous frequency distribution of the energy of oceanic waves munk 1949 resonance could occur in many harbors of different sizes such as rotterdam harbor in the netherlands de jong and battjes 2004 hualian harbor in taiwan maa et al 2011 marina di carrara in italy bellotti and franco 2011 guerrini et al 2014 pohang new harbor in south korea kumar et al 2016 and paradip port in odisha india kumar and gulshan 2017 2018 moreover when the periods of wave motion are in the same range as the natural periods of ships severe negative response of ships will occur resulting in damage on mooring ships and mooring systems sakakibara and kubo 2008 a reasonable design or modification of harbor configurations can minimize the negative effect of harbor oscillations for studies consisting of harbor resonance improvements refer to lee and xing 2009 kumar et al 2014 therefore a better understanding of harbor oscillations is of practical significance analytical solutions play an essential role in understanding the general characteristics of harbor oscillations e g mei and ünlüata 1976 wang et al 2011a wang

al 2019 its main advantage is that almost all physical phenomena such as refraction diffraction reflection and wave breaking can be reproduced however it sometimes suffers from the limited model scale the capability of equipment and instruments etc with the advantage of no prior assumptions on the harbor resonance physics field observation is perhaps the more common approach to investigate coastal oscillations and it has been used extensively e g okihiro and guza 1996 bellotti and franco 2011 lopez et al 2012 kumar et al 2014 thotagamuwage and pattiaratchi 2014 moreover in general the physical modeling and field observation cost expensively the hambantota port built in 2017 is located in the southeast of sri lanka directly facing the north indian ocean see fig 1 it is the major seaport in sri lanka and plays a vital role in international routes between asia and europe from the feedback of the port operator unloading operations were disrupted due to the unexpected severe movements of the mooring ship during the southwest monsoon related filed observations e g waves and winds were therefore carried out the wave records in and offshore of the hambantota port are analyzed in this study low frequency i e 1 400 hz 1 30 hz waves are known to play a vital role in the movements of a mooring vessel at berth elzinga et al 1992 sakakibara and kubo 2008 lopez and iglesias 2014 furthermore relative to modeling ship motions only under short waves including low frequency waves would lead to an obvious increase in the ship movements especially in the surge motion kwak and pyun 2013 it is therefore practical and convenient to analyze the oscillations within the port mainly at the low frequency range attention is focused on the following four aspects 1 overview of the wave conditions in the hambantota port such as whether the short wave height was out of the limit of the recommended allowable value and whether the low frequency waves inside the harbor are evident 2 the set of natural periods and associated modal structures of the hambantota port are investigated in addition whether the low frequency oscillations inside the harbor were dominated by its natural frequencies or by the frequencies of incident waves is clarified 3 as previous investigations revealed that low frequency harbor resonance can be excited by not only the incident low frequency waves but also incident short wave groups through nonlinear interaction mei and agnon 1989 wu and liu 1990 gao et al 2016a the offshore low frequency waves and short waves are considered separately in determining the generation of low frequency oscillations within the port 4 as low frequency waves can cause higher ship response elzinga et al 1992 sakakibara and kubo 2008 lopez and iglesias 2014 whether the low frequency waves within the hambantota port can be quickly estimated in terms of the offshore wave parameters deserves to be studied to this end an empirical formula and an artificial neural network model are adopted and compared this paper is organized as follows the setup of the field measurements and analysis methods are described in section 2 results and discussions are present in sections 3 6 corresponding to the aforementioned four aspects finally conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 field observation setup and analysis methods 2 1 field observation setup the harbor layout and topography are shown in fig 1 two nortek acoustic waves and currents awac sensors were set up offshore of g1 and within g2 the hambantota port marked as the red circles in fig 1 based on the technology of acoustic surface tracking ast awac sensors can measure the water free surface and wave direction the duration of the measurement is usually limited due to its high cost it is thus crucial to select the time range for measurement the indian ocean has a typical monsoon climate prevailing by the southwest monsoon from june to september in summer and northeast monsoon from december to march in winter sabique et al 2012 the swell height in the north indian ocean reaches its maximum during the southwest monsoon due to the strong swells generated by the furious wind in the westerly belt zheng and li 2017 hence the port is most affected by the southwest monsoon due to its position in sri lanka accordingly field observation was implemented from july 10 to september 25 2019 which covered almost the whole duration of the southwest monsoon due to the adjustment of the devices data were absent on some days i e aug 14 15 and aug 16 17 for the inside and offshore sensors respectively the awac sensor inside the port collected data at a rate of 20 min per hour with the sampling frequency of 4 hz the other sensor outside the port collected data at a rate of 34 min per hour with the sampling frequency of 2 hz pre treatment of the data was carried out the time series were inspected to detect spikes and corrected using linear interpolation between the useful data points however data with too many spikes were discarded finally 1778 and 1765 samples are obtained for wave sensors g1 and g2 respectively which yields 1717 samples under the same duration 2 2 analysis method regarding the methods for analyzing the measured wave data the most common one is the spectral analysis providing useful information in the frequency domain for the specific observing positions however the filed observation typically suffers from poor spatial resolution due to the limited number of wave sensors and the discrete nature of measurement in order to acquire the characteristics of oscillations in the whole harbor the numerical simulations are therefore used to present the resonant modal structures 2 2 1 spectral analysis the spectral analysis is carried out using the discrete fourier transform to provide useful information in the frequency domain the present work considers two frequency bands of the spectra the sw band 1 30 hz f 1 hz comprising swell and wind waves which represents most of the wave energy the lf band 1 400 hz f 1 30 hz consisting of low frequency waves which is known to play a vital role in the movements of a mooring vessel at berth in addition to the total significant wave height h s the significant wave height of the sw band and lf band are denoted by h sw and h lf which can be calculated by the following equations 1 h x 4 e x where x denotes different frequency bands i e sw or lf e x is the zeroth spectral moment of the x frequency band given by 2 e x f f s f d f where f and f are the low and upper boundaries of the x frequency band the parameters within and offshore of the port are distinguished using the superscript e g h s g 2 versus h s g 1 2 2 2 modal analysis to obtain the spatial information of the low frequency oscillations the present study conducts simulations using the numerical model ma et al 2020 based on the extended mild slope equation chandrasekera and cheung 1997 solved by the hybrid finite element method mei et al 2005 fig 2 shows the computational domain of the hambantota port including 19 585 nodes and 37 928 triangular elements linear regular waves with various frequencies come from the south open sea the amplification factor r is defined as 3 r f a f a 0 where a 0 is the amplitude of the incident wave and does not change with the frequency a f is the response wave amplitude at a given point to the incident waves and varies with the wave frequency each local maximum point of r f corresponds to the natural resonant frequency 2 2 3 correlation analysis to determine the correlation between wave conditions within and outside the harbor the pearson s correlation coefficient c is utilized 4 c j 1 n x j x y j y j 1 n x j x 2 j 1 n y j y 2 where x and y denote a pair of variables n is the number of samples of both variables furthermore the p value is taken into account to evaluate whether a pair of variables are significantly correlated or not the significance level is 0 05 in this study that is a pair of variables are significantly correlated if its p value is smaller than 0 05 3 overview of the wave conditions this section presents a basic description of the wave conditions in the hambantota port as a first step whether the short wave height was out of the limit of the recommended allowable value is determined the h 4 i e crest to trough wave height with 4 accumulation frequency at g2 sensor is calculated using the zero upcrossing method according to the chinese design code of general layout for sea ports ministry of transport of the people s republic of china 2014 for vessels having a deadweight tonnage dwt of 10 000 and 100 000 dwt the allowable h 4 for harbor operation under beam waves are 0 6 m and 1 0 m respectively the time series of h 4 is shown in fig 3 for vessels having 100 000 dwt the h 4 were totally within the limit of the recommended allowable value 1 0 m for vessels having 10 000 dwt the h 4 exceeded the recommended allowable value 0 6 m for only 1 7 of the entire duration in short the observed crest to trough wave height was well within the limit of recommended allowable value as a second step sw waves and lf waves are considered separately to further evaluate the wave conditions fig 4 and fig 5 illustrate the time series of significant wave heights inside and outside the port respectively it is seen from fig 4 that at the offshore sensor g1 the lf wave height h l f g 1 was much smaller than the sw wave height h s w g 1 however within the port the lf wave height h lf g 2 and sw wave height h sw g 2 were on the same order the lf wave height inside the harbor was much more evident than that at the offshore location although observations at sensor g1 also contained the reflecting and scattering waves from the coastlines and harbor mouth respectively they were generally small relative to incident waves hence the ratio of inside and outside wave heights can reflect the wave disturbance to some extent see fig 6 it should be noted that the ration of h s is not present as it is similar to ratio of h sw in the case of h sw the ratio wave disturbance coefficient varied from 0 09 to 0 30 and has a mean value of 0 19 hence good protection against sw waves i e short waves was provided by the port breakwater however in the case of h lf the ratio ranged from 0 26 to 1 35 with an average of 0 58 the lf waves can propagate into the port more efficiently and even amplified at times consequently the port cannot be sheltered well from lf waves 4 natural periods and modal structures it is widely accepted that most of the lf energy will concentrate near the resonant modes thereby revealing the natural periods lopez et al 2012 thotagamuwage and pattiaratchi 2014 gao et al 2017b however besides the natural frequencies of the port the lf energy may concentrate on the dominated low frequencies of the incident waves in this section the peak periods identified from the measured spectra are regarded as the potential natural periods of the hambantota port subsequently numerical results are taken into consideration to further confirm the true natural periods as similar rules are found after a comprehensive review on the wave spectra during the entire observed duration for simplicity only six day averaged spectra with a random interval of 10 15 days are illustrated see fig 7 the wave spectra were relatively energetic for the dates of 16 jul and 22 aug and calm for the other four dates note that only periods under the lf band i e 0 0025 hz 0 0333hz are considered it is seen that the offshore spectra were generally smooth and white but the lf energy inside the harbor permanently concentrated in some periods marked with vertical lines as the natural period is a fundamental parameter of a given harbor and does not change with the wave state i e energetic or calm the four periods i e 400 s 173s 52 s and 35 s are regarded as the potential natural periods of the hambantota port to compare the field data with numerical results the measured wave spectra should be converted to the amplification factor diagram where the natural periods can also be figured out to this end the amplification factor eq 3 can be changed 5 r g 2 f a g 2 f a g 1 f where a g 1 f and a g 2 f denote the amplitude of each spectral frequency for wave sensor g1 and g2 respectively therefore r g 2 f represents the amplification factor at sensor g2 fig 8 shows the amplification factor diagra r g 2 f note that the measured r g 2 f diagram symbol lines is calculated from the field data shown in fig 7 and the numerical r g 2 f diagram solid lines is obtained from the numerical simulation introduced in section 2 2 2 an overall good agreement of peak frequencies can be found between the field data and numerical results the aforementioned four potential natural periods are also apparent in the amplification diagram natural periods obtained from the in situ measurement and numerical simulation are recorded in table 1 where a close agreement is found thereby confirming that they are indeed the natural periods of the hambantota port it is seen that most of the measured lf wave energy inside the harbor concentrated near the natural periods particularly wave energy at the mode a1 was obviously amplified therefore low frequency oscillations inside the hambantota port were dominated by its natural periods i e the eigen oscillations it is seen from fig 7 that the spectral density of modes a2 a4 was much lower than that of mode a1 which may be explained through the modal analysis below fig 9 shows the numerical modal structures i e the distribution of normalized wave height of modes a1 a4 in the cases of modes a1 and a2 see fig 9 a and b the resonant modes oscillate throughout the whole port two and three nodal lines where the wave height is minimal or zero can be observed within the harbor respectively especially one of the nodal lines locates near the harbor entrance this is an important feature in the lower resonant modes of harbor oscillations wang et al 2020 in the case of mode a3 see fig 9 c the modal structure is more complicated resonance within the inner basin is relatively clear and visible there are two nodal lines parallel to the short side of the basin and one nodal line parallel to the long side of the basin in the case of mode a4 see fig 9 d the resonant mode oscillating within the inner basin is more evident i e two nodal lines parallel to the long side of the basin it is seen that the sensor g2 is located near the nodal line of modes a2 and a3 respectively therefore the corresponding observed spectral density was low see fig 7 however though the sensor g2 happens to be located at the anti nodal line where the wave height reaches local maximum of mode a4 the corresponding observed spectral density was also low this phenomenon may be attributed to an extremely weak excitation of mode a4 in practice in conclusion the observed energy of natural modes generally increased with the wave period as mentioned previously sensor g2 is at the nodal lines in some resonant modes hence these modes cannot be detected only based on the information at sensor g2 considering that for most of frequencies the corresponding wave heights can reach a local maximum at the corner points within the harbor the amplification diagram at sensor s1 can reflect most of resonant modes see fig 10 the natural periods are labeled as b1 b16 and listed in table 2 the ratio of r g 2 and r s 1 can reflect the potential for detection of a natural period in sensor g2 i e the greater the r g 2 r s 1 ratio the more possible the corresponding natural period can be detected by sensor g2 it is seen in table 2 that the ratio is generally low from modes b3 to b15 which can explain why the spectral density measured at sensor g2 from 1 125 hz to 1 20 hz see fig 7 was low for instance modal structures of modes b5 and b6 are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the sensor g2 is located at the nodal lines hence wave height at sensor g2 is minimal however the wave heights can reach a local maximum at the corner of the inner basin it is important to note that modes with high amplification factors e g mode b5 maybe not dangerous in practice if they have not been obviously triggered hence it should be emphasized that table 2 only presents the potential natural periods of the hambantota port 5 correlation between the low frequency oscillations within the port and the offshore waves correlation analysis is carried out to determine the generation of low frequency oscillations within the hambantota port the offshore lf and sw waves are considered separately as previous investigations revealed that low frequency harbor resonance can be excited by not only the incident low frequency waves but also incident short wave groups through nonlinear interaction mei and agnon 1989 wu and liu 1990 gao et al 2016a fig 12 shows the comparison of the lf wave height inside the harbor i e h lf g 2 and the offshore sw wave height i e h sw g 1 where a clear rule can be found the correlation coefficient is 0 77 and the p value is much less than 0 05 which indicates h lf g 2 and h sw g 1 were significantly correlated and the linear dependence between them is strong moreover the quadratic function is selected at the authors feeling to fit the distribution of discrete points see the red line in fig 12 it is seen that h lf g 2 increased with h sw g 1 in a nonlinear trend which is more evident after h sw g 1 2 0 m fig 13 shows the comparison of the lf wave height inside the harbor i e h lf g 2 and the offshore lf wave height i e h lf g 1 where a clear rule could be found the correlation coefficient is 0 80 and the p value is much less than 0 05 which indicates h lf g 2 and h lf g 1 were significantly correlated moreover the linear dependence between them is more strong than that in fig 12 the discrete points can thus be better fitted by the linear line as the periods of lf waves and the natural periods of the port are on the same order the lf oscillations can therefore be induced directly by the lf waves resulting in the linear relation between h lf g 2 and h lf g 1 however the lf oscillations cannot be triggered directly by the sw waves as the periods of them are much smaller than the natural periods of the port according to the research of mei and agnon 1989 wu and liu 1990 the lf oscillations can be induced by the short wave groups through the wave nonlinearity on the second order that varies with the square of wave height therefore h lf g 2 increased with h sw g 1 in a nonlinear trend which could be described by a quadratic function as discussed above it is clear that both the offshore low frequency waves and short waves contributed to the low frequency oscillations within the port however the difference in their effect on lf oscillations is not clear which deserves to be further investigated the correlation coefficient of the spectra within the port i e s g 2 f versus the offshore total sw and lf wave energy i e e sw g 1 and e lf g 1 respectively are calculated as functions of wave frequency see fig 14 note that only the results under the lf band are discussed below it is seen from fig 14 a that s g 2 f at two frequency ranges i e 0 0025 hz 0 0091 hz and 0 0167 hz 0 0256 hz are significantly correlated with the offshore total sw wave energy i e e sw g 1 as the p value i e blue line at the two ranges is much smaller than 0 05 however there is no significant correlation between the s g 2 f at the other frequency ranges and e sw g 1 as the corresponding p value is generally much higher than 0 05 from fig 14b it is seen that s g 2 f at the entire lf band is significantly correlated with e lf g 1 as the corresponding p value is totally much smaller than 0 05 moreover the relative higher correlation coefficient i e black line can be found at the frequency range 1 400 hz 1 50 hz for a better understanding of the aforementioned rules three wave records are selected from the observed data set see table 3 in records 1 and 2 h lf g 1 are almost the same but h sw g 1 in the record 2 is higher than that in the record 1 however in records 1 and 3 h sw g 1 are identical but the h lf g 1 in the record 3 is greater than that in the record 1 it is seen that h lf g 2 can increase with h sw g 1 and h lf g 1 respectively which is consistent with the law revealed by figs 12 and 13 the measured wave spectra of records 1 and 2 are shown in fig 15 the spectral density of record 2 is higher than that of record 1 mainly at the narrow range 0 0025 hz 0 01 hz fig 16 illustrates the measured wave spectra of records 1 and 3 it is seen that the spectral density of record 3 is generally higher than that of record 1 at the entire lf band however a significant difference of the spectral density between records 1 and 3 is found at the range 0 0025 hz 0 0175hz the above descriptions are generally consistent with the rule revealed by fig 14 6 estimating the low frequency wave height within the port as the lf wave height inside the port was highly correlated with the offshore lf waves and sw waves swells and wind waves it is subsequently useful to investigate methods that can quickly estimate the lf wave height using the offshore wave parameters however the forecasting technique for short waves in nearshore regions is well developed relative to lf waves accordingly only the outside short wave parameters are taken into consideration empirical formula and an artificial neural network model are adopted and compared 6 1 empirical formula it is hypothesized that the inside lf wave height h lf g 2 depends on the outside short wave parameters significant short wave height h sw g 1 peak period t p g 1 and peak direction θ p g 1 however only the h sw g 1 and t p g 1 are taken to account herein as it is difficult to include the θ p g 1 in an explicit formula inspired by bowers 1992 an empirical formula for estimating h lf g 2 is given 6 h lf g 2 k h sw g 1 α t p g 1 β where the site specific empirical parameters k α and β can be obtained using the non linear least squares method it is noted that k α and β are dimensionless and then the dimension of k changes with these values resulting in a dimensional balance furthermore as shown previously lf wave energy is spatially different due to the modal structure of long waves the fitted parameters are therefore only valid for the position of sensor g2 the total dataset 1717 samples see subsection 2 1 was split into a fitting set 1682 samples and a test set 35 samples the fitting set is used to attain the optimum empirical parameters i e k α and β the test set is subsequently adopted to assess the performance of eq 6 the fitted empirical parameters are presented in table 4 the relative mean absolute error rmae abs x fit x real x real n is 0 232 where n denotes the sample number 1682 the correlation coefficient between measured h lf g 2 and fitted h lf g 2 is 0 8 hence the expression eq 6 can well reproduce h lf g 2 at the fitting set the predicted results at the test set are shown and discussed in subsection 6 2 in order to compare the performance of the empirical formula and artificial neural network model 6 2 artificial neural networks the artificial neural network ann models have been widely used in the prediction of near shore wave conditions in recent years deo et al 2001 lopez and iglesias 2013 inspired by biological neural networks of the human brain ann models are designed to solve complex problems containing multiple factors uncertainty and nonlinearity different from the empirical formula eq 6 there is no task specific rule in the ann models because an ann can learn and generalize itself from the existing data therefore the peak wave direction θ p g 1 which is not included in the empirical formula can be taken to account using the ann model in this work the ann model is performed using an in house built neural toolbox in matlab overall three types of layers are included in an artificial neural network an input layer for sending data to the network a single or additional hidden layer for generating results based on the input and an output layer for providing the results the number of hidden layers and neurons has an important influence on the results based on the pre test not the actual test being discussed now a double hidden layer architecture was adopted see fig 17 an alternate architecture without the input θ p g 1 is also used in order to assess the influence of wave direction on lf wave height inside the port some key steps using the ann model are explained as follows first a feed forward backpropagation network is created using the function newff second the network is trained with the training set 1682 samples mentioned in section 6 1 using the function train to describe the nonlinear relationship the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function is employed for hidden layers third based on the trained network and the input of the test set 35 samples the predicted results can be obtained using the function sim a linear transfer function purelin is used in the output layer note that as the performance of ann model on the training set is not important relative to that on the test set it is not shown herein the performance of the empirical formula and the ann model on the test set are compared in fig 18 and the corresponding error statistics are presented in table 5 although both methods give good results the ann model performed slightly better with lower error and a higher correlation coefficient notably at the point with higher h lf g 2 the predicted value of the ann model is relatively better however it is seen that considering the wave direction in ann model does not improve its performance in predicting the lf wave height within the port it may be attributed to that the measured wave direction is only valid to the short waves 7 conclusions the oscillations at the lower frequency band of 1 400 hz 1 30 hz within the hambantota port during the southwest monsoon of 2019 in the indian ocean are investigated with the combination of in situ measured water surface elevation and numerical simulations the following conclusions are drawn from the present results the statistical results show that the observed short wave height was well below the limit of allowable values recommended by the port design code see fig 3 the frequency domain analysis see fig 4 illustrates that at the offshore location the low frequency wave height varying from 0 047 m to 0 33 m was much smaller than the short wave height ranging from 1 02 m to 3 56 m however within the port see fig 5 the low frequency wave height varying from 0 021 m to 0 263 m and short wave height ranging from 0 188 m to 0 565 m were on the same order the low frequency wave height inside the harbor was much more noticeable than that at the offshore location by combining analyses of spectra derived from in situ measurement and modal analyses solving the extended mild slope equation four natural frequencies of the port are identified and their modal structures are obtained see figs 7 and 8 it is found that that the low frequency waves within the harbor mainly concentrated on its natural periods i e the eigen oscillations instead of the frequencies of external waves combining the analyses of spectra amplification diagram and modal structures it is found that the energy of natural modes generally increased with the wave period the correlation analysis shows that both the offshore low frequency waves and short waves contributed to the low frequency oscillations within the port see figs 12 and 13 the difference in their effects on low frequency oscillations is further investigated the low frequency energy spectrum within the port is found to be more significantly correlated with the offshore total low frequency energy than with the offshore total short wave energy see fig 14 the empirical formula see eq 6 and artificial neural network see fig 17 models are adopted to efficiently estimate the low frequency wave height within the port using the offshore wave parameters although both methods give excellent results see fig 18 the ann model performed slightly better with an smaller error and a higher correlation coefficient see table 5 credit authorship contribution statement guohai dong conceptualization methodology resources writing review editing zhenjun zheng

21812,the low frequency 1 400 1 30 hz oscillations within the hambantota port sri lanka are investigated based on the in situ measured water surface elevations in and outside the harbor by combining analyses of spectra derived from the in situ measurement and modal analyses solving the extended mild slope equation four natural frequencies of the port are identified and their modal structures are obtained it is found that the low frequency oscillations within the port were dominated by its natural frequencies i e the eigen oscillations instead of the frequencies of external waves subsequently the correlation analysis is carried out to determine the generation of the low frequency oscillations although both the offshore low frequency and short waves contributed to the low frequency oscillations the low frequency energy spectrum within the port is found to be more significantly correlated with the offshore total low frequency wave energy than with the offshore total short wave energy moreover the empirical formula and artificial neural network models are presented to efficiently estimate the low frequency waves inside the harbor in terms of the offshore wave parameters although both methods give excellent results the artificial neural network performs slightly better keywords hambantota port low frequency oscillations north indian ocean southwest monsoon modal analysis 1 introduction long waves with periods greater than tens of seconds can be trapped and significantly amplified within a harbor thereby resulting in detrimental effects on port operations rabinovich 2009 this phenomenon is referred to as harbor resonance or coastal oscillations the natural periods of a harbor depend on its layout and bathymetry in general the natural periods range from o 100 s for a small harbor to o 1000 s for a large harbor owing to the broad and continuous frequency distribution of the energy of oceanic waves munk 1949 resonance could occur in many harbors of different sizes such as rotterdam harbor in the netherlands de jong and battjes 2004 hualian harbor in taiwan maa et al 2011 marina di carrara in italy bellotti and franco 2011 guerrini et al 2014 pohang new harbor in south korea kumar et al 2016 and paradip port in odisha india kumar and gulshan 2017 2018 moreover when the periods of wave motion are in the same range as the natural periods of ships severe negative response of ships will occur resulting in damage on mooring ships and mooring systems sakakibara and kubo 2008 a reasonable design or modification of harbor configurations can minimize the negative effect of harbor oscillations for studies consisting of harbor resonance improvements refer to lee and xing 2009 kumar et al 2014 therefore a better understanding of harbor oscillations is of practical significance analytical solutions play an essential role in understanding the general characteristics of harbor oscillations e g mei and ünlüata 1976 wang et al 2011a wang et al 2014 wang et al 2020 although some assumptions such as linear and inviscid and simplifications such as simple harbor structures must be made numerical simulations have become an efficient tool

al 2019 its main advantage is that almost all physical phenomena such as refraction diffraction reflection and wave breaking can be reproduced however it sometimes suffers from the limited model scale the capability of equipment and instruments etc with the advantage of no prior assumptions on the harbor resonance physics field observation is perhaps the more common approach to investigate coastal oscillations and it has been used extensively e g okihiro and guza 1996 bellotti and franco 2011 lopez et al 2012 kumar et al 2014 thotagamuwage and pattiaratchi 2014 moreover in general the physical modeling and field observation cost expensively the hambantota port built in 2017 is located in the southeast of sri lanka directly facing the north indian ocean see fig 1 it is the major seaport in sri lanka and plays a vital role in international routes between asia and europe from the feedback of the port operator unloading operations were disrupted due to the unexpected severe movements of the mooring ship during the southwest monsoon related filed observations e g waves and winds were therefore carried out the wave records in and offshore of the hambantota port are analyzed in this study low frequency i e 1 400 hz 1 30 hz waves are known to play a vital role in the movements of a mooring vessel at berth elzinga et al 1992 sakakibara and kubo 2008 lopez and iglesias 2014 furthermore relative to modeling ship motions only under short waves including low frequency waves would lead to an obvious increase in the ship movements especially in the surge motion kwak and pyun 2013 it is therefore practical and convenient to analyze the oscillations within the port mainly at the low frequency range attention is focused on the following four aspects 1 overview of the wave conditions in the hambantota port such as whether the short wave height was out of the limit of the recommended allowable value and whether the low frequency waves inside the harbor are evident 2 the set of natural periods and associated modal structures of the hambantota port are investigated in addition whether the low frequency oscillations inside the harbor were dominated by its natural frequencies or by the frequencies of incident waves is clarified 3 as previous investigations revealed that low frequency harbor resonance can be excited by not only the incident low frequency waves but also incident short wave groups through nonlinear interaction mei and agnon 1989 wu and liu 1990 gao et al 2016a the offshore low frequency waves and short waves are considered separately in determining the generation of low frequency oscillations within the port 4 as low frequency waves can cause higher ship response elzinga et al 1992 sakakibara and kubo 2008 lopez and iglesias 2014 whether the low frequency waves within the hambantota port can be quickly estimated in terms of the offshore wave parameters deserves to be studied to this end an empirical formula and an artificial neural network model are adopted and compared this paper is organized as follows the setup of the field measurements and analysis methods are described in section 2 results and discussions are present in sections 3 6 corresponding to the aforementioned four aspects finally conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 field observation setup and analysis methods 2 1 field observation setup the harbor layout and topography are shown in fig 1 two nortek acoustic waves and currents awac sensors were set up offshore of g1 and within g2 the hambantota port marked as the red circles in fig 1 based on the technology of acoustic surface tracking ast awac sensors can measure the water free surface and wave direction the duration of the measurement is usually limited due to its high cost it is thus crucial to select the time range for measurement the indian ocean has a typical monsoon climate prevailing by the southwest monsoon from june to september in summer and northeast monsoon from december to march in winter sabique et al 2012 the swell height in the north indian ocean reaches its maximum during the southwest monsoon due to the strong swells generated by the furious wind in the westerly belt zheng and li 2017 hence the port is most affected by the southwest monsoon due to its position in sri lanka accordingly field observation was implemented from july 10 to september 25 2019 which covered almost the whole duration of the southwest monsoon due to the adjustment of the devices data were absent on some days i e aug 14 15 and aug 16 17 for the inside and offshore sensors respectively the awac sensor inside the port collected data at a rate of 20 min per hour with the sampling frequency of 4 hz the other sensor outside the port collected data at a rate of 34 min per hour with the sampling frequency of 2 hz pre treatment of the data was carried out the time series were inspected to detect spikes and corrected using linear interpolation between the useful data points however data with too many spikes were discarded finally 1778 and 1765 samples are obtained for wave sensors g1 and g2 respectively which yields 1717 samples under the same duration 2 2 analysis method regarding the methods for analyzing the measured wave data the most common one is the spectral analysis providing useful information in the frequency domain for the specific observing positions however the filed observation typically suffers from poor spatial resolution due to the limited number of wave sensors and the discrete nature of measurement in order to acquire the characteristics of oscillations in the whole harbor the numerical simulations are therefore used to present the resonant modal structures 2 2 1 spectral analysis the spectral analysis is carried out using the discrete fourier transform to provide useful information in the frequency domain the present work considers two frequency bands of the spectra the sw band 1 30 hz f 1 hz comprising swell and wind waves which represents most of the wave energy the lf band 1 400 hz f 1 30 hz consisting of low frequency waves which is known to play a vital role in the movements of a mooring vessel at berth in addition to the total significant wave height h s the significant wave height of the sw band and lf band are denoted by h sw and h lf which can be calculated by the following equations 1 h x 4 e x where x denotes different frequency bands i e sw or lf e x is the zeroth spectral moment of the x frequency band given by 2 e x f f s f d f where f and f are the low and upper boundaries of the x frequency band the parameters within and offshore of the port are distinguished using the superscript e g h s g 2 versus h s g 1 2 2 2 modal analysis to obtain the spatial information of the low frequency oscillations the present study conducts simulations using the numerical model ma et al 2020 based on the extended mild slope equation chandrasekera and cheung 1997 solved by the hybrid finite element method mei et al 2005 fig 2 shows the computational domain of the hambantota port including 19 585 nodes and 37 928 triangular elements linear regular waves with various frequencies come from the south open sea the amplification factor r is defined as 3 r f a f a 0 where a 0 is the amplitude of the incident wave and does not change with the frequency a f is the response wave amplitude at a given point to the incident waves and varies with the wave frequency each local maximum point of r f corresponds to the natural resonant frequency 2 2 3 correlation analysis to determine the correlation between wave conditions within and outside the harbor the pearson s correlation coefficient c is utilized 4 c j 1 n x j x y j y j 1 n x j x 2 j 1 n y j y 2 where x and y denote a pair of variables n is the number of samples of both variables furthermore the p value is taken into account to evaluate whether a pair of variables are significantly correlated or not the significance level is 0 05 in this study that is a pair of variables are significantly correlated if its p value is smaller than 0 05 3 overview of the wave conditions this section presents a basic description of the wave conditions in the hambantota port as a first step whether the short wave height was out of the limit of the recommended allowable value is determined the h 4 i e crest to trough wave height with 4 accumulation frequency at g2 sensor is calculated using the zero upcrossing method according to the chinese design code of general layout for sea ports ministry of transport of the people s republic of china 2014 for vessels having a deadweight tonnage dwt of 10 000 and 100 000 dwt the allowable h 4 for harbor operation under beam waves are 0 6 m and 1 0 m respectively the time series of h 4 is shown in fig 3 for vessels having 100 000 dwt the h 4 were totally within the limit of the recommended allowable value 1 0 m for vessels having 10 000 dwt the h 4 exceeded the recommended allowable value 0 6 m for only 1 7 of the entire duration in short the observed crest to trough wave height was well within the limit of recommended allowable value as a second step sw waves and lf waves are considered separately to further evaluate the wave conditions fig 4 and fig 5 illustrate the time series of significant wave heights inside and outside the port respectively it is seen from fig 4 that at the offshore sensor g1 the lf wave height h l f g 1 was much smaller than the sw wave height h s w g 1 however within the port the lf wave height h lf g 2 and sw wave height h sw g 2 were on the same order the lf wave height inside the harbor was much more evident than that at the offshore location although observations at sensor g1 also contained the reflecting and scattering waves from the coastlines and harbor mouth respectively they were generally small relative to incident waves hence the ratio of inside and outside wave heights can reflect the wave disturbance to some extent see fig 6 it should be noted that the ration of h s is not present as it is similar to ratio of h sw in the case of h sw the ratio wave disturbance coefficient varied from 0 09 to 0 30 and has a mean value of 0 19 hence good protection against sw waves i e short waves was provided by the port breakwater however in the case of h lf the ratio ranged from 0 26 to 1 35 with an average of 0 58 the lf waves can propagate into the port more efficiently and even amplified at times consequently the port cannot be sheltered well from lf waves 4 natural periods and modal structures it is widely accepted that most of the lf energy will concentrate near the resonant modes thereby revealing the natural periods lopez et al 2012 thotagamuwage and pattiaratchi 2014 gao et al 2017b however besides the natural frequencies of the port the lf energy may concentrate on the dominated low frequencies of the incident waves in this section the peak periods identified from the measured spectra are regarded as the potential natural periods of the hambantota port subsequently numerical results are taken into consideration to further confirm the true natural periods as similar rules are found after a comprehensive review on the wave spectra during the entire observed duration for simplicity only six day averaged spectra with a random interval of 10 15 days are illustrated see fig 7 the wave spectra were relatively energetic for the dates of 16 jul and 22 aug and calm for the other four dates note that only periods under the lf band i e 0 0025 hz 0 0333hz are considered it is seen that the offshore spectra were generally smooth and white but the lf energy inside the harbor permanently concentrated in some periods marked with vertical lines as the natural period is a fundamental parameter of a given harbor and does not change with the wave state i e energetic or calm the four periods i e 400 s 173s 52 s and 35 s are regarded as the potential natural periods of the hambantota port to compare the field data with numerical results the measured wave spectra should be converted to the amplification factor diagram where the natural periods can also be figured out to this end the amplification factor eq 3 can be changed 5 r g 2 f a g 2 f a g 1 f where a g 1 f and a g 2 f denote the amplitude of each spectral frequency for wave sensor g1 and g2 respectively therefore r g 2 f represents the amplification factor at sensor g2 fig 8 shows the amplification factor diagra r g 2 f note that the measured r g 2 f diagram symbol lines is calculated from the field data shown in fig 7 and the numerical r g 2 f diagram solid lines is obtained from the numerical simulation introduced in section 2 2 2 an overall good agreement of peak frequencies can be found between the field data and numerical results the aforementioned four potential natural periods are also apparent in the amplification diagram natural periods obtained from the in situ measurement and numerical simulation are recorded in table 1 where a close agreement is found thereby confirming that they are indeed the natural periods of the hambantota port it is seen that most of the measured lf wave energy inside the harbor concentrated near the natural periods particularly wave energy at the mode a1 was obviously amplified therefore low frequency oscillations inside the hambantota port were dominated by its natural periods i e the eigen oscillations it is seen from fig 7 that the spectral density of modes a2 a4 was much lower than that of mode a1 which may be explained through the modal analysis below fig 9 shows the numerical modal structures i e the distribution of normalized wave height of modes a1 a4 in the cases of modes a1 and a2 see fig 9 a and b the resonant modes oscillate throughout the whole port two and three nodal lines where the wave height is minimal or zero can be observed within the harbor respectively especially one of the nodal lines locates near the harbor entrance this is an important feature in the lower resonant modes of harbor oscillations wang et al 2020 in the case of mode a3 see fig 9 c the modal structure is more complicated resonance within the inner basin is relatively clear and visible there are two nodal lines parallel to the short side of the basin and one nodal line parallel to the long side of the basin in the case of mode a4 see fig 9 d the resonant mode oscillating within the inner basin is more evident i e two nodal lines parallel to the long side of the basin it is seen that the sensor g2 is located near the nodal line of modes a2 and a3 respectively therefore the corresponding observed spectral density was low see fig 7 however though the sensor g2 happens to be located at the anti nodal line where the wave height reaches local maximum of mode a4 the corresponding observed spectral density was also low this phenomenon may be attributed to an extremely weak excitation of mode a4 in practice in conclusion the observed energy of natural modes generally increased with the wave period as mentioned previously sensor g2 is at the nodal lines in some resonant modes hence these modes cannot be detected only based on the information at sensor g2 considering that for most of frequencies the corresponding wave heights can reach a local maximum at the corner points within the harbor the amplification diagram at sensor s1 can reflect most of resonant modes see fig 10 the natural periods are labeled as b1 b16 and listed in table 2 the ratio of r g 2 and r s 1 can reflect the potential for detection of a natural period in sensor g2 i e the greater the r g 2 r s 1 ratio the more possible the corresponding natural period can be detected by sensor g2 it is seen in table 2 that the ratio is generally low from modes b3 to b15 which can explain why the spectral density measured at sensor g2 from 1 125 hz to 1 20 hz see fig 7 was low for instance modal structures of modes b5 and b6 are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the sensor g2 is located at the nodal lines hence wave height at sensor g2 is minimal however the wave heights can reach a local maximum at the corner of the inner basin it is important to note that modes with high amplification factors e g mode b5 maybe not dangerous in practice if they have not been obviously triggered hence it should be emphasized that table 2 only presents the potential natural periods of the hambantota port 5 correlation between the low frequency oscillations within the port and the offshore waves correlation analysis is carried out to determine the generation of low frequency oscillations within the hambantota port the offshore lf and sw waves are considered separately as previous investigations revealed that low frequency harbor resonance can be excited by not only the incident low frequency waves but also incident short wave groups through nonlinear interaction mei and agnon 1989 wu and liu 1990 gao et al 2016a fig 12 shows the comparison of the lf wave height inside the harbor i e h lf g 2 and the offshore sw wave height i e h sw g 1 where a clear rule can be found the correlation coefficient is 0 77 and the p value is much less than 0 05 which indicates h lf g 2 and h sw g 1 were significantly correlated and the linear dependence between them is strong moreover the quadratic function is selected at the authors feeling to fit the distribution of discrete points see the red line in fig 12 it is seen that h lf g 2 increased with h sw g 1 in a nonlinear trend which is more evident after h sw g 1 2 0 m fig 13 shows the comparison of the lf wave height inside the harbor i e h lf g 2 and the offshore lf wave height i e h lf g 1 where a clear rule could be found the correlation coefficient is 0 80 and the p value is much less than 0 05 which indicates h lf g 2 and h lf g 1 were significantly correlated moreover the linear dependence between them is more strong than that in fig 12 the discrete points can thus be better fitted by the linear line as the periods of lf waves and the natural periods of the port are on the same order the lf oscillations can therefore be induced directly by the lf waves resulting in the linear relation between h lf g 2 and h lf g 1 however the lf oscillations cannot be triggered directly by the sw waves as the periods of them are much smaller than the natural periods of the port according to the research of mei and agnon 1989 wu and liu 1990 the lf oscillations can be induced by the short wave groups through the wave nonlinearity on the second order that varies with the square of wave height therefore h lf g 2 increased with h sw g 1 in a nonlinear trend which could be described by a quadratic function as discussed above it is clear that both the offshore low frequency waves and short waves contributed to the low frequency oscillations within the port however the difference in their effect on lf oscillations is not clear which deserves to be further investigated the correlation coefficient of the spectra within the port i e s g 2 f versus the offshore total sw and lf wave energy i e e sw g 1 and e lf g 1 respectively are calculated as functions of wave frequency see fig 14 note that only the results under the lf band are discussed below it is seen from fig 14 a that s g 2 f at two frequency ranges i e 0 0025 hz 0 0091 hz and 0 0167 hz 0 0256 hz are significantly correlated with the offshore total sw wave energy i e e sw g 1 as the p value i e blue line at the two ranges is much smaller than 0 05 however there is no significant correlation between the s g 2 f at the other frequency ranges and e sw g 1 as the corresponding p value is generally much higher than 0 05 from fig 14b it is seen that s g 2 f at the entire lf band is significantly correlated with e lf g 1 as the corresponding p value is totally much smaller than 0 05 moreover the relative higher correlation coefficient i e black line can be found at the frequency range 1 400 hz 1 50 hz for a better understanding of the aforementioned rules three wave records are selected from the observed data set see table 3 in records 1 and 2 h lf g 1 are almost the same but h sw g 1 in the record 2 is higher than that in the record 1 however in records 1 and 3 h sw g 1 are identical but the h lf g 1 in the record 3 is greater than that in the record 1 it is seen that h lf g 2 can increase with h sw g 1 and h lf g 1 respectively which is consistent with the law revealed by figs 12 and 13 the measured wave spectra of records 1 and 2 are shown in fig 15 the spectral density of record 2 is higher than that of record 1 mainly at the narrow range 0 0025 hz 0 01 hz fig 16 illustrates the measured wave spectra of records 1 and 3 it is seen that the spectral density of record 3 is generally higher than that of record 1 at the entire lf band however a significant difference of the spectral density between records 1 and 3 is found at the range 0 0025 hz 0 0175hz the above descriptions are generally consistent with the rule revealed by fig 14 6 estimating the low frequency wave height within the port as the lf wave height inside the port was highly correlated with the offshore lf waves and sw waves swells and wind waves it is subsequently useful to investigate methods that can quickly estimate the lf wave height using the offshore wave parameters however the forecasting technique for short waves in nearshore regions is well developed relative to lf waves accordingly only the outside short wave parameters are taken into consideration empirical formula and an artificial neural network model are adopted and compared 6 1 empirical formula it is hypothesized that the inside lf wave height h lf g 2 depends on the outside short wave parameters significant short wave height h sw g 1 peak period t p g 1 and peak direction θ p g 1 however only the h sw g 1 and t p g 1 are taken to account herein as it is difficult to include the θ p g 1 in an explicit formula inspired by bowers 1992 an empirical formula for estimating h lf g 2 is given 6 h lf g 2 k h sw g 1 α t p g 1 β where the site specific empirical parameters k α and β can be obtained using the non linear least squares method it is noted that k α and β are dimensionless and then the dimension of k changes with these values resulting in a dimensional balance furthermore as shown previously lf wave energy is spatially different due to the modal structure of long waves the fitted parameters are therefore only valid for the position of sensor g2 the total dataset 1717 samples see subsection 2 1 was split into a fitting set 1682 samples and a test set 35 samples the fitting set is used to attain the optimum empirical parameters i e k α and β the test set is subsequently adopted to assess the performance of eq 6 the fitted empirical parameters are presented in table 4 the relative mean absolute error rmae abs x fit x real x real n is 0 232 where n denotes the sample number 1682 the correlation coefficient between measured h lf g 2 and fitted h lf g 2 is 0 8 hence the expression eq 6 can well reproduce h lf g 2 at the fitting set the predicted results at the test set are shown and discussed in subsection 6 2 in order to compare the performance of the empirical formula and artificial neural network model 6 2 artificial neural networks the artificial neural network ann models have been widely used in the prediction of near shore wave conditions in recent years deo et al 2001 lopez and iglesias 2013 inspired by biological neural networks of the human brain ann models are designed to solve complex problems containing multiple factors uncertainty and nonlinearity different from the empirical formula eq 6 there is no task specific rule in the ann models because an ann can learn and generalize itself from the existing data therefore the peak wave direction θ p g 1 which is not included in the empirical formula can be taken to account using the ann model in this work the ann model is performed using an in house built neural toolbox in matlab overall three types of layers are included in an artificial neural network an input layer for sending data to the network a single or additional hidden layer for generating results based on the input and an output layer for providing the results the number of hidden layers and neurons has an important influence on the results based on the pre test not the actual test being discussed now a double hidden layer architecture was adopted see fig 17 an alternate architecture without the input θ p g 1 is also used in order to assess the influence of wave direction on lf wave height inside the port some key steps using the ann model are explained as follows first a feed forward backpropagation network is created using the function newff second the network is trained with the training set 1682 samples mentioned in section 6 1 using the function train to describe the nonlinear relationship the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function is employed for hidden layers third based on the trained network and the input of the test set 35 samples the predicted results can be obtained using the function sim a linear transfer function purelin is used in the output layer note that as the performance of ann model on the training set is not important relative to that on the test set it is not shown herein the performance of the empirical formula and the ann model on the test set are compared in fig 18 and the corresponding error statistics are presented in table 5 although both methods give good results the ann model performed slightly better with lower error and a higher correlation coefficient notably at the point with higher h lf g 2 the predicted value of the ann model is relatively better however it is seen that considering the wave direction in ann model does not improve its performance in predicting the lf wave height within the port it may be attributed to that the measured wave direction is only valid to the short waves 7 conclusions the oscillations at the lower frequency band of 1 400 hz 1 30 hz within the hambantota port during the southwest monsoon of 2019 in the indian ocean are investigated with the combination of in situ measured water surface elevation and numerical simulations the following conclusions are drawn from the present results the statistical results show that the observed short wave height was well below the limit of allowable values recommended by the port design code see fig 3 the frequency domain analysis see fig 4 illustrates that at the offshore location the low frequency wave height varying from 0 047 m to 0 33 m was much smaller than the short wave height ranging from 1 02 m to 3 56 m however within the port see fig 5 the low frequency wave height varying from 0 021 m to 0 263 m and short wave height ranging from 0 188 m to 0 565 m were on the same order the low frequency wave height inside the harbor was much more noticeable than that at the offshore location by combining analyses of spectra derived from in situ measurement and modal analyses solving the extended mild slope equation four natural frequencies of the port are identified and their modal structures are obtained see figs 7 and 8 it is found that that the low frequency waves within the harbor mainly concentrated on its natural periods i e the eigen oscillations instead of the frequencies of external waves combining the analyses of spectra amplification diagram and modal structures it is found that the energy of natural modes generally increased with the wave period the correlation analysis shows that both the offshore low frequency waves and short waves contributed to the low frequency oscillations within the port see figs 12 and 13 the difference in their effects on low frequency oscillations is further investigated the low frequency energy spectrum within the port is found to be more significantly correlated with the offshore total low frequency energy than with the offshore total short wave energy see fig 14 the empirical formula see eq 6 and artificial neural network see fig 17 models are adopted to efficiently estimate the low frequency wave height within the port using the offshore wave parameters although both methods give excellent results see fig 18 the ann model performed slightly better with an smaller error and a higher correlation coefficient see table 5 credit authorship contribution statement guohai dong conceptualization methodology resources writing review editing zhenjun zheng

21813,the bond between epoxy coated reinforcement ecr and seawater coral aggregate concrete scac were studied by using a series of pull out tests five different parameters were considered in this test types of concrete scac and ordinary concrete oc and reinforcement ecr and ordinary reinforcement the ratio of bond length to reinforcement diameter 3 5 and 8 and concrete strength c25 and c35 and thickness of concrete cover the failure mode bond slip curve and strength of specimens were analyzed typical failure mode of pull out specimen was splitting failure while the failure surface of scac specimen was different from that of oc specimen test results indicated that the bond strength of specimen with scac was high compared to specimen using oc even under the similar concrete strength seawater coral aggregate concrete ecr scac ecr bond strength decreased with increasing bond length and decreasing concrete strength and thickness of concrete cover the bond slip curve of scac ecr was similar to that of ordinary concrete oc ordinary reinforcement or however scac and ecr reduced the bond slip curve curvature the decline of curve was improved by using ecr finally an analytical

to the economic and military developments of china da et al 2016 wang et al 2017 however these reefs are far away from the mainland and lack construction materials fresh water and gravel etc which are essential for infrastructures yang et al 2018 it is uneconomical and time consuming to adopt ordinary concrete concrete adopting fresh water and gravel pebble in the reefs and island an alternative construction material is important to the further development of concrete structures the seawater coral aggregate concrete is considered as an ideal material due to its advantages local availability of materials and low cost etc yodsudjai et al 2002 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018a scac can replace fresh water and natural aggregates with seawater and coral aggregates respectively the application of seawater coral aggregate concrete in the construction of island is promising several researchers have investigated the properties of scac in recent years especially its mechanical properties and durability da et al 2016 and huang et al 2018a found that the compressive strength of scac developed more quickly than that of oc at early age while this difference became small after 7d it was observed that tensile flexural strength of scac was enhanced due to the self curing effect of coral aggregates da et al 2018 wang et al 2018b da et al 2016 and feng et al wang et al 2017 reported that scac compressive stress strain curves were dived into three different stages the curvature and the descending parts of scac curve were different from those of oc curve huang et al 2018a the curve curvature of oc was higher than that of scac while oc showed a relatively ductile failure compared to scac huang et al 2018a it was found that the failure mechanism of scac was similar to that of lightweight aggregate concrete wang et al 2018b huang et al 2018b basic mechanical properties of scac could meet the engineering requirements based on the above test results however its ductility and energy dissipation capacity need to be improved the common method of preventing crack propagation and enhancing the ductility of concrete is to embed reinforcement however there are many chloride ions cl in seawater and the environment is severe wang et al 2017 the ordinary reinforcement can be easily corroded yu et al 2017 it was reported that many reinforced seawater coral concrete buildings in kwajalein and midway islands were damaged due to the corrosion of steel bars howdyshell 1974 therefore finding high durable reinforcement is really important for scac structures the stainless fiber reinforced polymer frp and epoxy coated reinforcements are generally considered as good methods however the application of stainless reinforcement is restricted due to its high cost bautista et al 2006 the frp reinforcement has good durability while its ductility is low compared to steel it was found that the energy dissipation capacity and ductility of concrete with frp reinforcement were lower than those of concrete adopting steel reinforcement antonio 1993 xiao et al 2014 according to these above analyses the application of ecr is promising due to its low cost high durability and good ductility basic properties of scac structures can be improved by adopting ecr however the bond between concrete and ecr are complicated due to the epoxy coating it is necessary to investigate the effect of epoxy coating on bond performance ecr has been in general used for 46 years ahmed et al 2017a mcdonald et al 1998 according to the research findings despite of its thin coating ecr shows excellent rust resistance compared to ordinary reinforcement mcdonald et al 1998 mathey and clifton 1976 the application of ecr is increasing every year however epoxy coating not only protects steel bars from corrosion but also reduces the bond between the concrete and steel the bond of ecr to ordinary concrete has been studied by many researchers in recent years wang and han mathey and clifton 1976 adopted pull out specimens and observed that a 6 percent reduction in bond strength with the use of ecr johnston and zia 1982 treece and jirsa 1989 found a reduction of 10 35 bond strength ecr specimen through beam end specimens furthermore choi et al 1990a kim and lee 2017 reported that the reinforcing bar parameters bar size coatings thickness deformation pattern deformation spacing and bearing area ratio etc influenced the bond of ecr to concrete it was found that epoxy coatings in range of 0 12 mm 0 3 mm obviously reduced the bond strength choi et al 1990a miller et al 2003 the more bar size was the more effects of coatings thickness were choi et al 1990a moehle et al 2006 the bond of ecr with high bearing area ratio the ratio of rib bearing areas to the bar cross section was seldom affected by the coating choi et al 1990a test results indicated that the bond strength the maximum value of averaged bond stress increased with decreasing bar size and bond length choi et al 1990a xu et al 1996 however the difference of bond strength between ecr and uncoated bars increased with the increase of bar size kim and lee 2017 furthermore typical bond properties of ecr were influenced by concrete parameters concrete strength type of coarse aggregates slump and consolidation etc pokorný et al 2015 yeih et al 2004 ghaffari et al 1992 reported that the bond strength of coated reinforcement increased with the increases of cover bars cast in low slump concrete were stronger in bond than bars cast in high slump concrete of the same compressive strength it was found that lack of vibration of high slump concrete had a negative effect on bond strength ghaffari et al 1992 the low bond between ecr and concrete with brick chips aggregate was observed compared to ordinary concrete ahmed et al 2017b basic bond properties of ecr are obtained based on the above results but these studies mainly focus on the bond between ecr and ordinary concrete there are few studies on the bond of ecr to seawater coral aggregate concrete yang et al 2018 and wang et al 2018a found that the bond of scac to frp cfrp gfrp and afrp etc bars was different from that of oc to frp bars the influences of coral aggregates and seawater cannot be ignored the bond of ecr to scac significantly changed with the variation of material composition epoxy coating and aggregates etc the bond of scac to ecr needs to be further analyzed the pull out test was adopted to study the bond properties of scac ecr in this test typical influences of concrete strength cover thickness bond length and types of reinforcement and concrete on the bond of specimen were investigated the failure mode bond strength bond slip curve and bond stress distribution of scac ecr were systematically analyzed an analytical stress strain expression was proposed the obtained results would provide a basis for the determination of anchorage length splice length and bond strength of scac ecr it can promote the development of scac design and the application of reinforced saca structures 2 experimental program 2 1 materials properties 2 1 1 reinforcement 16 mm epoxy coated and un coated reinforcements were adopted in this test fig 1 all reinforcements were obtained from same heat of steel in order to keep the same deformation pattern and mechanical properties of bars basic properties of reinforcement were listed in table 1 the epoxy coatings with thickness of 0 16 mm were applied the thickness of coating was provided by the manufacturer 2 1 2 concrete mix 2 1 2 1 raw materials two different types of coarse aggregates were adopted i e coral coarse aggregates and gravel fig 2 cca were obtained from crushed corals details of coarse aggregates are listed in table 2 the fine aggregates included river sand and sea sand typical particle size distributions of fine and coarse aggregates are shown in fig 3 furthermore seawater and fresh water were applied in the preparations for scac and oc respectively seawater and sea sand were derived from lingshan bay qingdao the main ions of seawater are listed in table 3 2 1 2 2 concrete basic properties of cca were different from those of gravel according to table 2 different mix proportions were applied to obtain similar target strength table 4 the prismatic 100 100 300 mm3 and cubic 100 100 100 mm3 specimens were prepared to determine 28d axial and cubic compressive strength ministry of communication 2002 long et al 2019 the target concrete strength in this test was c25 and c35 they were commonly used in the world the obtained results will provide a basis for the application of scac all ordinary concrete specimens were cured under standard condition room temperature of 20 c 2 c relative humidity of 90 5 the scac specimens were immersed in seawater until the test age of 28 days room temperature of 20 c 2 c an electro hydraulic servo tester 2000 kn was used to obtain mechanical properties of concrete table 4 2 2 design and preparation of specimen all pull out specimens were fabricated through the following processes 1 cement fine aggregates and 1 3 of water were added and mixed it for 2 min 2 coarse aggregates and another 1 3 of water were added and mixed for 2 min 3 adding the left water and mixing it for about 2 min 4 the mold was filled with concrete mix and then vibrated by external vibrator for about 1 min the curing method of pull out specimen was similar to that of plain concrete the pull out test was used to study the bond of ecr to concrete in this test ministry of communication 2002 aci committee 2004 canadian standards association 2012 the size of specimen was 150 mm 150 mm 150 mm typical characteristics of pull out specimen adopting this kind of size were simple implementation and easy operation the bond strength and anchorage length can be obtained through test which is essential to the design requirements of scac structures five different parameters were considered 1 types of concrete scac and oc and reinforcement ecr and ordinary reinforcement the coupling effect of scac and ecr on the bond of specimen was analyzed through test the related results would be utilized in the design of reinforced scac structures 2 the bond length l a 3 5 and 8 times of reinforcement diameter this provides deeper insight into the variation of bond strength under different bond lengths 3 concrete strength c25 and c35 4 thickness of concrete cover 67 mm and 42 mm the bond slip curve and failure mode significantly change with the variations of concrete cover thickness and strength ahmed et al 2017a mathey and clifton 1976 at present typical effects of cover thickness and strength on bond of scac to ecr are not studied the obtained results provide a basis for the requirements of bond strength anchorage length and splice length of scac structure under different conditions there were 13 groups of specimens with different parameters and each group had 3 specimens details of specimen are listed in table 5 the specimen is denoted by concrete type s and o are scac and ordinary concrete respectively bond length 3d 5d and 8d represent 3 5 and 8 times of reinforcement diameter respectively concrete strength c25 and c35 denote c25 and c35 concrete respectively reinforcement type e and o are ecr and ordinary reinforcement respectively thickness of cover 67 and 42 denote 67 mm and 42 mm cover thickness respectively taking s 5d c25 e 67 as an example s denotes scac 5d represents the bond length is 5 times of reinforcement diameter c25 is c25 concrete e represents the ecr and 67 is 67 mm concrete cover thickness detailed design of pull out specimen is shown in fig 4 there were 125 mm and 25 mm bar left at loading and free ends of specimen respectively the bond length of specimen was adjusted by pvc tubes fig 4 c 2 3 test setup instrumentation and loading protocol the loading system consisted of three parts a mts multi function electrical universal tester 400 kn a rigid loading frame and a computer system fig 5 the rigid loading frame mainly included two square plates bolts and four high strength screws furthermore an extensometer was installed in the free end unloaded end of specimen to obtain the relative slip between ecr and concrete the measured axial load and deformation of specimen were recorded by computer system experiment was carried out in the building structures laboratory of shandong university of science and technology the loading mode was in the form of displacement pattern and the loading rate was 0 2 mm min furthermore all specimens were preloaded with 2 kn before actual loading to ensure the normal work of devices typical failure mode was also recorded at the end of test 3 experimental results 3 1 overall characteristics of bond behavior the averaged bond stress τ interfacial shear slip at the free end δ curve fig 6 and the bond strength τ max were adopted to analyze typical bond behavior of specimen the τ is given by eq 1 1 τ f πdl a where f is pull out load d is the size of reinforcing bar mm and l a denotes bond length mm when f reaches the peak point f max the corresponding averaged bond stress is the bond strength τ max τ max is the maximum value of averaged bond stress τ test results indicated that τ δ curve was divided into micro slipping slipping and declining stages fig 6 yang et al 2018 the τ was enhanced but the slip of the free end was negligible at the initial stage of loading τ was mainly chemical adhesion at this stage treece and jirsa 1989 the initial slope of curve was influenced by type of concrete it was found that the initial slope of specimen adopting scac s 5d c25 o 67 was low compared to specimen adopting oc o 5d c25 o 67 that can be attributed to the modulus of oc was higher than that of scac huang et al 2018a the τ increased nonlinearly with the increase of δ when τ approached 40 90 of τ max the slope of curve reduced due to the failure of chemical adhesion and the cracking of concrete in the slipping stage τ mainly included friction and mechanical interlock between the reinforcing bar ribs and the surrounding concrete treece and jirsa 1989 it can be from fig 6 and table 5 that the curve curvature and τ max significantly changed with the variations of bond length strength and types of reinforcement and concrete obvious slip at the free end was observed when τ approached τ max the τ δ curve was in the declining stage after the peak point fig 6 test results indicated that τ dropped suddenly and δ increased drastically at the final stage of loading typical influences of bond length concrete strength and type of reinforcement on the decline of τ δ curve was obvious the mechanical interlock was failed and specimen was supported by the friction between reinforcing bars and surrounding concrete at this stage yang et al 2018 3 2 failure process there were no obvious deformation and cracks at the initial stage of loading the relation between pull out load f and interfacial shear slip at the free end δ was nonlinearly when f reached 40 50 of the peak load f max this indicated that plastic deformation and micro cracks appeared in the inner of concrete which were mainly caused by the squeeze between bar ribs and concrete ahmed et al 2017a there were many fine cracks appeared in the surface of specimen when f approached 90 100 of f max however typical characteristics of cracks length number and width in ordinary concrete specimen were large compared with specimen adopting scac axial load dropped suddenly and the macro cracks developed quickly after f max specimen was mainly supported by the friction between reinforcing bars and concrete fig 7 3 3 typical failure mode and surface typical failure mode of specimens is shown in table 5 the main mode was splitting failure when the ratio of concrete thickness c to reinforcement diameter d was less than 5 irrespective of types of concrete and reinforcing bars the reason is no transverse reinforcements in the pull out specimen guo 2003 typical failure surface of scac specimen was smooth compared to oc specimen fig 8 the main cracks crossed the cement mortar coral coarse aggregates and itzs fig 8 b the coral aggregates were almost fractured fig 8 b c however most of gravel was intact fig 8 a and d this is because the low strength and hardness of coral aggregates wang et al 2017 huang et al 2018a the friction phenomenon was not observed on bond surface of concrete typical influences of bond length concrete strength and cover thicknesses on failure surface of pull out specimen were small furthermore it was found that epoxy coating of reinforcement was intact during the test there was no epoxy coating shed during the test the coating protected the bars from corrosion of chloride ions in seawater and the rust of ecr was not observed fig 8 b and d however obvious corrosion of the ordinary reinforcement was found in scac specimens fig 8 c compared to oc specimen fig 8 a the cl in mixing and curing water seawater easily corroded ordinary reinforcing bars in a short term 28d 3 4 typical distribution of bond stress the distribution of bond stress changed with the variation of bond location however there were few studies on the distribution of bond stress for scac ecr a special method was used to manufacture ecr to obtain τ distribution guo 2003 1 dividing an ordinary reinforcement into two halves along the axis 2 manufacturing a 3 mm in depth 4 mm in width and full bar length groove on half of reinforcing bars 3 setting strain gauges at regular intervals 20 mm and drawing out wires through the groove fig 9 4 sticking two halves of reinforcing bars together and spraying epoxy coating the bond stress was calculated as follows eq 2 2 ξ i δ f a a s σ i 1 σ i a e s a s ε i 1 ε i a where ξ i is the bond stress at ith i 1 2 5 measuring points δ f represents the variation of pull out load a s and a are the cross sectional and surface areas of reinforcement a π d d x respectively e s and d denote elastic modulus and diameter of bar σ i 1 ε i 1 and σ i ε i are axial stress strain of reinforcement at i 1st and ith measuring points respectively 3 4 1 axial strain distribution the measured axial strain distribution along bond length at different load levels is shown in fig 10 it was found that axial strain was negligible at the initial stage of loading it obviously increased when f reached about 30 40 of f max which indicated that the chemical adhesion was failed axial strain decreased from the loading end to the free end after 0 3 f max 3 4 2 bond stress distribution typical distribution of bond stress was obtained fig 11 based on eq 2 the bond stress distributed uniformly along the bond length at the initial stage of loading however the distribution of bond stress was uneven when f approached 30 40 of f max it is attributed to the failure of chemical adhesion guo 2003 test results indicated that the maximum bond stress was near loading end about 10 15 mm from loading end fig 11 the distribution of bond stress was almost unchanged after 0 3 f max however bond stress increased with increasing f based on the test results it was found that typical bond stress distribution of scac ecr was similar to that of ordinary concrete ordinary reinforcement 4 influences of factors test results indicated that the bond strength and bond stress slip curve τ δ were obviously affected by bond length cover thickness concrete strength and types of reinforcement and concrete the influences of these factors should be quantitatively described 4 1 bond strength 4 1 1 effect of concrete type table 5 shows τ max of specimens with different parameters it was found that the bond strength of scac specimen was averagely 14 higher than that of oc specimens under the same conditions for example τ max of s 5d c25e 67 and s 5d c25 o 67 were about 11 and 17 6 higher than those of o 5d c25 e 67 and o 5d c25 o 67 respectively that can be attributed to the cracking of coral concrete was small before the peak stress compared to ordinary concrete huang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b when f reached f max the cracking size and quantity of pull out specimen using scac was lower than that of specimen adopting oc and the bond strength of reinforcing bar to scac was high compared to oc specimen 4 1 2 effect of reinforcement type it was found that τ max of specimen with ecr was averagely 13 7 lower than that of specimen adopting ordinary reinforcement table 5 this is because epoxy coating reduces the bond and friction between reinforcing bars and concrete choi et al 1990a furthermore the bond length reduced the effect of epoxy coating on τ max it was obtained that τ max of s 5d c35 o 67 was 15 8 higher than that of s 5d c35 e 67 while the difference between s 8d c35 o 67 and s 8d c35 e 67 was negligible finally the influence of epoxy coating changed with the variation of concrete type the difference between bond strength of o 5d c25 o 67 and that of o 5d c25 e 67 was 17 7 however the difference between s 5d c25 o 67 and s 5d c25 e 67 was 20 7 fig 12 it was found that scac enhanced the effect of epoxy coating on bond strength compared to ordinary concrete that can be attributed to the corrosion of ordinary reinforcement which is caused by cl in scac almusallam et al 1996 and kemp et al 1968 reported that τ max increased with the increase of corrosion percentage γ when γ was less than 5 this phenomenon can be explained as an increase in the reactionary confinement of the bar in the concrete as the amount of corrosion product increases and develops an expansive mechanical pressure on the surrounding concrete al sulaimani et al 1990 carera and ghoddoussi 1992 bamforth and pocock 1990 the rust on surface of ordinary reinforcement increased the radical compressive stress between surrounding concrete and inner reinforcement guo 2003 however these improvements degraded gradually when the corrosion of reinforcement became serious mcdonald et al 1998 the long term bond of reinforcement to scac needs to be further investigated 4 1 3 bond length cover thickness and concrete strength the bond strength decreased with increasing bond length it was found that τ max of s 8d c25 e 67 was 28 3 and 21 7 lower than those of s 3d c25 e 67 and s 5d c25 e 67 respectively fig 13 but concrete strength reduced the influence of bond length slightly test results indicated that τ max of s 8d c35 e 67 was just 22 8 and 19 7 lower than those of s 3d c35 e 67 and s 5d c35 e 67 respectively fig 13 the bond of scac to ecr increased with increasing concrete cover thickness it was found that τ max of s 3d c25 e 42 and s 5d c25 e 42 were 29 8 and 40 3 lower than those of s 3d c25 e 67 and s 5d c25 e 67 respectively table 5 the thicker concrete cover was the reinforcement was better confined by concrete cover was tepfers 1979 choi et al 1990b the less cracking and plastic deformation of specimen was and the higher τ max was wang et al 2018a finally the impact of three factors increased by the order of bond length concrete strength and cover thickness based on the above analyses 4 2 bond slip curve 4 2 1 concrete type the shape of scac or curve was similar to that of oc or curve fig 14 however obvious changes were observed due to the concrete type test results indicated that the curve curvature and τ max of specimen adopting scac s 5d 25 e 67 were high compared to specimen adopting oc o 5d c25 e 67 under the similar strength condition but the scac specimen s 5d c25 o 67 curve declined more rapidly than oc specimen curve o 5d c25 o 67 it is attributed to the mechanical properties of scac huang et al 2018a found that the cracking and plastic deformation of scac were small before the peak stress compared to oc the deformation and cracking of pull out specimen adopting scac were lower than those of specimen using oc which enhanced the curve curvature and τ max of specimen however macro cracking of coral concrete developed quickly after the peak point wang et al 2017 huang et al 2018a s 5d c25 o 67 curve dropped rapidly compared to o 5d c25 o 67 fig 14 4 2 2 type of reinforcement the reinforcement type influenced curvature and decline of bond slip curve it was found that the curve curvature of scac or was lower than that of scac ecr fig 15 it is attributed to the epoxy coating decreases the frictional and interlocking activity between reinforcing bar ribs and concrete choi et al 1990a kim and lee 2017 miller et al 2003 furthermore the decline of scac or oc or bond slip curve was rapid compared to specimen using ecr this is because the more friction and mechanical interlock between reinforcement and concrete are the higher energy inside specimen is and the more rapid decline of curve after the peak point is da et al 2016 huang et al 2018a 4 2 3 bond length concrete strength and cover thickness the τ δ curve changed with the variations of bond length concrete strength and cover thickness the higher concrete strength was the less curvature of curve was fig 16 however the curve curvature decreased with a decrease of bond length fig 17 this is mainly attributed to the less micro cracking of concrete before τ max huang et al 2018a 2019 furthermore test results indicated that the less cover thickness and higher bond length were the more rapid decrease of curve was fig 18 5 theoretical analysis the bond properties of scac to ecr were different from those of ordinary reinforcement to ordinary concrete based on the above analyses the changes of bond properties should be quantified by analytical expressions 5 1 bond strength formula an analytical formula for the bond strength of reinforcing bar to scac is necessary for the design and analysis of structures there are few specific expressions and related theories in this research field the specific expressions are suggested eqs 3 and 4 based on test results and the corresponding analyses yang et al 2018 wang et al 2018a guo 2003 3 τ max c 0 5174 1 3770 d l a 3 5130 1 084 c d f t for scac ecr 4 τ max c 0 05756 2 788 d l a 1 527 2 781 c d f t for scac or τ max c is the calculated bond strength l a denotes bond length d represents size of reinforcement c is the concrete cover thickness f t is splitting strength of concrete a comparison between τ max c and the experimental ones are shown in table 5 the correlation coefficient of data is 0 90 and the mean value is 1 01 the suggested equations can be used in practical design 5 2 approximation of the bond slip relations an analytical expression of bond slip curve is essential to the analysis of reinforced scac structures the derivation of this expression is listed as follows an approximate expression was obtained based on related references yang et al 2018 guo 2003 harajli et al 2002 harajli 2004 xu et al 1999 calculating the specific value of bond slip parameter for each test specimen based on test results the matlab software was utilized to code related program for least square method to derive the specific formulas of parameters the analytical expression eq 5 is given by 5 τ τ max δ δ u β δ δ u 1 δ δ u λ δ δ u 1 δ δ u δ δ u 1 where δ and τ are the interfacial shear slip free end and the averaged bond stress respectively τ max is the bond strength δ u is the interfacial shear slip corresponding to the bond strength 5 2 1 parameter β the parameter β denotes the initial slope of stress strain curve the larger β is the larger proportion of plastic deformation is 6 β 0 164 d l a 0 0056 f cu 0 423 d c 0 191 in eq 6 d is the size of reinforcement c represents the concrete cover thickness 5 2 2 parameter λ λ is the area under the declining part of bond stress slip cure the larger λ is the less ductility of specimen is 7 λ 4 56 d c 0 032 f cu 7 607 d l a 2 51 in eq 7 f cu is the cubic compressive strength of concrete a comparison between the experimental curves and the calculated ones is shown in fig 19 the suggested bond slip curves were in line with the real ones the analytical expression can be used in the theoretical analysis and practical design 6 conclusion the bond of epoxy coated reinforcement to seawater coral aggregate concrete was studied by pull out test the following conclusions can be drawn 1 typical failure mode of scac ecr pull out specimen is splitting failure when c d is less than 5 most of coral coarse aggregates are damaged and the failure surface is smooth compared to ordinary concrete specimen 2 the bond strength decreases sequentially in order of scac or oc or scac ecr and oc ecr the bond strength of scac ecr is averagely 14 higher than that of oc ecr due to the micro cracking of concrete the bond strength increases with the increase of scac cover thickness and the decrease of bond length 3 the bond slip curve is divided into micro slipping slipping and declining stages the curve curvature of specimen adopting scac and or is low compared to other specimens however the decline of scac pull out specimen curve is more rapid than that of oc pull out specimen curve the higher bond length is the more rapid decline of curve is furthermore the bond stress distributes non uniformly along the bond length 4 an analytical formula for bond strength of scac ecr is presented furthermore the bond slip relation of specimen is suggested it provides a basis for the application of reinforced scac structures credit authorship contribution statement ruifeng nie writing review editing investigation yijie huang

21813,the bond between epoxy coated reinforcement ecr and seawater coral aggregate concrete scac were studied by using a series of pull out tests five different parameters were considered in this test types of concrete scac and ordinary concrete oc and reinforcement ecr and ordinary reinforcement the ratio of bond length to reinforcement diameter 3 5 and 8 and concrete strength c25 and c35 and thickness of concrete cover the failure mode bond slip curve and strength of specimens were analyzed typical failure mode of pull out specimen was splitting failure while the failure surface of scac specimen was different from that of oc specimen test results indicated that the bond strength of specimen with scac was high compared to specimen using oc even under the similar concrete strength seawater coral aggregate concrete ecr scac ecr bond strength decreased with increasing bond length and decreasing concrete strength and thickness of concrete cover the bond slip curve of scac ecr was similar to that of ordinary concrete oc ordinary reinforcement or however scac and ecr reduced the bond slip curve curvature the decline of curve was improved by using ecr finally an analytical

to the economic and military developments of china da et al 2016 wang et al 2017 however these reefs are far away from the mainland and lack construction materials fresh water and gravel etc which are essential for infrastructures yang et al 2018 it is uneconomical and time consuming to adopt ordinary concrete concrete adopting fresh water and gravel pebble in the reefs and island an alternative construction material is important to the further development of concrete structures the seawater coral aggregate concrete is considered as an ideal material due to its advantages local availability of materials and low cost etc yodsudjai et al 2002 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018a scac can replace fresh water and natural aggregates with seawater and coral aggregates respectively the application of seawater coral aggregate concrete in the construction of island is promising several researchers have investigated the properties of scac in recent years especially its mechanical properties and durability da et al 2016 and huang et al 2018a found that the compressive strength of scac developed more quickly than that of oc at early age while this difference became small after 7d it was observed that tensile flexural strength of scac was enhanced due to the self curing effect of coral aggregates da et al 2018 wang et al 2018b da et al 2016 and feng et al wang et al 2017 reported that scac compressive stress strain curves were dived into three different stages the curvature and the descending parts of scac curve were different from those of oc curve huang et al 2018a the curve curvature of oc was higher than that of scac while oc showed a relatively ductile failure compared to scac huang et al 2018a it was found that the failure mechanism of scac was similar to that of lightweight aggregate concrete wang et al 2018b huang et al 2018b basic mechanical properties of scac could meet the engineering requirements based on the above test results however its ductility and energy dissipation capacity need to be improved the common method of preventing crack propagation and enhancing the ductility of concrete is to embed reinforcement however there are many chloride ions cl in seawater and the environment is severe wang et al 2017 the ordinary reinforcement can be easily corroded yu et al 2017 it was reported that many reinforced seawater coral concrete buildings in kwajalein and midway islands were damaged due to the corrosion of steel bars howdyshell 1974 therefore finding high durable reinforcement is really important for scac structures the stainless fiber reinforced polymer frp and epoxy coated reinforcements are generally considered as good methods however the application of stainless reinforcement is restricted due to its high cost bautista et al 2006 the frp reinforcement has good durability while its ductility is low compared to steel it was found that the energy dissipation capacity and ductility of concrete with frp reinforcement were lower than those of concrete adopting steel reinforcement antonio 1993 xiao et al 2014 according to these above analyses the application of ecr is promising due to its low cost high durability and good ductility basic properties of scac structures can be improved by adopting ecr however the bond between concrete and ecr are complicated due to the epoxy coating it is necessary to investigate the effect of epoxy coating on bond performance ecr has been in general used for 46 years ahmed et al 2017a mcdonald et al 1998 according to the research findings despite of its thin coating ecr shows excellent rust resistance compared to ordinary reinforcement mcdonald et al 1998 mathey and clifton 1976 the application of ecr is increasing every year however epoxy coating not only protects steel bars from corrosion but also reduces the bond between the concrete and steel the bond of ecr to ordinary concrete has been studied by many researchers in recent years wang and han mathey and clifton 1976 adopted pull out specimens and observed that a 6 percent reduction in bond strength with the use of ecr johnston and zia 1982 treece and jirsa 1989 found a reduction of 10 35 bond strength ecr specimen through beam end specimens furthermore choi et al 1990a kim and lee 2017 reported that the reinforcing bar parameters bar size coatings thickness deformation pattern deformation spacing and bearing area ratio etc influenced the bond of ecr to concrete it was found that epoxy coatings in range of 0 12 mm 0 3 mm obviously reduced the bond strength choi et al 1990a miller et al 2003 the more bar size was the more effects of coatings thickness were choi et al 1990a moehle et al 2006 the bond of ecr with high bearing area ratio the ratio of rib bearing areas to the bar cross section was seldom affected by the coating choi et al 1990a test results indicated that the bond strength the maximum value of averaged bond stress increased with decreasing bar size and bond length choi et al 1990a xu et al 1996 however the difference of bond strength between ecr and uncoated bars increased with the increase of bar size kim and lee 2017 furthermore typical bond properties of ecr were influenced by concrete parameters concrete strength type of coarse aggregates slump and consolidation etc pokorný et al 2015 yeih et al 2004 ghaffari et al 1992 reported that the bond strength of coated reinforcement increased with the increases of cover bars cast in low slump concrete were stronger in bond than bars cast in high slump concrete of the same compressive strength it was found that lack of vibration of high slump concrete had a negative effect on bond strength ghaffari et al 1992 the low bond between ecr and concrete with brick chips aggregate was observed compared to ordinary concrete ahmed et al 2017b basic bond properties of ecr are obtained based on the above results but these studies mainly focus on the bond between ecr and ordinary concrete there are few studies on the bond of ecr to seawater coral aggregate concrete yang et al 2018 and wang et al 2018a found that the bond of scac to frp cfrp gfrp and afrp etc bars was different from that of oc to frp bars the influences of coral aggregates and seawater cannot be ignored the bond of ecr to scac significantly changed with the variation of material composition epoxy coating and aggregates etc the bond of scac to ecr needs to be further analyzed the pull out test was adopted to study the bond properties of scac ecr in this test typical influences of concrete strength cover thickness bond length and types of reinforcement and concrete on the bond of specimen were investigated the failure mode bond strength bond slip curve and bond stress distribution of scac ecr were systematically analyzed an analytical stress strain expression was proposed the obtained results would provide a basis for the determination of anchorage length splice length and bond strength of scac ecr it can promote the development of scac design and the application of reinforced saca structures 2 experimental program 2 1 materials properties 2 1 1 reinforcement 16 mm epoxy coated and un coated reinforcements were adopted in this test fig 1 all reinforcements were obtained from same heat of steel in order to keep the same deformation pattern and mechanical properties of bars basic properties of reinforcement were listed in table 1 the epoxy coatings with thickness of 0 16 mm were applied the thickness of coating was provided by the manufacturer 2 1 2 concrete mix 2 1 2 1 raw materials two different types of coarse aggregates were adopted i e coral coarse aggregates and gravel fig 2 cca were obtained from crushed corals details of coarse aggregates are listed in table 2 the fine aggregates included river sand and sea sand typical particle size distributions of fine and coarse aggregates are shown in fig 3 furthermore seawater and fresh water were applied in the preparations for scac and oc respectively seawater and sea sand were derived from lingshan bay qingdao the main ions of seawater are listed in table 3 2 1 2 2 concrete basic properties of cca were different from those of gravel according to table 2 different mix proportions were applied to obtain similar target strength table 4 the prismatic 100 100 300 mm3 and cubic 100 100 100 mm3 specimens were prepared to determine 28d axial and cubic compressive strength ministry of communication 2002 long et al 2019 the target concrete strength in this test was c25 and c35 they were commonly used in the world the obtained results will provide a basis for the application of scac all ordinary concrete specimens were cured under standard condition room temperature of 20 c 2 c relative humidity of 90 5 the scac specimens were immersed in seawater until the test age of 28 days room temperature of 20 c 2 c an electro hydraulic servo tester 2000 kn was used to obtain mechanical properties of concrete table 4 2 2 design and preparation of specimen all pull out specimens were fabricated through the following processes 1 cement fine aggregates and 1 3 of water were added and mixed it for 2 min 2 coarse aggregates and another 1 3 of water were added and mixed for 2 min 3 adding the left water and mixing it for about 2 min 4 the mold was filled with concrete mix and then vibrated by external vibrator for about 1 min the curing method of pull out specimen was similar to that of plain concrete the pull out test was used to study the bond of ecr to concrete in this test ministry of communication 2002 aci committee 2004 canadian standards association 2012 the size of specimen was 150 mm 150 mm 150 mm typical characteristics of pull out specimen adopting this kind of size were simple implementation and easy operation the bond strength and anchorage length can be obtained through test which is essential to the design requirements of scac structures five different parameters were considered 1 types of concrete scac and oc and reinforcement ecr and ordinary reinforcement the coupling effect of scac and ecr on the bond of specimen was analyzed through test the related results would be utilized in the design of reinforced scac structures 2 the bond length l a 3 5 and 8 times of reinforcement diameter this provides deeper insight into the variation of bond strength under different bond lengths 3 concrete strength c25 and c35 4 thickness of concrete cover 67 mm and 42 mm the bond slip curve and failure mode significantly change with the variations of concrete cover thickness and strength ahmed et al 2017a mathey and clifton 1976 at present typical effects of cover thickness and strength on bond of scac to ecr are not studied the obtained results provide a basis for the requirements of bond strength anchorage length and splice length of scac structure under different conditions there were 13 groups of specimens with different parameters and each group had 3 specimens details of specimen are listed in table 5 the specimen is denoted by concrete type s and o are scac and ordinary concrete respectively bond length 3d 5d and 8d represent 3 5 and 8 times of reinforcement diameter respectively concrete strength c25 and c35 denote c25 and c35 concrete respectively reinforcement type e and o are ecr and ordinary reinforcement respectively thickness of cover 67 and 42 denote 67 mm and 42 mm cover thickness respectively taking s 5d c25 e 67 as an example s denotes scac 5d represents the bond length is 5 times of reinforcement diameter c25 is c25 concrete e represents the ecr and 67 is 67 mm concrete cover thickness detailed design of pull out specimen is shown in fig 4 there were 125 mm and 25 mm bar left at loading and free ends of specimen respectively the bond length of specimen was adjusted by pvc tubes fig 4 c 2 3 test setup instrumentation and loading protocol the loading system consisted of three parts a mts multi function electrical universal tester 400 kn a rigid loading frame and a computer system fig 5 the rigid loading frame mainly included two square plates bolts and four high strength screws furthermore an extensometer was installed in the free end unloaded end of specimen to obtain the relative slip between ecr and concrete the measured axial load and deformation of specimen were recorded by computer system experiment was carried out in the building structures laboratory of shandong university of science and technology the loading mode was in the form of displacement pattern and the loading rate was 0 2 mm min furthermore all specimens were preloaded with 2 kn before actual loading to ensure the normal work of devices typical failure mode was also recorded at the end of test 3 experimental results 3 1 overall characteristics of bond behavior the averaged bond stress τ interfacial shear slip at the free end δ curve fig 6 and the bond strength τ max were adopted to analyze typical bond behavior of specimen the τ is given by eq 1 1 τ f πdl a where f is pull out load d is the size of reinforcing bar mm and l a denotes bond length mm when f reaches the peak point f max the corresponding averaged bond stress is the bond strength τ max τ max is the maximum value of averaged bond stress τ test results indicated that τ δ curve was divided into micro slipping slipping and declining stages fig 6 yang et al 2018 the τ was enhanced but the slip of the free end was negligible at the initial stage of loading τ was mainly chemical adhesion at this stage treece and jirsa 1989 the initial slope of curve was influenced by type of concrete it was found that the initial slope of specimen adopting scac s 5d c25 o 67 was low compared to specimen adopting oc o 5d c25 o 67 that can be attributed to the modulus of oc was higher than that of scac huang et al 2018a the τ increased nonlinearly with the increase of δ when τ approached 40 90 of τ max the slope of curve reduced due to the failure of chemical adhesion and the cracking of concrete in the slipping stage τ mainly included friction and mechanical interlock between the reinforcing bar ribs and the surrounding concrete treece and jirsa 1989 it can be from fig 6 and table 5 that the curve curvature and τ max significantly changed with the variations of bond length strength and types of reinforcement and concrete obvious slip at the free end was observed when τ approached τ max the τ δ curve was in the declining stage after the peak point fig 6 test results indicated that τ dropped suddenly and δ increased drastically at the final stage of loading typical influences of bond length concrete strength and type of reinforcement on the decline of τ δ curve was obvious the mechanical interlock was failed and specimen was supported by the friction between reinforcing bars and surrounding concrete at this stage yang et al 2018 3 2 failure process there were no obvious deformation and cracks at the initial stage of loading the relation between pull out load f and interfacial shear slip at the free end δ was nonlinearly when f reached 40 50 of the peak load f max this indicated that plastic deformation and micro cracks appeared in the inner of concrete which were mainly caused by the squeeze between bar ribs and concrete ahmed et al 2017a there were many fine cracks appeared in the surface of specimen when f approached 90 100 of f max however typical characteristics of cracks length number and width in ordinary concrete specimen were large compared with specimen adopting scac axial load dropped suddenly and the macro cracks developed quickly after f max specimen was mainly supported by the friction between reinforcing bars and concrete fig 7 3 3 typical failure mode and surface typical failure mode of specimens is shown in table 5 the main mode was splitting failure when the ratio of concrete thickness c to reinforcement diameter d was less than 5 irrespective of types of concrete and reinforcing bars the reason is no transverse reinforcements in the pull out specimen guo 2003 typical failure surface of scac specimen was smooth compared to oc specimen fig 8 the main cracks crossed the cement mortar coral coarse aggregates and itzs fig 8 b the coral aggregates were almost fractured fig 8 b c however most of gravel was intact fig 8 a and d this is because the low strength and hardness of coral aggregates wang et al 2017 huang et al 2018a the friction phenomenon was not observed on bond surface of concrete typical influences of bond length concrete strength and cover thicknesses on failure surface of pull out specimen were small furthermore it was found that epoxy coating of reinforcement was intact during the test there was no epoxy coating shed during the test the coating protected the bars from corrosion of chloride ions in seawater and the rust of ecr was not observed fig 8 b and d however obvious corrosion of the ordinary reinforcement was found in scac specimens fig 8 c compared to oc specimen fig 8 a the cl in mixing and curing water seawater easily corroded ordinary reinforcing bars in a short term 28d 3 4 typical distribution of bond stress the distribution of bond stress changed with the variation of bond location however there were few studies on the distribution of bond stress for scac ecr a special method was used to manufacture ecr to obtain τ distribution guo 2003 1 dividing an ordinary reinforcement into two halves along the axis 2 manufacturing a 3 mm in depth 4 mm in width and full bar length groove on half of reinforcing bars 3 setting strain gauges at regular intervals 20 mm and drawing out wires through the groove fig 9 4 sticking two halves of reinforcing bars together and spraying epoxy coating the bond stress was calculated as follows eq 2 2 ξ i δ f a a s σ i 1 σ i a e s a s ε i 1 ε i a where ξ i is the bond stress at ith i 1 2 5 measuring points δ f represents the variation of pull out load a s and a are the cross sectional and surface areas of reinforcement a π d d x respectively e s and d denote elastic modulus and diameter of bar σ i 1 ε i 1 and σ i ε i are axial stress strain of reinforcement at i 1st and ith measuring points respectively 3 4 1 axial strain distribution the measured axial strain distribution along bond length at different load levels is shown in fig 10 it was found that axial strain was negligible at the initial stage of loading it obviously increased when f reached about 30 40 of f max which indicated that the chemical adhesion was failed axial strain decreased from the loading end to the free end after 0 3 f max 3 4 2 bond stress distribution typical distribution of bond stress was obtained fig 11 based on eq 2 the bond stress distributed uniformly along the bond length at the initial stage of loading however the distribution of bond stress was uneven when f approached 30 40 of f max it is attributed to the failure of chemical adhesion guo 2003 test results indicated that the maximum bond stress was near loading end about 10 15 mm from loading end fig 11 the distribution of bond stress was almost unchanged after 0 3 f max however bond stress increased with increasing f based on the test results it was found that typical bond stress distribution of scac ecr was similar to that of ordinary concrete ordinary reinforcement 4 influences of factors test results indicated that the bond strength and bond stress slip curve τ δ were obviously affected by bond length cover thickness concrete strength and types of reinforcement and concrete the influences of these factors should be quantitatively described 4 1 bond strength 4 1 1 effect of concrete type table 5 shows τ max of specimens with different parameters it was found that the bond strength of scac specimen was averagely 14 higher than that of oc specimens under the same conditions for example τ max of s 5d c25e 67 and s 5d c25 o 67 were about 11 and 17 6 higher than those of o 5d c25 e 67 and o 5d c25 o 67 respectively that can be attributed to the cracking of coral concrete was small before the peak stress compared to ordinary concrete huang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b when f reached f max the cracking size and quantity of pull out specimen using scac was lower than that of specimen adopting oc and the bond strength of reinforcing bar to scac was high compared to oc specimen 4 1 2 effect of reinforcement type it was found that τ max of specimen with ecr was averagely 13 7 lower than that of specimen adopting ordinary reinforcement table 5 this is because epoxy coating reduces the bond and friction between reinforcing bars and concrete choi et al 1990a furthermore the bond length reduced the effect of epoxy coating on τ max it was obtained that τ max of s 5d c35 o 67 was 15 8 higher than that of s 5d c35 e 67 while the difference between s 8d c35 o 67 and s 8d c35 e 67 was negligible finally the influence of epoxy coating changed with the variation of concrete type the difference between bond strength of o 5d c25 o 67 and that of o 5d c25 e 67 was 17 7 however the difference between s 5d c25 o 67 and s 5d c25 e 67 was 20 7 fig 12 it was found that scac enhanced the effect of epoxy coating on bond strength compared to ordinary concrete that can be attributed to the corrosion of ordinary reinforcement which is caused by cl in scac almusallam et al 1996 and kemp et al 1968 reported that τ max increased with the increase of corrosion percentage γ when γ was less than 5 this phenomenon can be explained as an increase in the reactionary confinement of the bar in the concrete as the amount of corrosion product increases and develops an expansive mechanical pressure on the surrounding concrete al sulaimani et al 1990 carera and ghoddoussi 1992 bamforth and pocock 1990 the rust on surface of ordinary reinforcement increased the radical compressive stress between surrounding concrete and inner reinforcement guo 2003 however these improvements degraded gradually when the corrosion of reinforcement became serious mcdonald et al 1998 the long term bond of reinforcement to scac needs to be further investigated 4 1 3 bond length cover thickness and concrete strength the bond strength decreased with increasing bond length it was found that τ max of s 8d c25 e 67 was 28 3 and 21 7 lower than those of s 3d c25 e 67 and s 5d c25 e 67 respectively fig 13 but concrete strength reduced the influence of bond length slightly test results indicated that τ max of s 8d c35 e 67 was just 22 8 and 19 7 lower than those of s 3d c35 e 67 and s 5d c35 e 67 respectively fig 13 the bond of scac to ecr increased with increasing concrete cover thickness it was found that τ max of s 3d c25 e 42 and s 5d c25 e 42 were 29 8 and 40 3 lower than those of s 3d c25 e 67 and s 5d c25 e 67 respectively table 5 the thicker concrete cover was the reinforcement was better confined by concrete cover was tepfers 1979 choi et al 1990b the less cracking and plastic deformation of specimen was and the higher τ max was wang et al 2018a finally the impact of three factors increased by the order of bond length concrete strength and cover thickness based on the above analyses 4 2 bond slip curve 4 2 1 concrete type the shape of scac or curve was similar to that of oc or curve fig 14 however obvious changes were observed due to the concrete type test results indicated that the curve curvature and τ max of specimen adopting scac s 5d 25 e 67 were high compared to specimen adopting oc o 5d c25 e 67 under the similar strength condition but the scac specimen s 5d c25 o 67 curve declined more rapidly than oc specimen curve o 5d c25 o 67 it is attributed to the mechanical properties of scac huang et al 2018a found that the cracking and plastic deformation of scac were small before the peak stress compared to oc the deformation and cracking of pull out specimen adopting scac were lower than those of specimen using oc which enhanced the curve curvature and τ max of specimen however macro cracking of coral concrete developed quickly after the peak point wang et al 2017 huang et al 2018a s 5d c25 o 67 curve dropped rapidly compared to o 5d c25 o 67 fig 14 4 2 2 type of reinforcement the reinforcement type influenced curvature and decline of bond slip curve it was found that the curve curvature of scac or was lower than that of scac ecr fig 15 it is attributed to the epoxy coating decreases the frictional and interlocking activity between reinforcing bar ribs and concrete choi et al 1990a kim and lee 2017 miller et al 2003 furthermore the decline of scac or oc or bond slip curve was rapid compared to specimen using ecr this is because the more friction and mechanical interlock between reinforcement and concrete are the higher energy inside specimen is and the more rapid decline of curve after the peak point is da et al 2016 huang et al 2018a 4 2 3 bond length concrete strength and cover thickness the τ δ curve changed with the variations of bond length concrete strength and cover thickness the higher concrete strength was the less curvature of curve was fig 16 however the curve curvature decreased with a decrease of bond length fig 17 this is mainly attributed to the less micro cracking of concrete before τ max huang et al 2018a 2019 furthermore test results indicated that the less cover thickness and higher bond length were the more rapid decrease of curve was fig 18 5 theoretical analysis the bond properties of scac to ecr were different from those of ordinary reinforcement to ordinary concrete based on the above analyses the changes of bond properties should be quantified by analytical expressions 5 1 bond strength formula an analytical formula for the bond strength of reinforcing bar to scac is necessary for the design and analysis of structures there are few specific expressions and related theories in this research field the specific expressions are suggested eqs 3 and 4 based on test results and the corresponding analyses yang et al 2018 wang et al 2018a guo 2003 3 τ max c 0 5174 1 3770 d l a 3 5130 1 084 c d f t for scac ecr 4 τ max c 0 05756 2 788 d l a 1 527 2 781 c d f t for scac or τ max c is the calculated bond strength l a denotes bond length d represents size of reinforcement c is the concrete cover thickness f t is splitting strength of concrete a comparison between τ max c and the experimental ones are shown in table 5 the correlation coefficient of data is 0 90 and the mean value is 1 01 the suggested equations can be used in practical design 5 2 approximation of the bond slip relations an analytical expression of bond slip curve is essential to the analysis of reinforced scac structures the derivation of this expression is listed as follows an approximate expression was obtained based on related references yang et al 2018 guo 2003 harajli et al 2002 harajli 2004 xu et al 1999 calculating the specific value of bond slip parameter for each test specimen based on test results the matlab software was utilized to code related program for least square method to derive the specific formulas of parameters the analytical expression eq 5 is given by 5 τ τ max δ δ u β δ δ u 1 δ δ u λ δ δ u 1 δ δ u δ δ u 1 where δ and τ are the interfacial shear slip free end and the averaged bond stress respectively τ max is the bond strength δ u is the interfacial shear slip corresponding to the bond strength 5 2 1 parameter β the parameter β denotes the initial slope of stress strain curve the larger β is the larger proportion of plastic deformation is 6 β 0 164 d l a 0 0056 f cu 0 423 d c 0 191 in eq 6 d is the size of reinforcement c represents the concrete cover thickness 5 2 2 parameter λ λ is the area under the declining part of bond stress slip cure the larger λ is the less ductility of specimen is 7 λ 4 56 d c 0 032 f cu 7 607 d l a 2 51 in eq 7 f cu is the cubic compressive strength of concrete a comparison between the experimental curves and the calculated ones is shown in fig 19 the suggested bond slip curves were in line with the real ones the analytical expression can be used in the theoretical analysis and practical design 6 conclusion the bond of epoxy coated reinforcement to seawater coral aggregate concrete was studied by pull out test the following conclusions can be drawn 1 typical failure mode of scac ecr pull out specimen is splitting failure when c d is less than 5 most of coral coarse aggregates are damaged and the failure surface is smooth compared to ordinary concrete specimen 2 the bond strength decreases sequentially in order of scac or oc or scac ecr and oc ecr the bond strength of scac ecr is averagely 14 higher than that of oc ecr due to the micro cracking of concrete the bond strength increases with the increase of scac cover thickness and the decrease of bond length 3 the bond slip curve is divided into micro slipping slipping and declining stages the curve curvature of specimen adopting scac and or is low compared to other specimens however the decline of scac pull out specimen curve is more rapid than that of oc pull out specimen curve the higher bond length is the more rapid decline of curve is furthermore the bond stress distributes non uniformly along the bond length 4 an analytical formula for bond strength of scac ecr is presented furthermore the bond slip relation of specimen is suggested it provides a basis for the application of reinforced scac structures credit authorship contribution statement ruifeng nie writing review editing investigation yijie huang

21814,based on wave measurements lasting four and a half years wave characteristics in a lagoon of the south china sea are discussed in this paper the significant wave height h s mean periods t z and wind speed w s are mostly smaller than 1 m 6 s and 15 m s respectively based on the monthly average h s there exists a transition season between winter and summer in the first half of the year waves of the transition season are very small which is helpful for fishing and tourism to characterize the seasonal cycle of wind and waves a monsoon index based on the h s and the wind direction w d is proposed it is verified by the monthly average air temperature finally waves of winter monsoon indexes 0 25 are studied in detail it shows that most of these waves come from the north and are driven by the northeast monsoon and the cold air from the mainland of china besides locally generated fetch waves are common in winter these waves can be identified by the gaussian kernel clustering method the relationship between peak energy density s f p and g 1 2 h s 5 2 is also verified for these waves keywords reef lagoon wind wave season index south china sea 1 introduction in the south china sea a lagoon surrounded by reefs and islands is a common topography waves in the lagoon are mostly much smaller than those outside the lagoon up to 86 of wave energy is attenuated when waves enter the lagoon roberts et al 1992 thus waves in the reef lagoon are meaningful in coral reef protection and ocean structure design ding et al 2017 wu et al 2018 because of the complicated topography waves inside a lagoon are quite different from those in the open seas in some cases waves from the open sea dominate the lagoon in other cases these waves are shielded by the reefs and islands and local wind waves dominate the lagoon for the waves from the open sea diffraction plays the most important role when they enter the lagoon wave diffraction was widely studied in recent decades abohadima and isobe 1999 bai and taylor 2007 isaacson and cheung 1991 lee et al 2003 nwogu 1993 tang and ouellet 1997 wu et al 2016 yu 1981 empirical formulas were put forward for wave diffraction of simple topography yu 1981 numerical models such as the mild slope equation mle and the boussinesq equation were successfully employed in wave diffraction of complex terrain abohadima and isobe 1999 lee et al 2003 nwogu 1993 tang and ouellet 1997 wu et al 2016 due to roughness and steep slope the wave breaking and bottom friction also play important roles in the wave propagation cai et al 2019 cheriton et al 2016 gallop et al 2014 gourlay 1994 huang et al 2012 kench and brander 2006 lentz et al 2016 liu et al 2019 lowe et al 2005 monismith et al 2013 monismith et al 2015 péquignet et al 2011 ryan j lowe and stephen g monismith 2005 besides typhoon waves in the lagoon are of interests and many researches were made cai et al 2020 kjerfve and dinnel 1983 kjerfve et al 1986 ou et al 2002 oudart et al sun et al 2019 these researches rich our knowledge of the waves of a lagoon even so there is a lack of systematic study of the seasonal cycle of waves in a reef lagoon in the south china sea the climate is dominated by the monsoon in winter the northeast monsoon plays the major role and the cold air from the mainland of china has a big impact on the waves in summer the southwest monsoon plays the major role at the same time typhoons occur frequently this season our attention is focused on a lagoon at the north of the south china sea it is about 25000 m long and 15000 m wide due to the attenuation by the reefs and islands waves of the lagoon are much smaller than those in the open sea it brings the potential advantages for fishing and tourism even though the lagoon is somehow undeveloped these waves either come from the open sea or are generated locally some characteristics of these waves were studied in our previous works for waves from the open sea the wave energy attenuation was estimated by observations and simulations cai et al 2019 based on a series of observations extreme waves caused by the storms are discussed in detail cai et al 2020 it shows that the storm waves are generated locally at the approaching stage and come from the open sea at the leaving stage based on our experiments waves of winter are also impressive these waves normally are not as large as the storm waves but they last for a long time waves caused by the strong cold air may last for a week or more furthermore there are some months when the waves are very small that the sea as smooth as a mirror the wave characteristics vary from season to season it is of great interest to study the season characteristics and the waves of winter in this paper the characteristics of waves in the lagoon are estimated in detail based on it we find a transition season in the first half year and propose a monsoon index waves of winter are also identified and discussed by the monsoon index in section 2 an overall description of the in situ experiment is presented analysis of wind and wave parameters is given in section 3 the monthly analysis is presented in section 4 and waves in winter are studied in section 5 finally the conclusions are drawn 2 experimental setup and data an experiment from june 2014 to september 2018 was conducted in a reef lagoon as showed in fig 1 and fig 2 the lagoon is surrounded by the ocean the depth of the measurement site is approximately 25 m and the average depth of the lagoon is approximately 30 m the site is selected because there used to be a lot of coral however many of these corals died for varying reasons see fig 3 the original goal of this experiment focused on the influence of corals on waves cai et al 2019 liu et al 2019 storm waves are also one of the major topics see the best tracks in fig 1 cai et al 2020 as a result the site is close to the island surly the local geometry plays an important role in the wave characteristics we should always take care of the influence of geometry when we investigate the waves of the lagoon the experiment was described in detail in our previous paper cai et al 2020 information about the instruments is given in table 1 a total of 10 262 samples with 3 h intervals were obtained by the buoy and the awac profiler 3 wave characteristics 3 1 wind speed significant wave height h s and mean period t z distributions of h s are given in fig 4 all the heavy seas h s 1 5 m are driven by typhoons such as kalmaegi and doksuri these waves were studied in detail in our previous paper cai et al 2020 the largest h s is 2 79 m which happened on 14 september 2017 when typhoon doksuri passed by mostly the h s are smaller than 1 m fig 5 shows the distributions of t z the t z varies from 2 s to 6 s it seems that the t z in winter is smaller and more concentrated than that in summer fig 6 shows the distributions of wind speed winds with speeds larger than 20 m s are caused by three powerful typhoons which are similar to the waves mostly the wind speeds are smaller than 15 m s 3 2 wind direction and peak wave direction a seasonal cycle of wind directions is shown in fig 7 in winter the sea is dominated by the northeast monsoon and the cold air from the mainland of china and east winds are common in summer the sea is driven by the southwest monsoon and typhoons and south winds are common the topography has a greater influence on directions of wave than those of wind the rose diagram of fig 8 indicates that most waves are alongshore besides waves from the northeast and southwest are most common in winter and summer respectively the difference between the directions of wind and wave can be explained by the topography shown in fig 2 in winter westward waves from the open sea are sheltered by the reefs waves at the site are mostly generated from the northeast of the lagoon in which direction the fetch is large enough for wave developing in summary waves from the open sea enter the lagoon through the south entrances of the lagoon due to the diffraction of the island the wave directions change the wave direction is sensitive to the topography and it varies from place to place as a result it is almost impossible to find a location that can be representative for the whole lagoon we should always take care of the influence of geometry when we investigate the waves in the lagoon 4 monthly distribution and the season index to characterize the seasonal cycle of wind and waves monthly distributions of wind and wave parameters are discussed in this section 4 1 monthly distribution the monthly average and maximum values of wind speed are given in fig 9 the monthly average wind speeds show a w shaped pattern the monthly average wind speeds in november and december are larger than those in summer except those caused by typhoons kujira and doksuri the monthly maximum wind speeds do not vary much from month to month extreme wind mostly happens in summer while winds in winter have a greater average speed it is reasonable as gales caused by typhoons last for a few days while breezes caused by the northeast monsoon or the cold air often last up to a week or more monthly averages of h s also show a w shaped pattern see fig 10 left the monthly average h s in winter are similar to those in summer the monthly average h s from march to may are very small it indicates that there is a transition season between winter and summer in transition season the northeast monsoon weakens and the southwest monsoon is not formed yet due to the small winds and waves it is suitable to fish and travel in this season maximum significant wave heights of fig 10 right suggest that typhoons have greater influences on waves than winds monthly maximum significant wave heights of summer are mostly greater than those of winter monthly averages of t z are given in fig 11 as mentioned before t z in winter is smaller than that in summer in our previous paper typhoon waves in summer were discussed in detail it shows that waves can be divided into waves generated inside the lagoon and waves from the open sea the peak periods of waves from the open sea are concentrated around 10 s which makes the t z greater in winter we suggest that waves are mostly generated in the lagoon which makes the wave periods vary from 2 s to 5 s this suggestion will be verified in the following section the monthly averages of wind and wave directions are given in fig 12 the seasonal characteristics of wind and wave directions are discussed above in the transition season the wind directions change from the northeast to the south 4 2 the monsoon index li and zeng li and zeng 2002 proposed a monsoon based on the wind field however the transition season cannot be distinguished by their monsoon index and the seasonal cycle of waves was neglected inspired by li and zeng li and zeng 2002 a monsoon index based on h s and w d is proposed to characterize the seasonal cycle of wind and waves 1 λ cos w d w d 1 w d 7 w d 1 180 h s h s 4 h s 7 h s 4 where w d 1 w d 7 are the wind directions in january and july respectively h s 4 and h s 7 are the h s in april and july respectively the superscript means the average over 30 days as shown in fig 13 the monsoon indexes of winter and summer are approximately 1 and 1 respectively in the transition season the monsoon index is close to zero in this paper λ 0 25 is employed to delimit the winter summer and the transition season see table 2 the monthly average air temperature is employed to verify the monsoon index in fig 14 the variance curve of monthly average air temperature conforms to that of the monsoon index and the monthly average air temperature increases with the monsoon index as the air temperature increases during the transition season a phase difference between them occurs as a result the distribution is scattered and the dashed line of fig 14 right represents only the general trend of these two quantities in general characteristics of the air temperature can be captured by the monsoon index 5 waves in winter waves of summer are mostly driven by the typhoons these waves were studied in our previous paper cai et al 2020 waves of the transition season are worthless since the wave heights of which are so small in this section we will focus on the waves in winter and 3390 samples are selected by the standard λ 0 25 most of the waves of winter come from the north and are driven by the northeast monsoon and the cold air from the mainland of china the relationship of h s and t p is given in fig 15 most of the samples are located around a line to select these samples the gaussian kernel clustering method is employed and 2505 samples are selected however some samples around the line are out of selection which shows the limits of the gaussian kernel clustering method waves of groups 1 are employed to verify the fetch limited theory young 1999 2 ε 7 5 10 7 χ 0 8 ν 2 00 χ 0 25 and donelan et al 1985 3 ε 6 365 10 6 ν 3 3 where 4 ε h s 2 g 2 16 w s 4 ν w s f p g χ g x w s 2 are the non dimensional wave energy peak frequency and fetch respectively the fetch is calculated by the outlines of the lagoon see fig 2 the good agreement between the observations and the empirical relationship suggests that the waves were mostly locally generated fetch waves see fig 16 non dimensional spectra of waves of group 1 are given in fig 17 left note that spectra between 3 december 2017 and 5 december 2017 and after 18 december 2018 were lost the spectra are of the form αf 4 when f f p which is known as the equilibrium range cai et al 2020 since the equilibrium range of the observed spectra starts at the peak frequencies the maximum spectral density can be estimated by cai et al 2020 5 s f p a g 1 2 h s 5 2 where a is a constant the empirical relationship is also validated using the waves of group 1 in fig 17 right the good agreement between the observations and eq 5 indicates that there is an internal drive that exists to balance the total energy and the maximum energy density of the waves 6 conclusions observations of waves in a lagoon of the south china sea are used to make some studies in support of the following conclusion 1 time distributions of h s t z and w s are given based on our data according to the results waves with h s 1 5 m and winds with w s 20 m s are caused by the typhoons the t z in winter is smaller and more concentrated than that in summer the distributions of significant wave height h s mean periods t z and wind speed w s show that these quantities are mostly smaller than 1 m 6 s and 15 m s which refers to a mild sea condition 2 distributions of wind and wave directions show that the sea is dominated by east winds and northeast waves in winter and is dominated by south winds and southwest waves in summer 3 monthly distributions of average and maximum w s indicate that extreme winds are mostly caused by typhoons in summer while winds in winter have a greater average speed the monthly average h s from march to may are very small which indicates that there is a transition season between winter and summer 4 a monsoon index based on the h s and the w d is proposed to characterize the seasonal cycle of wind and waves and the monthly average air temperature is employed to verify the monsoon index 5 for most of the waves in winter t p and h s are located around a line 2505 samples around this line are selected by the gaussian kernel clustering method these waves are locally generated fetch waves also the relationship between peak energy density s f p and g 1 2 h s 5 2 is verified for these waves credit authorship contribution statement z w cai conceptualization methodology formal analysis

inside a lagoon are quite different from those in the open seas in some cases waves from the open sea dominate the lagoon in other cases these waves are shielded by the reefs and islands and local wind waves dominate the lagoon for the waves from the open sea diffraction plays the most important role when they enter the lagoon wave diffraction was widely studied in recent decades abohadima and isobe 1999 bai and taylor 2007 isaacson and cheung 1991 lee et al 2003 nwogu 1993 tang and ouellet 1997 wu et al 2016 yu 1981 empirical formulas were put forward for wave diffraction of simple topography yu 1981 numerical models such as the mild slope equation mle and the boussinesq equation were successfully employed in wave diffraction of complex terrain abohadima and isobe 1999 lee et al 2003 nwogu 1993 tang and ouellet 1997 wu et al 2016 due to roughness and steep slope the wave breaking and bottom friction also play important roles in the wave propagation cai et al 2019 cheriton et al 2016 gallop et al 2014 gourlay 1994 huang et al 2012 kench and brander 2006 lentz et al 2016 liu et al 2019 lowe et al 2005 monismith et al 2013 monismith et al 2015 péquignet et al 2011 ryan j lowe and stephen g monismith 2005 besides typhoon waves in the lagoon are of interests and many researches were made cai et al 2020 kjerfve and dinnel 1983 kjerfve et al 1986 ou et al 2002 oudart et al sun et al 2019 these researches rich our knowledge of the waves of a lagoon even so there is a lack of systematic study of the seasonal cycle of waves in a reef lagoon in the south china sea the climate is dominated by the monsoon in winter the northeast monsoon plays the major role and the cold air from the mainland of china has a big impact on the waves in summer the southwest monsoon plays the major role at the same time typhoons occur frequently this season our attention is focused on a lagoon at the north of the south china sea it is about 25000 m long and 15000 m wide due to the attenuation by the reefs and islands waves of the lagoon are much smaller than those in the open sea it brings the potential advantages for fishing and tourism even though the lagoon is somehow undeveloped these waves either come from the open sea or are generated locally some characteristics of these waves were studied in our previous works for waves from the open sea the wave energy attenuation was estimated by observations and simulations cai et al 2019 based on a series of observations extreme waves caused by the storms are discussed in detail cai et al 2020 it shows that the storm waves are generated locally at the approaching stage and come from the open sea at the leaving stage based on our experiments waves of winter are also impressive these waves normally are not as large as the storm waves but they last for a long time waves caused by the strong cold air may last for a week or more furthermore there are some months when the waves are very small that the sea as smooth as a mirror the wave characteristics vary from season to season it is of great interest to study the season characteristics and the waves of winter in this paper the characteristics of waves in the lagoon are estimated in detail based on it we find a transition season in the first half year and propose a monsoon index waves of winter are also identified and discussed by the monsoon index in section 2 an overall description of the in situ experiment is presented analysis of wind and wave parameters is given in section 3 the monthly analysis is presented in section 4 and waves in winter are studied in section 5 finally the conclusions are drawn 2 experimental setup and data an experiment from june 2014 to september 2018 was conducted in a reef lagoon as showed in fig 1 and fig 2 the lagoon is surrounded by the ocean the depth of the measurement site is approximately 25 m and the average depth of the lagoon is approximately 30 m the site is selected because there used to be a lot of coral however many of these corals died for varying reasons see fig 3 the original goal of this experiment focused on the influence of corals on waves cai et al 2019 liu et al 2019 storm waves are also one of the major topics see the best tracks in fig 1 cai et al 2020 as a result the site is close to the island surly the local geometry plays an important role in the wave characteristics we should always take care of the influence of geometry when we investigate the waves of the lagoon the experiment was described in detail in our previous paper cai et al 2020 information about the instruments is given in table 1 a total of 10 262 samples with 3 h intervals were obtained by the buoy and the awac profiler 3 wave characteristics 3 1 wind speed significant wave height h s and mean period t z distributions of h s are given in fig 4 all the heavy seas h s 1 5 m are driven by typhoons such as kalmaegi and doksuri these waves were studied in detail in our previous paper cai et al 2020 the largest h s is 2 79 m which happened on 14 september 2017 when typhoon doksuri passed by mostly the h s are smaller than 1 m fig 5 shows the distributions of t z the t z varies from 2 s to 6 s it seems that the t z in winter is smaller and more concentrated than that in summer fig 6 shows the distributions of wind speed winds with speeds larger than 20 m s are caused by three powerful typhoons which are similar to the waves mostly the wind speeds are smaller than 15 m s 3 2 wind direction and peak wave direction a seasonal cycle of wind directions is shown in fig 7 in winter the sea is dominated by the northeast monsoon and the cold air from the mainland of china and east winds are common in summer the sea is driven by the southwest monsoon and typhoons and south winds are common the topography has a greater influence on directions of wave than those of wind the rose diagram of fig 8 indicates that most waves are alongshore besides waves from the northeast and southwest are most common in winter and summer respectively the difference between the directions of wind and wave can be explained by the topography shown in fig 2 in winter westward waves from the open sea are sheltered by the reefs waves at the site are mostly generated from the northeast of the lagoon in which direction the fetch is large enough for wave developing in summary waves from the open sea enter the lagoon through the south entrances of the lagoon due to the diffraction of the island the wave directions change the wave direction is sensitive to the topography and it varies from place to place as a result it is almost impossible to find a location that can be representative for the whole lagoon we should always take care of the influence of geometry when we investigate the waves in the lagoon 4 monthly distribution and the season index to characterize the seasonal cycle of wind and waves monthly distributions of wind and wave parameters are discussed in this section 4 1 monthly distribution the monthly average and maximum values of wind speed are given in fig 9 the monthly average wind speeds show a w shaped pattern the monthly average wind speeds in november and december are larger than those in summer except those caused by typhoons kujira and doksuri the monthly maximum wind speeds do not vary much from month to month extreme wind mostly happens in summer while winds in winter have a greater average speed it is reasonable as gales caused by typhoons last for a few days while breezes caused by the northeast monsoon or the cold air often last up to a week or more monthly averages of h s also show a w shaped pattern see fig 10 left the monthly average h s in winter are similar to those in summer the monthly average h s from march to may are very small it indicates that there is a transition season between winter and summer in transition season the northeast monsoon weakens and the southwest monsoon is not formed yet due to the small winds and waves it is suitable to fish and travel in this season maximum significant wave heights of fig 10 right suggest that typhoons have greater influences on waves than winds monthly maximum significant wave heights of summer are mostly greater than those of winter monthly averages of t z are given in fig 11 as mentioned before t z in winter is smaller than that in summer in our previous paper typhoon waves in summer were discussed in detail it shows that waves can be divided into waves generated inside the lagoon and waves from the open sea the peak periods of waves from the open sea are concentrated around 10 s which makes the t z greater in winter we suggest that waves are mostly generated in the lagoon which makes the wave periods vary from 2 s to 5 s this suggestion will be verified in the following section the monthly averages of wind and wave directions are given in fig 12 the seasonal characteristics of wind and wave directions are discussed above in the transition season the wind directions change from the northeast to the south 4 2 the monsoon index li and zeng li and zeng 2002 proposed a monsoon based on the wind field however the transition season cannot be distinguished by their monsoon index and the seasonal cycle of waves was neglected inspired by li and zeng li and zeng 2002 a monsoon index based on h s and w d is proposed to characterize the seasonal cycle of wind and waves 1 λ cos w d w d 1 w d 7 w d 1 180 h s h s 4 h s 7 h s 4 where w d 1 w d 7 are the wind directions in january and july respectively h s 4 and h s 7 are the h s in april and july respectively the superscript means the average over 30 days as shown in fig 13 the monsoon indexes of winter and summer are approximately 1 and 1 respectively in the transition season the monsoon index is close to zero in this paper λ 0 25 is employed to delimit the winter summer and the transition season see table 2 the monthly average air temperature is employed to verify the monsoon index in fig 14 the variance curve of monthly average air temperature conforms to that of the monsoon index and the monthly average air temperature increases with the monsoon index as the air temperature increases during the transition season a phase difference between them occurs as a result the distribution is scattered and the dashed line of fig 14 right represents only the general trend of these two quantities in general characteristics of the air temperature can be captured by the monsoon index 5 waves in winter waves of summer are mostly driven by the typhoons these waves were studied in our previous paper cai et al 2020 waves of the transition season are worthless since the wave heights of which are so small in this section we will focus on the waves in winter and 3390 samples are selected by the standard λ 0 25 most of the waves of winter come from the north and are driven by the northeast monsoon and the cold air from the mainland of china the relationship of h s and t p is given in fig 15 most of the samples are located around a line to select these samples the gaussian kernel clustering method is employed and 2505 samples are selected however some samples around the line are out of selection which shows the limits of the gaussian kernel clustering method waves of groups 1 are employed to verify the fetch limited theory young 1999 2 ε 7 5 10 7 χ 0 8 ν 2 00 χ 0 25 and donelan et al 1985 3 ε 6 365 10 6 ν 3 3 where 4 ε h s 2 g 2 16 w s 4 ν w s f p g χ g x w s 2 are the non dimensional wave energy peak frequency and fetch respectively the fetch is calculated by the outlines of the lagoon see fig 2 the good agreement between the observations and the empirical relationship suggests that the waves were mostly locally generated fetch waves see fig 16 non dimensional spectra of waves of group 1 are given in fig 17 left note that spectra between 3 december 2017 and 5 december 2017 and after 18 december 2018 were lost the spectra are of the form αf 4 when f f p which is known as the equilibrium range cai et al 2020 since the equilibrium range of the observed spectra starts at the peak frequencies the maximum spectral density can be estimated by cai et al 2020 5 s f p a g 1 2 h s 5 2 where a is a constant the empirical relationship is also validated using the waves of group 1 in fig 17 right the good agreement between the observations and eq 5 indicates that there is an internal drive that exists to balance the total energy and the maximum energy density of the waves 6 conclusions observations of waves in a lagoon of the south china sea are used to make some studies in support of the following conclusion 1 time distributions of h s t z and w s are given based on our data according to the results waves with h s 1 5 m and winds with w s 20 m s are caused by the typhoons the t z in winter is smaller and more concentrated than that in summer the distributions of significant wave height h s mean periods t z and wind speed w s show that these quantities are mostly smaller than 1 m 6 s and 15 m s which refers to a mild sea condition 2 distributions of wind and wave directions show that the sea is dominated by east winds and northeast waves in winter and is dominated by south winds and southwest waves in summer 3 monthly distributions of average and maximum w s indicate that extreme winds are mostly caused by typhoons in summer while winds in winter have a greater average speed the monthly average h s from march to may are very small which indicates that there is a transition season between winter and summer 4 a monsoon index based on the h s and the w d is proposed to characterize the seasonal cycle of wind and waves and the monthly average air temperature is employed to verify the monsoon index 5 for most of the waves in winter t p and h s are located around a line 2505 samples around this line are selected by the gaussian kernel clustering method these waves are locally generated fetch waves also the relationship between peak energy density s f p and g 1 2 h s 5 2 is verified for these waves credit authorship contribution statement z w cai conceptualization methodology formal analysis
