10480,the study of water nitrogen n interaction to improve crop drought resistance and reduce environmental pollution has increasingly become a hot topic however the response of yield and quality of paddy rice and upland rice to n nutrition under different irrigation regimes is little known continuous flooding cultivation cf control and bare dry cultivation bd were used to cultivate paddy rice cultivar yangjing 687 japonica and upland rice cultivar zhonghan 3 japonica and 3 n application rates 140 low n ln 210 normal n nn and 280 kg ha 1 high n hn were set for each irrigation regime the results showed that under bd and cf irrigation regimes the yield of paddy rice was the highest at nn while that of upland rice was the highest at bd with nn and at cf with hn breakdown viscosity was the highest and setback viscosity was the lowest for paddy rice at ln and for upland rice at nn increasing n application the chalky kernels percentage and the chalkiness of upland rice increased first and then decreased while that of paddy rice decreased under bd and increased under cf compared with cf bd made the seed setting percentage and 1000 grain weight of upland rice and paddy rice different and improved the appearance and nutritional quality of upland rice the correlation between the cooking and nutritional quality and leaf n content of upland rice was lower than that of paddy rice these results suggest that the yield and cooking quality of upland rice were high under bd with nn and the paddy rice yield was high under bd with nn or cf with nn keywords rice irrigation regime nitrogen application rate yield quality 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is one of the most important food crops in the world and the most important staple food in asia with population growth and rapid economic development increasing grain yield and improving grain quality has become a top priority in china zhang 2007 peng et al 2009 rice is also the main irrigation crop the traditional submerged cultivation of paddy rice not only consumes a large amount of water and has a low water use efficiency but also causes environmental pollution bouman and tuong 2001 for example under continuous flooding conditions paddy fields are the main source of ch4 emissions from farmland soils accounting for about 15 20 of the global total emissions yan et al 2005 previous studies have shown that paddy rice has a certain amphibious type of water and drought and has great potential for water saving bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2005 upland rice has strong drought resistance and low water requirement and is an ideal dry food crop marschner 1978 especially suitable for cultivation in arid and hilly and low mountain areas a large number of upland rice varieties have been cultivated by the international rice research institute and other institutions chinese scientists have also developed a number of water saving and drought resistant upland rice varieties especially in the breeding of japonica upland rice varieties which have reached the international advanced level and their yield and quality are approaching those of paddy rice varieties bouman et al 2006 atlin et al 2013 at present more and more researchers pay attention to the research and application of paddy rice dry cultivation technology fan et al 2005 zhang et al 2005 2013 sun et al 2012 mahmod et al 2014 yuan et al 2014 2017 most studies have shown that water saving cultivation could promote the growth and development of paddy rice increase effective tillers and increase yield liang et al 1999 wang et al 2016 while some studies show the opposite zhang et al 2019 alternating wetting and drying awd technology has little effect on yield of paddy rice yang et al 2007 ye et al 2013 chu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 upland rice can be used as a substitute for partially submerged paddy rice cultivation in dry land hillside land or low lying areas where rainfall is stable but irrigation conditions are lacking tabbal et al 2002 kukal et al 2005 tuong et al 2005 these measures not only play an active role in stabilizing and promoting food production but also play an important role in improving the utilization rate of water resources reducing a series of environmental problems caused by flooding paddy rice cultivation yang et al 2007 wang et al 2016 christy et al 2018 and promoting the sustainable development of agriculture as for the relationship between irrigation regimes and protein previous studies have suggested that the protein content of brown rice is higher and the nutritional quality of brown rice is improved under dry cultivation conditions or when the soil moisture content is low but the cooking quality of rice is affected chen et al 2012 cai et al 2004 in addition to water nitrogen n is the most important element affecting crop growth and the most important nutrient limiting factor for crop yield formation n application can significantly improve crop yield without the application of n fertilizer the global food supply of 7 billion people can not be maintained and the food problem of nearly 1 4 billion people in china can not be solved it is estimated that the application of n fertilizer feeds 48 of the world s current population erisman et al 2008 however according to the survey the apparent n utilization rate of rice in china in the past 10 years is only 39 yu and shi 2015 and the average apparent n recovery rate in the world is only 33 garnett et al 2009 the low utilization rate of n fertilizer not only causes a huge waste of resources and financial resources but also has a negative impact on the environment and the safety of agricultural products water and nutrients and their interaction are important factors affecting crop yield and quality benbi 1989 the research on the interaction of water and n to improve crop adaptation to drought stress has increasingly become the focus of nutritional physiological regulation but the conclusions are different many studies have shown that appropriate n fertilizer can improve crop drought tolerance improve fertilizer efficiency and water saving and increase grain yield yang et al 1996 liu et al 2013 yang 2015 but d k bhan and misra 1970 believe that increasing n fertilizer application under limited soil moisture may aggravate water stress and adversely affect crop yields you et al 2006 study showed that increasing n application significantly increased the crude protein content chalky kernels rate and chalkiness of rice and reduced the amylose content under the same irrigation mode and water saving irrigation significantly increased amylose content and chalkiness and reduced the crude protein content of rice at the same n level but there are also studies suggested that different irrigation and fertilization treatments had no significant effect on amylose content of hybrid early rice and had a significant effect on protein content cheng et al 2001 as for the effects of irrigation regime soil moisture nitrogen application and their interaction on rice yield and quality most of the previous studies used paddy rice as the test material and the research conclusions are different there are few comparative studies on the effects of irrigation regime nitrogen application and interaction on the yield and quality of upland rice and paddy rice it is hypothesized that the water and nitrogen management of upland rice and paddy rice are reasonably coordinated the yield quality water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency of rice can be improved and the sustainable development of agriculture can be promoted however the evidence is very scarce in this regard the objectives of this study were to investigate the differences of yield and quality between paddy rice and upland rice under the two irrigation regimes bare dry cultivation bd belong to the awd and continuous flooding cultivaiton cf control and 3 n application rates 140 low n ln 210 normal n nn and 280 kg ha 1 high n hn were set for each irrigation regime yield and its components earing rate leaf n content adventitious roots the chlorophyll content spad value after anthesis nutritional quality appearance quality and cooking and eating quality were determined which were closely related to yield formation and grain quality this study would provide guidance for fertilizer saving water saving rice cultivation and sustainable agricultural development and further understand the growth mechanism of rice under the interaction of water and n 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and study site description the experiment was conducted in the rice growing season may october at the research farm of yangzhou university jiangsu province china 32 30 n 119 25 e in 2016 and 2017 the paddy rice cultivar yangjing 687 japonica and the upland rice cultivar zhonghan 3 japonica were used as materials the cultivated soil layer was sandy loam typic ﬂuvaquents entisols u s taxonomy with available n p k at 108 2 25 8 and 97 3 mg kg 1 respectively organic matter 21 6 g kg 1 soil bulk density 1 37 g cm 3 and ph value 7 5 the monthly total precipitation mean air temperature and total sunshine hours of rice growing season in two experimental years were measured at the meteorological station near the test site table 1 2 2 treatments 2 2 3 two cultivars two irrigation regimes and three n levels design was conducted the experiment was laid out in a randomized split plot design with 3 replications dry tillage followed by bed making the plot occupies an area of 1 6m 5 0m there was a lane 1 0 m wide between the main plots and plastic film was inserted into the soil 0 5 m deep to form a barrier subplots were separated by a bund wrapped in plastic film 0 4 m wide fig 1 the two irrigation regimes were continuous flooding cultivation cf and bare dry cultivation bd the traditional way of rice submergence cultivation is cf during rice growth which not only consumes a lot of water but also pollutes the environment easily one week before harvesting cf kept 2 3 cm water layer flooded continuously until water was cut off the awd is to irrigate 2 3 cm shallow water when rice reaches the soil water potential swp index monitored by tensiometer in each rice growth period this method can be used to study and analyze the operation and relationship of water in the soil plant atmosphere continuum on a unified scale so as to greatly reduce the pollution of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to the environment in the treatment of bd belonging to awd the cultivated land was prepared first and then the 1 6m 5 0m wide boundary surface was manually fabricated under bd 2 3 cm water layer was maintained within 7 days after transplantation in order to regreen the seedlings after that the water supply of bd treatment was controlled four soil tensiometers nanjing institute of soil sciences were used to monitor swp at a depth of 15 20 cm in each bd plot which were read at 1200 h every day when the swp of bd plot reaches 20 kpa soil moisture concentration was 0 165 g g 1 depth was 15 20 cm and there was no precipitation it is irrigated with 2 0 2 5 cm thin water layer according to our previous research work 20 kpa swp would not seriously reduce grain production yang et al 2007 irrigation water consumption was monitored by a flowmeter installed in the irrigation pipeline lxsg 50 flowmeter water meter manufacturing plant shanghai china each plot had its own irrigation or drainage system fig 1 because the rainfall in the growing season of 2016 706 9 mm was higher than that in 2017 669 4 mm the irrigation amount in 2016 was 1 2 time s less than that in 2017 table 1 potassium chloride and calcium superphosphate were used as base fertilizer and the application rates were 300 and 375 kg ha 1 respectively excessive application of n fertilizer will not only lead to the increase of ineffective tillers late ripening lodging and aggravation of diseases and insect pests but also lead to the increase of empty grains and the decrease of seed setting rate which will affect the yield of rice if the application amount of n fertilizer is too small rice yield will not reach its potential only proper application of n fertilizer can not only increase rice yield but also increase n use efficiency the 3 levels of n application were designed as 140 low n ln 210 normal n nn and 280 kg ha 1 high n hn respectively and the ratio of base fertilizer to tiller fertilizer and panicle fertilizer was 5 2 3 the two varieties were sown on may 14 and seedlings were raised under dry farming conditions they were transplanted from june 14 16 both 2016 and 2017 the row spacing was 25 cm 10

45 days after transplanting in 2016 and 46 days after transplanting in 2017 leaf water potential of fully expanded leaves at the top of stems was measured when the swp in the center of the bd plot was about 20 kpa d the plants were rewatered w 46 days after transplanting in 2016 and 47 days after transplanting in 2017 three pressure chambers model 3000 soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara california usa were used to measure leaf water potential with six leaves for each plot twenty plants were labeled in each plot and the stem and tillering dynamics were observed every 5 7 days from transplanting to heading the percentage of effective panicles to the highest number of tillers tillers at jointing stage was the percentage of panicles based on the average number of effective tillers at jointing stage heading stage and maturity stage five representative holes excluding rows at the boundary were selected from each plot to dig out the roots of the soil the soil volume around the roots was 10 8 5 20 cm with a spade then the roots and aboveground organs of each plant were separated from the stem base the roots were carefully rinsed with a hydropneumatic elutriation device gillison s variety fabrications benzonia mi usa to determine the number of adventitious roots by counting leaves of aboveground plants were separated and leaf dry matter drying at 70 c to constant weight was ground into fine powder by bead mill retsch model mm301 germany digested by micro kjeldahl digestion 2300 kjeltec analyzer unit foss tecator sweden method n content in leaves was determined by yoshida et al 1976 method the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of eight fully expanded flag leaves at 10 days after heading were measured by a portable chlorophyll luminescence meter pam 2100 walz company germany the spad values of 10 fully expanded flag leaves were measured by chlorophyll meter spad 502 soil and plant analyzer development tokyo japan in each plot at 10 20 30 and 40 d after heading avoiding leaf veins the average value measured at 1 3 to 1 2 of the tip of leaf was the spad value of each flag leaf the grain yield was calculated by randomly selecting 50 holes and harvesting excluding boundary rows in each plot at the maturity stage for the two varieties the moisture content of the harvested grains was adjusted to 14 moisture the grain yield components were panicles per unit area spikelets per panicle seed setting percentage and 1000 grain weight moisture content 14 specific gravity 1 06 g cm 3 the percentage of ripened grains was full grains specific gravity 1 06 g cm 3 to total number of spikelets multiply by 100 spikelets per panicle grain yield per unit area panicles per unit area 1000 grain weight seed setting percentage according to the rice quality measurement standard ministry of agriculture p r china 1988 about 500 g grains harvested at maturity stage in each plot were dried in forced air oven at 40 c and then used for rice quality analysis 150 g grain samples were passed through the dehusker twice head rice was a grain whose length reaches three fourths or more of the average length of a complete grain koutroubas et al 2004 the length and width of 10 rice grains in each plot were measured by vernier caliper the chalkiness of 100 abrasive grains in each plot was evaluated by visual measurement grains containing more than 20 whiteness of the center belly and back or combinations of these are considered chalky grains the degree of chalkiness was the percentage of chalky area of chalky rice to the total area of grain protein content and amylose content were measured with a grain analyzer infratec 1241 foss denmark the representative milled rice samples were dried to constant weight in oven at 60 c then ground with stainless steel grinder and 0 25 mm sieve fw 100 china for further analysis of starch viscosity international organisation for standardisation iso 6647 1987e 1987 the parameters measured by rapid viscosity analyzer rva reflect the gelatinization disintegration expansion and gelatinization ability of starch which was usually used to evaluate the cooking quality of rice zhang et al 2008 in this experiment the viscosity properties of starch were measured using a rva model rva 3d newport scientific sydney australia and analyzed by tcw thermal cycle for windows software the characteristic values of starch viscosity were spectroscopic characteristic values of rice rva viscosity the unit of viscosity was cp the breakdown viscosity was calculated by subtracting the hot viscosity from the

upland rice increasing n application the yield of upland rice increased more than that of paddy rice table 2 also shows that increasing n application the panicle numbers of paddy rice and upland rice increased under the two irrigation regimes under bd the differences of seed setting percentage for paddy rice and upland rice between hn and nn were not significant but they were significantly lower than ln the 1000 grain weight of upland rice was significantly higher at hn and nn than that at ln and the 1000 grain weight of paddy rice decreased significantly under cf the seed setting percentage of upland rice the seed setting percentage and 1000 grain weight of paddy rice decreased significantly under bd the number of panicles of upland rice was significantly less and the seed setting percentage was significantly higher and the difference of 1000 grain weight and grain number per panicle was not significant and the 1000 grain weight and the number of panicles of paddy rice were significantly reduced compared to cf upland rice had fewer panicles smaller panicle type higher seed setting percentage and more 1000 grain weight compared with paddy rice there were significant differences among the 3 n levels and n levels and irrigation regimes had significant interactions on grain yield and its components p 0 05 table 2 3 3 stem tiller dynamics and adventitious root number

rice fig 3 the panicle number of paddy rice and upland rice under bd decreased by 10 8 and 13 0 respectively compared to cf compared to paddy rice upland rice had poor tillering ability fewer panicles but higher panicle rate fig 3 table 3 shows that the number of adventitious roots per hole of paddy rice and upland rice at heading stage increased gradually increasing n application under the two irrigation regimes the adventitious roots of paddy rice and upland rice under bd were less than under cf the increase of adventitious roots of paddy rice from jointing stage to heading stage was lower than that of upland rice however the average number of adventitious roots at jointing and heading stages of paddy rice was 2 3 times of that of upland rice there were significant differences among the 3 n levels and n levels and irrigation regimes had significant interactions on adventitious roots number at jointing and heading stage p 0 05 table 3 3 4 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters spad value

and the effect of n application on photosynthesis capacity of upland rice after heading was greater than that of paddy rice fv fm and qp of upland rice were not significantly different between bd and cf but fv fm and qp of paddy rice under bd were significantly lower than under cf the effect of water stress on photosynthetic capacity of paddy rice was greater than that of upland rice table 3 the spad values of flag leaves of paddy rice and upland rice at 3 n levels increased first and then decreased after anthesis under two irrigation regimes the order of spad values of flag leaves at grain filling stage was hn nn ln fig 4 the average spad value of paddy rice in 0 10 days after anthesis was lower than that under cf and higher than that under cf in 20 40 days after anthesis while that of upland rice after anthesis under bd was lower than that under cf the spad value of flag leaf of paddy rice increased significantly in 10 40 days after anthesis than that of upland rice fig 4 n content in leaves of paddy rice and upland rice decreased gradually under bd and cf and the order of leaf n content at the 3 stages was hn nn ln table 3 there was no significant difference in the average n content of upland rice leaves between bd and cf while the average n content of paddy rice leaves under bd was significantly higher than that under cf the decreasing value of n content in upland rice leaves before heading was smaller than that of paddy rice and the decreasing value after heading was larger than that of paddy rice and the decreasing range increased by 30 7 there were significant differences between the two irrigation regimes among the 3 n levels and n levels and irrigation regimes had significant interactions on leaf nitrogen content at the 3 stages p 0 05 table 3 3 5 grain quality increasing n application chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of upland rice increased first and then decreased under bd and cf while chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of paddy rice decreased under bd and increased under cf and the kernel length kernel width was the opposite to that of chalkiness table 4 table 4 also showed that there were no significant differences in the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness for paddy rice and upland rice between bd and cf and the kernel length kernel width of paddy rice under bd was significantly higher than that under cf compared with paddy rice chalky kernels rate chalkiness and grain length grain width of upland rice increased by 31 4 30 2 and 66 1 respectively the appearance quality of upland rice was generally inferior to that of paddy rice table 4 under bd and cf with the increase of n application the protein content of upland rice and paddy rice increased and the amylose content was opposite under bd the protein content of upland rice was significantly higher than that under cf the amylose content and protein content of upland rice increased by 23 6 and 5 0 respectively compared with that of paddy rice tables 4 and 5 the breakdown viscosity was the highest and setback viscosity was the lowest for paddy rice under ln and for upland rice under nn table 5 also showed that the final viscosity and setback viscosity of upland rice and the final viscosity of paddy rice under bd were significantly higher than that under cf and the other rva spectral parameters had no significant difference between bd and cf the setback viscosity of paddy rice was 67 lower than that of upland rice and the taste quality of paddy rice was better than that of upland rice there were significant differences among the 3 n levels and there were significant interactions between n levels and irrigation regimes in amylose content protein content chalky kernels percentage chalkiness and starch viscosity p 0 05 tables 4 and 5 3 6 relationship between main grain quality and leaf n concentration the correlation analysis showed that the n content of leaves at the 3 stages and the decline value of n content of leaves after heading for the two cultivars were positively correlated with setback viscosity and protein content and was negatively correlated with breakdown viscosity and amylose content table 6 the correlation between n content in paddy rice leaves at 3 stages and the decrease of n content in leaves after heading and amylose content protein content setback viscosity and breakdown viscosity was higher and n content in paddy rice leaves was more closely related to cooking and nutritional quality than that in upland rice 4 discussion with regard to the effect of n nutrition on rice yield under different soil moisture conditions many studies have suggested that with the increase of n application the yield would increase and excessive n application resulted in a decrease in yield yang et al 1996 jiang et al 2004 you et al 2006 fageria et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 deng et al 2018 in the present study it was observed that under bd and cf irrigation regimes the yield of paddy rice was the highest at nn while that of upland rice was the highest at bd with nn and at cf with hn the results showed that under water restriction the effect of n fertilizer on improving the yield of paddy rice and upland rice was weakened this is consistent with the conclusions of niang et al 2018 this study also further verified the previous results but the optimal n application amount of the highest yield was different between upland rice and paddy rice the possible reason is that under cf panicle number per unit area of upland rice at hn was significantly larger than that at nn there was no significant difference in 1000 grain weight and grain number per panicle of upland rice between hn and nn and the seed setting percentage decreased slightly and the yield was significantly higher at hn than that at nn the number of adventitious roots of paddy rice was more than that of upland rice which had strong ability of absorbing n and more tillers however the significant increase of panicle number in paddy rice under cf with hn could not compensate for the loss of grain number per panicle seed setting percentage and 1000 grain weight resulting in a significant decrease in yield compared to that at nn the results of studies on the effects of n nutrition on the seed setting rate and 1000 grain weight of rice under different soil water conditions are different yang et al 1996 cai et al 2006 you et al 2006 shi et al 2001 the results of this study show that under bd and cf increasing n application the seed setting percentage of upland rice decreased significantly but the difference of 1000 grain weight was not significant between hn and nn while 1000 grain weight and the seed setting percentage of paddy rice decreased significantly there are two possible reasons first the average number of adventitious roots per hole for upland rice before jointing was about 1 2 1 3 of the number of adventitious roots for paddy rice table 3 resulting in weaker ability of n uptake and tilling than that in paddy rice fig 3 the canopy light transmittance of upland rice was better than that of paddy rice the effect of increasing n application on photosynthetic capacity of upland rice was greater and the accumulation of carbohydrates was relatively sufficient in addition the increase of adventitious roots of upland rice with hn from jointing to heading stage was significantly higher than that of paddy rice the increase of n uptake was more and the decrease of n content in leaves of upland rice from jointing to heading stage was lower than that of paddy rice table 3 this stage was the spikelets formation stage which leads to no difference in spikelets per panicle for upland rice between hn and nn under bd secondly compared to paddy rice the spad value of flag leaves and the n content in leaves of upland rice decreased faster after heading stage fig 4 a d and table 3 leaf color became lighter c n ratio and carbohydrate accumulation increased which was beneficial to grain filling lin 2000 there are different conclusions on the effect of n nutrition on the appearance quality of rice some studies have suggested that the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of rice increased with the increase of n application you et al 2006 chen et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 but there are also reports that the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of rice decrease with the increase of n application xu et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 cong et al 2017 dhillon et al 2018 this experiment showed that under bd and cf increasing n application chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of upland rice increased first and then decreased while that of paddy rice decreased under bd and increased under cf the kernel length kernel width of the two varieties was the opposite to that of chalkiness the results of this study are not consistent with those of predecessors the possible reasons are as follows first the bigger the length width ratio of grain the longer and narrower the grain the smaller the distance of grain filling material to the abdomen and the more complete the grain filling resulting in the decrease of the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness second chalkiness is a complex quality trait controlled by genotype and environment upland rice and paddy rice have different sensitivity to n and water there are also different conclusions about the effect of water saving irrigation on the chalkiness rate and chalkiness of rice some studies suggest that the chalkiness rate of rice under water saving irrigation was lower than that under conventional irrigation zhou et al 2015 xu et al 2019 some studies think that compared with conventional irrigation the change of chalkiness rate varied with varieties under mulching the plastic film yang et al 2000 the results of this study show that there were no significant differences in the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness for paddy rice and upland rice between bd and cf the results of this study are not consistent with those of previous studies which may be related to different varieties fertilizer operation soil moisture status soil types and climatic conditions during the experiment with regard to the effect of n application on protein content and amylose content many scholars agree that with the increase of n application protein content of rice increases and amylose content decreases you et al 2006 chen et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 the results of this study are consistent with those of predecessors cong et al 2017 and zhu et al 2017 showed that increasing n application the peak viscosity and breakdown viscosity of rice decreased and setback viscosity increased wu et al 2001 showed that rice with high breakdown viscosity was softer and for varieties with negative setback viscosity rice tends to be too sticky while for varieties with positive setback viscosity and too large rice was hard and rough the results also showed that under bd and cf irrigation regimes breakdown viscosity was the highest and setback viscosity was the lowest for paddy rice at ln and for upland rice at nn among the 3 n levels these results indicated that upland rice tended to soften and stick at nn and paddy rice tended to soften and stick at ln and the n level further increased which was unfavorable to the improvement of cooking and eating quality table 5 some of the results of this study are consistent with the previous results paddy rice while others upland rice are inconsistent which may be due to the different genotypes of the two varieties and the different sensitivity to n correlation analysis showed that n content in paddy rice leaves was more closely related to cooking and nutritional quality than that in upland rice 5 conclusions water and nutrients and their interaction are important factors affecting crop yield and quality in the dry land and hillside with stable rainwater but lack of irrigation conditions bd and nn can be used for the cultivation of upland rice i e the crops are rewatered at the soil water potential of 20 kpa and total n application rate of 210 kg ha 1 in areas with more rainfall and convenient irrigation bd and nn or cf and nn can be used for the cultivation of paddy rice these two cultivation measures can not only achieve the goal of water and nitrogen synergism high yield and good quality of rice but also save irrigation water reduce non point source pollution of farmland and play a very important role in food production and ecological environment security there is a compensation effect of rewatering in the bd irrigation regime and its intensity and internal mechanism need to be further studied declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work

economic development increasing grain yield and improving grain quality has become a top priority in china zhang 2007 peng et al 2009 rice is also the main irrigation crop the traditional submerged cultivation of paddy rice not only consumes a large amount of water and has a low water use efficiency but also causes environmental pollution bouman and tuong 2001 for example under continuous flooding conditions paddy fields are the main source of ch4 emissions from farmland soils accounting for about 15 20 of the global total emissions yan et al 2005 previous studies have shown that paddy rice has a certain amphibious type of water and drought and has great potential for water saving bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2005 upland rice has strong drought resistance and low water requirement and is an ideal dry food crop marschner 1978 especially suitable for cultivation in arid and hilly and low mountain areas a large number of upland rice varieties have been cultivated by the international rice research institute and other institutions chinese scientists have also developed a number of water saving and drought resistant upland rice varieties especially in the breeding of japonica upland rice varieties which have reached the international advanced level and their yield and quality are approaching those of paddy rice varieties bouman et al 2006 atlin et al 2013 at present more and more researchers pay attention to the research and application of paddy rice dry cultivation technology fan et al 2005 zhang et al 2005 2013 sun et al 2012 mahmod et al 2014 yuan et al 2014 2017 most studies have shown that water saving cultivation could promote the growth and development of paddy rice increase effective tillers and increase yield liang et al 1999 wang et al 2016 while some studies show the opposite zhang et al 2019 alternating wetting and drying awd technology has little effect on yield of paddy rice yang et al 2007 ye et al 2013 chu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 upland rice can be used as a substitute for partially submerged paddy rice cultivation in dry land hillside land or low lying areas where rainfall is stable but irrigation conditions are lacking tabbal et al 2002 kukal et al 2005 tuong et al 2005 these measures not only play an active role in stabilizing and promoting food production but also play an important role in improving the utilization rate of water resources reducing a series of environmental problems caused by flooding paddy rice cultivation yang et al 2007 wang et al 2016 christy et al 2018 and promoting the sustainable development of agriculture as for the relationship between irrigation regimes and protein previous studies have suggested that the protein content of brown rice is higher and the nutritional quality of brown rice is improved under dry cultivation conditions or when the soil moisture content is low but the cooking quality of rice is affected chen et al 2012 cai et al 2004 in addition to water nitrogen n is the most important element affecting crop growth and the most important nutrient limiting factor for crop yield formation n application can significantly improve crop yield without the application of n fertilizer the global food supply of 7 billion people can not be maintained and the food problem of nearly 1 4 billion people in china can not be solved it is estimated that the application of n fertilizer feeds 48 of the world s current population erisman et al 2008 however according to the survey the apparent n utilization rate of rice in china in the past 10 years is only 39 yu and shi 2015 and the average apparent n recovery rate in the world is only 33 garnett et al 2009 the low utilization rate of n fertilizer not only causes a huge waste of resources and financial resources but also has a negative impact on the environment and the safety of agricultural products water and nutrients and their interaction are important factors affecting crop yield and quality benbi 1989 the research on the interaction of water and n to improve crop adaptation to drought stress has increasingly become the focus of nutritional physiological regulation but the conclusions are different many studies have shown that appropriate n fertilizer can improve crop drought tolerance improve fertilizer efficiency and water saving and increase grain yield yang et al 1996 liu et al 2013 yang 2015 but d k bhan and misra 1970 believe that increasing n fertilizer application under limited soil moisture may aggravate water stress and adversely affect crop yields you et al 2006 study showed that increasing n application significantly increased the crude protein content chalky kernels rate and chalkiness of rice and reduced the amylose content under the same irrigation mode and water saving irrigation significantly increased amylose content and chalkiness and reduced the crude protein content of rice at the same n level but there are also studies suggested that different irrigation and fertilization treatments had no significant effect on amylose content of hybrid early rice and had a significant effect on protein content cheng et al 2001 as for the effects of irrigation regime soil moisture nitrogen application and their interaction on rice yield and quality most of the previous studies used paddy rice as the test material and the research conclusions are different there are few comparative studies on the effects of irrigation regime nitrogen application and interaction on the yield and quality of upland rice and paddy rice it is hypothesized that the water and nitrogen management of upland rice and paddy rice are reasonably coordinated the yield quality water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency of rice can be improved and the sustainable development of agriculture can be promoted however the evidence is very scarce in this regard the objectives of this study were to investigate the differences of yield and quality between paddy rice and upland rice under the two irrigation regimes bare dry cultivation bd belong to the awd and continuous flooding cultivaiton cf control and 3 n application rates 140 low n

anthesis nutritional quality appearance quality and cooking and eating quality were determined which were closely related to yield formation and grain quality this study would provide guidance for fertilizer saving water saving rice cultivation and sustainable agricultural development and further understand the growth mechanism of rice under the interaction of water and n 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and study site description the experiment was conducted in the rice growing season may october at the research farm of yangzhou university jiangsu province china 32 30 n 119 25 e in 2016 and 2017 the paddy rice cultivar yangjing 687 japonica and the upland rice cultivar zhonghan 3 japonica were used as materials the cultivated soil layer was sandy loam typic ﬂuvaquents entisols u s taxonomy with available n p k at 108 2 25 8 and 97 3 mg kg 1 respectively organic matter 21 6 g kg 1 soil bulk density 1 37 g cm 3 and ph value 7 5 the monthly total precipitation mean air temperature and total sunshine hours of rice growing season in two experimental years were measured at the meteorological station near the test site table 1 2 2 treatments 2 2 3 two cultivars two irrigation regimes and three n levels design was conducted the experiment was laid out in a randomized split plot design with 3 replications dry tillage followed by bed making the plot occupies an area of 1 6m 5 0m there was a lane 1 0 m wide between the main plots and plastic film was inserted into the soil 0 5 m deep to form a barrier subplots were separated by a bund wrapped in plastic film 0 4 m wide fig 1 the two irrigation regimes were continuous flooding cultivation cf and bare dry cultivation bd the traditional way of rice submergence cultivation is cf during rice growth which not only consumes a lot of water but also pollutes the environment easily one week before harvesting cf kept 2 3 cm water layer flooded continuously until water was cut off the awd is to irrigate 2 3 cm shallow water when rice reaches the soil water potential swp index monitored by tensiometer in each rice growth period this method can be used to study and analyze the operation and relationship of water in the soil plant atmosphere continuum on a unified scale so as to greatly reduce the pollution of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to the environment in the treatment of bd belonging to awd the cultivated land was prepared first and then the 1 6m 5 0m wide boundary surface was manually fabricated under bd 2 3 cm water layer was maintained within 7 days after transplantation in order to regreen the seedlings after that the water supply of bd treatment was controlled four soil tensiometers nanjing institute of soil sciences were used to monitor swp at a depth of 15 20 cm in each bd plot which were read at 1200 h every day when the swp of bd plot reaches 20 kpa soil moisture concentration was 0 165 g g 1 depth was 15 20 cm and there was no precipitation it is irrigated with 2 0 2 5 cm thin water layer according to our previous research work 20 kpa swp would not seriously reduce grain production yang et al 2007 irrigation water consumption was monitored by a flowmeter installed in the irrigation pipeline lxsg 50 flowmeter water meter manufacturing plant shanghai china each plot had its own irrigation or drainage system fig 1 because the rainfall in the growing season of 2016 706 9 mm was higher than that in 2017 669 4 mm the irrigation amount in 2016 was 1 2 time s less than that in 2017 table 1 potassium chloride and calcium superphosphate were used as base fertilizer and the application rates were 300 and 375 kg ha 1 respectively excessive application of n fertilizer will not only lead to the increase of ineffective tillers late ripening lodging and aggravation of diseases and insect pests but also lead to the increase of empty grains and the decrease of seed setting rate which will affect the yield of rice if the application amount of n fertilizer is too small rice yield will not reach its potential only proper application of n fertilizer can not only increase rice yield but also increase n use efficiency the 3 levels of n application were designed as 140 low n ln 210 normal n nn and 280 kg ha 1 high n hn respectively and the ratio of base fertilizer to tiller fertilizer and panicle fertilizer was 5 2 3 the two varieties were sown on may 14 and seedlings were raised under dry farming conditions they were transplanted from june 14 16 both 2016 and 2017 the row spacing was 25 cm 10

upland rice increasing n application the yield of upland rice increased more than that of paddy rice table 2 also shows that increasing n application the panicle numbers of paddy rice and upland rice increased under the two irrigation regimes under bd the differences of seed setting percentage for paddy rice and upland rice between hn and nn were not significant but they were significantly lower

rice fig 3 the panicle number of paddy rice and upland rice under bd decreased by 10 8 and 13 0 respectively compared to cf compared to paddy rice upland rice had poor tillering ability fewer panicles but higher panicle rate fig 3 table 3 shows that the number of adventitious roots per hole of paddy rice and upland rice at heading stage increased gradually increasing n application under the two irrigation regimes the adventitious roots of paddy rice and upland rice under bd were less than under cf the increase of adventitious roots of paddy rice from jointing stage to heading stage was lower than that of upland rice however the average number of adventitious roots at jointing and heading stages of paddy rice was 2 3 times of that of upland rice there were significant differences among the

and the effect of n application on photosynthesis capacity of upland rice after heading was greater than that of paddy rice fv fm and qp of upland rice were not significantly different between bd and cf but fv fm and qp of paddy rice under bd were significantly lower than under cf the effect of water stress on photosynthetic capacity of paddy rice was greater than that of upland rice table 3 the spad values of flag leaves of paddy rice and upland rice at 3 n levels increased first and then decreased after anthesis under two irrigation regimes the order of spad values of flag leaves at grain filling stage was hn nn ln fig 4 the average spad value of paddy rice in 0 10 days after anthesis was lower than that under cf and higher than that under cf in 20 40 days after anthesis while that of upland rice after anthesis under bd was lower than that under cf the spad value of flag leaf of paddy rice increased significantly in 10 40 days after anthesis than that of upland rice fig 4 n content in leaves of paddy rice and upland rice decreased gradually under bd and cf and the order of leaf n content at the 3 stages was hn nn ln table 3 there was no significant difference in the average n content of upland rice leaves between bd and cf while the average n content of paddy rice leaves under bd was significantly higher than that under cf the decreasing value of n content in upland rice leaves before heading was smaller than that of paddy rice and the decreasing value after heading was larger than that of paddy rice and the decreasing range increased by 30 7 there were significant differences between the two irrigation regimes among the 3 n levels and n levels and irrigation regimes had significant interactions on leaf nitrogen content at the 3 stages p 0 05 table 3 3 5 grain quality increasing n application chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of upland rice increased first and then decreased under bd and cf while chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of paddy rice decreased under bd and increased under cf and the kernel length kernel width was the opposite to that of chalkiness table 4 table 4 also showed that there were no significant differences in the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness for paddy rice and upland rice between bd and cf and the kernel length kernel width of paddy rice under bd was significantly higher than that under cf compared with paddy rice chalky kernels rate chalkiness and grain length grain width of upland rice increased by 31 4 30 2 and 66 1 respectively the appearance quality of upland rice was generally inferior to that of paddy rice table 4 under bd and cf with the increase of n application the protein content of upland rice and paddy rice increased and the amylose content was opposite under bd the protein content of upland rice was significantly higher than that under cf the amylose content and protein content of upland rice increased by 23 6 and 5 0 respectively compared with that of paddy rice tables 4 and 5 the breakdown viscosity was the highest and setback viscosity was the lowest for paddy rice under ln and for upland rice under nn table 5 also showed that the final viscosity and setback viscosity of upland rice and the final viscosity of paddy rice under bd were significantly higher than that under cf and the other rva spectral parameters had no significant difference between bd and cf the setback viscosity of paddy rice was 67 lower than that of upland rice and the taste quality of paddy rice was better than that of upland rice there were significant differences among the 3 n levels and there were significant interactions between n levels and irrigation regimes in amylose content protein content chalky kernels percentage chalkiness and starch viscosity p 0 05 tables 4 and 5 3 6 relationship between main grain quality and leaf n concentration the correlation analysis showed that the n content of leaves at the 3 stages and the decline value of n content of leaves after heading for the two cultivars were positively correlated with setback viscosity and protein content and was negatively correlated with breakdown viscosity and amylose content table 6 the correlation between n content in paddy rice leaves at 3 stages and the decrease of n content in leaves after heading and amylose content protein content setback viscosity and breakdown viscosity was higher and n content in paddy rice leaves was more closely related to cooking and nutritional quality than that in upland rice 4 discussion with regard to the effect of n nutrition on rice yield under different soil moisture conditions many studies have suggested that with the increase of n application the yield would increase and excessive n application resulted in a decrease in yield yang et al 1996 jiang et al 2004 you et al 2006 fageria et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 deng et al 2018 in the present study it was observed that under bd and cf irrigation regimes the yield of paddy rice was the highest at nn while that of upland rice was the highest at bd with nn and at cf with hn the results showed that under water restriction the effect of n fertilizer on improving the yield of paddy rice and upland rice was weakened this is consistent with the conclusions of niang et al 2018 this study also further verified the previous results but the optimal n application amount of the highest yield was different between upland rice and paddy rice the possible reason is that under cf panicle number per unit area of upland rice at hn was significantly larger than that at nn there was no significant difference in 1000 grain weight and grain number per panicle of upland rice between hn and nn and the seed setting percentage decreased slightly and the yield was significantly higher at hn than that at nn the number of adventitious roots of paddy rice was more than that of upland rice which had strong ability of absorbing n and more tillers however the significant increase of panicle number in paddy rice under cf with hn could not compensate for the loss of grain number per panicle seed setting percentage and 1000 grain weight resulting in a significant decrease in yield compared to that at nn the results of studies on the effects of n nutrition on the seed setting rate and 1000 grain weight of rice under different soil water conditions are different yang et al 1996 cai et al 2006 you et al 2006 shi et al 2001 the results of this study show that under bd and cf increasing n application the seed setting percentage of upland rice decreased significantly but the difference of 1000 grain weight was not significant between hn and nn while 1000 grain weight and the seed setting percentage of paddy rice decreased significantly there are two possible reasons first the average number of adventitious roots per hole for upland rice before jointing was about 1 2 1 3 of the number of adventitious roots for paddy rice table 3 resulting in weaker ability of n uptake and tilling than that in paddy rice fig 3 the canopy light transmittance of upland rice was better than that of paddy rice the effect of increasing n application on photosynthetic capacity of upland rice was greater and the accumulation of carbohydrates was relatively sufficient in addition the increase of adventitious roots of upland rice with hn from jointing to heading stage was significantly higher than that of paddy rice the increase of n uptake was more and the decrease of n content in leaves of upland rice from jointing to heading stage was lower than that of paddy rice table 3 this stage was the spikelets formation stage which leads to no difference in spikelets per panicle for upland rice between hn and nn under bd secondly compared to paddy rice the spad value of flag leaves and the n content in leaves of upland rice decreased faster after heading stage fig 4 a d and table 3 leaf color became lighter c n ratio and carbohydrate accumulation increased which was beneficial to grain filling lin 2000 there are different conclusions on the effect of n nutrition on the appearance quality of rice some studies have suggested that the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of rice increased with the increase of n application you et al 2006 chen et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 but there are also reports that the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of rice decrease with the increase of n application xu et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 cong et al 2017 dhillon et al 2018 this experiment showed that under bd and cf increasing n application chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness of upland rice increased first and then decreased while that of paddy rice decreased under bd and increased under cf the kernel length kernel width of the two varieties was the opposite to that of chalkiness the results of this study are not consistent with those of predecessors the possible reasons are as follows first the bigger the length width ratio of grain the longer and narrower the grain the smaller the distance of grain filling material to the abdomen and the more complete the grain filling resulting in the decrease of the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness second chalkiness is a complex quality trait controlled by genotype and environment upland rice and paddy rice have different sensitivity to n and water there are also different conclusions about the effect of water saving irrigation on the chalkiness rate and chalkiness of rice some studies suggest that the chalkiness rate of rice under water saving irrigation was lower than that under conventional irrigation zhou et al 2015 xu et al 2019 some studies think that compared with conventional irrigation the change of chalkiness rate varied with varieties under mulching the plastic film yang et al 2000 the results of this study show that there were no significant differences in the chalky kernels percentage and chalkiness for paddy rice and upland rice between bd and cf the results of this study are not consistent with those of previous studies which may be related to different varieties fertilizer operation soil moisture status soil types and climatic conditions during the experiment with regard to the effect of n application on protein content and amylose content many scholars agree that with the increase of n application protein content of rice increases and amylose content decreases you et al 2006 chen et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 the results of this study are consistent with those of predecessors cong et al 2017 and zhu et al 2017 showed that increasing n application the peak viscosity and breakdown viscosity of rice decreased and setback viscosity increased wu et al 2001 showed that rice with high breakdown viscosity was softer and for varieties with negative setback viscosity rice tends to be too sticky while for varieties with positive setback viscosity and too large rice was hard and rough the results also showed that under bd and cf irrigation regimes breakdown viscosity was the highest and setback viscosity was the lowest for paddy rice at ln and for upland rice at nn among the 3 n levels these results indicated that upland rice tended to soften and stick at nn and paddy rice tended to soften and stick at ln and the n level further increased which was unfavorable to the improvement of cooking and eating quality table 5 some of the results of this study are consistent with the previous results paddy rice while others upland rice are inconsistent which may be due to the different genotypes of the two varieties and the different sensitivity to n correlation analysis showed that n content in paddy rice leaves was more closely related to cooking and nutritional quality than that in upland rice 5 conclusions water and nutrients and their interaction are important factors affecting crop yield and quality in the dry land and hillside with stable rainwater but lack of irrigation conditions bd and nn can be used for the cultivation of upland rice i e the crops are rewatered at the soil water potential of 20 kpa and total n application rate of 210 kg ha 1 in areas with more rainfall and convenient irrigation bd and nn or cf and nn can be used for the cultivation of paddy rice these two cultivation measures can not only achieve the goal of water and nitrogen synergism high yield and good quality of rice but also save irrigation water reduce non point source pollution of farmland and play a very important role in food production and ecological environment security there is a compensation effect of rewatering in the bd irrigation regime and its intensity and internal mechanism need to be further studied declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work

10481,in this paper a new methodology is developed for the allocation of groundwater to agricultural lands considering the cultivated area of different crops selling price and net benefit of products and crops water requirements the methodology includes an integrated model with daily time steps for simulating soil water balance cultivar growth and groundwater level fluctuations the developed simulation model is linked with a particle swarm optimization model to find the optimal net benefit of beneficiaries the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm is also implemented to evaluate the fuzzy responses of the model against the existing uncertainty in the water supply to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology it is applied to a real world common pool groundwater allocation for agricultural uses in iran the results show that a centralized water allocation strategy can increase water productivity under water stress conditions by more than 0 2 kg m3

noory et al 2012 presented a simulation optimization model for maximizing the net benefit for all cultivated crops within irrigated areas in a reservoir irrigation system in iran the optimization model was optimized using linear programming lp and continuous particle swarm optimization cpso algorithm to make a detailed comparison between the results of lp and cpso a statistical assessment showed that the various types of pso algorithms were able to limit the variations of annual net benefit within an acceptable range i e 2 safavi and falsafioun 2017 attempted to develop an appropriate plan for the maximization of farmers net financial returns and define an optimal cropping pattern with seasonal time steps a genetic algorithm was applied to deficit irrigation scenarios to reduce water consumption and decrease the annual decline in the groundwater level their results showed that water consumption can be reduced by about 24 million cubic meters li et al 2018 evaluated the impact of crop types and drought scenarios on groundwater resources in central valley california the simulation results showed that water intensive crops could decrease groundwater storage by about 20 mm under drought conditions whereas water saving crops can recover groundwater storage and alleviate the adverse impacts of low flow conditions furthermore the managerial implications from this research suggest that decreasing water demands such as decreasing crop water intensity can mitigate groundwater depletion pso as a nature inspired metaheuristic algorithm is used for optimizing the defined nonlinear functions the pso algorithm originally introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 has been mostly considered due to its simplicity low cost of computations and good performance in terms of convergence to optimal or near optimal solutions kennedy et al 2001 the main idea behind the pso is inspired by the behavior of bird flocks or fish schools in seeking food in a search space shi and eberhart 1998 in the pso terminology the optimization is started by generating the decision variables particles with randomly assigned positions and velocities in the feasible domain the objective function is evaluated for each particle and the best particle position in the whole swarm gbest as well as the so far best position visited by each particle pbest are identified then the particle velocities and positions are updated using the gbest and pbest values and the optimization is continued until no further improvement in results is achieved shi and eberhart 1998 moradi sabzkouhi and

allocation noory et al 2012 fallah mehdipour et al 2013 nikoo et al 2014 and groundwater management liu et al 2018 as the stability and accuracy of an optimal solution to a water allocation problem is essential to its success in practical application read et al 2014 the current paper attempts to deal with the gaps in previous studies by 1 developing a general growth model to accurately estimate the actual water requirement of a cropping pattern and 2 providing a new framework for daily common pool groundwater allocation to demands in agricultural regions moreover due to the lack of systematic programs for irrigation planning in most of agricultural activities many beneficial opportunities such as reduction of water losses or pumping energy may stay unknown during the growing season therefore in this paper to improve the accuracy and applicability of the models developed in past researches we focus on the modeling of the soil water and crop system with more details table 1 the proposed non linear optimization model with daily time steps considers different irrigation and cropping systems and includes a large number of decision variables furthermore the existing uncertainties in the water supply are analyzed using a many objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the non linear optimization models incorporate agricultural hydrologic economic and technical constraints to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology it has been applied to shahrekord plain in iran where groundwater is the only source for irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description an accurate simulation model is a necessary tool for optimizing the allocation of scarce groundwater resources in a large scale cropping pattern the structure of the proposed study is summarized in fig 1 as shown on the left side of the figure the main parameters affecting agricultural water allocation including cultivated area selling price of the product yield production crop water requirement common pool groundwater resources water constraints and consolidation of cropping patterns are considered as decision making factors in the next step seven management strategies for estimating the groundwater discharge are defined based on one or more decision making factors for example strategy 3 is planned by applying the effects of yield production selling price of the product and cultivated area according to the flowchart the optimum plans for beneficiaries are obtained by the first four strategies moreover the optimal irrigation plans for cprs total cropping pattern of plain and crops could be suggested using strategies of 5 6 and 7 respectively calculations and results have been formulated based on real time information with daily time steps in the crop growth models and soil water simulation the obtained values of yield production and water budget which are indicated in the right side of the schematic flowchart from the previous steps are used by adding economic parameters such as water price and cultivation costs to analyze the cropping pattern and irrigation scheduling with this concept the optimization model has been implemented and evaluated to achieve the best water allocation plans for the maximization of net financial returns 2 2 crop growth equations the economic management of groundwater resources is essential to ensure the sustainability of cropping pattern for farmers hence the difference between the received incomes and farming production costs could be considered as the main factor noory et al 2012 osama et al 2017 sedghamiz et al 2018 based on the explanations the objective function was to maximize the net benefit of the beneficiaries which is defined by the following equation 1 m a x b b p 1 n p s 1 n s b m h i a s p y b p s 1 n s p c 10 i 1 n t i i i w p a s p where b is the net benefit of cropping pattern for beneficiary b irr 1 usd 42 000 irr yb is the selling price of crop p irr

the irrigation water price irr m3 nt is the days of the growing season for crop p ns is the number of irrigation systems and np is the number of crops in the cropping pattern common resources have different facets and restrictions the proposed simulation optimization methodology for agricultural water management has the ability of considering daily constraints under uncertainty the constraints of the optimizaiton model are discussed in the following sections the cropping area for each beneficiary will not change in the different management strategies 2 p 1 n p a p b a b where p and b represent the crop and the beneficiary in the simulation model respectively bm is obtained from the normalized biomass water productivity wp and the ratio of the daily crop transpiration tr over the reference evapotranspiration in a day i eto raes et al 2017 3 b m p w p p i 1 n t t r e t o i tr is calculated by multiplying eto with the crop transpiration coefficient kctr and by considering the effect of water ksaer and cold stress kstr t r k s a e r k s t r k c t r e t o 4 where ksaer is the soil water stress coefficient which becomes smaller than 1 and as such reduces crop transpiration when insufficient water is available to respond to the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and kstr is the cold stress coefficient which becomes smaller than 1 when there are not enough growing degrees in the day the crop transpiration coefficient kctr is proportional to the green canopy cover cc after the time tccm required to reach maximum canopy cover without water stress before senescence the canopy ages slowly and undergoes a progressive though a small reduction in transpiration after an assumed lag phase of 5 days kctr adj is given by 5 k c t r a d j k c t r t 5 f a g e c c m where fage is the reduction coefficient expressed as a fraction of the maximum canopy cover when senescence is triggered the transpiration drops more markedly with time raes et al 2017 this is simulated by multiplying kctr adj with another adjustment factor fsen which declines from 1 at the start of senescence cc maximum canopy cover to 0 when no green canopy cover remains cc 0 6 k c t r s

the four times of emergence maximum senescence and maturity 2 3 soil water balance predicting the real time soil water content in the root zone and quantifying crop water use is important to maximize the use of limited water supplies irmak and kambe 2009 transpiration and evaporation in addition to the climatic conditions depend on the moisture content of different layers of the soil runoff deep percolation evaporation and transpiration are the components of the water budget that determine the water use efficiency in each planning policy irrigation time can be estimated according to the time interval of rainfall and irrigation and the soil moisture content in the field capacity and permanent wilting point hence in addition to studying the interaction of groundwater and irrigation it is necessary to simulate the movement of water in the root area the main form of soil water balance is formulated as eq 10 10 s i 1 s i i i r i e i tr i dp i ro i for i 1 2 nt where s is the height of stored water in the root zone mm i is the irrigation depth mm r is rainfall mm e is evaporation mm dp is deep percolation mm and ro is runoff mm the water balance is calculated and measured in the root zone the root depth starts to increase from an initial depth z0 to the maximum effective rooting depth zm is reached and estimated in daily time steps as the following equation raes et al 2017 11 z t z 0 z m z o t t 0 2 t m t 0 2 n where zt is effective rooting depth at time t zo and zm are the initial and maximum rooting depths respectively t0 is time to reach 90 crop emergence day tm is time after planting when zm is reached day t is the time from planting day and n is shape factor the estimation of the evaporation deep percolation and runoff which are generally considered as part of the system losses must be done in real time evaporation occurs from the surface layer of the soil and each soil texture has a different surface layer to provide evaporation conditions on the other hand different moisture content has different evaporation rates deep percolation will occur between two points of soil moisture saturation and field capacity and will only be considered from the underlying soil and for the outflow of water from the root zone runoff has been estimated according to the irrigation system and permeability of the soil according to the description the water allocated to each irrigation event should be less than the soil capacity in the irrigation time 12 0 i i t a w s i for i 1 2 n t 13 p 1 n p i 1 n t i b p i a w b for b 1 2 nb where taw is the capacity to store water in the root zone and awb is the allowable volume of water to exploit for operator b in a growing season from an economic point of view the distribution of water should be such that at least the net

iran fig 2 the average annual precipitation is only 120 mm which is corresponding to arid conditions the uncontrolled heavy pumping of groundwater about 250 mm3 annually has caused over exploitation in the irrigation area tabatabaei et al 2010 fakharinia et al 2012 lalehzari et al 2010 2013 lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 required data for mathematical modeling were collected from government agencies interviews of 178 farmers in the region and a practical survey of the region varade and patel 2018 the other input data such as sowing dates soil properties and details of the existing cropping pattern and economic parameters were collected from october 2016 to september 2017 table 3 the values of production costs for cultivating potato tomato onion and cucumber are greater than other crops because more labor forces are needed in the planting and harvest stages according to the table there are five necessary points to predict the fraction of canopy cover for each crop including the times of sowing emergence maximum canopy senescence and maturity that is presented with so em mc se and ma respectively furthermore fig 3 shows the cropping pattern based on the three irrigation systems in three cprs as shown in the figure trickle irrigation was mostly implemented for cucumber and onion and sprinkler irrigation is superior to other irrigation methods for annual and winter crops 2 5 groundwater resources as shown in fig 1 to assess the impacts of different water allocation plans four strategies for maximizing the net benefit of the beneficiaries a plan with to increase the benefit of the common groundwater resource a policy aimed at increasing the total income of the cropping pattern and the final strategy as a free discharge from the aquifer are defined and implemented the strategies are as follows and the results are discussed below 2 5 1 strategy i s1 the planning in this strategy is carried out based on the cultivated area of each beneficiary in this case the allocated water for beneficiaries and crops are calculated using the following equations respectively 16 a w b c t a w c p 1 n p a p b b 1 n b p 1 n p a p b c 17 a w p b c a w b c a p b c b 1 n b c p 1 n p a p b c where awb and tawc are the maximum allowable exploitation for the operator b and cpr c ap is the cropping area of crop p np nb and nc represent the number of crops beneficiaries and common pool groundwater resources respectively 2 5 2 strategy ii s2 the price of products is considered as a weighting factor for water allocation in the second strategy 18 a w b c t a w c p 1 n p a p b p b p 1 n p b 1 n b a p b b p c 19 a w p b c a w b c a p b c b p p 1 n p a p b p b c where bp is the selling price of crop p 2 5 3 strategy iii s3 in the third plan the division of available water is planned based on the potential benefit of each crop therefore the equations of allocation water between the beneficiaries and crops are 20 a w b c t a w c p 1 n p a p y p b p b p 1

temperature humidity wind speed day length growth season and vegetation coefficients has been used for water allocation consequently the pricing yield production and production costs have not a key role to play in water resources governance 22 a w b c t a w c p 1 n p a p g w p b p 1 n p b 1 n b a p b g w p c 23 a w p b c a w b c a p b c g w p p 1 n p a p g w p b c where gw is the total water requirement for each crop cubic meters per hectare according to the hydrologic parameters 2 5 5 strategy v s5 in the four previous strategies the objective function of the optimization model was based on maximizing the net income of the operators but in the 5th strategy the maximization of the net benefit of the cropping pattern in each cprs has been considered hence the estimated income for each operator is calculated based on the total benefits obtained by the whole cropping pattern it should be noted that the cultivated area of the crops has not changed for any beneficiary the evaluation results obtained in this plan can be different because one of the planning capabilities with this goal is to determine the irrigation intervals by utilizing the result of the best experience of each beneficiary 2 5 6 strategy vi s6 in the sixth plan the total benefit of the plain cropping pattern is simulated as an objective function in these conditions the total allowable discharging of cprs is simultaneously applied to the entire cropping pattern of plain and it is assumed that land consolidation is included in the water allocation system 2 5 7 strategy vii s7 the constraints on water use make significant changes to the irrigation planning and productivity criteria therefore the seventh strategy has been defined and evaluated by eliminating water constraints this is due to the study of the effects of water constraints on the decision making system and the comparison of performance and water use efficiency with other strategies the evaluation of the defined strategies could be estimated by the economic efficiency of water eew irr m3 the economic efficiency of land eel irr ha and water productivity wp 24 e e w p s 1 n s b m h i a s y b p s 1 n s c c 10 i 1 n t i i i w p φ a

and the amount of water used in each of the policies for the three cprs according to the presented concept in the table more successful strategies can be made using available water among s1 to s4 the least unused water is related to s4 or planning based on the actual water requirement although the distribution of water in s4 seems to be optimal the cropping pattern requires eliminating or adding some crops to increase the objective function value among strategies that are planned according to the existing discharge sources s5 has the least amount of unused water especially in cpr3 where suffers from water scarcity to supply the crop water requirements as shown in table 4 there is the maximum use of irrigation water in land consolidation policy and integrated groundwater management this option requires the restructuring of the cultivation pattern or find a solution to use the unplanned water in regions that are facing tension the allocated water is compared in the seven predefined management strategies in fig 4 according to the figure allocated water in s2 and s3 are less than others because the economic parameters have more effect on the water distribution fig 5 shows the obtained net benefit per cost corresponding to the irrigation water according to the expectation the net benefit per cost for the strategies that have lower constraints for supplying water to agricultural fields s6 and s7 is more than other strategies despite the effect of yield price as the distribution coefficient the least benefit has been obtained in s2 cprs management especially in water shortage s5 and cpr3 the actual demands and the cultivation area strategies especially in situations where the water stress decreases are the suitable options for optimal irrigation planning the percentages of irrigation lost by deep percolation runoff and evaporation are shown in fig 6 maximum and minimum values of the water losses have been obtained for s2 cpr1 19 2 cpr2 17 5 and cpr3 20 2 and s5 cpr1 14 4 cpr2 16 cpr3 12 6 respectively economic efficiency of water and land are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 the eew values of cpr1 cpr2 and cpr3 are estimated as 85 115 4 and 99 2 irr m3 respectively although s2 has achieved the highest water use efficiency it has had the lowest land use efficiency s1 and s3 can be considered as the optimal strategies with eew and eel values of 117 5 irr m3 and 13 7 irr ha for cpr2 and similar responses for the other cprs the effect of defined management of water allocation on the simulated crops is different the product competition for increasing the economic efficiency of water use varies in different strategies table 5 according to the table the highest indexes of chickpea bean maize alfalfa and onion have been calculated in s1 however cucumber has had the most efficiency in s2 because of the selling price comparing the evaluation parameter and planning system for potato show that the economic efficiency of water in s6 for all cprs are the same and the lowest amongst the other strategies the best condition for managing water distribution in this product is s4 allocation based on the water requirement the competitive ability of potato is less than other spring crops due to lower prices the increase of wp under water stress is attributed to biomass production being reduced less by drought than water use anyia and herzog 2004 as shown in fig 9 except for sugar beet maize and alfalfa the highest water productivity values belong to s5 wps for sugar beet alfalfa and maize have the lowest values in the economic strategy s3 3 2 uncertainty analysis in the proposed structure an uncertainty analysis was incorporated into programming frameworks to account for extensive parameter uncertainties madani and dinar 2012 regulwar and gurav 2012 lu et al 2009 kerachian et al 2010 for this purpose the product simulation model and a multi objective optimization algorithm i e nsgaii deb et al 2002 are implemented to evaluate the fuzzy responses of the model against the uncertainties of water supply hence input fuzzy numbers are discretized in the two levels of membership function based on a percentage of optimal allocated water e g 0 25 to estimate the extreme values of the relative net benefit nsgaii generates the initial population randomly and evaluates two objective functions for each crop the population is sorted based on the non domination principle and is classified in different fronts that the best level of non dominated solutions is called pareto front every chromosome in each front ranked by closeness distance criterion to guide the solutions in pareto front toward the boundary solutions haghighi and zahedi asl 2014 fig 10 presents the fuzzy numbers of irrigation water mm on the right and the fuzzy response of the model dimensionless ratio of the net benefit per water price on the left according to the figure the net benefits of alfalfa sugar beet and maize are the lowest against other crops despite receiving the highest volume of water changes in the amount of water allocated for these products did not have a significant effect on their economic efficiency the fuzzy analysis results indicate that with saving about 4 5 million cubic meters of allocated water for these crops only 8 5 percent of their net profit will decrease the existing uncertainties have the greatest impacts on the tomato and onion production therefore sustainable planning especially the use of drip irrigation systems is essential for these products 3 3 irrigation planning fig 11 shows the variation of water balance in a growing season for alfalfa with 7 day irrigation intervals as shown in the figure harvesting is carried out three times the highest amount of runoff evaporation and deep percolation occurred during irrigation after the harvest time the 7 day irrigation interval for alfalfa has not been optimal and has led to an increase in soil layers finally a schematic illustration of the relationships between crops water availability and decision making rules has been provided for representing the most suitable cropping pattern fig 12 five criteria i e benefit per cost water saving eew eel and wp and four decision parameters i e cultivated area selling price products yield production and water demand have been combined to achieve the optimal policies a decision guide has been presented in the figure with different shapes decision making components and lines objective indicator under wet black and dry white conditions for example the main crops of a sustainable cropping pattern for increasing the water productivity in a drought year are lentil bean cucumber and chickpea hence s3 is suggested for water allocation for the proposed optimal cropping pattern 3 4 research implications and limitations this paper investigated the impact of groundwater exploitation plans on agricultural water supply sustainability in the shahrekord plain iran considerations for developing strategies for optimal water alloation to agricultural demands and managing groundwater resources were discussed it was shown that the proposed groundwater management strategies can help regional water supply agencies meet future demands furthermore this methodology with a daily time step can help decision makers in real time modeling and water allocation from hydrologic and economic points of view the current policies for groundwater exploitation in the shahrekord plain do not guarantee the sustainability of groundwater the results show that cprs strategies can be effectively used for groundwater management in the study area the developed concept is subject to several limitations in the simulation optimization model the existing uncertainties in the selling prices of products have not been incorporated moreover the model does not directly consider the losses during water delivery to agricultural lands 4 summary and conclusion optimization of cropping patterns can improve the management of agricultural water resources for sustaining agricultural productivity and sustainable development sun et al 2017 varade and patel 2018 the main objective of the study was to develop a model for optimal allocation of groundwater in agriculture based on the actual demands of crops the limitations affecting water soil and cropping pattern as well as economic parameters this has been made by choosing a suitable decision based on different strategies for managing groundwater exploitation and shows the best option in the context of water scarcity it was important to use the obtained results in the decision making system for the issuance of groundwater withdrawal permits selection of appropriate cropping patterns water pricing prediction of yield production etc singh 2015 lalehzari et al 2016 groundwater is a common pool resource that should be involved in the water distribution management system between beneficiaries and yield productions the results show that the targeting of cprs has led to an increase in the net income of farmers and the overall pattern of cultivation the study of water discharges in the soil is necessary for the proper estimation of water requirements and therefore optimal allocation various management parameters affect the water use efficiency including irrigation germination time root depth and canopy cover one of the factors that reduce the yield and income of some plants such as potatoes peas and beans in s5 and s6 has been the discrepancy of these plants with the seven day irrigation cycle which was considered as their default some plants such as alfalfa maize wheat and barley have better compatibility with long term irrigation intervals the best water allocation program will occur when in addition to the value time was also considered as a variable for products in future studies the existing uncertainties in available water resources can be better incorporated using the conditional value at risk method also assessing the relationship between the cost of water supply and cropping patterns could be a topic for future works declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10481,in this paper a new methodology is developed for the allocation of groundwater to agricultural lands considering the cultivated area of different crops selling price and net benefit of products and crops water requirements the methodology includes an integrated model with daily time steps for simulating soil water balance cultivar growth and groundwater level fluctuations the developed simulation model is linked with a particle swarm optimization model to find the optimal net benefit of beneficiaries the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm is also implemented to evaluate the fuzzy responses of the model against the existing uncertainty in the water supply to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology it is applied to a real world common pool groundwater allocation for agricultural uses in iran the results show that a centralized water allocation strategy can increase water productivity under water stress conditions by more than 0 2 kg m3 for wheat and barley this policy can also provide the highest values for the benefit per cost ratio and the economic efficiency of land keywords common pool resources groundwater irrigation water productivity water allocation 1 introduction in the arid and semi arid regions the first priority in water allocation is usually granted to the municipal sector the second priority to industry and the third to agriculture uses braude et al 2015 groundwater systems as common pool resources cprs are usually used for water storage and water supply to domestic industrial and agricultural demands huang et al 2017 cui and singh 2017 porse et al 2018 a common pool resource is defined as a resource system whose yield is subtractable and its characteristics make the exclusion of potential appropriators or limitation of the existing beneficiaries rights nontrivial but not necessarily impossible ostrom et al 1994 madani and dinar 2012 sustainable management of common pool groundwater resources has been a global concern in the past decades madani and dinar 2012 nikoo et al 2013 ross et al 2016 li et al 2018 porse et al 2018 lalehzari et al 2020 groundwater resource management by different

reducing cropped areas and simulating an optimal irrigation plan during droughts several simulation optimization models have been developed to find the optimal relationship between groundwater

noory et al 2012 presented a simulation optimization model for maximizing the net benefit for all cultivated crops within irrigated areas in a reservoir irrigation system in iran the optimization model was optimized using linear programming lp and continuous particle swarm optimization cpso algorithm to make a detailed comparison between the results of lp and cpso a statistical assessment showed that the various types of pso algorithms were able to limit the variations of annual net benefit within an acceptable range i e 2 safavi and falsafioun 2017 attempted to develop an appropriate plan for the maximization of farmers net financial returns and define an optimal cropping pattern with seasonal time steps a genetic algorithm was applied to deficit irrigation scenarios to reduce water consumption and decrease the annual decline in the groundwater level their results showed that water consumption can be reduced by about 24 million cubic meters li et al 2018 evaluated the impact of crop types and drought scenarios on groundwater resources in central valley california the simulation results showed that water intensive crops could decrease groundwater storage by about 20 mm under drought conditions whereas water saving crops can recover groundwater storage and alleviate the adverse impacts of low flow conditions furthermore the managerial implications from this research suggest that decreasing water demands such as decreasing crop water intensity can mitigate groundwater depletion pso as a nature inspired metaheuristic algorithm is used for optimizing the defined nonlinear functions the pso algorithm originally introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 has been mostly considered due to its simplicity low cost of computations and good performance in terms of convergence to optimal or near optimal solutions kennedy et al 2001 the main idea behind the pso is inspired by the behavior of bird flocks or fish schools in seeking food in a search space shi and eberhart 1998 in the pso terminology the optimization is started by generating the decision variables particles with randomly assigned positions and velocities in the feasible domain the objective function is evaluated for each particle and the best particle position in the whole swarm gbest as well as the so far best position visited by each particle pbest are identified then the particle velocities and positions are updated using the gbest and pbest values and the optimization is continued until no further improvement in results is achieved shi and eberhart 1998 moradi sabzkouhi and haghighi 2016 liu et al 2018 pso has been widely applied to engineering optimization problems e g for the uncertainty analysis of pipe network hydraulics moradi sabzkouhi and haghighi 2016 water allocation noory et al 2012 fallah mehdipour et al 2013 nikoo et al 2014 and groundwater management liu et al 2018 as the stability and accuracy of an optimal solution to a water allocation problem is essential to its success in practical application read et al 2014 the current paper attempts to deal with the gaps in previous studies by 1 developing a general growth model to accurately estimate the actual water requirement of a cropping pattern and 2 providing a new framework for daily common pool groundwater allocation to demands in agricultural regions moreover due to the lack of systematic programs for irrigation planning in most of agricultural activities many beneficial opportunities such as reduction of water losses or pumping energy may stay unknown during the growing season therefore in this paper to improve the accuracy and applicability of the models developed in past researches we focus on the modeling of the soil water and crop system with more details table 1 the proposed non linear optimization model with daily time steps considers different irrigation and cropping systems and includes a large number of decision variables furthermore the existing uncertainties in the water supply are analyzed using a many objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the non linear optimization models incorporate agricultural hydrologic economic and technical constraints to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology it has been applied to shahrekord plain in iran where groundwater is the only source for irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description an accurate simulation model is a necessary tool for optimizing the allocation of scarce groundwater resources in a large scale cropping pattern the structure of the proposed study is summarized in fig 1 as shown on the left side of the figure the main parameters affecting agricultural water allocation including cultivated area selling price of the product yield production crop water requirement common pool groundwater resources water constraints and consolidation of cropping patterns are considered as decision making factors in the next step seven management strategies for estimating the groundwater discharge are defined based on one or more decision making factors for example strategy 3 is planned by applying the effects of yield production selling price of the product and cultivated area according to the flowchart the optimum plans for beneficiaries are obtained by the first four strategies moreover the optimal irrigation plans for cprs total cropping pattern of plain and crops could be suggested using strategies of 5 6 and 7 respectively calculations and results have been formulated based on real time information with daily time steps in the crop growth models and soil water simulation the obtained values of yield production and water budget which are indicated in the right side of the schematic flowchart from the previous steps are used by adding economic parameters such as water price and cultivation costs to analyze the cropping pattern and irrigation scheduling with this concept the optimization model has been implemented and evaluated to achieve the best water allocation plans for the maximization of net financial returns 2 2 crop growth equations the economic management of groundwater resources is essential to ensure the sustainability of cropping pattern for farmers hence the difference between the received incomes and farming production costs could be considered as the main factor noory et al 2012 osama et al 2017 sedghamiz et al 2018 based on the explanations the objective function was to maximize the net benefit of the beneficiaries which is defined by the following equation 1 m a x b b p 1 n p s 1 n s b m h i a s p y b p s 1 n s p c 10 i 1 n t i i i w p a s p where b is the net benefit of cropping pattern for beneficiary b irr 1 usd 42 000 irr yb is the selling price of crop p irr

the irrigation water price irr m3 nt is the days of the growing season for crop p ns is the number of irrigation systems and np is the number of crops in the cropping pattern common resources have different facets and restrictions the proposed simulation optimization methodology for agricultural water management has the ability of considering daily constraints under uncertainty the constraints of the optimizaiton model are discussed in the following sections the cropping area for each beneficiary will not change in the different management strategies 2 p 1 n p a p b a b where p and b represent the crop and the beneficiary in the simulation model respectively bm is obtained from the normalized biomass water productivity wp and the ratio of the daily crop transpiration tr over the reference evapotranspiration in a day i eto raes et al 2017 3 b m p w p p i 1 n t t r e t o i tr is calculated by multiplying eto with the crop transpiration coefficient kctr and by considering the effect of water ksaer and cold stress kstr t r k s a e r k s t r k c t r e t o 4 where ksaer is the soil water stress coefficient which becomes smaller than 1 and as such reduces crop transpiration when insufficient water is available to respond to the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and kstr is the cold stress coefficient which becomes smaller than 1 when there are not enough growing degrees in the day the crop transpiration coefficient kctr is proportional to the green canopy cover cc after the time tccm required to reach maximum canopy cover without water stress before senescence the canopy ages slowly and undergoes a progressive though a small reduction in transpiration after an assumed lag phase of 5 days kctr adj is given by 5 k c t r a d j k c t r t 5 f a g e c c m where fage is the reduction coefficient expressed as a fraction of the maximum canopy cover when senescence is triggered the transpiration drops more markedly with time raes et al 2017 this is simulated by multiplying kctr adj with another adjustment factor fsen which declines from 1 at the start of senescence cc maximum canopy cover to 0 when no green canopy cover remains cc 0 6 k c t r s

the four times of emergence maximum senescence and maturity 2 3 soil water balance predicting the real time soil water content in the root zone and quantifying crop water use is important to maximize the use of limited water supplies irmak and kambe 2009 transpiration and evaporation in addition to the climatic conditions depend on the moisture content of different layers of the soil runoff deep percolation evaporation and transpiration are the components of the water budget that determine the water use efficiency in each planning policy irrigation time can be estimated according to the time interval of rainfall and irrigation and the soil moisture content in the field capacity and permanent wilting point hence in addition to studying the interaction of groundwater and irrigation it is necessary to simulate the movement of water in the root area the main form of soil water balance is formulated as eq 10 10 s i 1 s i i i r i e i tr i dp i ro i for i 1 2 nt where s is the height of stored water in the root zone mm i is the irrigation depth mm r is rainfall mm e is evaporation mm dp is deep percolation mm and ro is runoff mm the water balance is calculated and measured in the root zone the root depth starts to increase from an initial depth z0 to the maximum effective rooting depth zm is reached and estimated in daily time steps as the following equation raes et al 2017 11 z t z 0 z m z o t t 0 2 t m t 0 2 n where zt is effective rooting depth at time t zo and zm are the initial and maximum rooting depths respectively t0 is time to reach 90 crop emergence day tm is time after planting when zm is reached day t is the time from planting day and n is shape factor the estimation of the evaporation deep percolation and runoff which are generally considered as part of the system losses must be done in real time evaporation occurs from the surface layer of the soil and each soil texture has a different surface layer to provide evaporation conditions on the other hand different moisture content has different evaporation rates deep percolation will occur between two points of soil moisture saturation and field capacity and will only be considered from the underlying soil and for the outflow of water from the root zone runoff has been estimated according to the irrigation system and permeability of the soil according to the description the water allocated to each irrigation event should be less than the soil capacity in the irrigation time 12 0 i i t a w s i for i 1 2 n t 13 p 1 n p i 1 n t i b p i a w b for b 1 2 nb where taw is the capacity to store water in the root zone and awb is the allowable volume of water to exploit for operator b in a growing season from an economic point of view the distribution of water should be such that at least the net

iran fig 2 the average annual precipitation is only 120 mm which is corresponding to arid conditions the uncontrolled heavy pumping of groundwater about 250 mm3 annually has caused over exploitation in the irrigation area tabatabaei et al 2010 fakharinia et al 2012 lalehzari et al 2010 2013 lalehzari and tabatabaei 2015 required data for mathematical modeling were collected from government agencies interviews of 178 farmers in the region and a practical survey of the region varade and patel 2018 the other input data such as sowing dates soil properties and details of the existing cropping pattern and economic parameters were collected from october 2016 to september 2017 table 3 the values of production costs for cultivating potato tomato onion and cucumber are greater than other crops because more labor forces are needed in the planting and harvest stages according to the table there are five necessary points to predict the fraction of canopy cover for each crop including the times of sowing emergence maximum canopy senescence and maturity that is presented with so em mc se and ma respectively furthermore fig 3 shows the cropping pattern based on the three irrigation systems in three cprs as shown in the figure trickle irrigation was mostly implemented for cucumber and onion and sprinkler irrigation is superior to other irrigation methods for annual and winter crops 2 5 groundwater resources as shown in fig 1 to assess the impacts of different water allocation plans four strategies for maximizing the net benefit of the beneficiaries a plan with to increase the benefit of the common groundwater resource a policy aimed at increasing the total income of the cropping pattern and the final strategy as a free discharge from the aquifer are defined and implemented the strategies are as follows and the results are discussed below 2 5 1 strategy i s1 the planning in this strategy is carried out based on the cultivated area of each beneficiary in this case the allocated water for beneficiaries and crops are calculated using the following equations respectively 16 a w b c t a w c p 1 n p a p b b 1 n b p 1 n p a p b c 17 a w p b c a w b c a p b c b 1 n b c p 1 n p a p b c where awb and tawc are the maximum allowable exploitation for the operator b and cpr c ap is the cropping area of crop p np nb and nc represent the number of crops beneficiaries and common pool groundwater resources respectively 2 5 2 strategy ii s2 the price of products is considered as a weighting factor for water allocation in the second strategy 18 a w b c t

available water is planned based on the potential benefit of each crop therefore the equations of allocation water between the beneficiaries and crops are 20 a w b c t a w c p 1 n p a p y p b p b p 1

temperature humidity wind speed day length growth season and vegetation coefficients has been used for water allocation consequently the pricing yield production and production costs have not a key role to play in water resources governance 22 a w b c t a w c p 1 n p a p g w p b p 1 n p b 1 n b a p b g w p c 23 a w p b c a w b c a p b c g w p p 1 n p a p g w p b c where gw is the total water requirement for each crop cubic meters per hectare according to the hydrologic parameters 2 5 5 strategy v s5 in the four previous strategies the objective function of the optimization model was based on maximizing the net income of the operators but in the 5th strategy the maximization of the net benefit of the cropping pattern in each cprs has been considered hence the estimated income for each operator is calculated based on the total benefits obtained by the whole cropping pattern it should be noted that the cultivated area of the crops has not changed for any beneficiary the evaluation results obtained in this plan can be different because one of the planning capabilities with this goal is to determine the irrigation intervals by utilizing the result of the best experience of each beneficiary 2 5 6 strategy vi s6 in the sixth plan the total benefit of the plain cropping pattern is simulated as an objective function in these conditions the total allowable discharging of cprs is simultaneously applied to the entire cropping pattern of plain and it is assumed that land consolidation is included in the water allocation system 2 5 7 strategy vii s7 the constraints on water use make significant changes to the irrigation planning and productivity criteria therefore the seventh strategy has been defined and evaluated by eliminating water constraints this is due to the study of the effects of water constraints on the decision making system and the comparison of performance and water use efficiency with other strategies the evaluation of the defined strategies could be estimated by the economic efficiency of water eew irr m3 the economic efficiency of land eel irr ha and water productivity wp 24 e e w p s 1 n s b m h i a s y b p s 1 n s c c 10 i 1 n t i i i w p φ a

and the amount of water used in each of the policies for the three cprs according to the presented concept in the table more successful strategies can be made using available water among s1 to s4 the least unused water is related to s4 or planning based on the actual water requirement although the distribution of water in s4 seems to be optimal the cropping pattern requires eliminating or adding some crops to increase the objective function value among strategies that are planned according to the existing discharge sources s5 has the least amount of unused water especially in cpr3 where suffers from water scarcity to supply the crop water requirements as shown in table 4 there is the maximum use of irrigation water in land consolidation policy and integrated groundwater management this option requires the restructuring of the cultivation pattern or find a solution to use the unplanned water in regions that are facing tension the allocated water is compared in the seven predefined management strategies in fig 4 according to the figure allocated water in s2 and s3 are less than others because the economic parameters have more effect on the water distribution fig 5 shows the obtained net benefit per cost corresponding to the irrigation water according to the expectation the net benefit per cost for the strategies that have lower constraints for supplying water to agricultural fields s6 and s7 is more than other strategies despite the effect of yield price as the distribution coefficient the least benefit has been obtained in s2 cprs management especially in water shortage s5 and cpr3 the actual demands and the cultivation area strategies especially in situations where the water stress decreases are the suitable options for optimal irrigation planning the percentages of irrigation lost by deep percolation runoff and evaporation are shown in fig 6 maximum and minimum values of the water losses have been obtained for s2 cpr1 19 2 cpr2 17 5 and cpr3 20 2 and s5 cpr1 14 4 cpr2 16 cpr3 12 6 respectively economic efficiency of water and land are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 the eew values of cpr1 cpr2 and cpr3 are estimated as 85 115 4 and 99 2 irr m3 respectively although s2 has achieved the highest water use efficiency it has had the lowest land use efficiency s1 and s3 can be considered as the optimal strategies with eew and eel values of 117 5 irr m3 and 13 7 irr ha for cpr2 and similar responses for the other cprs the effect of defined management of water allocation on the simulated crops is different the product competition for increasing the economic efficiency of water use varies in different strategies table 5 according to the table the highest indexes of chickpea bean maize alfalfa and onion have been calculated in s1 however cucumber has had the most efficiency in s2 because of the selling price comparing the evaluation parameter and planning system for potato show that the economic efficiency of water in s6 for all cprs are the same and the lowest amongst the other strategies the best condition for managing water distribution in this product is s4 allocation based on the water requirement the competitive ability of potato is less than other spring crops due to lower prices the increase of wp under water stress is attributed to biomass production being reduced less by drought than water use anyia and herzog 2004 as shown in fig 9 except for sugar beet maize and alfalfa the highest water productivity values belong to s5 wps for sugar beet alfalfa and maize have the lowest values in the economic strategy s3 3 2 uncertainty analysis in the proposed structure an uncertainty analysis was incorporated into programming frameworks to account for extensive parameter uncertainties madani and dinar 2012 regulwar and gurav 2012 lu et al 2009 kerachian et al 2010 for this purpose the product simulation model and a multi objective optimization algorithm i e nsgaii deb et al 2002 are implemented to evaluate the fuzzy responses of the model against the uncertainties of water supply hence input fuzzy numbers are discretized in the two levels of membership function based on a percentage of optimal allocated water e g 0 25 to estimate the extreme values of the relative net benefit nsgaii generates the initial population randomly and evaluates two objective functions for each crop the population is sorted based on the non domination principle and is classified in different fronts that the best level of non dominated solutions is called pareto front every chromosome in each front ranked by closeness distance criterion to guide the solutions in pareto front toward the boundary solutions haghighi and zahedi asl 2014 fig 10 presents the fuzzy numbers of irrigation water mm on the right and the fuzzy response of the model dimensionless ratio of the net benefit per water price on the left according to the figure the net benefits of alfalfa sugar beet and maize are the lowest against other crops despite receiving the highest volume of water changes in the amount of water allocated for these products did not have a significant effect on their economic efficiency the fuzzy analysis results indicate that with saving about 4 5 million cubic meters of allocated water for these crops only 8 5 percent of their net profit will decrease the existing uncertainties have the greatest impacts on the tomato and onion production therefore sustainable planning especially the use of drip irrigation systems is essential for these products 3 3 irrigation planning fig 11 shows the variation of water balance in a growing season for alfalfa with 7 day irrigation intervals as shown in the figure harvesting is carried out three times the highest amount of runoff evaporation and deep percolation occurred during irrigation after the harvest time the 7 day irrigation interval for alfalfa has not been optimal and has led to an increase in soil layers finally a schematic illustration of the relationships between crops water availability and decision making rules has been provided for representing the most suitable cropping pattern fig 12 five criteria i e benefit per cost water saving eew eel and wp and four decision parameters i e cultivated area selling price products yield production and water demand have been combined to achieve the optimal policies a decision guide has been presented in the figure with different shapes decision making components and lines objective indicator under wet black and dry white conditions for example the main crops of a sustainable cropping pattern for increasing the water productivity in a drought year are lentil bean cucumber and chickpea hence s3 is suggested for water allocation for the proposed optimal cropping pattern 3 4 research implications and limitations this paper investigated the impact of groundwater exploitation plans on agricultural water supply sustainability in the shahrekord plain iran considerations for developing strategies for optimal water alloation to agricultural demands and managing groundwater resources were discussed it was shown that the proposed groundwater management strategies can help regional water supply agencies meet future demands furthermore this methodology with a daily time step can help decision makers in real time modeling and water allocation from hydrologic and economic points of view the current policies for groundwater exploitation in the shahrekord plain do not guarantee the sustainability of groundwater the results show that cprs strategies can be effectively used for groundwater management in the study area the developed concept is subject to several limitations in the simulation optimization model the existing uncertainties in the selling prices of products have not been incorporated moreover the model does not directly consider the losses during water delivery to agricultural lands 4 summary and conclusion optimization of cropping patterns can improve the management of agricultural water resources for sustaining agricultural productivity and sustainable development sun et al 2017 varade and patel 2018 the main objective of the study was to develop a model for optimal allocation of groundwater in agriculture based on the actual demands of crops the limitations affecting water soil and cropping pattern as well as economic parameters this has been made by choosing a suitable decision based on different strategies for managing groundwater exploitation and shows the best option in the context of water scarcity it was important to use the obtained results in the decision making system for the issuance of groundwater withdrawal permits selection of appropriate cropping patterns water pricing prediction of yield production etc singh 2015 lalehzari et al 2016 groundwater is a common pool resource that should be involved in the water distribution management system between beneficiaries and yield productions the results show that the targeting of cprs has led to an increase in the net income of farmers and the overall pattern of cultivation the study of water discharges in the soil is necessary for the proper estimation of water requirements and therefore optimal allocation various management parameters affect the water use efficiency including irrigation germination time root depth and canopy cover one of the factors that reduce the yield and income of some plants such as potatoes peas and beans in s5 and s6 has been the discrepancy of these plants with the seven day irrigation cycle which was considered as their default some plants such as alfalfa maize wheat and barley have better compatibility with long term irrigation intervals the best water allocation program will occur when in addition to the value time was also considered as a variable for products in future studies the existing uncertainties in available water resources can be better incorporated using the conditional value at risk method also assessing the relationship between the cost of water supply and cropping patterns could be a topic for future works declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10482,optimal crop nitrogen n management is required to minimize n losses to the environment in vegetable crop production there are several approaches based on soil and plant monitoring that can assist to improve n management these include soil monitoring destructive tissue n analysis petiole sap nitrate no3 analysis and non destructive optical sensors crop based methods and portable rapid analysis systems the most promising optical sensors for guiding n management in vegetable production considering performance and practicality are chlorophyll meters and canopy reflectance sensors the crop based methods are generally sensitive indicators of crop n status in a wide range of vegetable crops however they tend to have reduced sensitivity when n supply is excessive a notable feature of soil monitoring methods e g the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method soil solution monitoring is that they can detect excess n supply the combination of crop and soil monitoring will provide vegetable growers with tools to detect crop n deficiency and excess n supply the selection of the best monitoring approach for a given farm will depend on factors such as crop and farm characteristics the farmer s technical level technical support and economic considerations soil and crop monitoring approaches could form part of improved management packages that include decision support systems dss to determine crop n and or irrigation requirements and monitoring of soil water status the use of such packages when combined with fertigation and drip irrigation is key for very efficient n management of vegetable crops with reduced n loss to the environment keywords chlorophyll reflectance sap analysis soil solution tissue analysis vegetation indices 1 introduction the high value of vegetable production encourages growers to apply high nitrogen n rates and frequent irrigation to ensure high yields agostini et al 2010 thompson et al 2017 2020a commonly n fertilizer and irrigation applications are excessive fereres et al 2003 thompson et al 2007 2020a contributing to nitrate no3 leaching loss ramos et al 2002 zotarelli et al 2007 and subsequent no3 accumulation in water bodies ju et al 2007 pulido bosch et al 2000 thompson et al 2020a several additional characteristics of vegetable production such as high cropping intensity and shallow root systems thompson et al 2020a thorup kristensen and kirkegaard 2016 increase the risk of no3 leaching loss public and scientific concerns of environmental impacts have increased political pressure to reduce no3 contamination of water bodies from agriculture in the european union eu the nitrates directive council of the european communities 1991 and the water framework directive council of the european communities 2000 require farmers to adopt improved n management practices in areas vulnerable to no3 contamination current commercial n management in vegetable production is largely based on the accumulated experience of growers and advisors of practices that maximize yield and ensure profitability thompson et al 2007 2020a improved crop n management requires that n fertilizer application should supplement other n sources to ensure that crop n demand is satisfied while avoiding an excessive n supply soto et al 2015 thompson et al 2017 necessary components of optimal n fertilization of vegetable crops are assessment of crop soil n status to determine if the n supply is deficient adequate or excessive assessment of the degree of deficiency or excess and using these assessments to quantitatively adjust n fertilizer management such assessments can be done by monitoring the soil to assess the immediate soil n supply the crop to assess its n status or both three general n monitoring approaches used with vegetable crops are soil monitoring assessment of crop n status using destructive methods i e leaf tissue analysis and petiole sap analysis and assessment of crop n status using non destructive methods i e optical sensors both proximal and remote sensors and electrical impedance spectroscopy these three general approaches will be reviewed with a focus on practical methods used on commercial farms methods with potential for practical use and methods that have been the subject of recent applied research conducted in a farming context 2 soil monitoring for n management in the context of this review soil monitoring is the periodic sampling and analysis of soil or soil solution to assess the adequacy of the immediate n supply during a crop it differs from individual analyses of soil mineral n or no3 conducted as part of n fertilizer recommendation schemes that determine the total amount of fertilizer n required for an individual crop n fertilizer recommendation schemes for vegetable crops such as the nmin and kns are described by thompson et al 2017 and in the accompanying article in this special issue by tei et al 2020 three soil monitoring methods have been used to assist with n management of vegetable crops in europe being the saturation extract the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method and soil solution analysis 2 1 the saturation extract solutions from the saturated extract procedure used for soil salinity assessment have been analyzed for no3 concentration to inform of the immediately available n supply sonneveld et al 1990 sonneveld and voogt 2009 given the time and laboratory requirements to obtain the saturated extract this is not a practical option for regular monitoring of commercial crops 2 2 the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method this method is used in the netherlands to assess root zone soil no3 in commercial greenhouse grown vegetable crops that are grown in soil with fertigation in this system nutrient solutions are frequently applied the nutrient solutions used with soil grown crops are similar to those used for soilless crop sonneveld and voogt 2009 in which n is applied principally as no3 composite soil samples 0 25 cm are taken regularly generally monthly during a crop and extracted with water one volume of soil to two volumes of water sonneveld et al 1990 sonneveld and voogt 2009 thompson et al 2017 the relationship of the no3 concentration no3 in the extract solution to target values is used to adjust if required the no3 of the nutrient solution applied by fertigation the adjustment procedure is illustrated in fig 1 when the extract no3 is within the range b c mmol l 1 the standard no3 of nutrient solution is maintained fig 1 when the extract no3 is progressively less than b mmol l 1 the no3 of nutrient solution is progressively increased when the extract no3 is progressively higher than c mmol l 1 the no3 of nutrient solution is progressively decreased other nutrients and electrical conductivity are managed using the same approach sonneveld et al 1990 sonneveld and voogt 2009 this method is used for n management where all fertilizer n is applied by fertigation by drip or sprinkler irrigation nutrient solution composition varies with species and are adjusted for factors such as water quality cropping stage and soil type sonneveld and voogt 2009 with very frequent nutrient addition by fertigation it is the immediately available nutrients in soil that are of interest optimization of frequent nutrient addition requires frequent testing which in turn requires simple and quick procedures to obtain and prepare samples the use of fresh soil sampling by volume and the use of a simple ratio with this method facilitates rapid sample preparation in dutch commercial practice 40 cores 2 cm diameter are taken in each sampled area in drip irrigated row crops 50 of the cores are taken 10 cm from a plant and 50 are taken midway between plants in the same row in sprinkler irrigated crops such as lettuce or radish where the complete soil surface is cropped samples are taken at random samples are taken when the soil is at or close to field capacity avoiding very moist soil immediately after irrigation where crops are grown in raised beds only the beds are sampled a full description of the use of 1 2 soil water extract method in commercial dutch greenhouses is available in dutch in van den bos et al 1999 other descriptions are available in sonneveld et al 1990 and sonneveld and voogt 2009 in addition to commercial greenhouse growers in the netherlands this method has been adapted to greenhouse conditions in italy incrocci et al 2017 and greece de kreij et al 2007 the sufficiency range values determined for crops in italy are somewhat lower than those used in the netherlands incrocci et al 2017 in italy this method is used by some greenhouse growers in combination with the greenfert software that facilitates data interpretation incrocci et al 2017 while the method has mostly been used with greenhouse crops it can be used with open field fertigated crops given that the reference values are verified adapted 2 3 soil solution analysis the no3 of the soil solution in the root zone can be used to assist with n management of fertigated vegetable crops thompson et al 2017 like the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method this method informs of the immediately available n in the root zone soil solution is sampled regularly e g every 1 4 weeks during a crop with ceramic cup suction samplers the sampler enables periodic sampling of the soil solution from where roots are concentrated such as from within the drip irrigation bulb thompson et al 2017 the ceramic cup of the suction sampler is placed within the zone of maximum root density depending on the crop and soil characteristics in almeria greenhouses where the root distribution is generally relatively shallow padilla et al 2017c because of the local soil system thompson et al 2007 the ceramic cup is usually placed at 10 20 cm soil depth and 8 10 cm from the main stem of the plant ceramic cup suction samplers collect soil solution from the soil volume immediately surrounding the ceramic cup consequently the soil solution sampled with each sampler is a localized point measurement this enables on going monitoring of specific locations however it can also result in appreciable spatial variability in the measured soil solution no3 hartz 2003 particularly where n is applied by combined fertigation and drip irrigation through replication and careful selection of representative locations avoiding unrepresentative plants and border areas and in greenhouses by avoiding zones of rainfall entry the spatial variability of drip irrigated and fertigated crops can be substantially reduced granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2017 an important practical issue with ceramic cup suction samplers is the limited range of soil matric potentials at which sampling is possible these samplers are only effective in moist soils with matric potentials in the approximate range of 0 to 50 kpa the vacuum within the sampler must be more negative than the matric potential of the surrounding soil the commonly used manual vacuum pumps apply a maximum vacuum of approximately 60 kpa because of the limited soil moisture range suction samplers are best suited to vegetable crops grown in continually moist soils such as in greenhouses or cool season outdoor crops in other crops they are best used soon after irrigation or rainfall the general use of suction samplers to sample soil solution was reviewed by grossmann and udluft 1991 recommended sampling procedures for routine practical soil solution no3 concentration monitoring are to apply vacuum 12 24 h after the previous irrigation to allow equilibration of the soil solution and then to maintain the vacuum for 12 24 h granados et al 2013 peña fleitas et al 2015 two general approaches are used for data interpretation and n management 1 the use of absolute limits either as an individual value sufficiency value or as a range sufficiency range and 2 the use of tendencies a sufficiency value differentiates between deficient below the value and sufficient above the value a sufficiency range differentiates between deficient below the minimum value sufficient between the above the minimum and maximum values and excess above maximum value identification of absolute limits is challenging because of the interaction of numerous factors e g crop species and phenology soil characteristics and spatial variability absolute sufficiency values of 4 5 mmol no3 l 1 have been proposed hartz and hochmuth 1996 thompson et al 2020b 2017 consistently lower values are suggestive of an insufficient n supply maximum absolute value of 12 15 mmol no3 l 1 have been suggested for greenhouse grown crops in south eastern spain granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2020b values that are consistently clearly higher than the n concentrations typically applied by fertigation of 10 12 mmol no3 l 1 are suggestive of an excessive n supply an on going tendency of increasing soil solution no3 is an indicator of excessive n application with fertigated drip irrigated vegetable crops particularly where little drainage and therefore no3 leaching occurs gallardo et al 2006 granados et al 2013 peña fleitas et al 2015 this can be seen in fig 2 with a fertigated tomato receiving very frequent n application peña fleitas et al 2015 there was a moderate on going increase in soil solution no3 with an applied nutrient solution of 13 mmol no3 l 1 and a much more rapid on going increase in soil solution no3 with an applied nutrient solution of 22 mmol no3 l 1 fig 2 peña fleitas et al 2015 conversely negative tendencies can indicate insufficient n supply the use of tendencies overcomes the uncertainties associated with spatial variation of point measurements dealing with spatial variability is likely to be relatively more important with commercial growers than in research studies because of grower reluctance to have sufficient number e g four of replicated samplers within a crop soil solution no3 has been used in combination with other methods as part of a prescriptive corrective management approach giller et al 2004 for combined n and irrigation management granados et al 2013 magán et al 2019 both granados et al 2013 and magán et al 2019 used soil solution no3 in combination with decision support systems dss that estimated both crop n and irrigation requirements granados et al 2013 used sufficiency ranges and magán et al 2019 used minimum sufficiency values and tendencies to interpret soil solution no3 data these studies reported reductions in n fertilizer use and no3 leaching of 35 38 and 58 63 respectively small portable rapid test systems parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 can be used for on farm measurement of no3 in soil solution samples these are discussed in section 6 soil solution obtained with suction samplers can also be used to monitor soil solution electrical conductivity and other nutrients while much of the research work to data has been conducted in greenhouse soils soil solution suction samplers can also be used in open field conditions given that soil moisture conditions are adequate 2 4 general observations on soil monitoring for n management a notable feature of the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method and the sampling of soil solution no3 is that both methods can detect both excessive and deficient n supply the capacity to detect excess n is influenced by crop management and drainage nevertheless the capacity to detect n excess is an important feature for intensive vegetable production where excessive n supply is common given this capacity soil monitoring methods have an important role in the development of improved n management of vegetable production either alone or in combination with other methods they could form part of management packages that include crop monitoring of n status the use of dss to determine crop and or irrigation requirements and monitoring of soil crop water status 3 interpretation of crop n monitoring data monitoring of crop n status potentially integrates crop n demand and soil n supply schröder et al 2000 many of the crop n monitoring approaches that are described in this review enable rapid in situ assessment of crop n status to provide users with information on crop n status i e to inform of whether a crop n status is deficient or sufficient either relative or absolute values of monitoring can be used to assess n status when monitoring measurements deviate from what indicates sufficient crop n status n fertilizer management should be adjusted using a semi quantitative adjustment approach this is done by adding more or less n to a previously prepared plan of n fertilizer application gianquinto et al 2004 thompson et al 2017 using a quantitative adjustment approach algorithms calculate the adjustment to the n fertilizer plan the following sections describe the use of relative and absolute sufficiency values of crop monitoring measurements 3 1 use of relative nitrogen sufficiency indices reference plots a common procedure to interpret crop monitoring measurements is to divide measured values determined within the crop by values measured in a well fertilized reference plot that has no n limitation the resulting ratio is known as the nitrogen sufficiency index nsi debaeke et al 2006 piekielek et al 1995 the underlying concept of the nsi is that monitoring measurements saturate or reach a plateau when there is no n limitation on crop growth nsi values of 1 indicate n deficiency and nsi values 1 indicate n sufficiency an alternative to the establishment of reference plots is the use of virtual reference plots holland and schepers 2013 where an area within the field with good growth is assumed not to be n limited and is used for reference measurements one of the main advantages of the use of the nsi is that it reduces the influence of factors other than n on monitoring measurements abiotic and water stress disease incidence and cultivar may influence monitoring measurements similarly in both the measured area and the reference plot the use of reference plots isolates the effect of n status of the measured area samborski et al 2009 thompson et al 2017 reference plots were developed for cereal crops there are few examples of the use of reference plots in vegetable crops westerveld et al 2004 used an optical sensor spad 502 chlorophyll meter to aid n fertilization management of cabbage carrots and onions n fertilization was applied whenever measurements with proximal sensors fell below 95 97 of values in the reference plot similarly gianquinto et al 2010 used a reference plot to guide n fertilization in muskmelon using a chlorophyll meter see section 5 1 1 which resulted in significantly lower n application a limitation of the use of reference plots in fertigated vegetable crops is the requirement for an additional irrigation sector independent from that of the main crop additionally the work and calculation involved in periodic programming of fertigation would be doubled for practical reasons reference plots are not attractive for fertigated commercial vegetable crops a consideration with reference plots is the size and number of reference plots required in general plot size should be large enough to allow regular measurements on a representative crop area in fields with homogeneous soil and topography one representative reference plot is sufficient however in heterogeneous fields one reference plot is required for each identifiable zone of soil and topography 3 2 use of absolute sufficiency values of monitoring measurements the use of absolute sufficiency values of monitoring measurements overcomes the practical limitations of establishing reference plots in fertigated vegetable crops also farmers are not required to calculate sufficiency values absolute sufficiency values are made available to farmers and technical advisors through extension services following determination in research studies two approaches have been used to determine absolute sufficiency values for vegetable crops 1 the fitting of yield response regression lines and 2 the use of relationships with an indicator of crop n status yield based sufficiency values are calculated from segmented linear plateau regression analysis relating relative yield to crop monitoring measurements gianquinto et al 2004 padilla et al 2017b using the first approach relative yield is used to standardize yield across years cultivars and cropping conditions using the second approach absolute sufficiency values are derived from the relationship between nitrogen nutrition index nni which is an established indicator of crop n status lemaire et al 2008 and the monitoring measurements padilla et al 2015 nni values of 1 indicate n deficiency of 1 indicate n excess and of 1 indicate n sufficiency lemaire et al 2008 the nni is calculated as the ratio between actual crop n content and the critical crop n content which is the minimum n content necessary for maximum growth greenwood et al 1990 the critical crop n content is obtained from the critical n curve which is a power function that relates above ground dry matter production with crop n content greenwood et al 1990 specific critical n curves are available for some vegetable species such as tomato peña fleitas et al 2015 tei et al 2002 sweet pepper rodríguez et al 2020 and cucumber padilla et al 2016 a general critical n curve has been described for c3 crops greenwood et al 1990 and researchers are continually producing critical n curves for more species absolute sufficiency values of monitoring measurements have been related to thermal time gianquinto et al 2010 padilla et al 2015 or phenological stages de souza et al 2019 padilla et al 2018 sufficiency values provided for phenological stages facilitate the on farm use of monitoring approaches because measurements are related to easily recognizable crop development stages padilla et al 2016 the use of absolute sufficiency values related to crop age e g days after transplanting has limited applicability with vegetable crops because of variations in planting dates crop cycles climate locations etc 4 determination of crop n status using destructive methods 4 1 leaf tissue n analysis leaf tissue n analysis refers to the measurement of total n content in leaf blades of the most recently fully expanded leaves it is a long established method for monitoring crop n status geraldson and tyler 1990 hartz and hochmuth 1996 generally sufficiency ranges for individual phenological phases of a species are used to interpret results sufficiency ranges are available for various vegetable species grown in greenhouse or open field conditions in different regions geraldson and tyler 1990 hartz and hochmuth 1996 hochmuth et al 2015 as a n monitoring method leaf tissue n analysis is a relatively insensitive measure of crop n status due to the limited response of leaf n content to short periods of inadequate n supply olsen and lyons 1994 additionally it requires laboratory analysis and there is an inevitable time delay associated with transporting samples analysis and report preparation consequently this method is not suitable for rapid adjustments of n fertilization required by fertigation which is being increasingly used in vegetable production from the farmer s perspective the logistics of handling and transporting samples and the cost of analysis are major disadvantages for regular monitoring thompson et al 2017 although tissue analysis is limited as a n monitoring approach multi element tissue analysis is useful for diagnosis of possible nutritional problems 4 2 sap no3 analysis sap no3 analysis measures the no3 in a solution obtained from conducting tissue xylem phloem plus the apoplastic cytosolic and vacuolar water of fresh petioles hochmuth 1994 sap is extracted by squeezing petiole tissue most commonly by using a domestic garlic press the sensitivity of petiole sap no3 to crop n status has been established for various vegetable crops such as tomato farneselli et al 2014 hartz and bottoms 2009 peña fleitas et al 2015 pepper olsen and lyons 1994 potato goffart et al 2008 lettuce broccoli and watermelon hartz et al 1993 and onion cabbage and carrots westerveld et al 2004 petiole sap no3 is appreciably more sensitive to crop n supply than total leaf n content olsen and lyons 1994 generally petioles are obtained from the most recent fully expanded leaf to reduce variation between individual plants it is recommended to collect 25 petioles from different representative plants in a field or plot goffart et al 2008 recommended protocols should be strictly and consistently followed for leaf selection time of sampling petiole removal petiole handling and storage sap extraction and storage of sap samples farneselli et al 2006 goffart et al 2008 hochmuth 2012 1994 thompson et al 2017 also sampled crops should not be suffering from water stress or deficiencies of other nutrients farneselli et al 2006 goffart et al 2008 generally it was reported that petiole sap no3 concentration declined notably as crops grow hartz and bottoms 2009 hochmuth 2012 1994 recommendations were commonly made as sufficiency ranges for phenological phases with recommended values generally declining as crops developed hochmuth 2012 1994 however a number of recent studies with fertigated vegetable crops receiving very frequent n addition have reported that petiole sap no3 remained relatively constant throughout the crop fig 3 this has been observed in tomato farneselli et al 2014 peña fleitas et al 2015 muskmelon peña fleitas et al 2015 pepper magán et al 2019 and cucumber r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data strong consistent relationships between petiole sap no3 and nni throughout crops were reported for fertigated tomato and muskmelon peña fleitas et al 2015 fertigated tomato farneselli et al 2014 and fertigated sweet pepper r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data a single linear regression equation described the relationship between petiole sap no3 and nni for both greenhouse grown indeterminate tomato in almeria spain and open field determinate processing tomato in perugia italy fig 4 peña fleitas et al 2015 this single equation covered most of the duration of one greenhouse grown tomato crop in almeria and of two open field tomato crops in perugia solving the unique regression equation for nni 1 provided a unique sufficiency value for growth of 1050 mg n no3 l 1 throughout the tomato crop fig 4 peña fleitas et al 2015 similarly a single relationship was obtained for several fertigated pepper crops r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data there are very few reports of relationships between petiole sap no3 and nni in crops other than vegetables bélanger et al 2003 reported linear relationships in potato that shifted with crop growth however it was notable that all n was applied at planting certain aspects of the behaviour of sap no3 in fertigated vegetable crops with frequent n addition in recent studies have differed from that generally observed in earlier studies with more infrequent n application generally in those earlier studies sap no3 declined throughout the crop it may be that very frequent application of n by combined fertigation and drip irrigation reduces the effects of otherwise influential factors on the tendency of sap no3 concentration during a crop however the relative constancy of sap no3 in fertigated vegetable crops with frequent n addition has not always been observed hartz and bottoms 2009 reported an appreciable on going reduction in sap no3 of fertigated tomato in california receiving weekly n addition there is currently insufficient data of fertigated vegetable crops to establish conclusively whether and or how frequent n addition affects the response of petiole sap no3 to crop n status petiole sap no3 analysis is generally sensitive to crop n status of vegetable crops particularly to n deficiency this method can provide information on the adequacy of crop n status for a given species within a given region this requires local field trials to determine validate sufficiency values petiole sap no3 values can be influenced by factors such as cultivar the timing and amount of the previous n application and rainfall enhancing soil n mineralization goffart et al 2008 site and variety have been reported to affect sap no3 values belec et al 2001 westerveld et al 2007 regular n applications general crop management practices and similarity of cultivars are likely to improve consistency both within and between regions it appears that the very frequent n addition of fertigated vegetable crops can reduce the influence of crop management and climatic factors while there are indications that petiole sap no3 can identify clearly excessive n supply there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions however it appears that measured sap no3 can clearly exceed sufficiency values thereby providing an indication of excessive crop n status sap no3 analysis has been used in commercial farming to assist with crop n management it has been used by potato farmers in belgium and the netherlands w voogt wageningen university and research the netherlands personal communication private companies have been active for a number of years offering sap analysis of various nutrients including no3 to assist with nutrient management of commercial horticultural crops in the netherlands and in australia an interesting adaptation of one of these private companies is the use of blade sap rather than petiole sap magán et al 2019 used petiole sap no3 concentration as part of a treatment with prescriptive corrective management giller et al 2004 in which sap no3 was consistently notably lower than in a conventionally managed treatment small portable rapid test systems parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 can be used for rapid on farm measurement of the no3 concentration in petiole sap these methods are reviewed in section 6 5 determination of crop n status using non destructive methods 5 1 optical sensors optical sensors provide measurements of optical properties of crops that are indicative of crop n status thereby indicating n sufficiency or the degree of n deficiency these sensors do not directly measure n content or n status of crops but they provide an indirect measurement that is related to actual crop n content or crop n status cartelat et al 2005 mistele and schmidhalter 2008 padilla et al 2014 optical sensors are generally used for proximal sensing i e positioned either in contact or close to the crop 0 4 3 0 m from the crop canopy some optical sensors e g spectral radiometers or multispectral cameras are also used for remote sensing applications i e on unmanned aerial vehicles drones or planes the advantages of the use of optical sensors are that the measurements are made instantly and that the results are very rapidly available padilla et al 2018b some optical sensors measure very small areas of leaves e g chlorophyll meters whereas others measure relatively large areas of crop canopy through continuous on the go measurement table 1 padilla et al 2018b 5 1 1 chlorophyll meters chlorophyll meters are hand held optical sensors that estimate chlorophyll content per leaf area the rationale for using chlorophyll meters for monitoring crop n status is that chlorophyll content is directly related to leaf n content evans 1989 hatfield et al 2008 the measured area is generally 10 mm2 consequently appreciable replication and consistent measurement protocols are required the chlorophyll meter output is a dimensionless value that is related to the actual chlorophyll content markwell et al 1995 monje and bugbee 1992 parry et al 2014 most chlorophyll meters measure transmittance of red and near infra red nir radiation by the leaf the red radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll and the nir is mostly transmitted by chlorophyll fox and walthall 2008 there are currently several commercially available chlorophyll meters table 1 the spad 502 meter is the most commonly used padilla et al 2018b chlorophyll meter measurements have been used as reliable indicators of leaf n content or crop n status in many vegetable crops such as tomato gianquinto et al 2006b padilla et al 2015 muskmelon gianquinto et al 2010 padilla et al 2014 cucumber padilla et al 2017a sweet pepper de souza et al 2019 potato gianquinto et al 2004 olivier et al 2006 and lettuce mendoza tafolla et al 2019 there are reports where chlorophyll meter measurements did not distinguish different n nutrition of tomato farneselli et al 2010 ulissi et al 2011 and cucumber güler and büyük 2007 these contradictory results were likely due to small differences in leaf n content sufficiency values of chlorophyll meter measurements are available for determinate processing tomato gianquinto et al 2004 2006a indeterminate fresh market tomato padilla et al 2018 2015 cucumber güler and büyük 2007 padilla et al 2017a potato gianquinto et al 2003 and sweet pepper de souza et al 2019 in some crops the sufficiency values determined were relatively constant throughout the crop therefore an average sufficiency value could be calculated for the complete crop cycle in indeterminate tomato an average value of 54 2 spad units was determined padilla et al 2018 in cucumber sufficiency values of 45 2 spad units padilla et al 2017a and 44 9 spad units güler and büyük 2007 have been recommended for the complete crop cycle in potato a sufficiency value of 38 2 spad units was recommended for the complete crop cycle gianquinto et al 2003 in contrast for sweet pepper there were large differences in spad sufficiency values between phenological stages of between 49 7 and 65 2 spad units de souza et al 2019 this suggested that a single spad sufficiency value cannot be used for a complete sweet pepper crop these data also demonstrate that each species must be evaluated separately sufficiency values of chlorophyll meter measurements are likely to be affected by cultivar de souza et al 2020 monostori et al 2016 care should be taken when using sufficiency values determined for a particular cultivar to other cultivars of the same species there is a commonly held view that chlorophyll meter measurements saturate and are not sensitive at high chlorophyll contents fox and walthall 2008 the saturation effect is seen as a plateau response of chlorophyll meter measurements to increasingly high chlorophyll contents padilla et al 2018a saturation implies that under these conditions chlorophyll meters are unable to detect differences in chlorophyll content saturation has been reported at relatively high crop n contents in vegetable crops goffart et al 2008 however numerous studies have not reported saturation responses in potato gianquinto et al 2004 majic et al 2008 tomato güler and büyük 2007 padilla et al 2015 and muskmelon padilla et al 2014 in cucumber padilla et al 2017a and sweet pepper de souza et al 2019 relatively weak saturation was observed i e asymptotic responses without a clear plateau effect occurred at high chlorophyll content the available results suggest that the saturation response is not universal in vegetable crops there are three factors that influence the saturation response at high chlorophyll content firstly the occurrence of and degrees of species specific luxury n uptake thompson et al 2017 secondly leaf chlorophyll content can vary appreciably between species padilla et al 2018b thirdly the saturation response of chlorophyll meters can be influenced by the equations used to calculate the measured value from the radiation transmission measurements of the meters padilla et al 2018a there are several published reports in which chlorophyll meter measurements were used to guide n fertilization of vegetable crops westerveld et al 2004 used the spad 502 chlorophyll meter to aid n fertilizer management of cabbage carrots and onions in canada half of the recommended n fertilization rate was supplied at pre planting and the rest was applied as side dressing when spad measurements fell below 95 97 of the value of the highest n rate treatment using chlorophyll meter based fertilization n application was reduced by 30 45 kg n ha 1 compared to farmer practice westerveld et al 2004 with tomato in italy the use of chlorophyll meter measurements enabled reductions in n application of 18 45 gianquinto et al 2006b in this latter case a procedure for the calculation of chlorophyll meter threshold values was established using data obtained in previous trials from chlorophyll meter measurements and relative tomato yield see above section 3 2 a large coordinated project was conducted in italy belgium scotland and the netherlands to guide n fertilization of potato using chlorophyll meters gianquinto et al 2004 this work determined absolute sufficiency values see above section 3 2 and equations to determine the rate of side dress n required to maximize yield when chlorophyll meter values were below the sufficiency value in this study chlorophyll meters identified when otherwise routine side dress n applications were not necessary the amount of n to apply na to maximize yield was calculated as follows na kg ha 1 1 yr ymax ncrop nfe hi where yr was relative yield corresponding to the chlorophyll meter values measured in the field ymax was potential yield kg ha 1 that can be obtained by the crop ncrop was plant n concentration nfe was n fertilizer efficiency and hi was harvest index while some of these terms were easy to determine through crop monitoring yr grower experience ymax or the literature ncrop and hi nfe estimation was more difficult because of its dependency on numerous variables nevertheless the combined use of chlorophyll meter measurements with this equation reduced n application by 30 60 gianquinto et al 2004 also in potato olivier et al 2006 developed a practical system to improve crop n management based on the use of a chlorophyll meter hydro n tester table 1 sufficiency values and split n applications the fields were fertilized at planting with 70 of the total n recommendation the remaining 30 was either applied later or not applied depending on whether chlorophyll meter values were below or above the sufficiency value olivier et al 2006 this strategy saved 30 55 kg n ha 1 5 1 2 reflectance sensors reflectance sensors provide information on crop n status by measuring radiation reflected from the crop hatfield et al 2008 ollinger 2011 padilla et al 2018b plant tissues absorb approximately 90 of visible radiation 390 750 nm and reflect approximately 50 of nir 750 1300 nm knipling 1970 reflectance of visible and nir radiation varies with crop n content peñuelas et al 1994 reflectance sensors measure crop reflectance at several wavelengths which is used to calculate vegetation indices the most used vegetation indices and their formulae are presented in table 2 vegetation indices based on red reflectance e g ndvi rvi table 2 saturate at high chlorophyll contents associated with high n application whereas vegetation indices based on reflectance in the red edge band e g rendvi ccci table 2 centered around 720 nm do not saturate daughtry et al 2000 raper and varco 2015 soil reflectance can confound reflectance measurements e g from top down measurement where this may be an issue there are indices that distinguish vegetation reflectance from soil reflectance e g savi table 2 alternatively positioning the sensor to capture a side view of the crop minimizes soil reflectance padilla et al 2018b several studies have evaluated the sensitivity of vegetation indices as indicators of crop n status of vegetable crops such as tomato gianquinto et al 2011 padilla et al 2015 muskmelon padilla et al 2014 cucumber padilla et al 2017d yang et al 2010 and broccoli el shikha et al 2007 the vegetation indices gndvi and gvi were the most sensitive indicators of crop n status and yield for open field processing tomato gianquinto et al 2011 2019 ndvi and rvi were the most sensitive indicators of crop n status in greenhouse grown indeterminate tomato padilla et al 2015 in soil grown cucumber crops ndvi and several other vegetation indices were sensitive indicators of crop n status and yield padilla et al 2017b these results were confirmed by yang et al 2010 for leaf n content in hydroponically grown cucumber similar results with ndvi as an indicator of crop n status were observed in muskmelon another cucurbit crop padilla et al 2014 in broccoli ndvi was a sensitive indicator of crop n status but ccci was more sensitive el shikha et al 2007 a major advantage of canopy reflectance sensors is that they measure a much larger area of the canopy than the leaf based measurement of chlorophyll meters in addition some reflectance sensors e g crop circle sensors greenseeker table 1 make continuous on the go measurement thereby integrating a large area of crop foliage these sensors are mounted on tractors or manually supported on lightweight pole systems there are handheld sensors for making individual spot measurements e g rapidscan cs 45 greenseeker handheld table 1 these sensors are generally simpler and cheaper reflectance sensors can be passive or active depending on whether they have their own light source passive sensors have photodetectors that measure both incident radiation and radiation reflected from the canopy active sensors have a light source that emits visible and nir radiation and photodetectors that measure the reflected radiation solari et al 2008 the main advantage of active sensors over passive sensors is that active sensors can be used under any irradiance conditions fitzgerald 2010 padilla et al 2019 for passive reflectance sensors uniform irradiance conditions are recommended oliveira and scharf 2014 and measurements must be taken during the central hours of the day gianquinto et al 2019 active sensors are best suited for on farm use because their use is not restricted by ambient radiation conditions an important issue with reflectance sensors for on farm use is the cost some of the more sophisticated sensors can cost 6000 in europe simpler sensors are becoming available for 1000 most of the reflectance sensors listed in table 1 provide reflectance data of a small number of pre selected wavelengths two or three bands some sensors e g greenseeker handheld rapidscan cs 45 table 1 provide instant measurement of ndvi on lcd screens other sensors i e crop circle sensors table 1 require data logging and data processing some of these automatically calculate ndvi which can be rapidly downloaded e g crop circle acs 211 table 1 multispectral sensors measure reflectance of 2 10 bands of the electromagnetic spectrum hyperspectral sensors provide reflectance measurements across a broad and nearly continuous spectrum that can range between 400 nm and 2500 nm jain et al 2007 tripodi et al 2018 research has been conducted with multi and hyperspectral sensors gianquinto et al 2011 perry et al 2012 however data processing and interpretation is currently too complex for on farm use thompson et al 2017 research on the application of reflectance sensors to guide n fertilization has mostly been conducted with cereals and potato little work has been conducted with vegetables a n side dress system for potato was developed by van evert et al 2012 using measurements of the weighted difference vegetation index wdvi the amount of side dressed n kg ha 1 was determined as n s i d e d r e s s n o p t i m u m n c r o p where noptimum was crop n uptake for highest yield obtained from literature and ncrop was crop n uptake derived from a pre established relationship between wdvi and crop n uptake using this scheme n savings averaged 44 56 kg n ha 1 23 reduction while maintaining yield for maize scharf and lory 2009 calibrated reflectance measurements to determine the economically optimal side dress n rate application eonr linear and quadratic regression analysis were used to determine eonr from reflectance measurements using these regression equations reflectance based fertilization reduced n fertilizer use by 25 without yield reduction compared to conventional n management scharf et al 2011 complex algorithms that relate vegetation indices to yield and n application rate were developed to guide n fertilizer application to wheat berntsen et al 2006 thomason et al 2011 using a similar algorithm for variable rate n application raun et al 2002 reported that n use efficiency was improved by 15 compared to traditional management with fixed n rates a generalized algorithm for variable rate n fertilization of both maize and wheat was developed by solie et al 2012 the online sensor based nitrogen rate calculator developed by the oklahoma state university provides specific n rate recommendations for a wide range of crops based on measurements of the ndvi vegetation index with the greenseeker sensor table 1 some of the commercial sensors listed in table 1 e g n sensor greenseeker have their own proprietary algorithms to determine optimum n application rate for the measured crop area from canopy reflectance measurements generally these algorithms are not publicly available nor is information available of the validation process however there are exceptions e g holland and schepers 2010 canopy reflectance sensors are used in commercial farming with various field crops for variable rate n application and to aid optimal n rate application as yet there appears to have been very limited use with commercial vegetable crops 5 1 3 fluorescence based flavonols meters flavonols meters are optical sensors that measure relative flavonols content per leaf area padilla et al 2018b tremblay et al 2012 table 1 flavonols are a class of polyphenolic compounds that increase with lower crop n content therefore flavonols content is inversely related to chlorophyll content flavonols meters provide a dimensionless value that is related to the actual flavonols content padilla et al 2018b tremblay et al 2012 a major advantage of flavonols meters is that measurements are not influenced by the soil tremblay et al 2012 however as with chlorophyll meters the small sampling area measured by flavonols meters requires representative and adequate sampling padilla et al 2018b flavonols meters can be used at any time of the day without a significant effect on flavonols measurement tremblay et al 2012 however flavonols content changes between seasons padilla et al 2016 this is very relevant when comparing absolute measurements of flavonols meters throughout long crop cycles there are consistent reports that flavonols meter measurements are sensitive indicators of crop n status this has been observed in broccoli tremblay et al 2009 potato ben abdallah et al 2018 muskmelon padilla et al 2014 cucumber padilla et al 2016 and sweet pepper r de souza university of almeria unpublished data in a review tremblay et al 2012 highlighted that flavonols meter measurements and the nitrogen balance index nbi cartelat et al 2005 were the two most suitable indicators for the assessment of crop n status when using flavonols meters nbi is the ratio between chlorophyll and flavonols contents there are no reports on the use of flavonols meter measurements as tools to guide n fertilizer management in crops additionally the high cost of fluorescence based flavonols meters 3 000 14 000 in europe depending on the model makes unattractive to commercial farmers until practices are established to aid n fertilizer management and the purchase price is reduced it is very unlikely that these meters are applicable on commercial farms 5 2 electrical impedance spectroscopy electrical impedance spectroscopy eis is a technique that measures the impedance of a material or system in response to alternating current ac applied at a certain potential the frequency dependence of the impedance can inform of underlying chemical processes can detect structural characteristics of biological tissue and can detect changes in the physiological state of biological tissue jócsák et al 2019 electrical conduction in biological tissues is related to the presence and mobility of ions in cells data of electrical properties at various frequency ranges informs of the components and structure of cells tissues consequently if a change in tissue structure composition occurs distinctive impedance spectra can be detected eis in lower frequency ranges 10 hz 1 mhz is widely applied in biomedical diagnostics food sciences and in plant sciences jócsák et al 2019 in plant sciences the main applications are for root growth estimation frost hardening capability detection fruit and vegetable quality measurement and abiotic and biotic stress detection jócsák et al 2019 the parameters of eis are also suitable for the estimation of plant nutrient status studies on tomato have shown that electrical impedance can be used to detect and diagnose plant nutrition status for phosphorous meiqing et al 2016 and potassium jinyang et al 2016 muñoz huerta et al 2014 analyzed the electrical impedance response of soilless grown lettuce to different n concentrations in nutrient solution a strong and positive correlation was observed between plant n content and frequency values suggesting that electrical impedance may be sensitive to plant n status for a comprehensive review of the application of electrical impedance measurement on plants see jócsák et al 2019 6 use of portable rapid analysis systems small portable rapid analysis systems can be used for on farm measurements of the no3 in soil solution section 2 3 and petiole sap section 4 2 parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 thereby providing the grower advisor with an almost immediate result after sample collection there are two main groups of rapid analysis systems no3 specific ion sensitive electrode systems such as the laquatwin no3 meters horiba kyoto japan and no3 sensitive test strip readers such as the rqflex reflectometer merck darmstadt germany and nitrachek reflectometer eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands parks et al 2012 provided a detailed description of these two types of on farm rapid analysis systems discussing operation calibration measurement range and interferences parks et al 2012 reported that no3 specific ion sensitive electrode systems tended to overestimate and that they were subject to interference from chloride cl interferences from cl and sulphate so4 2 were reported by di goia et al 2010 from several hundred analyses of nutrient solution soil solution and sap from different vegetable crops good agreement was obtained between no3 specific ion sensitive electrode system and laboratory analysis r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data however in this work there was a tendency for the no3 specific ion sensitive electrode to underestimate sap no3 at no3 of 6500 mg l 1 which was overcome by diluting samples parks et al 2012 reported that while accurate results had been reported with no3 sensitive test strip readers there were limited scientific assessments with plant samples however thompson et al 2009 obtained accurate results using a no3 sensitive test strip reader with sap samples and soil solution these authors reported that the limited range of the no3 sensitive test strip reader used up to 225 mg no3 l 1 rqflex reflectometer required dilution of nearly all samples and that accurate dilution was critically important generally no3 specific ion sensitive electrodes have a much larger working range of no3 than no3 sensitive test strip readers further research is required to fully characterize the performance of the currently available rapid analysis systems nevertheless the available information suggests that they can provide reasonably accurate results that are adequate for monitoring used for on farm decision making parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 however results are less accurate than laboratory analysis considerable care should be taken and instructions should be strictly followed particular care should be given to handling cleaning sample temperature and dilution which if not done correctly can introduce errors parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 results should be periodically checked against laboratory analysis and independent standard aqueous solutions should be regularly analyzed to confirm the accuracy in aqueous solutions di gioia et al 2010 rapid analysis systems are available for the measurement of nutrients other than no3 these systems are test strip readers ion specific electrodes for specific nutrients or multi ion electrode systems that measure the concentrations of various nutrients there are few published scientific studies available that have evaluated these systems 7 management applications of crop and soil n monitoring in vegetable crops this article has reviewed different plant and soil monitoring approaches with the capacities to assess crop and soil n status and to guide n management in vegetable crops these approaches include soil monitoring destructive tissue n analysis petiole sap no3 analysis and non destructive optical sensors electrical impedance spectroscopy crop based methods and portable rapid analysis systems for the measurement of no3 in solution these monitoring approaches have been demonstrated to be sensitive indicators of crop n status in a wide range of vegetable crops and to be useful tools to guide n fertilizer management in general the selection of the best monitoring approach for a given farm will depend on factors such as crop and farm characteristics the farmer s technical level the support provided and economic considerations in scientific terms the selection of an approach for crop n management should consider the capacity to provide information of crop n status throughout the entire crop cycle or at critical stages in practical terms an important issue to consider is the cost and ease of use the high cost of some optical sensors i e above 3 000 makes them unaffordable for small vegetable farmers and local enterprises but it is likely that there will be increasing availability of low cost sensors providing an affordable way to monitor crop n status as a basis to adjust in season n fertilization generally crop based methods are sensitive indicators of crop n status in diverse vegetable crops they are particularly useful to detect n deficiency however they and particularly optical sensors have reduced sensitivity to detect excessive n supply a notable feature of soil monitoring methods e g the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method soil solution monitoring is that they can detect excess n supply the combination of crop and soil monitoring methods will provide vegetable growers with tools to detect crop n deficiency and excess n supply soil and crop monitoring approaches could form part of improved management packages that include the use of dsss to determine crop n requirements see article by gallardo et al 2020 in this special issue in such a prescriptive corrective management package soil and crop monitoring measurements would be the bases of corrective adjustments of the prescriptive n fertilizer plan prepared with the dss the use of such a package particularly when combined with fertigation and drip irrigation will considerably improve n management of vegetable crops resulting in much smaller n losses to the environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10482,optimal crop nitrogen n management is required to minimize n losses to the environment in vegetable crop production there are several approaches based on soil and plant monitoring that can assist to improve n management these include soil monitoring destructive tissue n analysis petiole sap nitrate no3 analysis and non destructive optical sensors crop based methods and portable rapid analysis systems the most promising optical sensors for guiding n management in vegetable production considering performance and practicality are chlorophyll meters and canopy reflectance sensors the crop based methods are generally sensitive indicators of crop n status in a wide range of vegetable crops however they tend to have reduced sensitivity when n supply is excessive a notable feature of soil monitoring methods e g the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method soil solution monitoring is that they can detect excess n supply the combination of crop and soil monitoring will provide vegetable growers with tools to detect crop n deficiency and excess n supply the selection of the best monitoring approach for a given farm will depend on factors such as crop and farm characteristics the farmer s technical level technical support and economic considerations soil and crop monitoring approaches could form part of improved management packages that include decision support systems dss to determine crop n and or irrigation requirements and monitoring of soil water status the use of such packages when combined with fertigation and drip irrigation is key for very efficient n management of vegetable crops with reduced n loss to the environment keywords chlorophyll reflectance sap analysis soil solution tissue analysis vegetation indices 1 introduction the high value of vegetable production encourages growers to apply high nitrogen n rates and frequent irrigation to ensure high yields agostini et al 2010 thompson et al 2017 2020a commonly n fertilizer and irrigation applications are excessive fereres et al 2003 thompson et al 2007 2020a contributing to nitrate no3 leaching loss ramos et al 2002 zotarelli et al 2007 and subsequent no3 accumulation in water bodies ju et al 2007 pulido bosch et al 2000 thompson et al 2020a several additional characteristics of vegetable production such as high cropping intensity and shallow root systems thompson et al 2020a thorup kristensen and kirkegaard 2016 increase the risk of no3 leaching loss public and scientific concerns of environmental impacts have increased political pressure to reduce no3 contamination of water bodies from agriculture in the european union eu the nitrates directive council of the european communities 1991 and the water framework directive council of the european communities 2000 require farmers to adopt improved n management practices in areas vulnerable to no3 contamination current commercial n management in vegetable production is largely based on the accumulated experience of growers and advisors of practices that maximize yield and ensure profitability thompson et al 2007 2020a improved crop n management requires that n fertilizer application should supplement other n sources to ensure that crop n demand is satisfied while avoiding an excessive n supply soto et al 2015 thompson et al 2017 necessary components of optimal n fertilization of vegetable crops are assessment of crop soil n status to determine if the n supply is deficient adequate or excessive assessment of the degree of deficiency or excess and using these assessments to quantitatively adjust n fertilizer management such assessments can be done by monitoring the soil to assess the immediate soil n supply the crop to assess its n status or both three general n monitoring approaches used with vegetable crops are soil monitoring assessment of crop n status using destructive methods i e leaf tissue analysis and petiole sap analysis and assessment of crop n status using non destructive methods i e optical sensors both proximal and remote sensors and electrical impedance spectroscopy these three general approaches will be reviewed with a focus on practical methods used on commercial farms methods with potential for practical use and methods that have been the subject of recent applied research conducted in a farming context 2 soil monitoring for n management in the context of this review soil monitoring is the periodic sampling and analysis of soil or soil solution to assess the adequacy of the immediate n supply during a crop it differs from individual analyses of soil mineral n or no3 conducted as part of n fertilizer recommendation schemes that determine the total amount of fertilizer n required for an individual crop n fertilizer recommendation schemes for vegetable crops such as the nmin and kns are described by thompson et al 2017 and in the accompanying article in this special issue by tei et al 2020 three soil monitoring methods have been used to assist with n management of vegetable crops in europe being the saturation extract the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method and soil solution analysis 2 1 the saturation extract solutions from the saturated extract procedure used for soil salinity assessment have been analyzed for no3 concentration to inform of the immediately available n supply sonneveld et al 1990 sonneveld and voogt 2009 given the time and laboratory requirements to obtain the saturated extract this is not a practical option for regular monitoring of commercial crops 2 2 the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method this method is used in the netherlands to assess root zone soil no3 in commercial greenhouse grown vegetable crops that are grown in soil with fertigation in this system nutrient solutions are frequently applied the nutrient solutions used with soil grown crops are similar to those used for soilless crop sonneveld and voogt 2009 in which n is applied principally as no3 composite soil samples 0 25 cm are taken regularly generally monthly during a crop and extracted with water one volume of soil to two volumes of water sonneveld et al 1990 sonneveld and voogt 2009 thompson et al 2017 the relationship of the no3 concentration no3 in the extract solution to target values is used to adjust if required the no3 of the nutrient solution applied by fertigation the adjustment procedure is illustrated in fig 1 when the extract no3 is within the range b c mmol l 1 the standard no3 of nutrient solution is maintained fig 1 when the extract no3 is progressively less than b mmol l 1 the no3 of nutrient solution is progressively increased when the extract no3 is progressively higher than c mmol l 1 the no3 of nutrient solution is progressively decreased other nutrients and electrical conductivity are managed using the same approach sonneveld et al 1990 sonneveld and voogt 2009 this method is used for n management where all fertilizer n is applied by fertigation by drip or sprinkler irrigation nutrient solution composition varies with species and are adjusted for factors such as water quality cropping stage and soil type sonneveld and voogt 2009 with very frequent nutrient addition by fertigation it is the immediately available nutrients in soil that are of interest optimization of frequent nutrient addition requires frequent testing which in turn requires simple and quick procedures to obtain and prepare samples the use of fresh soil sampling by volume and the use of a simple ratio with this method facilitates rapid sample preparation in dutch commercial practice 40 cores 2 cm diameter are taken in each sampled area in drip irrigated row crops 50 of the cores are taken 10 cm from a plant and 50 are taken midway between plants in the same row in sprinkler irrigated crops such as lettuce or radish where the complete soil surface is cropped samples are taken at random samples are taken when the soil is at or close to field capacity avoiding very moist soil immediately after irrigation where crops are grown in raised beds only the beds are sampled a full description of the use of 1 2 soil water extract method in commercial dutch greenhouses is available in dutch in van den bos et al 1999 other descriptions are available in sonneveld et al 1990 and sonneveld and voogt 2009 in addition to commercial greenhouse growers in the netherlands this method has been adapted to greenhouse conditions in italy incrocci et al 2017 and greece de kreij et al 2007 the sufficiency range values determined for crops in italy are somewhat lower than those used in the netherlands incrocci et al 2017 in italy this method is used by some greenhouse growers in combination with the greenfert software that facilitates data interpretation incrocci et al 2017 while the method has mostly been used with greenhouse crops it can be used with open field fertigated crops given that the reference values are verified adapted 2 3 soil solution analysis the no3 of the soil solution in the root zone can be used to assist with n management of fertigated vegetable crops thompson et al 2017 like the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method this method informs of the immediately available n in the root zone soil solution is sampled regularly e g every 1 4 weeks during a crop with ceramic cup suction samplers the sampler enables periodic sampling of the soil solution from where roots are concentrated such as from within the drip irrigation bulb thompson et al 2017 the ceramic cup of the suction sampler is placed within the zone of maximum root density depending on the crop and soil characteristics in almeria greenhouses where the root distribution is generally relatively shallow padilla et al 2017c because of the local soil system thompson et al 2007 the ceramic cup is usually placed at 10 20 cm soil depth and 8 10 cm from the main stem of the plant ceramic cup suction samplers collect soil solution from the soil volume immediately surrounding the ceramic cup consequently the soil solution sampled with each sampler is a localized point measurement this enables on going monitoring of specific locations however it can also result in appreciable spatial variability in the measured soil solution no3 hartz 2003 particularly where n is applied by combined fertigation and drip irrigation through replication and careful selection of representative locations avoiding unrepresentative plants and border areas and in greenhouses by avoiding zones of rainfall entry the spatial variability of drip irrigated and fertigated crops can be substantially reduced granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2017 an important practical issue with ceramic cup suction samplers is the limited range of soil matric potentials at which sampling is possible these samplers are only effective in moist soils with matric potentials in the approximate range of 0 to 50 kpa the vacuum within the sampler must be more negative than the matric potential of the surrounding soil the commonly used manual vacuum pumps apply a maximum vacuum of approximately 60 kpa because of the limited soil moisture range suction samplers are best suited to vegetable crops grown in continually moist soils such as in greenhouses or cool season outdoor crops in other crops they are best used soon after irrigation or rainfall the general use of suction samplers to sample soil solution was reviewed by grossmann and udluft 1991 recommended sampling procedures for routine practical soil solution no3 concentration monitoring are to apply vacuum 12 24 h after the previous irrigation to allow equilibration of the soil solution and then to maintain the vacuum for 12 24 h granados et al 2013 peña fleitas et al 2015 two general approaches are used for data interpretation and n management 1 the use of absolute limits either as an individual value sufficiency value or as a range sufficiency range and 2 the use of tendencies a sufficiency value differentiates between deficient below the value and sufficient above the value a sufficiency range differentiates between deficient below the minimum value sufficient between the above the minimum and maximum values and excess above maximum value identification of absolute limits is challenging because of the interaction of numerous factors e g crop species and phenology soil characteristics and spatial variability absolute sufficiency values of 4 5 mmol no3 l 1 have been proposed hartz and hochmuth 1996 thompson et al 2020b 2017 consistently lower values are suggestive of an insufficient n supply maximum absolute value of 12 15 mmol no3 l 1 have been suggested for greenhouse grown crops in south eastern spain granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2020b values that are consistently clearly higher than the n concentrations typically applied by fertigation of 10 12 mmol no3 l 1 are suggestive of an excessive n supply an on going tendency of increasing soil solution no3 is an indicator of excessive n application with fertigated drip irrigated vegetable crops particularly where little drainage and therefore no3 leaching occurs gallardo et al 2006 granados et al 2013 peña fleitas et al 2015 this can be seen in fig 2 with a fertigated tomato receiving very frequent n application peña fleitas et al 2015 there was a moderate on going increase in soil solution no3 with an applied nutrient solution of 13 mmol no3 l 1 and a much more rapid on going increase in soil solution no3 with an applied nutrient solution of 22 mmol no3 l 1 fig 2 peña fleitas et al 2015 conversely negative tendencies can indicate insufficient n supply the use of tendencies overcomes the uncertainties associated with spatial variation of point measurements dealing with spatial variability is likely to be relatively more important with commercial growers than in research studies because of grower reluctance to have sufficient number e g four of replicated samplers within a crop soil solution no3 has been used in combination with other methods as part of a prescriptive corrective management approach giller et al 2004 for combined n and irrigation management granados et al 2013 magán et al 2019 both granados et al 2013 and magán et al 2019 used soil solution no3 in combination with decision support systems dss that estimated both crop n and irrigation requirements granados et al 2013 used sufficiency ranges and magán et al 2019 used minimum sufficiency values and tendencies to interpret soil solution no3 data these studies reported reductions in n fertilizer use and no3 leaching of 35 38 and 58 63 respectively small portable rapid test systems parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 can be used for on farm measurement of no3 in soil solution samples these are discussed in section 6 soil solution obtained with suction samplers can also be used to monitor soil solution electrical conductivity and other nutrients while much of the research work to data has been conducted in greenhouse soils soil solution suction samplers can also be used in open field conditions given that soil moisture conditions are adequate 2 4 general observations on soil monitoring for n management a notable feature of the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method and the sampling of soil solution no3 is that both methods can detect both excessive and deficient n supply the capacity to detect excess n is influenced by crop management and drainage nevertheless the capacity to detect n excess is an important feature for intensive vegetable production where excessive n supply is common given this capacity soil monitoring methods have an important role in the development of improved n management of vegetable production either alone or in combination with other methods they could form part of management packages that include crop monitoring of n status the use of dss to determine crop and or irrigation requirements and monitoring of soil crop water status 3 interpretation of crop n monitoring data monitoring of crop n status potentially integrates crop n demand and soil n supply schröder et al 2000 many of the crop n monitoring approaches that are described in this review enable rapid in situ assessment of crop n status to provide users with information on crop n status i e to inform of whether a crop n status is deficient or sufficient either relative or absolute values of monitoring can be used to assess n status when monitoring measurements deviate from what indicates sufficient crop n status n fertilizer management should be adjusted using a semi quantitative adjustment approach this is done by adding more or less n to a previously prepared plan of n fertilizer application gianquinto et al 2004 thompson et al 2017 using a quantitative adjustment approach algorithms calculate the adjustment to the n fertilizer plan the following sections describe the use of relative and absolute sufficiency values of crop monitoring measurements 3 1 use of relative nitrogen sufficiency indices reference plots a common procedure to interpret crop monitoring measurements is to divide measured values determined within the crop by values measured in a well fertilized reference plot that has no n limitation the resulting ratio is known as the nitrogen sufficiency index nsi debaeke et al 2006 piekielek et al 1995 the underlying concept of the nsi is that monitoring measurements saturate or reach a plateau when there is no n limitation on crop growth nsi values of 1 indicate n deficiency and nsi values 1 indicate n sufficiency an alternative to the establishment of reference plots is the use of virtual reference plots holland and schepers 2013 where an area within the field with good growth is assumed not to be n limited and is used for reference measurements one of the main advantages of the use of the nsi is that it reduces the influence of factors other than n on monitoring measurements abiotic and water stress disease incidence and cultivar may influence monitoring measurements similarly in both the measured area and the reference plot the use of reference plots isolates the effect of n status of the measured area samborski et al 2009 thompson et al 2017 reference plots were developed for cereal crops there are few examples of the use of reference plots in vegetable crops westerveld et al 2004 used an optical sensor spad 502 chlorophyll meter to aid n fertilization management of cabbage carrots and onions n fertilization was applied whenever measurements with proximal sensors fell below 95 97 of values in the reference plot similarly gianquinto et al 2010 used a reference plot to guide n fertilization in muskmelon using a chlorophyll meter see section 5 1 1 which resulted in significantly lower n application a limitation of the use of reference plots in fertigated vegetable crops is the requirement for an additional irrigation sector independent from that of the main crop additionally the work and calculation involved in periodic programming of fertigation would be doubled for practical reasons reference plots are not attractive for fertigated commercial vegetable crops a consideration with reference plots is the size and number of reference plots required in general plot size should be large enough to allow regular measurements on a representative crop area in fields with homogeneous soil and topography one representative reference plot is sufficient however in heterogeneous fields one reference plot is required for each identifiable zone of soil and topography 3 2 use of absolute sufficiency values of monitoring measurements the use of absolute sufficiency values of monitoring measurements overcomes the practical limitations of establishing reference plots in fertigated vegetable crops also farmers are not required to calculate sufficiency values absolute sufficiency values are made available to farmers and technical advisors through extension services following determination in research studies two approaches have been used to determine absolute sufficiency values for vegetable crops 1 the fitting of yield response regression lines and 2 the use of relationships with an indicator of crop n status yield based sufficiency values are calculated from segmented linear plateau regression analysis relating relative yield to crop monitoring measurements gianquinto et al 2004 padilla et al 2017b using the first approach relative yield is used to standardize yield across years cultivars and cropping conditions using the second approach absolute sufficiency values are derived from the relationship between nitrogen nutrition index nni which is an established indicator of crop n status lemaire et al 2008 and the monitoring measurements padilla et al 2015 nni values of 1 indicate n deficiency of 1 indicate n excess and of 1 indicate n sufficiency lemaire et al 2008 the nni is calculated as the ratio between actual crop n content and the critical crop n content which is the minimum n content necessary for maximum growth greenwood et al 1990 the critical crop n content is obtained from the critical n curve which is a power function that relates above ground dry matter production with crop n content greenwood et al 1990 specific critical n curves are available for some vegetable species such as tomato peña fleitas et al 2015 tei et al 2002 sweet pepper rodríguez et al 2020 and cucumber padilla et al 2016 a general critical n curve has been described for c3 crops greenwood et al 1990 and researchers are continually producing critical n curves for more species absolute sufficiency values of monitoring measurements have been related to thermal time gianquinto et al 2010 padilla et al 2015 or phenological stages de souza et al 2019 padilla et al 2018 sufficiency values provided for phenological stages facilitate the on farm use of monitoring approaches because measurements are related to easily recognizable crop development stages padilla et al 2016 the use of absolute sufficiency values related to crop age e g days after transplanting has limited applicability with vegetable crops because of variations in planting dates crop cycles climate locations etc 4 determination of crop n status using destructive methods 4 1 leaf tissue n analysis leaf tissue n analysis refers to the measurement of total n content in leaf blades of the most recently fully expanded leaves it is a long established method for monitoring crop n status geraldson and tyler 1990 hartz and hochmuth 1996 generally sufficiency ranges for individual phenological phases of a species are used to interpret results sufficiency ranges are available for various vegetable species grown in greenhouse or open field conditions in different regions geraldson and tyler 1990 hartz and hochmuth 1996 hochmuth et al 2015 as a n monitoring method leaf tissue n analysis is a relatively insensitive measure of crop n status due to the limited response of leaf n content to short periods of inadequate n supply olsen and lyons 1994 additionally it requires laboratory analysis and there is an inevitable time delay associated with transporting samples analysis and report preparation consequently this method is not suitable for rapid adjustments of n fertilization required by fertigation which is being increasingly used in vegetable production from the farmer s perspective the logistics of handling and transporting samples and the cost of analysis are major disadvantages for regular monitoring thompson et al 2017 although tissue analysis is limited as a n monitoring approach multi element tissue analysis is useful for diagnosis of possible nutritional problems 4 2 sap no3 analysis sap no3 analysis measures the no3 in a solution obtained from conducting tissue xylem phloem plus the apoplastic cytosolic and vacuolar water of fresh petioles hochmuth 1994 sap is extracted by squeezing petiole tissue most commonly by using a domestic garlic press the sensitivity of petiole sap no3 to crop n status has been established for various vegetable crops such as tomato farneselli et al 2014 hartz and bottoms 2009 peña fleitas et al 2015 pepper olsen and lyons 1994 potato goffart et al 2008 lettuce broccoli and watermelon hartz et al 1993 and onion cabbage and carrots westerveld et al 2004 petiole sap no3 is appreciably more sensitive to crop n supply than total leaf n content olsen and lyons 1994 generally petioles are obtained from the most recent fully expanded leaf to reduce variation between individual plants it is recommended to collect 25 petioles from different representative plants in a field or plot goffart et al 2008 recommended protocols should be strictly and consistently followed for leaf selection time of sampling petiole removal petiole handling and storage sap extraction and storage of sap samples farneselli et al 2006 goffart et al 2008 hochmuth 2012 1994 thompson et al 2017 also sampled crops should not be suffering from water stress or deficiencies of other nutrients farneselli et al 2006 goffart et al 2008 generally it was reported that petiole sap no3 concentration declined notably as crops grow hartz and bottoms 2009 hochmuth 2012 1994 recommendations were commonly made as sufficiency ranges for phenological phases with recommended values generally declining as crops developed hochmuth 2012 1994 however a number of recent studies with fertigated vegetable crops receiving very frequent n addition have reported that petiole sap no3 remained relatively constant throughout the crop fig 3 this has been observed in tomato farneselli et al 2014 peña fleitas et al 2015 muskmelon peña fleitas et al 2015 pepper magán et al 2019 and cucumber r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data strong consistent relationships between petiole sap no3 and nni throughout crops were reported for fertigated tomato and muskmelon peña fleitas et al 2015 fertigated tomato farneselli et al 2014 and fertigated sweet pepper r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data a single linear regression equation described the relationship between petiole sap no3 and nni for both greenhouse grown indeterminate tomato in almeria spain and open field determinate processing tomato in perugia italy fig 4 peña fleitas et al 2015 this single equation covered most of the duration of one greenhouse grown tomato crop in almeria and of two open field tomato crops in perugia solving the unique regression equation for nni 1 provided a unique sufficiency value for growth of 1050 mg n no3 l 1 throughout the tomato crop fig 4 peña fleitas et al 2015 similarly a single relationship was obtained for several fertigated pepper crops r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data there are very few reports of relationships between petiole sap no3 and nni in crops other than vegetables bélanger et al 2003 reported linear relationships in potato that shifted with crop growth however it was notable that all n was applied at planting certain aspects of the behaviour of sap no3 in fertigated vegetable crops with frequent n addition in recent studies have differed from that generally observed in earlier studies with more infrequent n application generally in those earlier studies sap no3 declined throughout the crop it may be that very frequent application of n by combined fertigation and drip irrigation reduces the effects of otherwise influential factors on the tendency of sap no3 concentration during a crop however the relative constancy of sap no3 in fertigated vegetable crops with frequent n addition has not always been observed hartz and bottoms 2009 reported an appreciable on going reduction in sap no3 of fertigated tomato in california receiving weekly n addition there is currently insufficient data of fertigated vegetable crops to establish conclusively whether and or how frequent n addition affects the response of petiole sap no3 to crop n status petiole sap no3 analysis is generally sensitive to crop n status of vegetable crops particularly to n deficiency this method can provide information on the adequacy of crop n status for a given species within a given region this requires local field trials to determine validate sufficiency values petiole sap no3 values can be influenced by factors such as cultivar the timing and amount of the previous n application and rainfall enhancing soil n mineralization goffart et al 2008 site and variety have been reported to affect sap no3 values belec et al 2001 westerveld et al 2007 regular n applications general crop management practices and similarity of cultivars are likely to improve consistency both within and between regions it appears that the very frequent n addition of fertigated vegetable crops can reduce the influence of crop management and climatic factors while there are indications that petiole sap no3 can identify clearly excessive n supply there are insufficient data to draw firm conclusions however it appears that measured sap no3 can clearly exceed sufficiency values thereby providing an indication of excessive crop n status sap no3 analysis has been used in commercial farming to assist with crop n management it has been used by potato farmers in belgium and the netherlands w voogt wageningen university and research the netherlands personal communication private companies have been active for a number of years offering sap analysis of various nutrients including no3 to assist with nutrient management of commercial horticultural crops in the netherlands and in australia an interesting adaptation of one of these private companies is the use of blade sap rather than petiole sap magán et al 2019 used petiole sap no3 concentration as part of a treatment with prescriptive corrective management giller et al 2004 in which sap no3 was consistently notably lower than in a conventionally managed treatment small portable rapid test systems parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 can be used for rapid on farm measurement of the no3 concentration in petiole sap these methods are reviewed in section 6 5 determination of crop n status using non destructive methods 5 1 optical sensors optical sensors provide measurements of optical properties of crops that are indicative of crop n status thereby indicating n sufficiency or the degree of n deficiency these sensors do not directly measure n content or n status of crops but they provide an indirect measurement that is related to actual crop n content or crop n status cartelat et al 2005 mistele and schmidhalter 2008 padilla et al 2014 optical sensors are generally used for proximal sensing i e positioned either in contact or close to the crop 0 4 3 0 m from the crop canopy some optical sensors e g spectral radiometers or multispectral cameras are also used for remote sensing applications i e on unmanned aerial vehicles drones or planes the advantages of the use of optical sensors are that the measurements are made instantly and that the results are very rapidly available padilla et al 2018b some optical sensors measure very small areas of leaves e g chlorophyll meters whereas others measure relatively large areas of crop canopy through continuous on the go measurement table 1 padilla et al 2018b 5 1 1 chlorophyll meters chlorophyll meters are hand held optical sensors that estimate chlorophyll content per leaf area the rationale for using chlorophyll meters for monitoring crop n status is that chlorophyll content is directly related to leaf n content evans 1989 hatfield et al 2008 the measured area is generally 10 mm2 consequently appreciable replication and consistent measurement protocols are required the chlorophyll meter output is a dimensionless value that is related to the actual chlorophyll content markwell et al 1995 monje and bugbee 1992 parry et al 2014 most chlorophyll meters measure transmittance of red and near infra red nir radiation by the leaf the red radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll and the nir is mostly transmitted by chlorophyll fox and walthall 2008 there are currently several commercially available chlorophyll meters table 1 the spad 502 meter is the most commonly used padilla et al 2018b chlorophyll meter measurements have been used as reliable indicators of leaf n content or crop n status in many vegetable crops such as tomato gianquinto et al 2006b padilla et al 2015 muskmelon gianquinto et al 2010 padilla et al 2014 cucumber padilla et al 2017a sweet pepper de souza et al 2019 potato gianquinto et al 2004 olivier et al 2006 and lettuce mendoza tafolla et al 2019 there are reports where chlorophyll meter measurements did not distinguish different n nutrition of tomato farneselli et al 2010 ulissi et al 2011 and cucumber güler and büyük 2007 these contradictory results were likely due to small differences in leaf n content sufficiency values of chlorophyll meter measurements are available for determinate processing tomato gianquinto et al 2004 2006a indeterminate fresh market tomato padilla et al 2018 2015 cucumber güler and büyük 2007 padilla et al 2017a potato gianquinto et al 2003 and sweet pepper de souza et al 2019 in some crops the sufficiency values determined were relatively constant throughout the crop therefore an average sufficiency value could be calculated for the complete crop cycle in indeterminate tomato an average value of 54 2 spad units was determined padilla et al 2018 in cucumber sufficiency values of 45 2 spad units padilla et al 2017a and 44 9 spad units güler and büyük 2007 have been recommended for the complete crop cycle in potato a sufficiency value of 38 2 spad units was recommended for the complete crop cycle gianquinto et al 2003 in contrast for sweet pepper there were large differences in spad sufficiency values between phenological stages of between 49 7 and 65 2 spad units de souza et al 2019 this suggested that a single spad sufficiency value cannot be used for a complete sweet pepper crop these data also demonstrate that each species must be evaluated separately sufficiency values of chlorophyll meter measurements are likely to be affected by cultivar de souza et al 2020 monostori et al 2016 care should be taken when using sufficiency values determined for a particular cultivar to other cultivars of the same species there is a commonly held view that chlorophyll meter measurements saturate and are not sensitive at high chlorophyll contents fox and walthall 2008 the saturation effect is seen as a plateau response of chlorophyll meter measurements to increasingly high chlorophyll contents padilla et al 2018a saturation implies that under these conditions chlorophyll meters are unable to detect differences in chlorophyll content saturation has been reported at relatively high crop n contents in vegetable crops goffart et al 2008 however numerous studies have not reported saturation responses in potato gianquinto et al 2004 majic et al 2008 tomato güler and büyük 2007 padilla et al 2015 and muskmelon padilla et al 2014 in cucumber padilla et al 2017a and sweet pepper de souza et al 2019 relatively weak saturation was observed i e asymptotic responses without a clear plateau effect occurred at high chlorophyll content the available results suggest that the saturation response is not universal in vegetable crops there are three factors that influence the saturation response at high chlorophyll content firstly the occurrence of and degrees of species specific luxury n uptake thompson et al 2017 secondly leaf chlorophyll content can vary appreciably between species padilla et al 2018b thirdly the saturation response of chlorophyll meters can be influenced by the equations used to calculate the measured value from the radiation transmission measurements of the meters padilla et al 2018a there are several published reports in which chlorophyll meter measurements were used to guide n fertilization of vegetable crops westerveld et al 2004 used the spad 502 chlorophyll meter to aid n fertilizer management of cabbage carrots and onions in canada half of the recommended n fertilization rate was supplied at pre planting and the rest was applied as side dressing when spad measurements fell below 95 97 of the value of the highest n rate treatment using chlorophyll meter based fertilization n application was reduced by 30 45 kg n ha 1 compared to farmer practice westerveld et al 2004 with tomato in italy the use of chlorophyll meter measurements enabled reductions in n application of 18 45 gianquinto et al 2006b in this latter case a procedure for the calculation of chlorophyll meter threshold values was established using data obtained in previous trials from chlorophyll meter measurements and relative tomato yield see above section 3 2 a large coordinated project was conducted in italy belgium scotland and the netherlands to guide n fertilization of potato using chlorophyll meters gianquinto et al 2004 this work determined absolute sufficiency values see above section 3 2 and equations to determine the rate of side dress n required to maximize yield when chlorophyll meter values were below the sufficiency value in this study chlorophyll meters identified when otherwise routine side dress n applications were not necessary the amount of n to apply na to maximize yield was calculated as follows na kg ha 1 1 yr ymax ncrop nfe hi where yr was relative yield corresponding to the chlorophyll meter values measured in the field ymax was potential yield kg ha 1 that can be obtained by the crop ncrop was plant n concentration nfe was n fertilizer efficiency and hi was harvest index while some of these terms were easy to determine through crop monitoring yr grower experience ymax or the literature ncrop and hi nfe estimation was more difficult because of its dependency on numerous variables nevertheless the combined use of chlorophyll meter measurements with this equation reduced n application by 30 60 gianquinto et al 2004 also in potato olivier et al 2006 developed a practical system to improve crop n management based on the use of a chlorophyll meter hydro n tester table 1 sufficiency values and split n applications the fields were fertilized at planting with 70 of the total n recommendation the remaining 30 was either applied later or not applied depending on whether chlorophyll meter values were below or above the sufficiency value olivier et al 2006 this strategy saved 30 55 kg n ha 1 5 1 2 reflectance sensors reflectance sensors provide information on crop n status by measuring radiation reflected from the crop hatfield et al 2008 ollinger 2011 padilla et al 2018b plant tissues absorb approximately 90 of visible radiation 390 750 nm and reflect approximately 50 of nir 750 1300 nm knipling 1970 reflectance of visible and nir radiation varies with crop n content peñuelas et al 1994 reflectance sensors measure crop reflectance at several wavelengths which is used to calculate vegetation indices the most used vegetation indices and their formulae are presented in table 2 vegetation indices based on red reflectance e g ndvi rvi table 2 saturate at high chlorophyll contents associated with high n application whereas vegetation indices based on reflectance in the red edge band e g rendvi ccci table 2 centered around 720 nm do not saturate daughtry et al 2000 raper and varco 2015 soil reflectance can confound reflectance measurements e g from top down measurement where this may be an issue there are indices that distinguish vegetation reflectance from soil reflectance e g savi table 2 alternatively positioning the sensor to capture a side view of the crop minimizes soil reflectance padilla et al 2018b several studies have evaluated the sensitivity of vegetation indices as indicators of crop n status of vegetable crops such as tomato gianquinto et al 2011 padilla et al 2015 muskmelon padilla et al 2014 cucumber padilla et al 2017d yang et al 2010 and broccoli el shikha et al 2007 the vegetation indices gndvi and gvi were the most sensitive indicators of crop n status and yield for open field processing tomato gianquinto et al 2011 2019 ndvi and rvi were the most sensitive indicators of crop n status in greenhouse grown indeterminate tomato padilla et al 2015 in soil grown cucumber crops ndvi and several other vegetation indices were sensitive indicators of crop n status and yield padilla et al 2017b these results were confirmed by yang et al 2010 for leaf n content in hydroponically grown cucumber similar results with ndvi as an indicator of crop n status were observed in muskmelon another cucurbit crop padilla et al 2014 in broccoli ndvi was a sensitive indicator of crop n status but ccci was more sensitive el shikha et al 2007 a major advantage of canopy reflectance sensors is that they measure a much larger area of the canopy than the leaf based measurement of chlorophyll meters in addition some reflectance sensors e g crop circle sensors greenseeker table 1 make continuous on the go measurement thereby integrating a large area of crop foliage these sensors are mounted on tractors or manually supported on lightweight pole systems there are handheld sensors for making individual spot measurements e g rapidscan cs 45 greenseeker handheld table 1 these sensors are generally simpler and cheaper reflectance sensors can be passive or active depending on whether they have their own light source passive sensors have photodetectors that measure both incident radiation and radiation reflected from the canopy active sensors have a light source that emits visible and nir radiation and photodetectors that measure the reflected radiation solari et al 2008 the main advantage of active sensors over passive sensors is that active sensors can be used under any irradiance conditions fitzgerald 2010 padilla et al 2019 for passive reflectance sensors uniform irradiance conditions are recommended oliveira and scharf 2014 and measurements must be taken during the central hours of the day gianquinto et al 2019 active sensors are best suited for on farm use because their use is not restricted by ambient radiation conditions an important issue with reflectance sensors for on farm use is the cost some of the more sophisticated sensors can cost 6000 in europe simpler sensors are becoming available for 1000 most of the reflectance sensors listed in table 1 provide reflectance data of a small number of pre selected wavelengths two or three bands some sensors e g greenseeker handheld rapidscan cs 45 table 1 provide instant measurement of ndvi on lcd screens other sensors i e crop circle sensors table 1 require data logging and data processing some of these automatically calculate ndvi which can be rapidly downloaded e g crop circle acs 211 table 1 multispectral sensors measure reflectance of 2 10 bands of the electromagnetic spectrum hyperspectral sensors provide reflectance measurements across a broad and nearly continuous spectrum that can range between 400 nm and 2500 nm jain et al 2007 tripodi et al 2018 research has been conducted with multi and hyperspectral sensors gianquinto et al 2011 perry et al 2012 however data processing and interpretation is currently too complex for on farm use thompson et al 2017 research on the application of reflectance sensors to guide n fertilization has mostly been conducted with cereals and potato little work has been conducted with vegetables a n side dress system for potato was developed by van evert et al 2012 using measurements of the weighted difference vegetation index wdvi the amount of side dressed n kg ha 1 was determined as n s i d e d r e s s n o p t i m u m n c r o p where noptimum was crop n uptake for highest yield obtained from literature and ncrop was crop n uptake derived from a pre established relationship between wdvi and crop n uptake using this scheme n savings averaged 44 56 kg n ha 1 23 reduction while maintaining yield for maize scharf and lory 2009 calibrated reflectance measurements to determine the economically optimal side dress n rate application eonr linear and quadratic regression analysis were used to determine eonr from reflectance measurements using these regression equations reflectance based fertilization reduced n fertilizer use by 25 without yield reduction compared to conventional n management scharf et al 2011 complex algorithms that relate vegetation indices to yield and n application rate were developed to guide n fertilizer application to wheat berntsen et al 2006 thomason et al 2011 using a similar algorithm for variable rate n application raun et al 2002 reported that n use efficiency was improved by 15 compared to traditional management with fixed n rates a generalized algorithm for variable rate n fertilization of both maize and wheat was developed by solie et al 2012 the online sensor based nitrogen rate calculator developed by the oklahoma state university provides specific n rate recommendations for a wide range of crops based on measurements of the ndvi vegetation index with the greenseeker sensor table 1 some of the commercial sensors listed in table 1 e g n sensor greenseeker have their own proprietary algorithms to determine optimum n application rate for the measured crop area from canopy reflectance measurements generally these algorithms are not publicly available nor is information available of the validation process however there are exceptions e g holland and schepers 2010 canopy reflectance sensors are used in commercial farming with various field crops for variable rate n application and to aid optimal n rate application as yet there appears to have been very limited use with commercial vegetable crops 5 1 3 fluorescence based flavonols meters flavonols meters are optical sensors that measure relative flavonols content per leaf area padilla et al 2018b tremblay et al 2012 table 1 flavonols are a class of polyphenolic compounds that increase with lower crop n content therefore flavonols content is inversely related to chlorophyll content flavonols meters provide a dimensionless value that is related to the actual flavonols content padilla et al 2018b tremblay et al 2012 a major advantage of flavonols meters is that measurements are not influenced by the soil tremblay et al 2012 however as with chlorophyll meters the small sampling area measured by flavonols meters requires representative and adequate sampling padilla et al 2018b flavonols meters can be used at any time of the day without a significant effect on flavonols measurement tremblay et al 2012 however flavonols content changes between seasons padilla et al 2016 this is very relevant when comparing absolute measurements of flavonols meters throughout long crop cycles there are consistent reports that flavonols meter measurements are sensitive indicators of crop n status this has been observed in broccoli tremblay et al 2009 potato ben abdallah et al 2018 muskmelon padilla et al 2014 cucumber padilla et al 2016 and sweet pepper r de souza university of almeria unpublished data in a review tremblay et al 2012 highlighted that flavonols meter measurements and the nitrogen balance index nbi cartelat et al 2005 were the two most suitable indicators for the assessment of crop n status when using flavonols meters nbi is the ratio between chlorophyll and flavonols contents there are no reports on the use of flavonols meter measurements as tools to guide n fertilizer management in crops additionally the high cost of fluorescence based flavonols meters 3 000 14 000 in europe depending on the model makes unattractive to commercial farmers until practices are established to aid n fertilizer management and the purchase price is reduced it is very unlikely that these meters are applicable on commercial farms 5 2 electrical impedance spectroscopy electrical impedance spectroscopy eis is a technique that measures the impedance of a material or system in response to alternating current ac applied at a certain potential the frequency dependence of the impedance can inform of underlying chemical processes can detect structural characteristics of biological tissue and can detect changes in the physiological state of biological tissue jócsák et al 2019 electrical conduction in biological tissues is related to the presence and mobility of ions in cells data of electrical properties at various frequency ranges informs of the components and structure of cells tissues consequently if a change in tissue structure composition occurs distinctive impedance spectra can be detected eis in lower frequency ranges 10 hz 1 mhz is widely applied in biomedical diagnostics food sciences and in plant sciences jócsák et al 2019 in plant sciences the main applications are for root growth estimation frost hardening capability detection fruit and vegetable quality measurement and abiotic and biotic stress detection jócsák et al 2019 the parameters of eis are also suitable for the estimation of plant nutrient status studies on tomato have shown that electrical impedance can be used to detect and diagnose plant nutrition status for phosphorous meiqing et al 2016 and potassium jinyang et al 2016 muñoz huerta et al 2014 analyzed the electrical impedance response of soilless grown lettuce to different n concentrations in nutrient solution a strong and positive correlation was observed between plant n content and frequency values suggesting that electrical impedance may be sensitive to plant n status for a comprehensive review of the application of electrical impedance measurement on plants see jócsák et al 2019 6 use of portable rapid analysis systems small portable rapid analysis systems can be used for on farm measurements of the no3 in soil solution section 2 3 and petiole sap section 4 2 parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 thereby providing the grower advisor with an almost immediate result after sample collection there are two main groups of rapid analysis systems no3 specific ion sensitive electrode systems such as the laquatwin no3 meters horiba kyoto japan and no3 sensitive test strip readers such as the rqflex reflectometer merck darmstadt germany and nitrachek reflectometer eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands parks et al 2012 provided a detailed description of these two types of on farm rapid analysis systems discussing operation calibration measurement range and interferences parks et al 2012 reported that no3 specific ion sensitive electrode systems tended to overestimate and that they were subject to interference from chloride cl interferences from cl and sulphate so4 2 were reported by di goia et al 2010 from several hundred analyses of nutrient solution soil solution and sap from different vegetable crops good agreement was obtained between no3 specific ion sensitive electrode system and laboratory analysis r b thompson university of almeria unpublished data however in this work there was a tendency for the no3 specific ion sensitive electrode to underestimate sap no3 at no3 of 6500 mg l 1 which was overcome by diluting samples parks et al 2012 reported that while accurate results had been reported with no3 sensitive test strip readers there were limited scientific assessments with plant samples however thompson et al 2009 obtained accurate results using a no3 sensitive test strip reader with sap samples and soil solution these authors reported that the limited range of the no3 sensitive test strip reader used up to 225 mg no3 l 1 rqflex reflectometer required dilution of nearly all samples and that accurate dilution was critically important generally no3 specific ion sensitive electrodes have a much larger working range of no3 than no3 sensitive test strip readers further research is required to fully characterize the performance of the currently available rapid analysis systems nevertheless the available information suggests that they can provide reasonably accurate results that are adequate for monitoring used for on farm decision making parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 however results are less accurate than laboratory analysis considerable care should be taken and instructions should be strictly followed particular care should be given to handling cleaning sample temperature and dilution which if not done correctly can introduce errors parks et al 2012 thompson et al 2009 results should be periodically checked against laboratory analysis and independent standard aqueous solutions should be regularly analyzed to confirm the accuracy in aqueous solutions di gioia et al 2010 rapid analysis systems are available for the measurement of nutrients other than no3 these systems are test strip readers ion specific electrodes for specific nutrients or multi ion electrode systems that measure the concentrations of various nutrients there are few published scientific studies available that have evaluated these systems 7 management applications of crop and soil n monitoring in vegetable crops this article has reviewed different plant and soil monitoring approaches with the capacities to assess crop and soil n status and to guide n management in vegetable crops these approaches include soil monitoring destructive tissue n analysis petiole sap no3 analysis and non destructive optical sensors electrical impedance spectroscopy crop based methods and portable rapid analysis systems for the measurement of no3 in solution these monitoring approaches have been demonstrated to be sensitive indicators of crop n status in a wide range of vegetable crops and to be useful tools to guide n fertilizer management in general the selection of the best monitoring approach for a given farm will depend on factors such as crop and farm characteristics the farmer s technical level the support provided and economic considerations in scientific terms the selection of an approach for crop n management should consider the capacity to provide information of crop n status throughout the entire crop cycle or at critical stages in practical terms an important issue to consider is the cost and ease of use the high cost of some optical sensors i e above 3 000 makes them unaffordable for small vegetable farmers and local enterprises but it is likely that there will be increasing availability of low cost sensors providing an affordable way to monitor crop n status as a basis to adjust in season n fertilization generally crop based methods are sensitive indicators of crop n status in diverse vegetable crops they are particularly useful to detect n deficiency however they and particularly optical sensors have reduced sensitivity to detect excessive n supply a notable feature of soil monitoring methods e g the dutch 1 2 soil water extract method soil solution monitoring is that they can detect excess n supply the combination of crop and soil monitoring methods will provide vegetable growers with tools to detect crop n deficiency and excess n supply soil and crop monitoring approaches could form part of improved management packages that include the use of dsss to determine crop n requirements see article by gallardo et al 2020 in this special issue in such a prescriptive corrective management package soil and crop monitoring measurements would be the bases of corrective adjustments of the prescriptive n fertilizer plan prepared with the dss the use of such a package particularly when combined with fertigation and drip irrigation will considerably improve n management of vegetable crops resulting in much smaller n losses to the environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10483,considering the importance of virtual water in water management the amount of virtual water was determined in the shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan irrigation and drainage networks first the water requirements of the crops were calculated using meteorological data of 10 years by cropwat software then the virtual water of the networks was determined using crop yield also the networks according to the virtual water were evaluated by questionnaire and analytical hierarchy process ahp the results showed that the virtual water of wheat in the shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan irrigation and drainage networks were 7183 33 7148 88 and 7501 11 m3 year respectively the amount of virtual water of barley in the mentioned networks was obtained at 8033 33 8252 78 and 8705 56 m3 year respectively and for sesame in shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network was 9836 28 m3 year and in ramshir the number was 10 252 31 m3 year comparison between the amounts of calculating data and the delivered water indicated that in shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan irrigation and drainage networks a more water usage percentage against the actual need of 31 23 and 28 was used the results of ahp and the ranking of mentioned networks using super decisions software with the virtual water approach showed that field factors in shahid rajae and hendijan networks and climate factors had the most significant weight in ramshir network the economic factors were the least influential among them comparing the results of ahp and the computation of virtual water revealed that the hendijan network ranked first place qualitative assessment of the operation of network utilization based on virtual water and water productivity warned that the mentioned networks were in undesirable conditions keywords blue water green water virtual water water productivity 1 introduction water scarcity in many parts of the planet has caused numerous problems for safe drinking water agricultural production and the overall process of general human life and by the year 2025 it is expected that 50 60 percent of the world s population will face water shortage cosgrave and rijiberman 2000 iran which is a semi arid country is no exception to this disaster recently the water shortage has been observed in various forms in iran falkenmark 1999 specifies that water stress depends on different factors such as technical and demographic scarcity and the density of the population in 1988 the amount of renewable freshwater supply for each person annually was 2254 m3 and because of high population growth and the drought condition in iran this number fell to 1950 m³ in 1994 this number was estimated by ghazi 2002 to be 1300 m3 in 2020 meanwhile plans have been made to increase the population of this country to more than 100 million people providing the amount of water for 100 million people requires 130 billion cubic meters of water annually unfortunately and obviously this quantity is not available in the country ghazi 2002 the increasing water crisis involving problems such as the lack of water due to the high use of renewable and non renewable water resources successive droughts and various other water problems make water resource management a vital issue in this regard the issue of virtual water is one of the most important options in water resources management with the advent of the idea of virtual water in recent years it has become clear that a large volume of water is transmitted virtually between different countries of the world in fact according to the current demand the available water resources will not be enough to make ends meet soon therefore it is very crucial to pay attention to the new methods of management of water supply one of the most common ways in the world is trading the products of virtual water razavi and davary 2014 the average volume of virtual water trade in the world is estimated at more than 1600 billion cubic meters per year through the trade of products and services barghi et al 2008 renault 2002 believed that global virtual water storage will increase the change in water production also the actual preservation of virtual water is dependent on the increase in food saving fracasso et al 2015 investigated the important factors of import and export and examined which of the two depends on virtual water and how the cycle works it has also been found that by raising the prices of irrigation water exports and imports of virtual water respectively fall and rise zhang et al 2016 believed that virtual water trade is a useful tool for dealing with water scarcity by a comprehensive study on the virtual water supply of agricultural products from 2001 to 2013 they concluded that china was in the context of virtual trade and agricultural products were being exported in the form of a trade surplus also known as positive commercial water trade the value of virtual water for agricultural products was 29 49 billion cubic meters per year while the water contained in the export products was 155 55 cubic meters per year moreover duarte et al 2016 reported that the globalization trend in the past 50 years required growth in the trade of agricultural products and foods results showed that the destination and origin of virtual water have changed but all the same north america is still ranked in the first place in virtual water exports and europe and asia are still dependent on the virtual water import network liu et al 2015 believed that the implementation of virtual and small scale virtual water trade policies could potentially be reducing water scarcity and improving the region s water management in iran mousavi et al 2010 considered virtual water as a new approach for coping with the brewing water crisis they concluded that food imports in iran were still not based on the virtual water trade but by using new patterns changing the policies of imports and exports with emphasizing on food security benefits could be obtained these benefits could be spent on other parts of the country more specifically facing droughts at the time of a water crisis baghestani et al 2010 provided a method to quantify and evaluate the water supply in the import and export of agricultural products during the years 1996 2006 in iran the results showed that during the years under review the trade balance of virtual water has become negative and therefore iran became a virtual importer regarding the relationship between virtual output volume and water productivity of irrigation systems it seems that the virtual water index of irrigation networks can be considered as an appropriate tool to assess the operational performance and water productivity of these systems firouzi and najdi 2011 knew high water consumption in agriculture and low irrigation efficiency required further attention to irrigation and drainage management for product increase they considered these factors as important factors in decision making implementation and advancement of projects virtual water management in irrigation and drainage networks they believed that with the mentioned factors they could ultimately improve the surface and groundwater management in other words by determining the virtual water of irrigation networks it is possible to evaluate the processes of distribution management water regulation and network operation it is also possible to determine and evaluate the factors affecting it and identify ways to improve the productivity of each network also with different virtual irrigation water dispersion a comparison of the performance of different networks could be used to estimate the discharge water of irrigation networks furthermore montazar and zadbagher 2010 selected 14 irrigation and drainage networks to determine water productivity in this research the minimum and maximum of water productivity were respectively obtained at 0 24 and 0 81 kg m3 also while assessing 14 irrigation networks using the hierarchical process and ranking them based on their sensitivity analysis it was concluded that the criteria for the cultivation area and the water requirement of the products had the most impact and the quality criteria and the price of water had the least effect on virtual water omidi et al 2014 by assessing virtual water in the irrigation and drainage network of takestan indicated that the increase in green virtual water in products was associated with increased productivity on the other hand given the low level of virtual water in high calorie products such as wheat barley and potatoes it is possible to determine a cultivation plan based on the production energy of the products when necessary evaluating the irrigation and drainage networks in the time of the utilization and operation because of the development and extension of these networks in khuzestan province is inevitable the amount of virtual water is a function of designing construction and the method of using irrigation and drainage networks because of this and the importance of virtual water in water resources management the current research was carried out to estimate the amount of virtual water in the irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan in this study while estimating the virtual water amount of the dominant products of these networks the networks were evaluated using a hierarchical analysis method with a virtual water approach to analyze and determine the parameters affecting virtual water to upgrade the networks 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area this research was carried out in three irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan these networks are managed by zohreh and jarahi utilization company of the dam power plant and irrigation and drainage networks this company works under khuzestan water and power authority and power ministry in iran the general characteristics of the studied networks are presented in table 1 shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network is located 160 km south east of ahvaz in omidieh plains the main water supply source of the shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network is the zohreh river which is carried out by the diversion dam and through the gravity of dewatering the network is carried out the area covered by this network is 8800 ha and the number of beneficiaries of this network is 522 people irrigation and drainage network of hendijan is in the south east of ahvaz and the downstream of asac dam with an area of about 50000 ha is considered as one of the most important projects in the catchment area of zohreh river in this network six developmental areas on the right bank of the river called r1 to r6 with an area of 33 000 ha and three areas on the left side of the riverbank l1 to l3 covering an area of 17 000 ha have been implemented the goal of network implementation is to eliminate water and land constraints increase agricultural productivity and prevent the migration of the villagers living in the area by providing more of the essentials for them in this research the r1 network which covers 6500 ha of the hendijan network was studied the ramshir irrigation network is located near ramshir city and 100 km south east of ahvaz the resource of water supply for this network is the jarahi river the transfer capacity of the main channel is 9 m3 s and the network coverage is 22000 ha the irrigation and drainage networks shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan mostly cultivate wheat barley and a small percentage of sesame are also planted fig 1 shows the map of the study areas in this study area there are three synoptic stations called omidieh hendijan and ramhormoz in the current research the data of mentioned stations were used for shahid rajae hendijan and ramshir networks respectively there are also three rainfall meter stations in each one of the networks the average data of these stations in the 11 years of 2005 2015 ha s been presented in table 2 according to table 2 the study area was located in the arid and semi arid areas in iran besides that the physical properties of the soil of the study areas consist of electrical conductivity ec the acidity ph bulk density ρb soil moisture at field capacity θ fc and soil moisture at wilting point θ pwp are presented in table 3 2 2 virtual water the term virtual water was first defined in 1998 by allen the first definition of virtual water was the amount of water used to produce a given amount of product which is defined at various stages of the production chain from the beginning to the end this includes goods agricultural products and services hoekstra 2003 while completing the definition of virtual water stated that virtual water is the total amount of water needed to produce a certain amount of products or goods due to climatic conditions location production time and efficiency in the process of producing a product various sources of water such as groundwater surface water springs rainwater wastewater etc may be used which in different cases the type of water supply play a significant role in the virtual water analysis this idea has led to the introduction and classification of virtual waters into three colors blue green and gray the water that is stored as moisture in the soil is called green water falkenmark 1995 introduced green water but it has not been under the concern of experts for many years green water is one of the most important sources of water supply for plants especially in rain fed lands the amount of green water that the plant consumes for growth and development and stores in the plant tissue or during transpiration is known as virtual green water water in the rivers behind the dams lakes surface waters and groundwater aquifers is called blue water thus blue virtual water is the volume of surface water or underground water consumed directly or indirectly through the production process of goods or services the water that has been infected in the production cycle of a product or commodity is called gray water in other words sewage and wastewater are nominated as gray waters the amount of gray water used in the agricultural sector to be consumed by the plant or in the industrial sector as wastewater is called gray virtual water in this study the synoptic data of the area with an 11 year interval of 2005 2015 was used firstly with the classification and insertion in the cropwat software the water requirement of the dominant cultivation area was calculated the khuzestan province is located in the arid and semi arid parts of iran therefore for calculation of the water requirement of the crops cropwat was used based on najafi 2007 the accuracy of cropwat for estimating the amount of evapotranspiration in the arid and semi arid regions of iran when compared with lysimeter data presented acceptable results therefore in this research the mentioned software was used then through the formulas presented below virtual network water was calculated and finally the networks were compared with each other the virtual water of a plant was obtained from the total water needed by the plant to produce products to the total yield which is usually measured and calculated in terms of cubic meters per ton and its relation is as follows ehsani and khaledi 2009 1 vw c crop cw u crop t p where vwc is the virtual water and tp is the yield per year tons per year cwu the water used in the plant is the total amount of water used to grow a plant in a given period and to calculate it we can use the following equation 2 cw u crop cw r crop y total ton year y ton ha where cwr is the net plant water requirement calculated using the cropwat software and ytotal and y are respectively the total yield per year and the amount of yield per unit area performance which is the information from the zohreh and jarahi utilization company was exploited on the other hand cwu is the gross water requirement of the plant which can be obtained from the following formula 3 cw u crop cw r crop 0 6 where 0 6 is the efficiency of the surface irrigation system in these areas which was measured and calculated by zohreh and jarahi utilization company of the dam power plant and irrigation and drainage networks anonymous 2015a b 2 3 hierarchy analysis process and super decision software the hierarchy analysis process was introduced by saaty 1980 to use the mentioned analysis the determination of the main criteria subcriteria and options are needed one of the prominent features of this method is that it only compares two criteria at a time the hierarchy process analysis is one of the most comprehensive systems designed for decision making with multiple criteria because this technique provides the possibility of formulating the problem hierarchically it is also possible to consider different quantitative and qualitative criteria in the problem this process involves various options in decision making the possibility of analyzing sensitivity to criteria and sub criteria and also the degree of the compatibility and incompatibility of the decision this is one of the many advantages of this analysis in multi criteria decision making another advantage of the hierarchical analysis process is that the process is designed to be aligned and adapted to the human mind and nature so this technique is two things one dependent on personal impressions and experiences to formulate a problem and two relatable to the logic understandings and experiences of humans in making the final decision and judgment parhizkar and ghafari gilandeh 2006 ghodsipour 2010 a literature review on the applications of ahp for natural resources management in five years starting in 2009 and ending in 2013 showed 130 reviewed articles classified into four different categories 1 environmental management 2 soil resources 3 water resources and 4 forest resources though all four sections are equally important the largest amount of articles was found in water resources table 4 the first step is to create a hierarchy of the problem in mind the second step is to give a nominal value to each level of the hierarchy and create a matrix of pair wise comparison judgment at the beginning of using the hierarchical analysis method it is essential to have the questionnaire prepared the opinions of experts were used to prepare them to prepare the questionnaire the target criterion sub criteria and options were determined in different sessions sessions in which managers and experts with different professions in water soil structures meteorology and socio economic sciences participated in the summary of the sessions was the goal criteria sub criteria and options they are presented in the below figure fig 2 to evaluate the reliability of the questionnaires cronbach s alpha was used it was calculated and compared with the standard the table of cronbach s alpha internal consistency is in table 5 as mentioned above the second step of ahp is giving a nominal value to every single level of the hierarchy and to create a matrix of pair wise comparison judgment the pair wise comparison method that was applied engaged a 9 point scale for the assignment of priority values 1 3 5 7 and 9 correspond respectively to equally moderately strongly very strongly and extremely important criterion whilst 2 4 6 and 8 are intermediate values the assignment of preference values is based on experts consultation reviewing technical documents and published international guidelines 50 questionnaires were completed in each network and a total of 150 questionnaires were evaluated and prepared to perform the evaluation in a hierarchical method super decisions software and information gathered from questionnaires were used in this software the data analysis procedure involves the following steps first the pair wise comparison matrix which is called matrix a is extracted from the data that is collected from interviews the principal right eigenvector of the matrix a is computed as w if aik a kj a ij is not confirmed for all k j and i the eigenvector method is selected jalaliyoon et al 2012 if the matrix is incompatible and in case of incomplete consistency the pair comparisons matrix cannot be used in the normalizing column to get wi for a positive and reversed matrix the eigenvector technique can be used to reach a convergence among the set of answers into the successive repetition of this process the calculation should be repeated several times to make a decision when facing an incompatible matrix then the following formula is applied to transform the raw data into meaningful absolute values and normalized weight w w1 w2 w3 wn 4 aw λ max w λ max n λ max a j w j n w 1 a a i j w i t h a i j 1 a i j a pairwise comparison w normalized weight vector λmax maximum eigenvalue of matrix a aij numerical comparison between the values i and j to control the computations and evaluations decision consistency is always necessary for each matrix the quotient of the consistency index for a stochastic matrix of the same vector was taken as the criterion to judge the decision inconsistency which is in itself is the definition of the consistency ratio in cases where the ratio is less than 0 1 the system has an acceptable consistency saaty 1980 otherwise judgments must be repeated and a new comparison matrix has to be obtained in the present study the evaluation of the decision consistency was performed for each of the matrices developed based on saaty 1980 each matrix consistency was checked through the calculation of the consistency ratio cr which is defined as the quotient between the consistency index ci and the random index ri as per eq 5 5 c r c i r i the consistency index ci is determined using the following equation 6 c i λ max n n 1 where n is the dimension of the matrix n and λmax is the maximum value of the eigenvector the random index ri obtained from table 6 was established by the oak ridge national laboratory saaty 1980 the underlying concept of using ri is that cr is a normalized value since it is divided by an arithmetic mean of the random matrix consistency indices alonso and lamata 2006 ci was applied for the corresponding values obtained from sample matrices based on purely random judgments as annotated in table 6 in which the upper row is the order of the random matrix and the lower one is the corresponding index of consistency for random judgments coyle 2004 a consistency ratio of less than 0 1 is considered acceptable and higher than 0 1 is unacceptable therefore if such a number is calculated the generated weights have to be revised until the cr is under 0 1 all mention steps were done by super decision software which consists of 6 menus files designs assesses compares computations networks and various types of help from the design menu the hierarchical tree pattern was designed assesses compares is also one of the most important parts of super decision software all weighting processes pair comparisons pair comparison incompatibility rates and questionnaire responsiveness are included in this section the computation menu provides all outputs and analyses on the model operations such as analyzing different types of super matrixes ranking results of alternatives sensitivity analysis optimization and so on are obtained through this menu software output can be saved in excel software to draw charts generally fig 3 summarizes the process of the present study 3 results and discussion after analyzing the meteorological data and entering it into the cropwat software and placing the results in formulas 1 and 3 the amount of green water was calculated and the results were compared with the water content of the networks more specifically the water delivery to the farmer by the utilizing company the results are presented in table 7 the results showed that the amount of green water calculated for wheat in the irrigation and drainage network of hendijan was the highest followed by shahid rajae and ramshir networks in all three networks the amount of water supplied to the farmer anonymous 2015a b which is considered as blue water was greater than the water required by the plant in the irrigation and drainage network of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan respectively 31 23 and 28 percent were delivered more than the water requirement barley in the hendijan irrigation and drainage network had the highest amount of green water but the lowest amount of blue water following the hendijan network in terms of green water the ramshir and shahid rajae networks were ranked blue water was located in shahid rajae and ramshir networks in the shahid rajae and hendijan networks the amount of green water was lower than the blue water and in the ramshir network an inverse amount was seen sesame was cultivated only in two networks of ramshir and shahid rajae in which the amount of green water in ramshir network was more than the amount in shahid rajae network while in both networks the amount of blue water was much more than the total amount of the green one this can be related to the allocation of water which is more than the water requirement of the plant it can be concluded that according to the calculations the ranking of networks is hendijan ramshir and shahid rajae networks after calculating the amount of virtual water the indicator that was evaluated based on expert opinions and beneficiaries as mentioned before first the reliability of questionnaires was calculated the results have been represented in table 8 as seen in the above table the amount of cronbach s alpha for all criteria were between 0 8 0 9 this shows the amount of reliability was acceptable after evaluating the reliability of questionnaires the results of the completed questionnaires were entered into the super decisions software and the weight of various factors was determined these results are presented in fig 4 and table 9 11 fig 4 shows the weight of the criteria of the shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan irrigation and drainage networks based on the graphs obtained in the shahid rajae network the factors of land and economy respectively with 18 and 9 percent have the highest and lowest weights also in the ramshir network climatic factors with 18 and economic factors with a weight of 9 have the highest and lowest weights the results of the hendijan network were similar to those of the shahid rajae network the only difference was in the weight percentage the highest was 18 percent and the lowest 9 percent referring to the site visits and the statements of the questionnaire completers the low weight of the economic factors in all of the three networks is related to one fact that the price of water is not realistic due to the buyers the price of the yield is low the amount of guaranteed purchase of wheat by the government is also low on the other hand the climate of ramshir has a great impact on the amount of yielding in the plant high temperatures and high humidity are factors that can and will affects the virtual water of the network the two irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae and hendijan are located near omidieh city where similar climatic conditions are expected but the factors of land use in irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae and hendijan are heavier compared to the ramshir network this is probably related to the land plots and the more appropriate ownership system of these two networks relative to the ramshir network especially since the irrigation and drainage network of hendijan is a newly established company that has not faced many issues after reviewing the criteria the results of the weight percentages of the sub criteria are considered table 9 presents the weight of sub criteria in the shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network the study of the sub criteria in table 9 on the irrigation and drainage network of shahid rajae shows that the use of drain water type of irrigation system product value water price product price per unit of water delivery product value per until of water consumption processing conditions after production famers participation in the design and the degree of the responsibility that the farmers feel has a weight that equals to 0 56 meanwhile the maximum temperature with a weight of 4 51 is the most effective for the sub criteria in the shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network not unlike many existing networks there are no arrangements to reuse the drained water and as a result irrigated agricultural land is more often than not irrigated with the lowest efficiency on the one hand it is because of the low value of the product low price of water and low yield per hectare as a result of the cost and value of the product in the delivery unit also weighed less than what it was truly worth on the other hand the lack of food industries factories and related companies in these areas has led to a low weight in the processing of post production products in all three of the irrigation and drainage network the comments of the farmers were not included in their designs also experts believe that the degree of responsibility felt by the beneficiary is at the lowest possible amount it was found that the maximum temperature had the highest percentage of weight among the sub criteria due to the climatic characteristics of the region which sometimes reaches more than 50 degrees celsius the maximum temperature canand will affect the yield and virtual water in general the hierarchical analysis of shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network in the drainage scale showed that the depth and distance of drainage and the use of drain water in this section with a weight of 2 82 and 0 56 percent had respectively maximum and minimum effect on network virtual water in irrigation criteria the distribution of water in the network with 3 95 weight and irrigation system with 0 56 wt percent had a maximum and minimum effect the sensitivity analysis of the structural criterion showed the status of the canal cover and its sedimentation status with a weight that equals to 3 95 and 1 69 as sensitive and non susceptible sub criteria in the climatic parameters the maximum temperature with a weight of 4 51 was assigned to the maximum weight in the economic criterion the state of the insurance of the products had a weight of 3 39 and the value of the product the price of water the price of the product delivered water unit the value of the product in the water consumption unit and the state of the processing of the postproduction had a weight equal to 0 56 these factors had the most to least impact on the ranking of the options the area under cultivation and land consolidation status 3 39 and equipment and modernization status 1 41 have been allocated as the sub criteria of land factors as the most and the least weights the two sub categories of farmers associations and participation in the designing of the socio cultural criteria are 3 95 and 0 56 respectively table 10 shows the weight of sub criteria in the ramshir irrigation and drainage network the study of that sub criteria table 10 in ramshir irrigation and drainage network showed that not unlike the shahid rajae network the use of drain water type of irrigation system product value water price product price per unit of water delivery product value per unit of water consumption status the processing of products after production and farmers participation in the design and the degree of responsibility of farmers with a weight equal to 0 60 have the lowest weight meanwhile the maximum temperature with a weight of 4 21 has taken the spot of the most effective factor the mentioned issues regarding the results of the shahid rajae network sub criteria were also true for the ramshir network also the drainage criterion in ramshir irrigation and drainage network showed that the status of drainage and the use of drain water in this section with a weight of 2 83 and 0 65 percent had the highest and the lowest effect on the amount of virtual water in the network in the irrigation criteria the pattern of cropping the network with a 3 01 percent of the weight and the type of irrigation system with 0 65 wt percent had maximum and minimum effects the sensitivity analysis of the structural criterion the type and status of the structures and the sedimentation status and the state of growth of the weeds in the canal with weight equal to 3 31 and 1 80 as sensitive and non susceptible sub criteria in climatic factors maximum temperature and evapotranspiration with a maximum weight equal to 4 21 percent were assigned in the state of the insurance of economic products with a weight of 3 61 the value of the product the cost of water the price of the product in the delivered water unit the value of the product in the water consumption unit and the state of processing of the products after the production with a weight of 0 6 had the most and least impact on the ranking of options the area under cultivation 2 71 and equipment and renovation 1 92 respectively have been allocated as the sub criteria of territorial factors for the most and the lowest weights two of the sub criteria of the degree of trust in expert advice and the degree of responsibility of farmers in designing the socio cultural factors are 3 31 and 0 66 percent respectively table 11 presents the weight of sub criteria in the hendijan irrigation and drainage network table 11 shows that in irrigation and drainage network of hendijan the use of drain water type of irrigation system the status of plant growth in the canal product value water price product price per unit of water delivery product value per unit of water consumption the processing status of products after production farmers participation in the design and degree of responsibility felt by farmers with a weight of 0 52 is the lowest meanwhile the maximum temperature and the degree of trust to expert advice with a weight of 4 17 percent have had the most impact because it is new the hendijan network has new channels and is in an appropriate condition in this context hendijan irrigation and drainage network management emphasized the maintenance of the canals of this network which led to the growth of the grassland weeds in canals can be reached to the minimum in this network the operators have high confidence in the opinions of experts and according to themselves experts and manufacturers are practicing their proposals the hierarchical analysis of the hendijan irrigation and drainage network in drainage criterion revealed that the depth and distance of drainage system and the use of drain water in this section with a weight of 2 82 and 0 52 percent were the highest and lowest effect is the virtual water volume of the network in irrigation criteria the distribution of water in the network with 3 65 weight and irrigation system type with 0 52 weight show maximum and minimum effect the sensitivity analysis of the structural criterion the status of the canal cover and the condition of weeds growing in the canals with weight was 3 65 and 0 52 percent as sensitive and non sensitive sub criteria in the climatic factors the maximum temperature with a weight of 4 17 percent of the maximum weight was allocated the state of the insurance of economic products with a weight of 3 13 and the value of the product the price of water the price of the product in the delivered water unit the value of the product in the water consumption unit and the state of the processing of post production products with a weight of 0 52 had the most and least impact on the ranking of options the status of land consolidation 3 65 and the area under cultivation 3 39 as the sub criteria of land factors had the most and least weights two sub criteria of trust in expert counseling and farmers participation in designing in the field of socio cultural factors are respectively weighted at 4 17 and 0 52 irrigation and drainage network of hendijan like the other two networks has a suitable drainage system but there are no methods or systems for reusing the drain water on the other hand according to network management experts and utility statement the distribution of water in the network has always been announced according to the plan and needs of farmers during the year but due to the use of surface irrigation system for farms and low efficiency of this system under the criterion of the type of irrigation system has had the least effect on the water productivity of the network because it is new the network has new channels with the appropriate coverage according to observations made on the hendijan network the growth of plants and weeds in the canal was very small and negligible and this network was remarkably superior to the other two networks the maximum temperature of the aforementioned network has greatly affected the evapotranspiration of the plants and the yield and it caused this network to have the yield lower than the averages of the country and even the province the irrigation and drainage network of hendijan with proper division of land and suitable layout has suitable conditions for this view experts and users of the hendijan irrigation and drainage network have a great deal of interaction and the users of this network have a great deal of trust in the experts although in this network other networks are considered by the users in designing and construction has not been applied in general quotes about criteria the maximum and minimum weights can be seen below the drainage distance in the area was determined and implemented about 50 m and has good performances according to experts in the area and can be the strong point for the drainage criterion on the other hand the proper distribution of water in this network under the appropriate distribution method has been of great importance by carefully planning the water providers in the studied grids the coverage of irrigation networks of shahid rajae is proper concrete but in climatic factors due to the high temperature of the region in some cases more than 50 c and its impact on the production of the has the most effect on virtual water the strength of the economic factors was the insurance of products which according to the users and experts of the region had a significant effect on the yield in the region especially in wheat production this network has 800 ha of agricultural land and the integration and segmentation of the land with an average of 10 ha has been able to contribute to the well balanced farming in the region of course there were areas of criticism but the policy was more employment based the shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network has a more coherent association of water users than two other networks no arrangements have been planned for reuse of drain water in this network and the flood irrigation system has caused these two sub criteria to have the least weight on drainage and irrigation measures the sedimentation in the canals was low and the canals were in good condition and as a result sedimentation had little effect on virtual water but it was not suitable for equipping and modernizing according to the utilities it is possible in the future not so far the network will face a lot of problems in none of the networks no farmers were participating in the design of the network and therefore the effect on the virtual water of the region was the least in economic cases because prices for water and products are very unrealistic they have the least impact on water use and yield and ultimately on virtual water because the management and utilization of the networks are done by a company then the arguments about the more or less the effect of each sub standard are the same after reviewing the criteria and sub criteria of each network the final weights of the network were determined using the software fig 5 shows the final result of the rating of the studied networks according to fig 5 the hendijan network with a weight of 36 is ranked first and then the networks of shahid rajae and ramshir located with weighting equal to 33 and 31 respectively after weighing the criteria sub criteria and options the studied networks were compared in terms of virtual water in two methods hierarchical and computational methods the results are presented in table 12 table 12 shows the ranking of networks in this table the grid ranking is presented in three ideal normal and raw modes the raw values of the boundary matrix are the normal values of the normalization of the initial values and the ideal values of the division of the initial values with the largest value of them i e the division of each of the values over the sum the ratio of the raw amount to a larger value gives the ideal ratio according to the above figures the hendijan network is ranked first and shahid rajae and ramshir networks are ranked second and third place however the results from the calculation of virtual water are slightly different from the results of the analytical hierarchy moreover in the hierarchical analysis method the incompatibility of the matrices of the paired comparison of all criteria was less than 0 1 indicating that the decisions are consistent in the process of analytic hierarchy the results of hierarchical analysis and virtual water calculations are almost identical the difference between these two approaches is related to the difference in the attitude of these two methods the approach of the computational method is influenced by climatic vegetative and irrigation system efficiencies and climate conditions have the most impact on virtual water if there is more rainfall in the region the effective rain will become more thus the water productivity will be increased but in a hierarchical analysis method attitude is based on management which does not compute the virtual water method but it analyzes the factors affecting virtual water and productivity in this situation the hendijan network obtained a first place among other networks it means that the hendijan network considering the conditions and criteria mentioned has the least sensitivity to the negative and most sensitive sensitivity to the positive factors thus the more efficient use of the two networks other has shown finally the studied networks were evaluated for the water productivity index using the calculated virtual water volume if the water productivity is less than 0 1 then the grid condition is very unfavorable if 0 1 wp 0 15 network is undesirable the grid is semidesirable if 0 15 wp 0 2 and eventually if the water productivity is greater than or equal to 0 2 the network is desirable the results of this section are presented in table 13 the results revealed that the networks under study were done in unfavorable conditions based on water productivity based on the site visits made to complete the questionnaires of the present plan and the statements of farmers and experts the unfavorable conditions could be as follows the reuse of the drain water of the aforementioned networks the low quality and the salinity of irrigation water the absence of the system mechanization heavy texture and soil salinity low efficiency of surface irrigation systems high sedimentation in canals of the shahid rajae and ramshir irrigation and drainage networks growth of plants and weeds in these canals evapotranspiration and very high humidity due to the high temperature of the region especially the high temperature the very low price of water and production the absence of industrial companies appropriate foods in the area for product processing low ownership of agricultural land and traditional agricultural management some social issues and the existence of violations in the networks a comparison of this research with the one performed by montazar and zadbagher 2010 showed that in the study factors such as cultural issues water content channel coverage type of valves and structures with the same weights have the highest weight the second category was the distribution of water and in the third order were factors such as the year the cultivar the climate the price of water and water requirement the difference in the results is related to the weights of the regional factors also in the montazar and zadbagher 2010 research the qualitative assessment of water utilization in three networks located in khuzestan province dez gotvand and maroun was shown to be desirable semi desirable and undesirable furthermore in the three wheat barley and sesame crops the amount of blue and green water of sesame were less than the other two products which according to recommendation omidi et al 2014 due to the low level of virtual water this product can be considered in cases of lack of water in the plans 4 conclusion in the present research to investigate the status of irrigation and drainage networks in khuzestan province in terms of virtual water three networks of irrigation and drainage of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan were studied using two methods of computational analysis and hierarchical analysis the results showed that the amount of green water of wheat calculated in the irrigation and drainage network of hendijan was the highest followed by ramshir and shahid rajae networks in all three networks the amount of water delivered to the farm which is considered as blue water is more than the water required by the plant in the irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan 31 23 and 28 percent more water than the required amount was delivered to the farm in the network of the shahid rajae the economic and territorial factors have been assigned the largest and the lowest weights the ramshir network sensitivity analysis showed that climatic factors with the highest weight and economic factors had the least weight similarly the hendijan network is similar to the shahid rajae network with the difference that the weight percentages were different in a general review it can be concluded that based on the calculations and hierarchical analyses ranking of networks is in line with the hendijan shahid rajae and ramshir networks in the hierarchical analysis method the incompatibility of the matrices of the paired comparisons of all criteria was less than 0 1 which indicates that decision makers are compatible in the ahp process there are several limitations to the present study it is suggested that for future investigations virtual water for agricultural products be calculated in addition to the water required for growing plants evaporated water during irrigation evaporated water during the transfer of water to the farm water penetrated the land after irrigation and out of reach water flowing on the ground and gathered at the bottom of the land after irrigation water consumed by weeds water leakage from canals and irrigation pipes water required for the production of fertilizers water required for the production of pesticides water needed for the labor force and machinery should be considered furthermore according to the weights obtained for the sub criteria to achieve the proper utilization of water and reach the logical level of virtual water attention should be paid to the type of irrigation system use of drain water as a portion of irrigation water real water prices and farmers participation acknowledgment we are grateful

10483,considering the importance of virtual water in water management the amount of virtual water was determined in the shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan irrigation and drainage networks first the water requirements of the crops were calculated using meteorological data of 10 years by cropwat software then the virtual water of the networks was determined using crop yield also the networks according to the virtual water were evaluated by questionnaire and analytical hierarchy process ahp the results showed that the virtual water of wheat in the shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan irrigation and drainage networks were 7183 33 7148 88 and 7501 11 m3 year respectively the amount of virtual water of barley in the mentioned networks was obtained at 8033 33 8252 78 and 8705 56 m3 year respectively and for sesame in shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network was 9836 28 m3 year and in ramshir the number was 10 252 31 m3 year comparison between the amounts of calculating data and the delivered water indicated that in shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan irrigation and drainage networks a more water usage percentage against the actual need of 31 23 and 28 was used the results of ahp and the ranking of mentioned networks using super decisions software with the virtual water approach showed that field factors in shahid rajae and hendijan networks and climate factors had the most significant weight in ramshir network the economic factors were the least influential among them comparing the results of ahp and the computation of virtual water revealed that the hendijan network ranked first place qualitative assessment of the operation of network utilization based on virtual water and water productivity warned that the mentioned networks were in undesirable conditions keywords blue water green water virtual water water productivity 1 introduction water scarcity in many parts of the planet has caused numerous problems for safe drinking water agricultural production and the overall process of general human life and by the year 2025 it is expected that 50 60 percent of the world s population will face water shortage cosgrave and rijiberman 2000 iran which is a semi arid country is no exception to this disaster recently the water shortage has been observed in various forms in iran falkenmark 1999 specifies that water stress depends on different factors such as technical and demographic scarcity and the density of the population in 1988 the amount of renewable freshwater supply for each person annually was 2254 m3 and because of high population growth and the drought condition in iran this number fell to 1950 m³ in 1994 this number was estimated by ghazi 2002 to be 1300 m3 in 2020 meanwhile plans have been made to increase the population of this country to more than 100 million people providing the amount of water for 100 million people requires 130 billion cubic meters of water annually unfortunately and obviously this quantity is not available in the country ghazi 2002 the increasing water crisis involving problems such as the lack of water due to the high use of renewable and non renewable water resources successive droughts and various other water problems make water resource management a vital issue in this regard the issue of virtual water is one of the most important options in water resources management with the advent of the idea of virtual water in recent years it has become clear that a large volume of water is transmitted virtually between different countries of the world in fact according to the current demand the available water resources will not be enough to make ends meet soon therefore it is very crucial to pay attention to the new methods of management of water supply one of the most common ways in the world is trading the products of virtual water razavi and davary 2014 the average volume of virtual water trade in the world is estimated at more than 1600 billion cubic meters per year through the trade of products and services barghi et al 2008 renault 2002 believed that global virtual water storage will increase the change in water production also the actual preservation of virtual water is dependent on the increase in food saving fracasso et al 2015 investigated the important factors of import and export and examined which of the two depends on virtual water and how the cycle works it has also been found that by raising the prices of irrigation water exports and imports of virtual water respectively fall and rise zhang et al 2016 believed that virtual water trade is a useful tool for dealing with water scarcity by a comprehensive study on the virtual water supply of agricultural products from 2001 to 2013 they concluded that china was in the context of virtual trade and agricultural products were being exported in the form of a trade surplus also known as positive commercial water trade the value of virtual water for agricultural products was 29 49 billion cubic meters per year while the water contained in the export products was 155 55 cubic meters per year moreover duarte et al 2016 reported that the globalization trend in the past 50 years required growth in the trade of agricultural products and foods results showed that the destination and origin of virtual water have changed but all the same north america is still ranked in the first place in virtual water exports and europe and asia are still dependent on the virtual water import network liu et al 2015 believed that the implementation of virtual and small scale virtual water trade policies could potentially be reducing water scarcity and improving the region s water management in iran mousavi et al 2010 considered virtual water as a new approach for coping with the brewing water crisis they concluded that food imports in iran were still not based on the virtual water trade but by using new patterns changing the policies of imports and exports with emphasizing on food security benefits could be obtained these benefits could be spent on other parts of the country more specifically facing droughts at the time of a water crisis baghestani et al 2010 provided a method to quantify and evaluate the water supply in the import and export of agricultural products during the years 1996 2006 in iran the results showed that during the years under review the trade balance of virtual water has become negative and therefore iran became a virtual importer regarding the relationship between virtual output volume and water productivity of irrigation systems it seems that the virtual water index of irrigation networks can be considered as an appropriate tool to assess the operational performance and water productivity of these systems firouzi and najdi 2011 knew high water consumption in agriculture and low irrigation efficiency required further attention to irrigation and drainage management for product increase they considered these factors as important factors in decision making implementation and advancement of projects virtual water management in irrigation and drainage networks they believed that with the mentioned factors they could ultimately improve the surface and groundwater management in other words by determining the virtual water of irrigation networks it is possible to evaluate the processes of distribution management water regulation and network operation it is also possible to determine and evaluate the factors affecting it and identify ways to improve the productivity of each network also with different virtual irrigation water dispersion a comparison of the performance of different networks could be used to estimate the discharge water of irrigation networks furthermore montazar and zadbagher 2010 selected 14 irrigation and drainage networks to determine water productivity in this research the minimum and maximum of water productivity were respectively obtained at 0 24 and 0 81 kg m3 also while assessing 14 irrigation networks using the hierarchical process and ranking them based on their sensitivity analysis it was concluded that the criteria for the cultivation area and the water requirement of the products had the most impact and the quality criteria and the price of water had the least effect on virtual water omidi et al 2014 by assessing virtual water in the irrigation and drainage network of takestan indicated that the increase in green virtual water in products was associated with increased productivity on the other hand given the low level of virtual water in high calorie products such as wheat barley and potatoes it is possible to determine a cultivation plan based on the production energy of the products when necessary evaluating the irrigation and drainage networks in the time of the utilization and operation because of the development and extension of these networks in khuzestan province is inevitable the amount of virtual water is a function of designing construction and the method of using irrigation and drainage networks because of this and the importance of virtual water in water resources management the current research was carried out to estimate the amount of virtual water in the irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan in this study while estimating the virtual water amount of the dominant products of these networks the networks were evaluated using a hierarchical analysis method with a virtual water approach to analyze and determine the parameters affecting virtual water to upgrade the networks 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area this research was carried out in three irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan these networks are managed by zohreh and jarahi utilization company of the dam power plant and irrigation and drainage networks this company works under khuzestan water and power authority and power ministry in iran the general characteristics of the studied networks are presented in table 1 shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network is located 160 km south east of ahvaz in omidieh plains the main water supply source of the shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network is the zohreh river which is carried out by the diversion dam and through the gravity of dewatering the network is carried out the area covered by this network is 8800 ha and the number of beneficiaries of this network is 522 people irrigation and drainage network of hendijan is in the south east of ahvaz and the downstream of asac dam with an area of about 50000 ha is considered as one of the most important projects in the catchment area of zohreh river in this network six developmental areas on the right bank of the river called r1 to r6 with an area of 33 000 ha and three areas on the left side of the riverbank l1 to l3 covering an area of 17 000 ha have been implemented the goal of network implementation is to eliminate water and land constraints increase agricultural productivity and prevent the migration of the villagers living in the area by providing more of the essentials for them in this research the r1 network which covers 6500 ha of the hendijan network was studied the ramshir irrigation network is located near ramshir city and 100 km south east of ahvaz the resource of water supply for this network is the jarahi river the transfer capacity of the main channel is 9 m3 s and the network coverage is 22000 ha the irrigation and drainage networks shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan mostly cultivate wheat barley and a small percentage of sesame are also planted fig 1 shows the map of the study areas in this study area there are three synoptic stations called omidieh hendijan and ramhormoz in the current research the data of mentioned stations were used for shahid rajae hendijan and ramshir networks respectively there are also three rainfall meter stations in each one of the networks the average data of these stations in the 11 years of 2005 2015 ha s been presented in table 2 according to table 2 the study area was located in the arid and semi arid areas in iran besides that the physical properties of the soil of the study areas consist of electrical conductivity ec the acidity ph bulk density ρb soil moisture at field capacity θ fc and soil moisture at wilting point θ pwp are presented in table 3 2 2 virtual water the term virtual water was first defined in 1998 by allen the first definition of virtual water was the amount of water used to produce a given amount of product which is defined at various stages of the production chain from the beginning to the end this includes goods agricultural products and services hoekstra 2003 while completing the definition of virtual water stated that virtual water is the total amount of water needed to produce a certain amount of products or goods due to climatic conditions location production time and efficiency in the process of producing a product various sources of water such as groundwater surface water springs rainwater wastewater etc may be used which in different cases the type of water supply play a significant role in the virtual water analysis this idea has led to the introduction and classification of virtual waters into three colors blue green and gray the water that is stored as moisture in the soil is called green water falkenmark 1995 introduced green water but it has not been under the concern of experts for many years green water is one of the most important sources of water supply for plants especially in rain fed lands the amount of green water that the plant consumes for growth and development and stores in the plant tissue or during transpiration is known as virtual green water water in the rivers behind the dams lakes surface waters and groundwater aquifers is called blue water thus blue virtual water is the volume of surface water or underground water consumed directly or indirectly through the production process of goods or services the water that has been infected in the production cycle of a product or commodity is called gray water in other words sewage and wastewater are nominated as gray waters the amount of gray water used in the agricultural sector to be consumed by the plant or in the industrial sector as wastewater is called gray virtual water in this study the synoptic data of the area with an 11 year interval of 2005 2015 was used firstly with the classification and insertion in the cropwat software the water requirement of the dominant cultivation area was calculated the khuzestan province is located in the arid and semi arid parts of iran therefore for calculation of the water requirement of the crops cropwat was used based on najafi 2007 the accuracy of cropwat for estimating the amount of evapotranspiration in the arid and semi arid regions of iran when compared with lysimeter data presented acceptable results therefore in this research the mentioned software was used then through the formulas presented below virtual network water was calculated and finally the networks were compared with each other the virtual water of a plant was obtained from the total water needed by the plant to produce products to the total yield which is usually measured and calculated in terms of cubic meters per ton and its relation is as follows ehsani and khaledi 2009 1 vw c crop cw u crop t p where vwc is the virtual water and tp is the yield per year tons per year cwu the water used in the plant is the total amount of water used to grow a plant in a given period and to calculate it we can use the following equation 2 cw u crop cw r crop y total ton year y ton ha where cwr is the net plant water requirement calculated using the cropwat software and ytotal and y are respectively the total yield per year and the amount of yield per unit area performance which is the information from the zohreh and jarahi utilization company was exploited on the other hand cwu is the gross water requirement of the plant which can be obtained from the following formula 3 cw u crop cw r crop 0 6 where 0 6 is the efficiency of the surface irrigation system in these areas which was measured and calculated by zohreh and jarahi utilization company of the dam power plant and irrigation and drainage networks anonymous 2015a b 2 3 hierarchy analysis process and super decision software the hierarchy analysis process was introduced by saaty 1980 to use the mentioned analysis the determination of the main criteria subcriteria and options are needed one of the prominent features of this method is that it only compares two criteria at a time the hierarchy process analysis is one of the most comprehensive systems designed for decision making with multiple criteria because this technique provides the possibility of formulating the problem hierarchically it is also possible to consider different quantitative and qualitative criteria in the problem this process involves various options in decision making the possibility of analyzing sensitivity to criteria and sub criteria and also the degree of the compatibility and incompatibility of the decision this is one of the many advantages of this analysis in multi criteria decision making another advantage of the hierarchical analysis process is that the process is designed to be aligned and adapted to the human mind and nature so this technique is two things one dependent on personal impressions and experiences to formulate a problem and two relatable to the logic understandings and experiences of humans in making the final decision and judgment parhizkar and ghafari gilandeh 2006 ghodsipour 2010 a literature review on the applications of ahp for natural resources management in five years starting in 2009 and ending in 2013 showed 130 reviewed articles classified into four different categories 1 environmental management 2 soil resources 3 water resources and 4 forest resources though all four sections are equally important the largest amount of articles was found in water resources table 4 the first step is to create a hierarchy of the problem in mind the second step is to give a nominal value to each level of the hierarchy and create a matrix of pair wise comparison judgment at the beginning of using the hierarchical analysis method it is essential to have the questionnaire prepared the opinions of experts were used to prepare them to prepare the questionnaire the target criterion sub criteria and options were determined in different sessions sessions in which managers and experts with different professions in water soil structures meteorology and socio economic sciences participated in the summary of the sessions was the goal criteria sub criteria and options they are presented in the below figure fig 2 to evaluate the reliability of the questionnaires cronbach s alpha was used it was calculated and compared with the standard the table of cronbach s alpha internal consistency is in table 5 as mentioned above the second step of ahp is giving a nominal value to every single level of the hierarchy and to create a matrix of pair wise comparison judgment the pair wise comparison method that was applied engaged a 9 point scale for the assignment of priority values 1 3 5 7 and 9 correspond respectively to equally moderately strongly very strongly and extremely important criterion whilst 2 4 6 and 8 are intermediate values the assignment of preference values is based on experts consultation reviewing technical documents and published international guidelines 50 questionnaires were completed in each network and a total of 150 questionnaires were evaluated and prepared to perform the evaluation in a hierarchical method super decisions software and information gathered from questionnaires were used in this software the data analysis procedure involves the following steps first the pair wise comparison matrix which is called matrix a is extracted from the data that is collected from interviews the principal right eigenvector of the matrix a is computed as w if aik a kj a ij is not confirmed for all k j and i the eigenvector method is selected jalaliyoon et al 2012 if the matrix is incompatible and in case of incomplete consistency the pair comparisons matrix cannot be used in the normalizing column to get wi for a positive and reversed matrix the eigenvector technique can be used to reach a convergence among the set of answers into the successive repetition of this process the calculation should be repeated several times to make a decision when facing an incompatible matrix then the following formula is applied to transform the raw data into meaningful absolute values and normalized weight w w1 w2 w3 wn 4 aw λ max w λ max n λ max a j w j n w 1 a a i j w i t h a i j 1 a i j a pairwise comparison w normalized weight vector λmax maximum eigenvalue of matrix a aij numerical comparison between the values i and j to control the computations and evaluations decision consistency is always necessary for each matrix the quotient of the consistency index for a stochastic matrix of the same vector was taken as the criterion to judge the decision inconsistency which is in itself is the definition of the consistency ratio in cases where the ratio is less than 0 1 the system has an acceptable consistency saaty 1980 otherwise judgments must be repeated and a new comparison matrix has to be obtained in the present study the evaluation of the decision consistency was performed for each of the matrices developed based on saaty 1980 each matrix consistency was checked through the calculation of the consistency ratio cr which is defined as the quotient between the consistency index ci and the random index ri as per eq 5 5 c r c i r i the consistency index ci is determined using the following equation 6 c i λ max n n 1 where n is the dimension of the matrix n and λmax is the maximum value of the eigenvector the random index ri obtained from table 6 was established by the oak ridge national laboratory saaty 1980 the underlying concept of using ri is that cr is a normalized value since it is divided by an arithmetic mean of the random matrix consistency indices alonso and lamata 2006 ci was applied for the corresponding values obtained from sample matrices based on purely random judgments as annotated in table 6 in which the upper row is the order of the random matrix and the lower one is the corresponding index of consistency for random judgments coyle 2004 a consistency ratio of less than 0 1 is considered acceptable and higher than 0 1 is unacceptable therefore if such a number is calculated the generated weights have to be revised until the cr is under 0 1 all mention steps were done by super decision software which consists of 6 menus files designs assesses compares computations networks and various types of help from the design menu the hierarchical tree pattern was designed assesses compares is also one of the most important parts of super decision software all weighting processes pair comparisons pair comparison incompatibility rates and questionnaire responsiveness are included in this section the computation menu provides all outputs and analyses on the model operations such as analyzing different types of super matrixes ranking results of alternatives sensitivity analysis optimization and so on are obtained through this menu software output can be saved in excel software to draw charts generally fig 3 summarizes the process of the present study 3 results and discussion after analyzing the meteorological data and entering it into the cropwat software and placing the results in formulas 1 and 3 the amount of green water was calculated and the results were compared with the water content of the networks more specifically the water delivery to the farmer by the utilizing company the results are presented in table 7 the results showed that the amount of green water calculated for wheat in the irrigation and drainage network of hendijan was the highest followed by shahid rajae and ramshir networks in all three networks the amount of water supplied to the farmer anonymous 2015a b which is considered as blue water was greater than the water required by the plant in the irrigation and drainage network of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan respectively 31 23 and 28 percent were delivered more than the water requirement barley in the hendijan irrigation and drainage network had the highest amount of green water but the lowest amount of blue water following the hendijan network in terms of green water the ramshir and shahid rajae networks were ranked blue water was located in shahid rajae and ramshir networks in the shahid rajae and hendijan networks the amount of green water was lower than the blue water and in the ramshir network an inverse amount was seen sesame was cultivated only in two networks of ramshir and shahid rajae in which the amount of green water in ramshir network was more than the amount in shahid rajae network while in both networks the amount of blue water was much more than the total amount of the green one this can be related to the allocation of water which is more than the water requirement of the plant it can be concluded that according to the calculations the ranking of networks is hendijan ramshir and shahid rajae networks after calculating the amount of virtual water the indicator that was evaluated based on expert opinions and beneficiaries as mentioned before first the reliability of questionnaires was calculated the results have been represented in table 8 as seen in the above table the amount of cronbach s alpha for all criteria were between 0 8 0 9 this shows the amount of reliability was acceptable after evaluating the reliability of questionnaires the results of the completed questionnaires were entered into the super decisions software and the weight of various factors was determined these results are presented in fig 4 and table 9 11 fig 4 shows the weight of the criteria of the shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan irrigation and drainage networks based on the graphs obtained in the shahid rajae network the factors of land and economy respectively with 18 and 9 percent have the highest and lowest weights also in the ramshir network climatic factors with 18 and economic factors with a weight of 9 have the highest and lowest weights the results of the hendijan network were similar to those of the shahid rajae network the only difference was in the weight percentage the highest was 18 percent and the lowest 9 percent referring to the site visits and the statements of the questionnaire completers the low weight of the economic factors in all of the three networks is related to one fact that the price of water is not realistic due to the buyers the price of the yield is low the amount of guaranteed purchase of wheat by the government is also low on the other hand the climate of ramshir has a great impact on the amount of yielding in the plant high temperatures and high humidity are factors that can and will affects the virtual water of the network the two irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae and hendijan are located near omidieh city where similar climatic conditions are expected but the factors of land use in irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae and hendijan are heavier compared to the ramshir network this is probably related to the land plots and the more appropriate ownership system of these two networks relative to the ramshir network especially since the irrigation and drainage network of hendijan is a newly established company that has not faced many issues after reviewing the criteria the results of the weight percentages of the sub criteria are considered table 9 presents the weight of sub criteria in the shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network the study of the sub criteria in table 9 on the irrigation and drainage network of shahid rajae shows that the use of drain water type of irrigation system product value water price product price per unit of water delivery product value per until of water consumption processing conditions after production famers participation in the design and the degree of the responsibility that the farmers feel has a weight that equals to 0 56 meanwhile the maximum temperature with a weight of 4 51 is the most effective for the sub criteria in the shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network not unlike many existing networks there are no arrangements to reuse the drained water and as a result irrigated agricultural land is more often than not irrigated with the lowest efficiency on the one hand it is because of the low value of the product low price of water and low yield per hectare as a result of the cost and value of the product in the delivery unit also weighed less than what it was truly worth on the other hand the lack of food industries factories and related companies in these areas has led to a low weight in the processing of post production products in all three of the irrigation and drainage network the comments of the farmers were not included in their designs also experts believe that the degree of responsibility felt by the beneficiary is at the lowest possible amount it was found that the maximum temperature had the highest percentage of weight among the sub criteria due to the climatic characteristics of the region which sometimes reaches more than 50 degrees celsius the maximum temperature canand will affect the yield and virtual water in general the hierarchical analysis of shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network in the drainage scale showed that the depth and distance of drainage and the use of drain water in this section with a weight of 2 82 and 0 56 percent had respectively maximum and minimum effect on network virtual water in irrigation criteria the distribution of water in the network with 3 95 weight and irrigation system with 0 56 wt percent had a maximum and minimum effect the sensitivity analysis of the structural criterion showed the status of the canal cover and its sedimentation status with a weight that equals to 3 95 and 1 69 as sensitive and non susceptible sub criteria in the climatic parameters the maximum temperature with a weight of 4 51 was assigned to the maximum weight in the economic criterion the state of the insurance of the products had a weight of 3 39 and the value of the product the price of water the price of the product delivered water unit the value of the product in the water consumption unit and the state of the processing of the postproduction had a weight equal to 0 56 these factors had the most to least impact on the ranking of the options the area under cultivation and land consolidation status 3 39 and equipment and modernization status 1 41 have been allocated as the sub criteria of land factors as the most and the least weights the two sub categories of farmers associations and participation in the designing of the socio cultural criteria are 3 95 and 0 56 respectively table 10 shows the weight of sub criteria in the ramshir irrigation and drainage network the study of that sub criteria table 10 in ramshir irrigation and drainage network showed that not unlike the shahid rajae network the use of drain water type of irrigation system product value water price product price per unit of water delivery product value per unit of water consumption status the processing of products after production and farmers participation in the design and the degree of responsibility of farmers with a weight equal to 0 60 have the lowest weight meanwhile the maximum temperature with a weight of 4 21 has taken the spot of the most effective factor the mentioned issues regarding the results of the shahid rajae network sub criteria were also true for the ramshir network also the drainage criterion in ramshir irrigation and drainage network showed that the status of drainage and the use of drain water in this section with a weight of 2 83 and 0 65 percent had the highest and the lowest effect on the amount of virtual water in the network in the irrigation criteria the pattern of cropping the network with a 3 01 percent of the weight and the type of irrigation system with 0 65 wt percent had maximum and minimum effects the sensitivity analysis of the structural criterion the type and status of the structures and the sedimentation status and the state of growth of the weeds in the canal with weight equal to 3 31 and 1 80 as sensitive and non susceptible sub criteria in climatic factors maximum temperature and evapotranspiration with a maximum weight equal to 4 21 percent were assigned in the state of the insurance of economic products with a weight of 3 61 the value of the product the cost of water the price of the product in the delivered water unit the value of the product in the water consumption unit and the state of processing of the products after the production with a weight of 0 6 had the most and least impact on the ranking of options the area under cultivation 2 71 and equipment and renovation 1 92 respectively have been allocated as the sub criteria of territorial factors for the most and the lowest weights two of the sub criteria of the degree of trust in expert advice and the degree of responsibility of farmers in designing the socio cultural factors are 3 31 and 0 66 percent respectively table 11 presents the weight of sub criteria in the hendijan irrigation and drainage network table 11 shows that in irrigation and drainage network of hendijan the use of drain water type of irrigation system the status of plant growth in the canal product value water price product price per unit of water delivery product value per unit of water consumption the processing status of products after production farmers participation in the design and degree of responsibility felt by farmers with a weight of 0 52 is the lowest meanwhile the maximum temperature and the degree of trust to expert advice with a weight of 4 17 percent have had the most impact because it is new the hendijan network has new channels and is in an appropriate condition in this context hendijan irrigation and drainage network management emphasized the maintenance of the canals of this network which led to the growth of the grassland weeds in canals can be reached to the minimum in this network the operators have high confidence in the opinions of experts and according to themselves experts and manufacturers are practicing their proposals the hierarchical analysis of the hendijan irrigation and drainage network in drainage criterion revealed that the depth and distance of drainage system and the use of drain water in this section with a weight of 2 82 and 0 52 percent were the highest and lowest effect is the virtual water volume of the network in irrigation criteria the distribution of water in the network with 3 65 weight and irrigation system type with 0 52 weight show maximum and minimum effect the sensitivity analysis of the structural criterion the status of the canal cover and the condition of weeds growing in the canals with weight was 3 65 and 0 52 percent as sensitive and non sensitive sub criteria in the climatic factors the maximum temperature with a weight of 4 17 percent of the maximum weight was allocated the state of the insurance of economic products with a weight of 3 13 and the value of the product the price of water the price of the product in the delivered water unit the value of the product in the water consumption unit and the state of the processing of post production products with a weight of 0 52 had the most and least impact on the ranking of options the status of land consolidation 3 65 and the area under cultivation 3 39 as the sub criteria of land factors had the most and least weights two sub criteria of trust in expert counseling and farmers participation in designing in the field of socio cultural factors are respectively weighted at 4 17 and 0 52 irrigation and drainage network of hendijan like the other two networks has a suitable drainage system but there are no methods or systems for reusing the drain water on the other hand according to network management experts and utility statement the distribution of water in the network has always been announced according to the plan and needs of farmers during the year but due to the use of surface irrigation system for farms and low efficiency of this system under the criterion of the type of irrigation system has had the least effect on the water productivity of the network because it is new the network has new channels with the appropriate coverage according to observations made on the hendijan network the growth of plants and weeds in the canal was very small and negligible and this network was remarkably superior to the other two networks the maximum temperature of the aforementioned network has greatly affected the evapotranspiration of the plants and the yield and it caused this network to have the yield lower than the averages of the country and even the province the irrigation and drainage network of hendijan with proper division of land and suitable layout has suitable conditions for this view experts and users of the hendijan irrigation and drainage network have a great deal of interaction and the users of this network have a great deal of trust in the experts although in this network other networks are considered by the users in designing and construction has not been applied in general quotes about criteria the maximum and minimum weights can be seen below the drainage distance in the area was determined and implemented about 50 m and has good performances according to experts in the area and can be the strong point for the drainage criterion on the other hand the proper distribution of water in this network under the appropriate distribution method has been of great importance by carefully planning the water providers in the studied grids the coverage of irrigation networks of shahid rajae is proper concrete but in climatic factors due to the high temperature of the region in some cases more than 50 c and its impact on the production of the has the most effect on virtual water the strength of the economic factors was the insurance of products which according to the users and experts of the region had a significant effect on the yield in the region especially in wheat production this network has 800 ha of agricultural land and the integration and segmentation of the land with an average of 10 ha has been able to contribute to the well balanced farming in the region of course there were areas of criticism but the policy was more employment based the shahid rajae irrigation and drainage network has a more coherent association of water users than two other networks no arrangements have been planned for reuse of drain water in this network and the flood irrigation system has caused these two sub criteria to have the least weight on drainage and irrigation measures the sedimentation in the canals was low and the canals were in good condition and as a result sedimentation had little effect on virtual water but it was not suitable for equipping and modernizing according to the utilities it is possible in the future not so far the network will face a lot of problems in none of the networks no farmers were participating in the design of the network and therefore the effect on the virtual water of the region was the least in economic cases because prices for water and products are very unrealistic they have the least impact on water use and yield and ultimately on virtual water because the management and utilization of the networks are done by a company then the arguments about the more or less the effect of each sub standard are the same after reviewing the criteria and sub criteria of each network the final weights of the network were determined using the software fig 5 shows the final result of the rating of the studied networks according to fig 5 the hendijan network with a weight of 36 is ranked first and then the networks of shahid rajae and ramshir located with weighting equal to 33 and 31 respectively after weighing the criteria sub criteria and options the studied networks were compared in terms of virtual water in two methods hierarchical and computational methods the results are presented in table 12 table 12 shows the ranking of networks in this table the grid ranking is presented in three ideal normal and raw modes the raw values of the boundary matrix are the normal values of the normalization of the initial values and the ideal values of the division of the initial values with the largest value of them i e the division of each of the values over the sum the ratio of the raw amount to a larger value gives the ideal ratio according to the above figures the hendijan network is ranked first and shahid rajae and ramshir networks are ranked second and third place however the results from the calculation of virtual water are slightly different from the results of the analytical hierarchy moreover in the hierarchical analysis method the incompatibility of the matrices of the paired comparison of all criteria was less than 0 1 indicating that the decisions are consistent in the process of analytic hierarchy the results of hierarchical analysis and virtual water calculations are almost identical the difference between these two approaches is related to the difference in the attitude of these two methods the approach of the computational method is influenced by climatic vegetative and irrigation system efficiencies and climate conditions have the most impact on virtual water if there is more rainfall in the region the effective rain will become more thus the water productivity will be increased but in a hierarchical analysis method attitude is based on management which does not compute the virtual water method but it analyzes the factors affecting virtual water and productivity in this situation the hendijan network obtained a first place among other networks it means that the hendijan network considering the conditions and criteria mentioned has the least sensitivity to the negative and most sensitive sensitivity to the positive factors thus the more efficient use of the two networks other has shown finally the studied networks were evaluated for the water productivity index using the calculated virtual water volume if the water productivity is less than 0 1 then the grid condition is very unfavorable if 0 1 wp 0 15 network is undesirable the grid is semidesirable if 0 15 wp 0 2 and eventually if the water productivity is greater than or equal to 0 2 the network is desirable the results of this section are presented in table 13 the results revealed that the networks under study were done in unfavorable conditions based on water productivity based on the site visits made to complete the questionnaires of the present plan and the statements of farmers and experts the unfavorable conditions could be as follows the reuse of the drain water of the aforementioned networks the low quality and the salinity of irrigation water the absence of the system mechanization heavy texture and soil salinity low efficiency of surface irrigation systems high sedimentation in canals of the shahid rajae and ramshir irrigation and drainage networks growth of plants and weeds in these canals evapotranspiration and very high humidity due to the high temperature of the region especially the high temperature the very low price of water and production the absence of industrial companies appropriate foods in the area for product processing low ownership of agricultural land and traditional agricultural management some social issues and the existence of violations in the networks a comparison of this research with the one performed by montazar and zadbagher 2010 showed that in the study factors such as cultural issues water content channel coverage type of valves and structures with the same weights have the highest weight the second category was the distribution of water and in the third order were factors such as the year the cultivar the climate the price of water and water requirement the difference in the results is related to the weights of the regional factors also in the montazar and zadbagher 2010 research the qualitative assessment of water utilization in three networks located in khuzestan province dez gotvand and maroun was shown to be desirable semi desirable and undesirable furthermore in the three wheat barley and sesame crops the amount of blue and green water of sesame were less than the other two products which according to recommendation omidi et al 2014 due to the low level of virtual water this product can be considered in cases of lack of water in the plans 4 conclusion in the present research to investigate the status of irrigation and drainage networks in khuzestan province in terms of virtual water three networks of irrigation and drainage of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan were studied using two methods of computational analysis and hierarchical analysis the results showed that the amount of green water of wheat calculated in the irrigation and drainage network of hendijan was the highest followed by ramshir and shahid rajae networks in all three networks the amount of water delivered to the farm which is considered as blue water is more than the water required by the plant in the irrigation and drainage networks of shahid rajae ramshir and hendijan 31 23 and 28 percent more water than the required amount was delivered to the farm in the network of the shahid rajae the economic and territorial factors have been assigned the largest and the lowest weights the ramshir network sensitivity analysis showed that climatic factors with the highest weight and economic factors had the least weight similarly the hendijan network is similar to the shahid rajae network with the difference that the weight percentages were different in a general review it can be concluded that based on the calculations and hierarchical analyses ranking of networks is in line with the hendijan shahid rajae and ramshir networks in the hierarchical analysis method the incompatibility of the matrices of the paired comparisons of all criteria was less than 0 1 which indicates that decision makers are compatible in the ahp process there are several limitations to the present study it is suggested that for future investigations virtual water for agricultural products be calculated in addition to the water required for growing plants evaporated water during irrigation evaporated water during the transfer of water to the farm water penetrated the land after irrigation and out of reach water flowing on the ground and gathered at the bottom of the land after irrigation water consumed by weeds water leakage from canals and irrigation pipes water required for the production of fertilizers water required for the production of pesticides water needed for the labor force and machinery should be considered furthermore according to the weights obtained for the sub criteria to achieve the proper utilization of water and reach the logical level of

10484,the current study aims at reviewing and providing advances on methods for estimating and applying crop coefficients from observations of ground cover and vegetation height the review first focuses on the relationships between single kc and basal kcb and various parameters including the fraction of ground covered by the canopy fc the leaf area index lai the fraction of ground shaded by the canopy fshad the fraction of intercepted light flight and intercepted photosynthetic active radiation fipar these relationships were first studied in the 1970 s for annual crops and later in the last decennia for tree and vine perennials research has now provided a variety of methods to observe and measure fc and height h using both ground and remote sensing tools which has favored the further development of kc related functions in the past these relationships were not used predictively but to support the understanding of dynamics of kc and kcb in relation to the processes of evapotranspiration or transpiration inclusive of the role of soil evaporation later the approach proposed by allen and pereira 2009 the a p approach used fc and height h or lai data to define a crop density coefficient that was used to directly estimate kc and kcb values for a variety of annual and perennial crops in both research and practice it is opportune to review the a p method in the context of a variety of studies that have derived kc and kcb values from field measured data with simultaneously observed ground cover fc and height applications used to test the approach include various tree and vine crops olive pear and lemon orchards and vineyards vegetable crops pea onion and tomato crops field crops barley wheat maize sunflower canola cotton and soybean crops as well as a grassland and a bermudagrass pasture comparisons of kcb values computed with the a p method produced regression coefficients close to 1 0 and coefficients of determination 0 90 except for orchards results indicate that the a p approach can produce estimates of potential kcb using vegetation characteristics alone within reasonable or acceptable error and are useful for refining kcb for conditions of plant spacing size and density that differ from standard values the comparisons provide parameters appropriate to applications for the tested crops in addition the a p approach was applied with remotely sensed fc data for a variety of crops in california using the satellite irrigation management support sims framework daily sims crop et etc sims produced kcb values using the fao56 and a p approaches combination of satellite derived fc and kcb values with eto data from spatial cimis california irrigation management information system produced et estimates that were compared with daily actual crop et derived from energy balance calculations from micrometeorological instrumentation etc eb results produced coefficients of regression of 1 05 for field crops and 1 08 for woody crops and r2 values of 0 81 and 0 91 respectively these values suggest that daily etc sims based et can be accurately estimated within reasonable error and that the a p approach is appropriate to support that estimation it is likely that accuracy can be improved via progress in remote sensing determination of fc tabulated kcb results and calculation parameters are presented in a companion paper in this special issue keywords basal crop coefficients kcb under full cover density coefficient fc from ground observations fc from ndvi estimates of kcb for trees and annual crops operational kcb from fc with sims framework 1 introduction over many years studies have aimed at deriving crop coefficients from assessments of the relationships between a single kc or basal kcb and a variety of vegetation parameters including the fraction of ground covered by the canopy fc the leaf area index lai the fraction of ground shaded by the canopy fshad the fraction of intercepted light flight and intercepted photosynthetic active radiation fipar other crop canopy characteristics such as crop height h or tree crop size have been considered applications include a relatively large number of field and tree crops beginning nearly 50 years ago while studies relative to vines and trees are more recent only 20 years ago the relation of relative et kc or kcb with amount of vegetation has an obvious and physical basis where more plant leaf surface area means more total bulk stomatal surface and conductance and more opportunity for diffusion of water vapor from leaves as transpiration monteith 1965 1981 similarly more ground cover or leaf area by vegetation means more surface area for absorption of solar photons and subsequent conversion of that energy into et therefore given similar stomatal conductance and leaf and canopy architectural properties one might expect to see under adequate soil moisture conditions the relative et from a vegetated area to increase with increasing ground cover or leaf area monteith 1981 energy constraints create an upper limit on total relative et with increasing leaf area beyond some limit often regarded to be approximately lai 3 ritchie 1972 with an asymptotic relationship between kcb and lai as lai approaches or exceeds 3 and extending to about lai 6 tanner and jury 1976 the fraction of ground covered by the canopy on the other hand tends to have a more linear relationship with relative et due to a more direct proportional relationship between interception of solar photon flux by the canopy and its conversion to transpiration williams and ayars 2005 lópez urrea et al 2014 as described in the following sections fao56 allen et al 1998 introduced a standardized approach to relate the basal kc during the midseason period kcb mid to lai or fc using a kcb value representing kcb under conditions of full cover kcb full represented by lai 3 the proposed kcb mid lai and kcb mid fc equations were aimed at estimating kcb mid for natural non typical or non pristine agricultural vegetation not included in the standardized tables and were not directed toward applications for common agricultural crops kcb end was estimated by scaling the kcb mid equations according to conditions at the end of the season and the length of the late season a resistance correction factor fr was proposed for the lai and fc based equations to take into consideration stomatal control by vegetation in the fao56 approach estimates for kcb full were targeted toward non pristine agricultural crops based on fao56 tabulated kcb mid values for a considered crop after adjustment for climate relative to the standard sub humid and calm conditions rhmin 45 and u2 2 m s 1 a second estimate for kcb full was directed to natural vegetation non full cover crops or crops not listed in fao56 it utilized the kcb mid for full cover vegetation lai 3 and was estimated as a function of the mean maximum crop height kcb h 1 0 1 h where kcb h was limited to 1 2 the proposed upper limit for kcb for tall vegetation having full ground cover with lai 3 kcb h should also be adjusted for climate the use of the kcb mid fc equation was directed toward trees and shrubs however the use of kcb full estimated from kcb h reveals that it may be applicable to a wide range of conditions for agricultural crops particularly to orchards and vineyards where large ranges in fc and h exist and large ranges in kcb mid occur therefore allen and pereira 2009 extended the application of the fao56 equations through the development of a density coefficient kd computed either from fc and h or from lai that approach referred herein as a p approach included specific equations for kc and kcb for orchards and vineyards that considered the amount of active ground cover their article included the tabulation of parameters for a variety of crops as well as tabulated kc and kcb values for orchards and vineyards that considered a range of crop densities or age and the presence or absence of active ground cover this current study provides an important opportunity to review and revise related applications and concepts the objectives of this article consist of a reviewing and revising the use of kc and kcb relations with fc lai and other indicators of canopy light and energy interception b reviewing approaches relative to deriving fc from field and remote sensing observations c testing applications of the a p approach to compute kcb against model derived kcb and d parameterization of a p equations for field and tree crops tabulated values for kcb estimated with the a p equations are presented in a companion paper pereira et al 2020c this special issue section 2 reviews studies on relationships between kc or kcb and lai fc or other fractions of canopy light or radiation interception by field and vegetable crops and tree and vine crops the derivation of fc from field observations and remote sensing are briefly dealt with in section 3 an update of the a p approach to compute kc and kcb is described in section 4 the test of a p equations for various field vegetable tree and vine crops is presented in section 5 while section 6 discusses the application of the a p approach in the satellite irrigation management support framework to predict daily crop et section 7 provides advice and recommendations for users 2 review of relationships between crop coefficients and the fraction of ground cover or leaf area index 2 1 field and vegetable crops ritchie and burnett 1971 introduced the use of the ratio ep eo representing plant evaporation ep to potential evaporation eo which corresponds to the currently used kcb or transpiration coefficient and developed power relationships with lai and fc for both cotton and grain sorghum based upon two years of observations in their pioneering work data relative to both crops and both experimental years were fitted by the same curve in a later pioneering study al khafaf et al 1978 used two years of experiments with cotton and sorghum and found an exponential relationship between the ep eo ratio and lai as with the study of ritchie and burnett 1971 all data were fitted to the same equation in contrast tanner and jury 1976 did not use an ep eo ratio but demonstrated that actual et and t of a potato crop observed in a lysimeter were closely related to lai al kaisi et al 1989 obtained non linear relationships between maize kc and lai using treatments that allowed detection of the role of soil evaporation thus providing for a distinction between kc and kcb as later defined villalobos and fereres 1990 fit an exponential curve to the kcb lai data for three crops corn cotton and sunflower medeiros et al 2001 reported a third degree polynomial relationship between kcb and lai for beans however in a later study medeiros et al 2016 a quadratic equation was fitted to relate kcb with lai studies by duchemin et al 2006 using remote sensing have shown that the kc lai relationship for wheat could fit a unique exponential curve over 13 fields and three years of observations however with large dispersion along the fitted curve jiang et al 2014 reported that kc and kcb could be related with lai using exponential relationships for maize seeded at various densities that produced diverse lai throughout the growing season common to the above referred studies are the non linear relationships between lai and kc or kcb in contrast borges et al 2015 used the bowen ratio energy balance breb to derive kcb for melon and found a linear relation with lai ritchie and burnett 1971 also studied the relationship between the ratio ep eo and the fractional ground cover or fc non linear relationships were found which were different for sorghum in two experimental years since different row spacings were used later grattan et al 1998 developed non linear relationships between ground cover and crop coefficients for vegetable and row crops in california using the breb method to determine crop et crops studied included artichoke pinto beans broccoli lettuce melon onion and strawberry those authors concluded that kc changed as a quadratic function of the percentage ground cover or fc but linear fits were observed for data collected before midseason similarly using weighing lysimeters bryla et al 2010 found that quadratic equations could describe the relationships between kcb and fc for broccoli lettuce bell pepper and garlic graphical results of both studies evaluated and reported in allen and pereira 2009 suggest that linear relationships may accurately describe kcb fc relations before maximum vegetation development medeiros et al 2001 reported third degree polynomials relating kcb to fc for beans using remote sensing observations heilman et al 1982 found a linear relationship between kc and fc for four alfalfa plots later lópez urrea et al 2009a derived a linear equation relating onion kcb and fc with data obtained with a weighing lysimeter similarly lópez urrea et al 2009b reported a linear relationship between spring wheat kc and fc lópez urrea et al 2014 fit linear equations to kcb fc relationships for sunflower using lysimeter data however with different slopes of regression lines for each of two years of data a linear relationship between kc and fc was reported by zhang et al 2015 for sugarcane during the crop development stage with fc obtained from ndvi lozano et al 2016 reported a linear relationship between kc and fc for strawberries and lópez urrea et al 2016 found good linear relationship between kcb and fc values for two years of biomass sorghum data observed in lysimeters in addition these authors reported an excellent agreement between normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and both kcb and fc finally trout and dejonge 2018 reported a linear relationship between maize fc and kcb relative to alfalfa reference et for fc 0 80 and that linearity was not preserved beyond that threshold those authors assumed that this break in the linearity of kcb fc was caused by maize tasseling the above review shows that relationships between kc or kcb and fc are in general non linear relative to the full crop season of field and vegetable crops but may be linear during vegetation development that non linearity likely led to the adoption in fao aquacrop of a model adjusted fc which is multiplied by kcb max to obtain actual kcb and therefore to estimate actual transpiration raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 however this concept applies only for cases of full canopy cover for field and vegetable crops in contrast evidence for relationships between kc and or kcb and lai or fc led allen et al 1998 to adopt in fao56 predictive equations for kc and kcb from lai and fc which were later improved upon by allen and pereira 2009 2 2 tree and vine crops studies on tree and vine crops were developed later than those for annual crops the first study relating kc with mid day light intercepted by the canopy flight which is a good estimator of fc was reported by johnson et al 2000 for mature peach trees which was followed by ayars et al 2003 a linear relationship was found in these studies later for thompson seedless grapevine williams and ayars 2005 also found a linear relationship between kc and the fraction of area shaded fshad again a good estimator of fc goodwin et al 2003 2006 reported a strong linear relationship between kcb and fc and effective area of shade for peaches where fc was estimated using a combination of digital photographs of the tree taken from the direction of the sun and the fraction of par intercepted on the soil surface within the area of shade cast by the tree lópez urrea et al 2012 reported good linear regressions relating kcb and fc observed in a weighing lysimeter for a tempranillo vineyard over a three year period the authors fit three equations to the three years but a single equation could be adopted using all data however with a smaller coefficient of determination later montoro et al 2016 showed that fitted linear kcb fc relationships were different for irrigated and non irrigated conditions which likely caused reduced kcb act when vines were not irrigated also for a tempranillo vineyard picón toro et al 2012 found linear relationships between kcb and lai fipar and fc over a total of 5 years of data ferreira et al 2012 studied five vineyards in different locations using eddy covariance and adopted linear relationships for the kcb max lai and kcb max fc relations in contrast zhao et al 2018 found a non linear relationship between kcb and lai for a vineyard with different curves for all the years of experimentation following the tree kc flight studies referenced above research relative to tree crops has tested various indicators of canopy characteristics girona et al 2011 for a five year experiment with apple cv golden smoothee and pear cv conference reported that kc observed in large weighing lysimeters varied exponentially with fipar observed at noon responses of both tree crops were however different while all apple data fit the same curve well regardless of the year different equations were required to fit the pear data from different years depending on the tree age those authors hypothesized that this different behavior may be related to differences in the canopy properties between the two tree crops with pear canopies having higher porosity than apple canopies thus higher light penetration while apple canopies were denser and taller in addition the authors concluded that midday light interception did not adequately account for differences in kc across both species auzmendi et al 2011 reported that the relationships between actual transpiration tc act and fipar for apples were linear and observed that pre harvest and post harvest data behaved differently likely because the latter consisted of smaller tc act and fipar values marsal et al 2013 developed different canopy characteristics for apple trees based on plant height h and width w the ratio h w designated slenderness and the difference lai h w called leaf overlapping they used these indicators to characterize the canopy porosity of apple trees and to model kc mid variability a different canopy indicator was used by gonzález talice et al 2012 who reported linear relationships between tree cross sectional area tcsa and kcb tcsa was used as an indicator of ground cover shaded area moreover these authors found that linear regressions for tcsa kcb were similar for galaxy and fuji varieties but both differed from the equation used to fit granny smith data relationships between kc fc for trees and vines were developed only relatively recently for pecans and using remote sensing data over a number of cropped fields in new mexico samani et al 2011 found a linear relationship between the ratio kc kc ref and fc where kc ref was the kc measured for a mature pecan orchard with fc 80 that linear relationship proved acceptable for a pecan orchard in south africa ibraimo et al 2016 but those authors concluded that pecans did not show a linear relationship between kc and midday fipar and it was not possible to use the relationship proposed by samani et al 2011 predictively espadafor et al 2015 used four years of lysimeter observations in a young almond tree orchard where fc increased from 3 to 48 to assess the time evolution of the ratios kcb fipar and kcb fc over the last two years they found nearly constant ratios through time but no curve fittings were performed lately lópez lópez et al 2018 assessed the behavior of the ratio kcb fc for almonds but did not fit any equation to the relationships between variables however values for that ratio differed when computed from lysimeter or from field water balance the above review shows that relationships between kc or kcb and fc or lai for trees and vine crops contrary to field and vegetable crops are only recently studied and that different indicators of canopy interception of radiation have been used generally predictive kc and kcb equations proposed in fao56 using fc or lai data were assumed to be applicable to trees and vines allen and pereira 2009 developed predictive equations for kc and kcb from lai and fc focusing on trees and vines as analyzed further in this article 2 3 crop coefficients from ground cover and height the fao56 kcb mid lai and kcb mid fc relationships described above may be used predictively after estimating kcb full adjusting for climate conditions and considering the use of the resistance correction factor fr when the crop exhibits more stomatal control than standard agricultural crops conversely the simple fao56 relations of kc or kcb with fc lai fshad or fipar were generally not developed to be used predictively but rather mainly to discuss the behavior and suitability of derived kc and kcb values to expand the predictability of those fao56 equations allen and pereira 2009 developed the a p approach as a refinement and upgrade of the referred fao56 equations a coefficient of density kd from either lai or fc and h was defined to promote standardization and visual reproducibility parameter values were proposed and new kc and kcb values for various crops and crop densities mainly for tree and vine crops were considered tabulated kc and kcb values using the a p approach for various crops primarily for trees and vines having diverse crop densities and heights were later provided by jensen and allen 2016 more recently johnson and melton 2017 revised the application of the a p approach and proposed updated parameters for a wide panoply of field vegetable and fruit woody crops of california the approach is gaining usage by many researchers however often with limited information regarding the applications numerous a p applications have used the dual kc water balance model simdualkc because the approach is incorporated into the model rosa et al 2012a b and is used to adjust kcb values according to observed or simulated fc and h values examples include field research applications to tree and vine crops including peach paço et al 2012 olives paço et al 2014 2019 vineyards fandiño et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 as well as to field crops including soybeans wei et al 2015 and bermudagrass paredes et al 2018 miao et al 2016 used the a p approach to develop a procedure to compute kcb for relay intercrops and rosa et al 2016 developed a et kcb computational application for saline conditions related results from these applications are analyzed in section 5 other a p applications included estimation and analysis of kcb for olives conceição et al 2017 puppo et al 2019 citrus taylor et al 2015 and maize ding et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 and zheng et al 2013 applied the a p approach to estimate the kc of tomato cropped in both a greenhouse and open field pôças et al 2015 used the a p approach to validate computations of kcb for maize barley and olives using remote sensing rs vegetation indices ndvi and savi soil adjusted vegetation index and santos et al 2012 used that approach to parameterize the rs model metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration all applications produced relatively good accuracy for estimates of kcb values 3 determining the fraction of ground cover the observation of fc involves some complexity however depending upon the desired accuracy adams et al 1976 described an early description of a method for field determination of the fraction of ground cover or the fraction of ground shaded by the canopy in row crops as it is referred to in their study it refers to the use of a meter stick on the soil surface adjacent to plants and parallel to the row later adams and arkin 1977 compared various methods to determine ground cover and concluded that the meter stick method is as accurate faster simpler and more economical than the other methods used they reported that there were no significant differences in measurement results using the meter stick method overhead photographs spatial quantum sensor or traversing quantum cell cihlar et al 1987 developed a methodology for estimating green plant cover based on a supervised classification technique of digital photographic images using a maximum probability algorithm with the purpose of assigning the current classes of green vegetation in the image the use of overhead photographs has continued with improved equipment and varied sophistications in separating canopy cover from background goodwin et al 2006 reported the estimation of fc using a combination of digital photographs of the tree taken from the direction of the sun and the fraction of par intercepted on the soil surface within the area of shade cast by the tree er raki et al 2007 reported on the use a hemispherical canopy photo apparatus equipped with a fisheye lens to take photos above a wheat canopy hunsaker et al 2013 reported on the use of a digital camera mounted on a hand held aluminum pole to allow nadir views and trout and dejonge 2018 reported the use of a digital camera from a nadir view 6 m above the ground surface the main advances have come from the differentiation of digital image pixels relative to the plant canopy and background soil surface residue and senesced leaves particularly when digital images are used a different approach was used by martinez cob et al 2014 who reported on the use of pyranometers for estimation of fc at remote sites while adopting photographical techniques for in situ observation the main issues consist of taking the images near noon under a near nadir condition however the use of digital images of trees to obtain various canopy features has different requirements as described by espadafor et al 2015 duan et al 2017 compared fc estimates from experimental plots cropped with cotton sorghum and sugarcane with images and ortho mosaics captured by a low altitude uav the authors reported good agreement between ground cover estimates from ortho mosaic and images when the target was positioned at a near nadir view at the centre of the image the use of a digital camera from directly overhead of the canopy and image analysis to calculate the ratio of green leaf pixel to the whole photograph was also reported by fan et al 2017 also recently reported was the precise detection of fc for a lettuce crop using digital photography which allows measurement of the diameter of the plants with help of appropriate software namely relative to color selection fernández pacheco et al 2014 hernández hernández et al 2016 2017 a web application was developed by gonzález esquiva et al 2017 an application to diverse crops is reported by zhang et al 2018 who used nine color vegetation indices calculated from time series of digital photographs to develop an fc estimation model applicable to sugarcane maize cotton and paddy rice currently fc is commonly obtained from remote sensing trout et al 2008 produced diverse advances in remote sensing of fc namely using ndvi from landsat 5 after establishing a linear relationship between ndvi and fc for a variety of crops later among others lópez urrea et al 2009b 2016 johnson and trout 2012 campos et al 2014 pôças et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 and de la casa et al 2018 reported on the relationships between fc and various vegetation indices mainly ndvi and savi imukova et al 2015 used high resolution rapideye satellite images to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of the green vegetation fraction of croplands 4 predicting kcb from fraction of ground cover and height using a density coefficient 4 1 background concepts the two step crop coefficient reference et method kc x eto has been a successful and dependable means to estimate crop evapotranspiration etc and crop water requirements since the early 1970 s doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 the method uses weather data to estimate the grass reference eto and multiplies it by a crop coefficient kc that represents the relative rate of evapotranspiration from a specific crop and condition to that of the reference crop etc eto the reference condition is et from a clipped cool season well watered grass eto and represents a near maximum rate of et that varies with weather conditions the calculation of eto has been standardized by fao allen et al 1998 2006 followed by the american society of civil engineers asce ewri 2005 jensen and allen 2016 the kc eto approach provides a simple convenient and reproducible way to estimate et from a variety of crops and climatic conditions allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 2015 crop coefficient curves have been developed and were reported for a wide range of agricultural crops in fao56 allen et al 1998 2007 and their standardized values are currently updated for vegetable and field crops pereira et al 2020a b this special issue the standardized kc is regarded as generally transferable among regions and climates under the assumption that the eto accounts for nearly all variation caused by weather and climate and the kc represents the relative fraction of eto that is governed by amount type and condition of vegetation when cropped under standard pristine conditions under most conditions kc values can be quite accurately estimated through their relations with the fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation as discussed in previous sections the height of the vegetation and the amount of stomatal regulation under moist soil conditions as proposed by allen et al 1998 and detailed in the allen and pereira 2009 a p approach the value for kc for conditions of water and or salinity stress is generally determined by reducing the kc estimate via a stress coefficient ks using a daily soil water balance swb model e g the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a b and partitioning the kc into transpiration and evaporation components adopting the dual kc approach kc is defined as 1 k c k s k c b k e where kcb is the basal crop coefficient representing the ratio between crop transpiration and eto ke is the soil evaporation coefficient representing the ratio between soil evaporation and eto and ks is a dimensionless stress coefficient whose value is dependent on available soil water and soil and crop salinity related characteristics allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 the value for ks is 1 unless available soil water and or salinity limits transpiration in which case ks 1 estimation of ke for bare soil conditions is described in allen et al 1998 2005b and allen 2011 fig 1 shows the fao segmented approach to describe the kc curves where the continuous seasonal curve is broken into four linear segments representing the initial development midseason and late season periods doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 2005a the advantage of the fao kc curve is that only three key values for kc need to be determined kc ini during the initial period kc mid during the midseason period and kc end at the end if the late season period the fao procedure for standard kc values refers to mean standardized daily minimum relative humidity rhmin 45 and mean wind speed at 2 m u2 2 m s 1 for climates with rhmin and u2 differing from those values the standardized kc values tabulated in fao 56 or updated in pereira et al 2020a b this special issue are adjusted for all kc mid and kcb mid as well as for kc end and kcb end larger than 0 45 as 2 k c m i d e n d k c m i d e n d t a b l e 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where kc mid end table is the value for kc mid kcb mid kc end or kcb end for the above referred standard climate and h is the mean maximum plant height m during the midseason period or full cover period eq 2 is valid for h up to 20 m allen et al 1998 2005a when the crop dries in field kc end 0 45 the adjustment by eq 2 is not required the values for rhmin u2 and h need only to be approximate values averaged over the mid season and late season periods eq 2 helps to account for increases in maximum expected et rates limited by environmental energy relative to the grass based reference eto the increases are strongest for tall vegetation that can have greater aerodynamic roughness and leaf area as compared to the clipped grass reference 4 2 estimating kc curves from fraction of ground cover for expanses of vegetation large enough that an equilibrium boundary is established so that general one dimensional equations such as the penman monteith apply a maximum upper limit on et is established due to the law of conservation of energy therefore for large expanses of vegetation larger than about 500 to 2000 m2 the kc development process has upper limits for kc of 1 2 1 3 for the grass reference however as discussed by allen et al 2011 and pereira et al 2020a b this special issue under conditions of clothesline effects where vegetation height exceeds that of the surroundings or oasis effects where vegetation has higher soil water availability than the surroundings peak kc may exceed those limits caution is required when extrapolating et measurements from small vegetation plots to large stands or regions because overestimation of et may occur an upper energy constrained limit on kc termed kc max is defined as the maximum value for kc following rain or irrigation and is governed by the amount of energy available for evaporation of water the kc max varies with general climate ranging from about 1 05 1 30 allen et al 1998 2005a 3 k c m a x m a x 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 k c b t a b l e 0 05 where u2 and rhmin are averaged daily u2 and rhmin values during the growth period kcb table is the value for kcb for the standardized climate and h is the mean plant height m during the period of calculation initial development midseason or late season following the a p approach the basal kcb because it represents mostly transpiration depends upon the amount of vegetation and can be expressed as a function of a density coefficient kd as 4 k c b k c m i n k d k c b f u l l k c m i n where kcb is the approximation for kcb for vegetation structure and extent represented by the density coefficient kd defined hereafter kcb fullis the estimated basal kc at peak plant growth under conditions having nearly full ground cover or lai 3 and kc min is the minimum basal kc for bare soil 0 15 under typical agricultural conditions where some subsurface soil moisture exists for tree crops having grass or other ground cover eq 4 takes a different form that considers transpiration by the active ground cover thus 5 k c b k c b c o v e r k d m a x k c b f u l l k c b c o v e r k c b f u l l k c b c o v e r 2 where kcb cover is the kcb of the active ground cover in the absence of tree foliage the second term of the max function reduces the estimate for kcb mid by half the difference kcb full kc cover when this difference is negative this accounts for impacts of shading by vegetation when kcb kcb cover due to larger stomatal conductance of the ground cover eq 5 applies to estimate kcb during any period as described by allen and pereira 2009 the approach of eq 5 can be similarly applied to estimate a single kc coefficient kcb full can be approximated as a function of mean plant height and adjusted for climate following allen et al 1998 6 k c b f u l l f r m i n 1 0 k h h 1 20 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where h u2 and rhmin were defined previously but herein referring to the mid season the value for kcb full represents a general upper limit on kcb mid for vegetation having full ground cover and lai 3 under full water supply eq 6 suggests that an upper bound for kcb full is 1 20 plus adjustment for nonstandard climate effects of crop height are considered through the sum 1 kh h with kh 0 1 for tree and vine crops as well as tall field crops and kh 0 2 for short crops and vegetables as described in following sections eq 6 produces increases in kcb full with plant height and more arid climate the parameter fr applies a downward adjustment fr 1 0 if the vegetation exhibits more stomatal control on transpiration than is typical of most annual agricultural crops examples are provided in the following sections adopting the allen et al 1998 calculation procedure for fr it is assumed 7 f r δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 r l 100 where rl is mean leaf resistance for the vegetation in question s m 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure vs air temperature curve kpa oc 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa oc 1 both relative to the period when kcb full is computed this factor fr is multiplied against the estimate for kcb full in eq 6 to adjust its value which is particularly important in the case of perennials and the late season the standard value for fr is 1 0 because for most annual agricultural crops rl is often approximately 100 s m 1 values for rl for many agricultural and non agricultural plants can be found in allen et al 1996 and pereira and alves 2013 the value for rl is limited to 100 s m 1 the density coefficient kd used in eq 4 describes the increase in kcb with increase in amount of vegetation as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 where lai can be observed or estimated kd can be approximated under normal conditions as 8 k d 1 e 0 7 l a i where lai is defined as the area of leaves per area of ground surface averaged over a large area m2 m 2 with consideration of only one side of green healthy leaves active in vapor transfer where estimates of the fraction of ground surface covered by vegetation fc are available the kd is estimated as 9 k d m i n 1 m l f c e f f f c e f f 1 1 h where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation 0 01 1 near solar noon ml is a multiplier on fc eff describing the effect of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative et per fraction of ground shaded 1 0 2 0 and h is the mean height of the vegetation m fc eff is often observed as the shaded area near noon between 11 00 and 15 00 as reported in section 3 estimation of fc eff for row crops was described by allen et al 1998 an estimation for trees was provided by allen and pereira 2009 fc eff is often determined from visual inspection the ml multiplier on fc eff in eq 9 imposes an upper limit on the relative magnitude of transpiration per unit of ground area as represented by fc eff allen et al 1998 and is expected to mostly range from 1 5 to 2 0 depending on the canopy density and thickness ml is an attempt to simulate the upper physical limits on transpiration imposed by water flux through the plant root stem and leaf systems ml may have a low value when the canopy porosity is high the value for ml can be modified to fit the specific vegetation and experimental data 5 validation of kcb prediction from fraction of ground cover and height using ground observations the objective of this section is to demonstrate the application and ability of the a p approach to reproduce standard and measured kcb for a variety of trees and vines and vegetable and field crops the standard kcb used herein were derived from actual crop evapotranspiration data obtained through soil water balance procedures based upon accurate soil moisture measurements as well as by sap flow and eddy covariance measurements whose data were ingested into the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a the linearly segmented kcb curves were then computed through the calibration and validation of the model rosa et al 2012b using the observed soil water content or the observed transpiration with sap flow devices or the crop et measured with eddy covariance instrumentation the kcb values obtained through the calibration procedures are referred hereafter as kcb simdualkc kcb values reported here were also obtained from crop et accurately measured with large size weighing lysimeters located in the middle of large fields cultivated with the same crop and techniques used in the lysimeters lópez urrea et al 2016 these kcb values are named herein as kcb lysimeter et measurements and the kcb derivation procedures are described in the publications cited for each crop parameters in the a p functions were determined using a simplified trial and error procedure such that kcb a p approximate the kcb simdualkc or kcb lysimeter during various stages for each crop only the case study of section 5 6 fit a p parameters directly to experimental data ranges of values found for parameters give indication of values for parameters to be expected in practice these ranges in the case of trees and vines refer to variation in fc and h following pruning and natural plant growth during a stage in the case of vegetable and field crops refer to crop growth during a stage and later to senescence and for grasses and pasture refer to cuttings and regrowth 5 1 trees and vines 5 1 1 olive data were provided from field research reported by paço et al 2019 which was performed during 2011 2013 in a 78 ha super intensive olive orchard located at viana do alentejo southern portugal fc values used with the a p approach were obtained through field observations or using remote sensing pôças et al 2015 kcb simdualkc values were derived from the calibration and validation of the simdualkc model using sap flow transpiration measurements further validation was performed using eddy covariance measurements of etc act a value of ml 1 5 was used in eq 9 and kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 table 1 provides the ranges of values for the terms of the a p approach computed using observed data ranges are related with fc changes due to pruning and related responses of trees exacerbated by heavy pruning following exceptional frosts fr values were estimated after those tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 fig 2 shows the kcb a p estimated values compared with the kcb simdualkc values resulting from field observations during three growing seasons the regression forced through the origin fto produced a regression slope of b0 1 00 fig 3 thus there were no over or under estimation trends 5 1 2 peach in a study performed during 1998 and 1999 seasons in a commercial orchard located at atalaia montijo southern portugal paço et al 2012 measured peach transpiration using sap flow tc act along with et measurements of eddy covariance etec one year of tc act measurements was used to calibrate the simdualkc model and the other was used for model validation along with the etec measurements in this study only one value for fc eff 0 30 was measured during the mid season considering ml 1 4 kh 0 1 and fr 1 the calculated kd was 0 41 when kcb full was 1 17 thus resulting in kcb a p 0 51 which compared well with the field derived kcb simdualkc 0 50 5 1 3 pear a study was performed during two seasons 2013 and 2014 in a 50 ha commercial rocha pear orchard located in torres vedras western portugal rosa 2019 spatially distributed soil water measurements were accurately performed with fdr devices other measurements included the water table depth fc eff values were obtained from intercepted photosynthetically active radiation fipar measured with accupar lp 80 decagon devices usa all measurements were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model and therefore to derive the kcb simdualkc fig 4 in the a p approach ml 1 5 was used and kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 table 2 provides ranges for terms of the a p approach computed using observed fc eff and h fr values were estimated following allen and pereira 2009 the fto regression fig 4 produced b0 0 98 indicating a slight under estimation tendency by the kcb a p 5 1 4 lemon a study was performed on lemons during two growing seasons 2013 and 2014 in a 5 ha fully established lemon orchard rosa 2019 located in mafra near the west coast of portugal as per the study on pear soil water content was performed with fdr instrumentation at representative locations within the orchard fc eff was obtained from fipar measurements the soil moisture based et data were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model and therefore to derive kcb fig 5 in the a p approach ml 1 2 was used and kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 table 3 provides ranges for the terms in the a p approach computed using observed fc eff and h fr values were estimated after those tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 the fto regression fig 5 produced b0 1 03 thus a slight over estimation tendency for the kcb a p 5 1 5 wine grapes 5 1 5 1 vineyards with bare soil data were collected during two seasons for mature tempranillo wine grapes and reported by lópez urrea et al 2012 the water use of two grapevines was measured with a monolithic large weighing lysimeter installed in the center of a 1 ha plot surrounded by a drip irrigated vineyard of about 5 ha etc values were calculated as the difference between lysimeter mass losses from evaporation and or transpiration divided by the lysimeter area 9 0 m2 the lysimeter container is 3 m 3 m square and 1 7 m deep the lysimeter soil containing tank sits on a system of beams and a counterbalances that offsets the dead weight of the soil and the tank and reduces the load on the weigh beam by 1 000 1 the lysimeter mass resolution was 0 01 mm and its accuracy was greater than 0 03 mm equivalent water depth two vines were planted in the lysimeter each one occupying 4 5 m2 i e the same as the vines outside the lysimeter thus allowing for representative measurements of vineyard etc efforts were made to keep the vines inside the lysimeter growing at the same rate as the crop outside to minimize edge effects the basal crop coefficient kcb was obtained from the lysimeter kc values minus the calculated ke values using the fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 additional information about the lysimeter facility and the technical features of the lysimeter may be found in lópez urrea et al 2012 in the a p approach ml varied among the different stages with ml values of 1 1 1 3 and 1 8 used respectively for the initial development and mid season kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 table 4 provides for the terms of the a p approach computed using fc and h observations fr values were estimated after those tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 the regression forced through the origin fig 6 produced b0 0 99 thus no under or over estimation tendency for the kcb a p values 5 1 5 2 vineyards with active ground cover three examples are provided in this section first an albariño vineyard with permanent active ground cover at pontevedra spain and then two vineyards with the cv godello and mencía at valdeorras and ribeira sacra respectively galicia spain having active ground cover which transformed into mulch during the growing season two different trellis systems were utilized in the three examples in all cases etc act was determined with a swb and the soil water content was monitored with tdr these data were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model thus to derive kcb for the three vineyards the first example includes data for fc and h data for mature albariño wine grapes semi trellis system which were reported by fandiño et al 2012 fc and h values were measured during five growing seasons with unpublished data from 2011 and 2012 seasons an active ground cover was maintained in the inter row area consisting of natural herbaceous vegetation for active ground cover characterization observations were performed during the crop season including its density height h cover and fraction of green active ground cover fc cover these characteristics changed throughout the season due to various cultivation practices mainly mowing and application of herbicides along the vine row an adjustment to the measured fc was applied to determine fc eff effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation using the equations proposed by rosa et al 2012a a complete description of observations measurements the swb approach and the derivation of kcb simdualkc is provided by fandiño et al 2012 in the a p approach ml 1 5 was used kcb full was computed with eq 6 and kcb a p was determined using eq 5 due to the presence of an active ground cover in the inter row during the entire season kcb gcover relative to the active ground cover vegetation was determined with the simdualkc model taking into account different soil management operations practiced during the season which are reported in fandiño et al 2012 table 5 presents ranges for the terms of the a p approach computed using observations for fc and h fr values for initial and midseason periods and for the end season were taken from fandiño et al 2012 which were related to kcb full adjusted to local conditions fig 7 shows the comparison of estimated kcb a p values with kcb simdualkc through a fto regression where kcb simdualkc values were derived from observations estimated values for the initial and development stages showed worse results during the five seasons likely because the effects of the active ground cover were more important during these stages the fto regression fig 7 produced b0 1 00 thus no tendency for under or over estimation of the kcb a p values the resulting error in daily kcb estimation had an rmse of 0 05 the second group of vineyards represent data for fc and h for mature godello and mencía wine grapes vertical trellis on a double and single cordon system respectively that were reported by cancela et al 2015 data from 2012 and 2013 were used in both cases with fc and h values measured during two growing seasons a similar process to the albariño vineyard was applied to produce the kcb a p values kcb gcover was also determined using the simdualkc model taking into account variation in active ground cover during the season with the ground cover mulched during the development stage table 6 presents ranges for the terms of the a p approach computed using observations fr values for initial and midseason periods and for end season were taken from cancela et al 2015 and related with kcb full adjusted to local conditions fig 8 shows the comparison of estimated kcb a p values with simulated kcb simdualkc for godello fig 8a and mencía fig 8b trials the fto regression produced b0 1 01 for godello and b0 1 03 for mencía thus a slight over estimation while the resulting error in kcb estimation was rmse of 0 02 and 0 04 for godello and mencía respectively 5 2 vegetable crops 5 2 1 peas for industry the data set used was obtained at two commercial fields one of 30 ha located at alpiarça and the other with 47 ha at golegã central portugal both cropped with vining peas for industry during two seasons 2011 2012 as reported by paredes et al 2017 during the first year both fields were monitored but only one was monitored in the second year measurements included the net irrigation depths soil water content with fdr devices down to 0 80 m crop height root depths and fc eff soil water content was measured twice a week along the crop seasons at several representative locations the fraction of soil shaded by the crop canopy near solar noon was observed within four 1 m 1 m areas at various dates throughout the seasons in addition the dates for the crop growth stages were observed observations and measurements were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the potential kcb simdualkc were kcb mid 1 15 and kcb end 1 11 the high kcb end is due to the very early harvest required by the industry in the a p approach ml 2 was used and kh 0 2 in eq 6 performed the best in reproducing the kcb simdualkc data kh 0 2 was applied to the pea canopy and for other crops having similar architecture where there is considerable leaf area with relatively low canopy height ranges in parameters for the a p approach used in eqs 4 6 7 and 9 are given in table 7 fig 9 illustrates the fto regression between kcb a p and kcb simdualkc values the a p approach tended to under estimate the kcb values by about 6 b0 0 94 5 2 2 onions a dataset for onions was reported by lópez urrea et al 2009a etc measurements of sprinkler irrigated onions were conducted with a large weighing lysimeter installed in the center of a 100 100 m plot the lysimeter container is 2 7 m long 2 3 m wide and 1 7 m deep with an approximate total weight of 14 5 t the crop inside the lysimeter was kept at the same growth rate as the crop on the outside to minimize edge effects the lysimeter mass resolution was 0 02 mm with an accuracy of 0 04 mm equivalent water depth readers are referred to lópez urrea et al 2009a for a detailed description of lysimeter technical features and measurements fc and h values were measured during one growing season with 34 observations a value for ml 2 was used and kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 2 table 8 presents ranges for terms of the a p approach computed using observations fig 10 shows the comparison of estimated kcb a p values with measured kcb lysimeter the slope of the linear regression forced through the origin shows a slight under estimation tendency with b0 0 96 5 2 3 tomato a dataset for tomato refers to a study by zheng et al 2013 field experiments were developed during 2010 and 2011 seasons at wuwei gansu province northwest china five drip irrigated treatments relative to various soil matric potential thresholds were considered using a completely randomized design measurements included root depths leaf area index lai precipitation net irrigation depths and soil water content surveyed down to 0 80 m tomato et was derived from the soil water balance kd was obtained from lai measurements performed during two growing seasons using eq 8 kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 because differently from other vegetable crops referred before the crop was trained on a trellis table 9 presents ranges for the terms of the a p approach computed using lai and h observations fig 11 shows the comparison of single crop coefficients the estimated kc a p values and kc swb derived from soil water balance observations the slope of the linear fto regression produced b0 1 00 indicating no tendency for under or over estimation 5 3 field crops 5 3 1 barley data sets were collected along two contrasting rainfall seasons 2012 and 2013 at a 30 ha commercial malting barley field located at alpiarça central portugal pereira et al 2015 measurements included root depths crop height lai fc eff net irrigation depths and soil water content the latter were measured with fdr devices to a depth of 0 90 m observations were performed at several representative locations within the field the dates of the crop growth stages were observed along both seasons all observations and measurements were used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model and therefore to derive adequate kcb values the potential kcb simdualkc was set to kcb mid 1 04 and kcb end 0 10 based on et measurement data ml 2 was used and the best fit kh value was 0 1 table 10 provides ranges for parameters used with the a p approach fig 12 presents the fto regression relating the kcb simdualkc with the kcb a p values which produced b0 1 02 which was close to 1 5 3 2 wheat three sets of data were evaluated for wheat one set represented winter wheat with frozen soil after sowing and two sets represented spring wheat the winter wheat study was performed along two seasons 2007 08 and 2008 09 in daxing north china plain zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 field observations to obtain crop et and to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model included the soil water content using tdr devices along the entire root zone 1 0 m and ec observations in addition observations also included crop height root depths the fraction of ground cover fc observed randomly along the crops season soil evaporation measured with microlysimeters placed along the crop row the dates of the crop growth stages and the net irrigation depths one of the spring wheat data sets was observed at hetao inner mongolia miao et al 2016 where the wheat was sown after frozen soil melting this study was performed during three seasons 2010 2012 and various basin irrigated fields were surveyed with the soil water content measured with the gravimetric method field observations and measurements performed at randomly distributed locations within each 10 50 m plot included crop height fc the dates of the crop growth stages the rooting depth net irrigation depths and precipitation wheat et was obtained from the soil water balance with the simdualkc calibrated and validated against soil water content data therefore making it appropriate to derive kcb from observations of the swb the third set for spring wheat was sowed in a semi arid environment near albacete spain and kcb were obtained with weighing lysimeters sánchez et al 2015 the dual crop coefficient was calculated with the standard fao56 approach allen et al 1998 and using the crop coefficient values obtained from lysimeter measurements first the evaporation component ke was calculated with the fao56 methodology and afterwards the basal crop coefficient kcb was obtained from the lysimeter kc values minus the calculated ke values the lysimeter description is provided in section 5 2 2 and additional information is given in lópez urrea et al 2009b and sánchez et al 2015 for winter wheat the potential kcb simdualkc values fitted to et measurements were kcb mid 1 14 and kcb end 0 25 while for spring wheat the fitted potential kcb simdualkc values were kcb mid 1 15 and kcb end 0 32 in hetao and kcb mid 1 15 and kcb end 0 21 in albacete for all cases a ml 2 was used and the best fit kh used in eq 6 was 0 2 table 11 provides for the parameters used with the a p approach for the three case studies fig 13 presents the fto regression relating kcb a p with kcb simdualkc or kcb lysimeter for both winter and spring wheat a slight tendency for under estimation of kcb a p for the winter wheat crop b0 0 95 was observed but not for spring wheat cases b0 1 00 and 0 98 respectively for china and spain case studies 5 3 3 maize several data sets were used for evaluation of the a p approach for maize studies for non stressed grain maize are reported by zhang et al 2013 and zhao et al 2013 relative to experiments in daxing north china plain where etec and et from a swb were observed and kcb were derived from the respective calibration and validation of simdualkc other studies using a swb are those reported by martins et al 2013 using fdr instrumentation in santa maria southern brazil by paredes et al 2014 also using fdr in alpiarça central portugal and by miao et al 2016 in hetao inner mongolia using the gravimetric method a rainfed groundwater dependent grain maize was studied in horqin eastern inner mongolia where a swb was used to derive crop et under water stress conditions as reported by wu et al 2015a in addition a study on grain maize subject to high levels of water stress reported by giménez et al 2016 was developed at paysandú western uruguay using a swb supported by neutron probe data a data set relative to a swb observed with silage maize cropped at santa maria southern brazil was reported by martins et al 2013 which refers to the use of fdr measurements for most cases experiments were performed during two seasons measurements included for all cases the components of the soil water balance which were used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model and therefore to derive kcb the soil evaporation was also measured in the study by zhao et al 2013 ml was set to 2 for the non water stress data sets and 1 5 for the water stressed data set which produced a smaller canopy density for all cases the best kh value was 0 1 for grain maize the potential kcb simdualkc for kcb mid ranged from 1 10 to 1 17 and the kcb end ranged from 0 26 to 0 38 depending upon the grain moisture at harvest lower kcb simdualkc were obtained for the rainfed maize at horqin with kcb mid 0 95 and kcb end 0 15 for the high water stress uruguayan case kcb mid ranged from 1 00 1 08 and kcb end was 0 36 for silage maize kcb mid was 1 11 and kcb end was 0 77 table 12 provides ranges for parameters used with the a p approach fr was set to 0 65 for the end season for silage maize indicating impacts of some leaf senescence and reduction in stomatal conductance whereas for the end season of grain maize fr was set to 0 45 when harvesting with high grain moisture and 0 30 when harvesting with low grain moisture the reduction in fr was necessary during late season to counteract the impact of relatively high fc even though leaves were senescing fig 14 presents the fto regression relating kcb simdualkc with kcb a p for the various cases results show no tendency for under or over estimation with b0 values close to 1 0 for individual cases fig 14 presents the regression relating kcb a p with kcb simdualkc for all maize data sets with results b0 1 01 showing that the a p approach presented no tendencies for under or over estimating observed kcb simdualkc values 5 3 4 sunflower two data sets were available for sunflower one refers to three seasons 2010 2012 of field studies near hetao inner mongolia as described by miao et al 2016 sunflower et was derived from a swb based upon gravimetric method data measurements were used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the potential kcb simdualkc values were kcb mid 1 16 and kcb end 0 27 the second dataset refers to weighing lysimeter studies performed during two growing seasons near albacete spain as reported by lópez urrea et al 2014 in this study sunflower etc measurements were conducted with a large weighing lysimeter previously described the basal crop coefficient kcb was obtained from the lysimeter kc values minus the calculated ke values using the fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 ml 2 was adopted with a best fit kh value of 0 1 table 13 provides ranges for values for parameters used with the a p approach the regression results relating kcb a p values with kcb simdualkc or kcb lysimeter produced b0 0 99 and 1 03 respectively for the china and spain case studies combining all sunflower datasets resulted in b0 1 02 fig 15 thus a slight tendency for over estimation 5 3 5 canola the canola dataset represented a one year experiment with weighing lysimeters reported by sánchez et al 2014 etc measurements of sprinkler irrigated canola were carried out with a weighing lysimeter located at the lysimeter facility near albacete southeast spain kcb values were determined from the lysimeter kc

computed using observations fig 16 shows the comparison of estimated kcb a p values with measured kcb lysimeter the slope of the linear fto regression was 0 99 thus very close to 1 0 5 3 6 cotton the cotton data set was comprised of two years of observations in fergana central asia cholpankulov et al 2008 which were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc and to derive appropriate kcb values as described by rosa et al 2012b measurements included the soil water balance components based upon neutron probe observations the potential kcb simdualkc were kcb mid 1 15 and kcb end 0 50 the ml value of 1 5 was adopted and the best kh value was 0 20 table 15 provides ranges in parameters used with the a p approach the fto regression relating kcb simdualkc with kcb a p values fig 17 produced b0 0 98 thus quite close to 1 and indicating the ability to reproduce measurement fitted kcb values using the a p approach with physically and visually derived field parameters 5 3 7 soybean two different sets of data on soybean were evaluated the first is from paysandú eastern uruguay giménez et al 2017 developed along two seasons where the soybean varieties are tall reaching 1 20 m height in contrast the second soybean study developed along three seasons in daxing north china plain wei et al 2015 used a short variety with an average maximum height of 0 70 m measurements included in both cases the fc eff the dates of the crop growth stages as well as the components of the soil water balance the former based upon neutron probe observations and on tdr the second the swb were used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the study by wei et al 2015 also provided soil evaporation data which allowed further validation of the et partition approach used by the simdualkc model the potential kcb simdualkc for the tall variety fitted to field measurements was kcb mid 1 10 and kcb end 0 42 while for the short variety kcb mid 1 00 and kcb end 0 33 consequently different approaches were used when computing kcb a p ml 2 was utilized for both cases and the best fit kh value was 0 10 table 16 provides ranges in parameters used with the a p approach the fto regression relating kcb a p values with kcb simdualkc shows b0 of 0 99 and 0 95 for the data sets of the tall and the short varieties combining all the soybeans datasets produced b0 0 96 fig 18 thus showing a slight tendency for under estimation 5 4 pasture and forage crops 5 4 1 grassland a data set produced from a groundwater dependent grassland observed during two seasons 2009 and 2011 in the steppe of horqin eastern inner mongolia china wu et al 2015b was evaluated killing frosts occurred during both autumn and winter observations and measurements were performed at random locations and included root depth fc grass height the dates of the crop growth stages water table depths precipitation and the soil water content down to 0 60 m all information was used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the potential kcb simdualkc values fitted to measured etsimdualkc were kcb mid 0 67 and kcb end 0 38 these values are quite low and correspond to cropping under water stress conditions and its effect on vegetation growth and density an ml value of 1 5 was used and the best fit kh value was 0 20 fr 1 0 was assumed because the studied steppe grassland was water stressed quite often throughout the cropping season table 17 provides ranges in values for parameters used with the a p approach the fto regression relating kcb simdualkc with kcb a p values fig 19 shows a good agreement b0 1 01 5 4 2 bermudagrass a data set describing a tifton bermudagrass cropped in santa maria brazil along two growing seasons and two years 2015 16 and 2016 17 was reported by paredes et al 2018 the data set consists of three irrigated treatments where the forage cuts were spaced at 124 248 and 372 cumulative growing degree days cgdd field observations and measurements included the dates of the crop growth stages relative to the various cuts net irrigation depths root depths and grass height the fraction of ground cover and the soil water content along the entire root zone of 0 50 m observed with fdr devices thus grass et was obtained from swb and the collected data were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the derived potential fitted kcb simdualkc values were 0 91 and 0 96 respectively for the growth and cutting stages ml 1 5 was applied and the best fit kh value was 0 10 table 18 provides parameters used with the a p approach fig 20 shows the kcb a p values compared with the dynamics of the kcb simdualkc values for two years relative to the case where the interval between successive cuttings was 248 cgdd the regression between kcb a p and kcb simdualkc values was not performed because the range of variation in those values was too small producing a small r2 and non representative b0 instead the quality of estimates for kcb a p was assessed through verifying if the potential kcb simdualkc values for the growth and cutting stages respectively 0 91 and 0 96 fell within the range of kcb a p given in table 18 this assessment can be confirmed through the visual observation of fig 20 which shows that kcb a p fit modelled kcb simdualkc curves well for forage cuttings at 248 cgdd results for 124 and 372 cgdd not shown were similar 5 5 summary of goodness of fit indicators table 19 presents the goodness of fit indicators used to compare estimated kcb a p with simdualkc model derived kcb or lysimeter derived kcb relative to all crops described in the previous sections these results show that the coefficients of regression for the fto regression varied between 0 94 and 1 03 which indicates that kcb a p values are statistically close on average to kcb simdualkc or to kcb lysimeter thus producing estimates for kcb values similar to those resulting from field measurements moreover this similarity of estimates refers not only to kcb mid but also to the late season and despite the fact that the observation period is short to the crop development stage as well in addition similarity was observed not only for crops under pristine cultivation but also for crops under water stress which effectively expands the scope of application of the a p approach the ordinary least squares ols coefficients of determination were relatively high generally 0 90 which indicates that the a p computed kcb values were quite close to the fitted regression line and the target kcb values produced by the simdualkc model this provides confidence in the ability of predictions from the a p approach to reproduce field conditions associated with the good results for both b0 and r2 the rmse are small generally much smaller than 10 of kcb where 10 is a commonly accepted or expected error in et measurement and modelling allen et al 2011 5 6 a modification of the fr parameter eq 7 for tree orchards the parameter fr allen et al 1998 applies a downward adjustment fr 1 0 to kcb full when the vegetation exhibits more stomatal control on transpiration than it is common for most annual agricultural crops which is of particular importance for perennial crops and for the late season of annual crops the standard value for fr is 1 0 since for most non stressed annual crops rl is approximately 100 s m 1 the applications presented above refer to fr values not computed from observed rl values but estimated with a simplified tentative and error procedure aimed at driving the a p computed kcb values kcb a p towards the kcb determined using accurate et measurement approaches described in the relevant references those applications show fr 1 0 for perennials section 5 1 and fr 1 0 for vegetable and field crops sections 5 2 and 5 3 however with fr 1 0 after senescence started this empirical parameterization was successfully adopted when tabulating kcb and kc for a wide panoply of annual and perennial crops pereira et al 2020a aimed at providing indicative values for the parameters of the a p approach fr included since kcb and kc were previously determined pereira et al 2020b c a different approach has been proposed by mobe et al 2020 based upon measurements in 12 apple orchards of south africa with fc varying from 0 20 to 0 60 and relative to four apple varieties after observing that the kcb resulting from the a p approach kcb a p largely overestimated the kcb derived from eddy covariance measurements mobe et al 2020 found that fr was over estimated due to using the ratio rl 100 with the observed apple rl to the average leaf resistance of annual crops 100 s m 1 instead they replaced the 100 s m 1 in eq 7 with a resistance parameter α considered to represent the minimum unstressed canopy resistance for apple trees following this modification they observed that kcb a p was able to match kcb derived from ec measurements quite well over the 12 orchards the computations were made for the average rl 202 s m 1 and α 37 s m 1 therefore the mobe et al 2020 proposed that the fr modification may apply when there are observations of leaf resistance of orchard trees so that the parameter α can be estimated this approach is of great interest when there are observations of rl and when kcb values are known which allow one to back calculate fr and then solve the fr function for α more research along these lines is needed 6 applications of kc and kcb estimation from fraction of ground cover and height using remote sensing 6 1 the satellite irrigation management support framework a principal strength of the a p approach is that it provides a robust and standardized method for deriving kcb values for a wide diversity of crops as illustrated in section 5 using mostly physical and visual parameters combining the a p approach with the relationships between ndvi and fc described in trout et al 2008 and johnson and trout 2012 provides a basis for wide area mapping of crop coefficients from satellite data the satellite irrigation management support sims framework melton et al 2012 2020 provides one example of the implementation of this approach for satellite mapping of kcb values and applications of sims to date include both irrigation management and monitoring of crop evapotranspiration by water management agencies through a partnership between nasa and the california department of water resources cdwr sims has been implemented over california and is currently being expanded to provide data for other states in the western u s sims can be driven with satellite data from optical multispectral instruments onboard satellites including landsat 5 landsat 7 landsat 8 sentinel 2a sentinel 2b and others sims can be applied with both atmospherically corrected surface reflectance values or top of atmosphere reflectance though use of surface reflectances generally leads to higher accuracy for sims estimates for kcb and etc for the comparisons with ground measurements of et described below atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data were obtained from the usgs landsat collection 1 for the enhanced thematic mapper etm on landsat 7 and the operational land imager oli on landsat 8 sims first calculates ndvi values from the surface reflectance values and utilizes the relationship described in trout et al 2008 to calculate fc from ndvi following eq 10 10 fc eff 1 26 ndvi 0 18 where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation near solar noon and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index this equation has been shown to be robust across a range of crop types although additional refinements or the use of crop specific equations can be applied to further reduce errors in mapping of kcb values to facilitate use of the sims fc data with the a p approach the satellite derived fc is used as an estimate of fc eff and notated as fc eff below for consistency with section 4 following the derivation of fc eff sims calculates kd values as a function of fc eff and crop height h following eq 9 in section 4 crop type information is used to calculate h and for the u s sims uses crop type information gridded at 30 m resolution from the usda cropland data layer johnson and mueller 2010 sims also allows the user to specify crop type information as an input to the model sims uses maximum crop height hmax values from table 12 of fao 56 allen et al 1998 and assumes that for annuals h starts at zero and increases linearly to a plateau of hmax at 0 7 fc eff generally regarded as effective full cover for vineyards and mature orchards h is set equal to hmax for orchards an immaturity correction is implemented when fc eff 0 5 and hmax is reduced by 1 m no immaturity correction is applied to vineyards where h is typically set by physical trellis configuration and young vineyards are thus considered to have the same height as mature vineyards for practical purposes once the kd values are determined sims follows the a p approach to calculate kcb values including application of fr to adjust for stomatal regulation for perennial tree and vine crops for details see melton et al 2020 sims calculates ndvi fc eff and kcb values for each satellite scene and the time interval is dependent on the satellite data inputs for the analysis described below data from landsat 7 and landsat 8 were used resulting in updated values for kcb as frequently as every eight days excepting cloud cover following quality assurance quality control qa qc procedures and screening for residual cloud cover kcb values were next linearly interpolated to daily kcb values daily grass reference evapotranspiration eto data were obtained from the california irrigation management information system cimis operated by cdwr eto data were ingested from spatial cimis which produces daily eto maps for california on a 2 km state wide grid hart et al 2009 as the final step daily sims crop et etc sims values are calculated following the fao56 approach combining the satellite derived kcb values with the eto data from spatial cimis etc sims represents et from a well watered crop with minimal soil evaporation and sets ks 1 and ke 0 in eq 11 11 etc sims kskcb ke eto in situations where soil evaporation and crop water stress must be considered sims output can be combined with a soil water balance model to facilitate calculation of ks and ke based on precipitation records and observed or simulated irrigation events melton et al 2020 for applications in other states in the u s sims integrates eto data from gridmet abatzoglou 2013 or etref data from agricultural weather station networks such as the u s bureau of reclamation usbr agrimet network nevada s nice net or oklahoma s mesonet for international applications sims can be combined with etref derived from agricultural weather stations or gridded meteorological fields from global weather models a full description of sims is available in melton et al 2012 2020 along with an extensive accuracy assessment of etc sims data relative to ground based measurements of et for a range of crops including both well watered and deficit irrigated crops since the analyses in this manuscript are primarily focused on kcb values we summarize results from the accuracy assessment for sites and date ranges that are primarily associated with the well watered conditions that are best represented by etc sims 6 2 accuracy assessment melton et al 2020 compared etc sims with ground based et datasets for 14 crop types under both well irrigated and deficit irrigated conditions across all crop types studied they found that sims seasonal total et estimates were within 15 mean absolute error mae relative to ground based et datasets collected in commercial agricultural fields use of a soil water balance model to correct for soil evaporation and crop water stress reduced this seasonal error to less than 10 mae on a daily time step mae was 0 4 to 1 0 mm d 1 for typically well watered crops including rice leaf lettuce broccoli and other field crops and 0 8 to 1 6 mm d 1 for deficit irrigated crops including wine grapes and cotton here we evaluate only the subset of the full dataset that can be considered to represent well watered conditions with a generally dry surface and limited soil evaporation we extracted the subset based on soil water potential measurements collected at each site and satellite derived fc eff data to limit the analysis to periods when conditions could be considered to be well watered and the crop canopy was established enough to limit soil evaporation relative to the overall et et ground based datasets were collected using both flux towers with micrometeorological instrumentation as well as sensor networks and instrumentation used to calculate a complete soil water balance the flux towers included in the study were instrumented to derive et either by the full eddy covariance ec method or as the residual of the energy balance reb the sites with full ec instrumentation included a peach site and a second wine grape site wine2 and details for these sites are described in semmens et al 2016 and anderson et al 2017 respectively instrumentation deployed at these sites included a 3d sonic anemometer co located with an open path gas analyzer a four component net radiometer soil heat flux plates coupled with thermocouples and humidity and temperature sensors the reb instrumentation deployed at the first wine grape site wine1 included a similar instrumentation package with the exception that it did not include an open path gas analyzer and calculated the latent energy flux as the residual of the energy balance following the approach described by linquist et al 2015 instrumentation was deployed at these sites to calculate a daily soil water balance and included flow meters to measure applied irrigation precipitation gauges to measure rainfall capacitance probes and capacitance frequency domain probes to measure volumetric water content dielectric water potential sensors to measure soil water potential and capillary lysimeters to measure drainage below the root zone for this analysis daily estimates of actual crop et were calculated from the micrometeorological instrumentation via energy balance calculations etc eb and were filtered to eliminate dates when fractional cover was low fc eff 25 and when soil water potential swp measured in the field with dielectric soil water potential instruments mps 2 meter group pullman wa usa was less than 100 kpa indicating sustained soil water deficits for annual crops the daily mae between etc sims and etc eb was 0 71 mm d 1 16 0 and the mean bias error mbe was 0 33 mm d 1 5 7 fig 21 in general there was a strong relationship between etc sims and etc eb r2 0 81 and the largest differences were associated with the rice crop and explained by flood irrigation events that substantially increased evaporation even with a well established canopy for the perennial crop sites evaluated mae was 0 67 mm d 1 21 7 mbe was 0 35 mm d 1 6 9 and r2 was 0 91 fig 22 while these data represent only eight of the hundreds of different crops grown in california the crops included in this analysis span a wide range of growth forms and include examples of flood sprinkler and drip irrigated crops overall the results demonstrate the utility of the a p approach to provide valuable information for irrigation scheduling and management that is representative of well watered conditions and provide an indication of the error that might be associated with use of kcb values derived from satellite data in combination with etref data provided by agricultural weather networks sims currently provides data for california via web based data services which provide capabilities for visualization of maps and time series as well as data retrieval via an application programming interface api sims is available as open source code and includes both a python implementation for use on local or cloud based computing resources and as an implementation on google s earth engine gorelick et al 2017 using the python api for earth engine the sims api is being used to integrate data from sims into other irrigation management software including irriquest johnson et al 2014 and cropmanage cahn et al 2014 integration of sims with these and other irrigation management software tools facilitates correction for soil evaporation and crop water stress via a soil water balance model and supports calculation of irrigation system operating times from et data these tools also provide the ability to maintain records and calculate on farm water use efficiency metrics demonstrating the value of satellite observations for a variety of on farm water management applications 7 conclusions and recommendations the crop coefficient methodology adopted and documented in fao56 is a successful and essential component for improved agricultural water management and particularly for promoting water savings and precision irrigation the methodology has been and continues to be widely used for vegetable field and fruit crops to determine crop water requirements assess irrigation needs and support irrigation scheduling and management throughout the world due to both its relative simplicity and robustness nevertheless the predictive estimation of kc and kcb can be challenging with the use of tabulated values for kc and kcb being the most common option used by practitioners however many cropped conditions can deviate from those represented by the standardized tabulated values due to different cropping or tree densities and agronomic practices research over the past 50 years has demonstrated for a variety of vegetable field and fruit crops that crop coefficients relate well with the leaf area index the fraction of ground cover fc the fraction of ground shaded by the canopy fshad and the fraction of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation fipar these relationships can be varied using factors that explain the variability of kc values obtained from crop et determined in field however they have not been generally used to predict kc or kcb these relationships reviewed in this study nevertheless provided for a first approach adopted in fao56 to estimate kc from the effective fc or lai and the crop height h through relating kcb mid with lai or fc through the kcb full i e the kcb during the mid season at peak plant height for vegetation having full ground cover or lai 3 the original kcb mid lai and kcb mid fc equations proposed in fao56 were aimed at estimating kcb mid for natural non typical or non pristine agricultural vegetation that were not included in the kc and kcb tables and thus were not focused on the common agricultural crops a resistance correction factor fr was proposed in fao56 to consider the effects of stomatal control by the vegetation under study that methodology has received limited adoption despite research that has proven that strong relations exist between kc or kcb with fc or lai especially for tree and vine crops therefore that fao56 approach was upgraded with the a p approach allen and pereira 2009 through the development of a more visual density coefficient kd computed either from fc and h or from lai and by adopting specific equations for crop coefficients for orchards and vineyards including consideration of active ground cover the review provided here has shown good acceptance of the approach by the research community therefore it is opportune to test and summarize the approach for a variety of vegetable field and forage crops as well as orchards and vineyards with a focus on the parameterization of the a p equations results comparing the a p predicted kcb kcb a p with kcb values obtained from field measurements reveal coefficients of regression close to 1 0 indicating that kcb a p values are statistically close to those obtained from field data and with rmse generally smaller than 10 of kcb often not exceeding 5 the accurate results obtained allow us to conclude that the a p approach is appropriate to use for estimating crop coefficients from observed crop characteristics like fc and h a recently proposed modification of the stomatal resistance adjustment parameter fr for apple orchards mobe et al 2020 opens a new area of research for orchards when leaf resistances are observed observing crop heights is easy but determining average fc in the field over large areas can be challenging and requires appropriate methods different approaches are reviewed herein and particular attention is paid to determining fc from remote sensing in line with this a summary of results from the application of the satellite irrigation management support sims system are analyzed the accuracy of estimating daily crop et obtained with the a p approach when fc is derived from time series of satellite measurements of ndvi etc sims was compared with daily et determined from ground based energy balance measurements etc eb for annual crops the daily mean absolute error between etc sims and etc eb was mae 0 71 mm d 1 16 0 and the mean bias error mbe was small representing 5 7 the largest differences were associated with a rice crop likely due to flood irrigation events that substantially increased evaporation even with a well established canopy plus impacts of exposed water on the ndvi signal for perennial crops mae was also small 0 67 mm d 1 however larger in relative terms 21 7 while mbe represented only 6 9 while the field data included in the analysis only address a small fraction of the hundreds of different crops grown in california the crops included in the analysis span a wide range of growth forms and irrigation methods overall the results demonstrate the utility of the a p approach to provide valuable information for irrigation scheduling and management that is representative of well watered conditions research on both lines needs to be continued to support both ground and satellite based applications in irrigation scheduling and management namely to support users in parameterizing the a p approach with easy to obtain information with this objective a companion paper pereira et al 2020a tabulates kcb for vegetable and field crops based on related literature reviews pereira et al 2020b c and tabulates kcb for orchards and vineyards using satellite sims data and reviewed ground crop data it is our overall goal that the use of the a p approach can

10484,the current study aims at reviewing and providing advances on methods for estimating and applying crop coefficients from observations of ground cover and vegetation height the review first focuses on the relationships between single kc and basal kcb and various parameters including the fraction of ground covered by the canopy fc the leaf area index lai the fraction of ground shaded by the canopy fshad the fraction of intercepted light flight and intercepted photosynthetic active radiation fipar these relationships were first studied in the 1970 s for annual crops and later in the last decennia for tree and vine perennials research has now provided a variety of methods to observe and measure fc and height h using both ground and remote sensing tools which has favored the further development of kc related functions in the past these relationships were not used predictively but to support the understanding of dynamics of kc and kcb in relation to the processes of evapotranspiration or transpiration inclusive of the role of soil evaporation later the approach proposed by allen and pereira 2009 the a p approach used fc and height h or lai data to define a crop density coefficient that was used to directly estimate kc and kcb values for a variety of annual and perennial crops in both research and practice it is opportune to review the a p method in the context of a variety of studies that have derived kc and kcb values from field measured data with simultaneously observed ground cover fc and height applications used to test the approach include various tree and vine crops olive pear and lemon orchards and vineyards vegetable crops pea onion and tomato crops field crops barley wheat maize sunflower canola cotton and soybean crops as well as a grassland and a bermudagrass pasture comparisons of kcb values computed with the a p method produced regression coefficients close to 1 0 and coefficients of determination 0 90 except for orchards results indicate that the a p approach can produce estimates of potential kcb using vegetation characteristics alone within reasonable or acceptable error and are useful for refining kcb for conditions of plant spacing size and density that differ from standard values the comparisons provide parameters appropriate to applications for the tested crops in addition the a p approach was applied with remotely sensed fc data for a variety of crops in california using the satellite irrigation management support sims framework daily sims crop et etc sims produced kcb values using the fao56 and a p approaches combination of satellite derived fc and kcb values with eto data from spatial cimis california irrigation management information system produced et estimates that were compared with daily actual crop et derived from energy balance calculations from micrometeorological instrumentation etc eb results produced coefficients of regression of 1 05 for field crops and 1 08 for woody crops and r2 values of 0 81 and 0 91 respectively these values suggest that daily etc sims based et can be accurately estimated within reasonable error and that the a p approach is appropriate to support that estimation it is likely that accuracy can be improved via progress in remote sensing determination of fc tabulated kcb results and calculation parameters are presented in a companion paper in this special issue keywords basal crop coefficients kcb under full cover density coefficient fc from ground observations fc from ndvi estimates of kcb for trees and annual crops operational kcb from fc with sims framework 1 introduction over many years studies have aimed at deriving crop coefficients from assessments of the relationships between a single kc or basal kcb and a variety of vegetation parameters including the fraction of ground covered by the canopy fc the leaf area index lai the fraction of ground shaded by the canopy fshad the fraction of intercepted light flight and intercepted photosynthetic active radiation fipar other crop canopy characteristics such as crop height h or tree crop size have been considered applications include a relatively large number of field and tree crops beginning nearly 50 years ago while studies relative to vines and trees are more recent only 20 years ago the relation of relative et kc or kcb with amount of vegetation has an obvious and physical basis where more plant leaf surface area means more total bulk stomatal surface and conductance and more opportunity for diffusion of water vapor from leaves as transpiration monteith 1965 1981 similarly more ground cover or leaf area by vegetation means more surface area for absorption of solar photons and subsequent conversion of that energy into et therefore given similar stomatal conductance and leaf and canopy architectural properties one might expect to see under adequate soil moisture conditions the relative et from a vegetated area to increase with increasing ground cover or leaf area monteith 1981 energy constraints create an upper limit on total relative et with increasing leaf area beyond some limit often regarded to be approximately lai 3 ritchie 1972 with an asymptotic relationship between kcb and lai as lai approaches or exceeds 3 and extending to about lai 6 tanner and jury 1976 the fraction of ground covered by the canopy on the other hand tends to have a more linear relationship with relative et due to a more direct proportional relationship between interception of solar photon flux by the canopy and its conversion to transpiration williams and ayars 2005 lópez urrea et al 2014 as described in the following sections fao56 allen et al 1998 introduced a standardized approach to relate the basal kc during the midseason period kcb mid to lai or fc using a kcb value representing kcb under conditions of full cover kcb full represented by lai 3 the proposed kcb mid lai and kcb mid fc equations were aimed at estimating kcb mid for natural non typical or non pristine agricultural vegetation not included in the standardized tables and were not directed toward applications for common agricultural crops kcb end was estimated by scaling the kcb mid equations according to conditions at the end of the season and the length of the late season a resistance correction factor fr was proposed for the lai and fc based equations to take into consideration stomatal control by vegetation in the fao56 approach estimates for kcb full were targeted toward non pristine agricultural crops based on fao56 tabulated kcb mid values for a considered crop after adjustment for climate relative to the standard sub humid and calm conditions rhmin 45 and u2 2 m s 1 a second estimate for kcb full was directed to natural vegetation non full cover crops or crops not listed in fao56 it utilized the kcb mid for full cover vegetation lai 3 and was estimated as a function of the mean maximum crop height kcb h 1 0 1 h where kcb h was limited to 1 2 the proposed upper limit for kcb for tall vegetation having full ground cover with lai 3 kcb h should also be adjusted for climate the use of the kcb mid fc equation was directed toward trees and shrubs however the use of kcb full estimated from kcb h reveals that it may be applicable to a wide range of conditions for agricultural crops particularly to orchards and vineyards where large ranges in fc and h exist and large ranges in kcb mid occur therefore allen and pereira 2009 extended the application of the fao56 equations through the development of a density coefficient kd computed either from fc and h or from lai that approach referred herein as a p approach included specific equations for kc and kcb for orchards and vineyards that considered the amount of active ground cover their article included the tabulation of parameters for a variety of crops as well as tabulated kc and kcb values for orchards and vineyards that considered a range of crop densities or age and the presence or absence of active ground cover this current study provides an important opportunity to review and revise related applications and concepts the objectives of this article consist of a reviewing and revising the use of kc and kcb relations with fc lai and other indicators of canopy light and energy interception b reviewing approaches relative to deriving fc from field and remote sensing observations c testing applications of the a p approach to compute kcb against model derived kcb and d parameterization of a p equations for field and tree crops tabulated values for kcb estimated with the a p equations are presented in a companion paper pereira et al 2020c this special issue section 2 reviews studies on relationships between kc or kcb and lai fc or other fractions of canopy light or radiation interception by field and vegetable crops and tree and vine crops the derivation of fc from field observations and remote sensing are briefly dealt with in section 3 an update of the a p approach to compute kc and kcb is described in section 4 the test of a p equations for various field vegetable tree and vine crops is presented in section 5 while section 6 discusses the application of the a p approach in the satellite irrigation management support framework to predict daily crop et section 7 provides advice and recommendations for users 2 review of relationships between crop coefficients and the fraction of ground cover or leaf area index 2 1 field and vegetable crops ritchie and burnett 1971 introduced the use of the ratio ep eo representing plant evaporation ep to potential evaporation eo which corresponds to the currently used kcb or transpiration coefficient and developed power relationships with lai and fc for both cotton and grain sorghum based upon two years of observations in their pioneering work data relative to both crops and both experimental years were fitted by the same curve in a later pioneering study al khafaf et al 1978 used two years of experiments with cotton and sorghum and found an exponential relationship between the ep eo ratio and lai as with the study of ritchie and burnett 1971 all data were fitted to the same equation in contrast tanner and jury 1976 did not use an ep eo ratio but demonstrated that actual et and t of a potato crop observed in a lysimeter were closely related to lai al kaisi et al 1989 obtained non linear relationships between maize kc and lai using treatments that allowed detection of the role of soil evaporation thus providing for a distinction between kc and kcb as later defined villalobos and fereres 1990 fit an exponential curve to the kcb lai data for three crops corn cotton and sunflower medeiros et al 2001 reported a third degree polynomial relationship between kcb and lai for beans however in a later study medeiros et al 2016 a quadratic equation was fitted to relate kcb with lai studies by duchemin et al 2006 using remote sensing have shown that the kc lai relationship for wheat could fit a unique exponential curve over 13 fields and three years of observations however with large dispersion along the fitted curve jiang et al 2014 reported that kc and kcb could be related with lai using exponential relationships for maize seeded at various densities that produced diverse lai throughout the growing season common to the above referred studies are the non linear relationships between lai and kc or kcb in contrast borges et al 2015 used the bowen ratio energy balance breb to derive kcb for melon and found a linear relation with lai ritchie and burnett 1971 also studied the relationship between the ratio ep eo and the fractional ground cover or fc non linear relationships were found which were different for sorghum in two experimental years since different row spacings were used later grattan et al 1998 developed non linear relationships between ground cover and crop coefficients for vegetable and row crops in california using the breb method to determine crop et crops studied included artichoke pinto beans broccoli lettuce melon onion and strawberry those authors concluded that kc changed as a quadratic function of the percentage ground cover or fc but linear fits were observed for data collected before midseason similarly using weighing lysimeters bryla et al 2010 found that quadratic equations could describe the relationships between kcb and fc for broccoli lettuce bell pepper and garlic graphical results of both studies evaluated and reported in allen and pereira 2009 suggest that linear relationships may accurately describe kcb fc relations before maximum vegetation development medeiros et al 2001 reported third degree polynomials relating kcb to fc for beans using remote sensing observations heilman et al 1982 found a linear relationship between kc and fc for four alfalfa plots later lópez urrea et al 2009a derived a linear equation relating onion kcb and fc with data obtained with a weighing lysimeter similarly lópez urrea et al 2009b reported a linear relationship between spring wheat kc and fc lópez urrea et al 2014 fit linear equations to kcb fc relationships for sunflower using lysimeter data however with different slopes of regression lines for each of two years of data a linear relationship between kc and fc was reported by zhang et al 2015 for sugarcane during the crop development stage with fc obtained from ndvi lozano et al 2016 reported a linear relationship between kc and fc for strawberries and lópez urrea et al 2016 found good linear relationship between kcb and fc values for two years of biomass sorghum data observed in lysimeters in addition these authors reported an excellent agreement between normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and both kcb and fc finally trout and dejonge 2018 reported a linear relationship between maize fc and kcb relative to alfalfa reference et for fc 0 80 and that linearity was not preserved beyond that threshold those authors assumed that this break in the linearity of kcb fc was caused by maize tasseling the above review shows that relationships between kc or kcb and fc are in general non linear relative to the full crop season of field and vegetable crops but may be linear during vegetation development that non linearity likely led to the adoption in fao aquacrop of a model adjusted fc which is multiplied by kcb max to obtain actual kcb and therefore to estimate actual transpiration raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 however this concept applies only for cases of full canopy cover for field and vegetable crops in contrast evidence for relationships between kc and or kcb and lai or fc led allen et al 1998 to adopt in fao56 predictive equations for kc and kcb from lai and fc which were later improved upon by allen and pereira 2009 2 2 tree and vine crops studies on tree and vine crops were developed later than those for annual crops the first study relating kc with mid day light intercepted by the canopy flight which is a good estimator of fc was reported by johnson et al 2000 for mature peach trees which was followed by ayars et al 2003 a linear relationship was found in these studies later for thompson seedless grapevine williams and ayars 2005 also found a linear relationship between kc and the fraction of area shaded fshad again a good estimator of fc goodwin et al 2003 2006 reported a strong linear relationship between kcb and fc and effective area of shade for peaches where fc was estimated using a combination of digital photographs of the tree taken from the direction of the sun and the fraction of par intercepted on the soil surface within the area of shade cast by the tree lópez urrea et al 2012 reported good linear regressions relating kcb and fc observed in a weighing lysimeter for a tempranillo vineyard over a three year period the authors fit three equations to the three years but a single equation could be adopted using all data however with a smaller coefficient of determination later montoro et al 2016 showed that fitted linear kcb fc relationships were different for irrigated and non irrigated conditions which likely caused reduced kcb act when vines were not irrigated also for a tempranillo vineyard picón toro et al 2012 found linear relationships between kcb and lai fipar and fc over a total of 5 years of data ferreira et al 2012 studied five vineyards in different locations using eddy covariance and adopted linear relationships for the kcb max lai and kcb max fc relations in contrast zhao et al 2018 found a non linear relationship between kcb and lai for a vineyard with different curves for all the years of experimentation following the tree kc flight studies referenced above research relative to tree crops has tested various indicators of canopy characteristics girona et al 2011 for a five year experiment with apple cv golden smoothee and pear cv conference reported that kc observed in large weighing lysimeters varied exponentially with fipar observed at noon responses of both tree crops were however different while all apple data fit the same curve well regardless of the year different equations were required to fit the pear data from different years depending on the tree age those authors hypothesized that this different behavior may be related to differences in the canopy properties between the two tree crops with pear canopies having higher porosity than apple canopies thus higher light penetration while apple canopies were denser and taller in addition the authors concluded that midday light interception did not adequately account for differences in kc across both species auzmendi et al 2011 reported that the relationships between actual transpiration tc act and fipar for apples were linear and observed that pre harvest and post harvest data behaved differently likely because the latter consisted of smaller tc act and fipar values marsal et al 2013 developed different canopy characteristics for apple trees based on plant height h and width w the ratio h w designated slenderness and the difference lai h w called leaf overlapping they used these indicators to characterize the canopy porosity of apple trees and to model kc mid variability a different canopy indicator was used by gonzález talice et al 2012 who reported linear relationships between tree cross sectional area tcsa and kcb tcsa was used as an indicator of ground cover shaded area moreover these authors found that linear regressions for tcsa kcb were similar for galaxy and fuji varieties but both differed from the equation used to fit granny smith data relationships between kc fc for trees and vines were developed only relatively recently for pecans and using remote sensing data over a number of cropped fields in new mexico samani et al 2011 found a linear relationship between the ratio kc kc ref and fc where kc ref was the kc measured for a mature pecan orchard with fc 80 that linear relationship proved acceptable for a pecan orchard in south africa ibraimo et al 2016 but those authors concluded that pecans did not show a linear relationship between kc and midday fipar and it was not possible to use the relationship proposed by samani et al 2011 predictively espadafor et al 2015 used four years of lysimeter observations in a young almond tree orchard where fc increased from 3 to 48 to assess the time evolution of the ratios kcb fipar and kcb fc over the last two years they found nearly constant ratios through time but no curve fittings were performed lately lópez lópez et al 2018 assessed the behavior of the ratio kcb fc for almonds but did not fit any equation to the relationships between variables however values for that ratio differed when computed from lysimeter or from field water balance the above review shows that relationships between kc or kcb and fc or lai for trees and vine crops contrary to field and vegetable crops are only recently studied and that different indicators of canopy interception of radiation have been used generally predictive kc and kcb equations proposed in fao56 using fc or lai data were assumed to be applicable to trees and vines allen and pereira 2009 developed predictive equations for kc and kcb from lai and fc focusing on trees and vines as analyzed further in this article 2 3 crop coefficients from ground cover and height the fao56 kcb mid lai and kcb mid fc relationships described above may be used predictively after estimating kcb full adjusting for climate conditions and considering the use of the resistance correction factor fr when the crop exhibits more stomatal control than standard agricultural crops conversely the simple fao56 relations of kc or kcb with fc lai fshad or fipar were generally not developed to be used predictively but rather mainly to discuss the behavior and suitability of derived kc and kcb values to expand the predictability of those fao56 equations allen and pereira 2009 developed the a p approach as a refinement and upgrade of the referred fao56 equations a coefficient of density kd from either lai or fc and h was defined to promote standardization and visual reproducibility parameter values were proposed and new kc and kcb values for various crops and crop densities mainly for tree and vine crops were considered tabulated kc and kcb values using the a p approach for various crops primarily for trees and vines having diverse crop densities and heights were later provided by jensen and allen 2016 more recently johnson and melton 2017 revised the application of the a p approach and proposed updated parameters for a wide panoply of field vegetable and fruit woody crops of california the approach is gaining usage by many researchers however often with limited information regarding the applications numerous a p applications have used the dual kc water balance model simdualkc because the approach is incorporated into the model rosa et al 2012a b and is used to adjust kcb values according to observed or simulated fc and h values examples include field research applications to tree and vine crops including peach paço et al 2012 olives paço et al 2014 2019 vineyards fandiño et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 as well as to field crops including soybeans wei et al 2015 and bermudagrass paredes et al 2018 miao et al 2016 used the a p approach to develop a procedure to compute kcb for relay intercrops and rosa et al 2016 developed a et kcb computational application for saline conditions related results from these applications are analyzed in section 5 other a p applications included estimation and analysis of kcb for olives conceição et al 2017 puppo et al 2019 citrus taylor et al 2015 and maize ding et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 and zheng et al 2013 applied the a p approach to estimate the kc of tomato cropped in both a greenhouse and open field pôças et al 2015 used the a p approach to validate computations of kcb for maize barley and olives using remote sensing rs vegetation indices ndvi and savi soil adjusted vegetation index and santos et al 2012 used that approach to parameterize the rs model metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration all applications produced relatively good accuracy for estimates of kcb values 3 determining the fraction of ground cover the observation of fc involves some complexity however depending upon the desired accuracy adams et al 1976 described an early description of a method for field determination of the fraction of ground cover or the fraction of ground shaded by the canopy in row crops as it is referred to in their study it refers to the use of a meter stick on the soil surface adjacent to plants and parallel to the row later adams and arkin 1977 compared various methods to determine ground cover and concluded that the meter stick method is as accurate faster simpler and more economical than the other methods used they reported that there were no significant differences in measurement results using the meter stick method overhead photographs spatial quantum sensor or traversing quantum cell cihlar et al 1987 developed a methodology for estimating green plant cover based on a supervised classification technique of digital photographic images using a maximum probability algorithm with the purpose of assigning the current classes of green vegetation in the image the use of overhead photographs has continued with improved equipment and varied sophistications in separating canopy cover from background goodwin et al 2006 reported the estimation of fc using a combination of digital photographs of the tree taken from the direction of the sun and the fraction of par intercepted on the soil surface within the area of shade cast by the tree er raki et al 2007 reported on the use a hemispherical canopy photo apparatus equipped with a fisheye lens to take photos above a wheat canopy hunsaker et al 2013 reported on the use of a digital camera mounted on a hand held aluminum pole to allow nadir views and trout and dejonge 2018 reported the use of a digital camera from a nadir view 6 m above the ground surface the main advances have come from the differentiation of digital image pixels relative to the plant canopy and background soil surface residue and senesced leaves particularly when digital images are used a different approach was used by martinez cob et al 2014 who reported on the use of pyranometers for estimation of fc at remote sites while adopting photographical techniques for in situ observation the main issues consist of taking the images near noon under a near nadir condition however the use of digital images of trees to obtain various canopy features has different requirements as described by espadafor et al 2015 duan et al 2017 compared fc estimates from experimental plots cropped with cotton sorghum and sugarcane with images and ortho mosaics captured by a low altitude uav the authors reported good agreement between ground cover estimates from ortho mosaic and images when the target was positioned at a near nadir view at the centre of the image the use of a digital camera from directly overhead of the canopy and image analysis to calculate the ratio of green leaf pixel to the whole photograph was also reported by fan et al 2017 also recently reported was the precise detection of fc for a lettuce crop using digital photography which allows measurement of the diameter of the plants with help of appropriate software namely relative to color selection fernández pacheco et al 2014 hernández hernández et al 2016 2017 a web application was developed by gonzález esquiva et al 2017 an application to diverse crops is reported by zhang et al 2018 who used nine color vegetation indices calculated from time series of digital photographs to develop an fc estimation model applicable to sugarcane maize cotton and paddy rice currently fc is commonly obtained from remote sensing trout et al 2008 produced diverse advances in remote sensing of fc namely using ndvi from landsat 5 after establishing a linear relationship between ndvi and fc for a variety of crops later among others lópez urrea et al 2009b 2016 johnson and trout 2012 campos et al 2014 pôças et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 and de la casa et al 2018 reported on the relationships between fc and various vegetation indices mainly ndvi and savi imukova et al 2015 used high resolution rapideye satellite images to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of the green vegetation fraction of croplands 4 predicting kcb from fraction of ground cover and height using a density coefficient 4 1 background concepts the two step crop coefficient reference et method kc x eto has been a successful and dependable means to estimate crop evapotranspiration etc and crop water requirements since the early 1970 s doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 the method uses weather data to estimate the grass reference eto and multiplies it by a crop coefficient kc that represents the relative rate of evapotranspiration from a specific crop and condition to that of the reference crop etc eto the reference condition is et from a clipped cool season well watered grass eto and represents a near maximum rate of et that varies with weather conditions the calculation of eto has been standardized by fao allen et al 1998 2006 followed by the american society of civil engineers asce ewri 2005 jensen and allen 2016 the kc eto approach provides a simple convenient and reproducible way to estimate et from a variety of crops and climatic conditions allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 2015 crop coefficient curves have been developed and were reported for a wide range of agricultural crops in fao56 allen et al 1998 2007 and their standardized values are currently updated for vegetable and field crops pereira et al 2020a b this special issue the standardized kc is regarded as generally transferable among regions and climates under the assumption that the eto accounts for nearly all variation caused by weather and climate and the kc represents the relative fraction of eto that is governed by amount type and condition of vegetation when cropped under standard pristine conditions under most conditions kc values can be quite accurately estimated through their relations with the fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation as discussed in previous sections the height of the vegetation and the amount of stomatal regulation under moist soil conditions as proposed by allen et al 1998 and detailed in the allen and pereira 2009 a p approach the value for kc for conditions of water and or salinity stress is generally determined by reducing the kc estimate via a stress coefficient ks using a daily soil water balance swb model e g the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a b and partitioning the kc into transpiration and evaporation components adopting the dual kc approach kc is defined as 1 k c k s k c b k e where kcb is the basal crop coefficient representing the ratio between crop transpiration and eto ke is the soil evaporation coefficient representing the ratio between soil evaporation and eto and ks is a dimensionless stress coefficient whose value is dependent on available soil water and soil and crop salinity related characteristics allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 the value for ks is 1 unless available soil water and or salinity limits transpiration in which case ks 1 estimation of ke for bare soil conditions is described in allen et al 1998 2005b and allen 2011 fig 1 shows the fao segmented approach to describe the kc curves where the continuous seasonal curve is broken into four linear segments representing the initial development midseason and late season periods doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 2005a the advantage of the fao kc curve is that only three key values for kc need to be determined kc ini during the initial period kc mid during the midseason period and kc end at the end if the late season period the fao procedure for standard kc values refers to mean standardized daily minimum relative humidity rhmin 45 and mean wind speed at 2 m u2 2 m s 1 for climates with rhmin and u2 differing from those values the standardized kc values tabulated in fao 56 or updated in pereira et al 2020a b this special issue are adjusted for all kc mid and kcb mid as well as for kc end and kcb end larger than 0 45 as 2 k c m i d e n d k c m i d e n d t a b l e 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where kc mid end table is the value for kc mid kcb mid kc end or kcb end for the above referred standard climate and h is the mean maximum plant height m during the midseason period or full cover period eq 2 is valid for h up to 20 m allen et al 1998 2005a when the crop dries in field kc end 0 45 the adjustment by eq 2 is not required the values for rhmin u2 and h need only to be approximate values averaged over the mid season and late season periods eq 2 helps to account for increases in maximum expected et rates limited by environmental energy relative to the grass based reference eto the increases are strongest for tall vegetation that can have greater aerodynamic roughness and leaf area as compared to the clipped grass reference 4 2 estimating kc curves from fraction of ground cover for expanses of vegetation large enough that an equilibrium boundary is established so that general one dimensional equations such as the penman monteith apply a maximum upper limit on et is established due to the law of conservation of energy therefore for large expanses of vegetation larger than about 500 to 2000 m2 the kc development process has upper limits for kc of 1 2 1 3 for the grass reference however as discussed by allen et al 2011 and pereira et al 2020a b this special issue under conditions of clothesline effects where vegetation height exceeds that of the surroundings or oasis effects where vegetation has higher soil water availability than the surroundings peak kc may exceed those limits caution is required when extrapolating et measurements from small vegetation plots to large stands or regions because overestimation of et may occur an upper energy constrained limit on kc termed kc max is defined as the maximum value for kc following rain or irrigation and is governed by the amount of energy available for evaporation of water the kc max varies with general climate ranging from about 1 05 1 30 allen et al 1998 2005a 3 k c m a x m a x 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 k c b t a b l e 0 05 where u2 and rhmin are averaged daily u2 and rhmin values during the growth period kcb table is the value for kcb for the standardized climate and h is the mean plant height m during the period of calculation initial development midseason or late season following the a p approach the basal kcb because it represents mostly transpiration depends upon the amount of vegetation and can be expressed as a function of a density coefficient kd as 4 k c b k c m i n k d k c b f u l l k c m i n where kcb is the approximation for kcb for vegetation structure and extent represented by the density coefficient kd defined hereafter kcb fullis the estimated basal kc at peak plant growth under conditions having nearly full ground cover or lai 3 and kc min is the minimum basal kc for bare soil 0 15 under typical agricultural conditions where some subsurface soil moisture exists for tree crops having grass or other ground cover eq 4 takes a different form that considers transpiration by the active ground cover thus 5 k c b k c b c o v e r k d m a x k c b f u l l k c b c o v e r k c b f u l l k c b c o v e r 2 where kcb cover is the kcb of the active ground cover in the absence of tree foliage the second term of the max function reduces the estimate for kcb mid by half the difference kcb full kc cover when this difference is negative this accounts for impacts of shading by vegetation when kcb kcb cover due to larger stomatal conductance of the ground cover eq 5 applies to estimate kcb during any period as described by allen and pereira 2009 the approach of eq 5 can be similarly applied to estimate a single kc coefficient kcb full can be approximated as a function of mean plant height and adjusted for climate following allen et al 1998 6 k c b f u l l f r m i n 1 0 k h h 1 20 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where h u2 and rhmin were defined previously but herein referring to the mid season the value for kcb full represents a general upper limit on kcb mid for vegetation having full ground cover and lai 3 under full water supply eq 6 suggests that an upper bound for kcb full is 1 20 plus adjustment for nonstandard climate effects of crop height are considered through the sum 1 kh h with kh 0 1 for tree and vine crops as well as tall field crops and kh 0 2 for short crops and vegetables as described in following sections eq 6 produces increases in kcb full with plant height and more arid climate the parameter fr applies a downward adjustment fr 1 0 if the vegetation exhibits more stomatal control on transpiration than is typical of most annual agricultural crops examples are provided in the following sections adopting the allen et al 1998 calculation procedure for fr it is assumed 7 f r δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 r l 100 where rl is mean leaf resistance for the vegetation in question s m 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure vs air temperature curve kpa oc 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa oc 1 both relative to the period when kcb full is computed this factor fr is multiplied against the estimate for kcb full in eq 6 to adjust its value which is particularly important in the case of perennials and the late season the standard value for fr is 1 0 because for most annual agricultural crops rl is often approximately 100 s m 1 values for rl for many agricultural and non agricultural plants can be found in allen et al 1996 and pereira and alves 2013 the value for rl is limited to 100 s m 1 the density coefficient kd used in eq 4 describes the increase in kcb with increase in amount of vegetation as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 where lai can be observed or estimated kd can be approximated under normal conditions as 8 k d 1 e 0 7 l a i where lai is defined as the area of leaves per area of ground surface averaged over a large area m2 m 2 with consideration of only one side of green healthy leaves active in vapor transfer where estimates of the fraction of ground surface covered by vegetation fc are available the kd is estimated as 9 k d m i n 1 m l f c e f f f c e f f 1 1 h where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation 0 01 1 near solar noon ml is a multiplier on fc eff describing the effect of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative et per fraction of ground shaded 1 0 2 0 and h is the mean height of the vegetation m fc eff is often observed as the shaded area near noon between 11 00 and 15 00 as reported in section 3 estimation of fc eff for row crops was described by allen et al 1998 an estimation for trees was provided by allen and pereira 2009 fc eff is often determined from visual inspection the ml multiplier on fc eff in eq 9 imposes an upper limit on the relative magnitude of transpiration per unit of ground area as represented by fc eff allen et al 1998 and is expected to mostly range from 1 5 to 2 0 depending on the canopy density and thickness ml is an attempt to simulate the upper physical limits on transpiration imposed by water flux through the plant root stem and leaf systems ml may have a low value when the canopy porosity is high the value for ml can be modified to fit the specific vegetation and experimental data 5 validation of kcb prediction from fraction of ground cover and height using ground observations the objective of this section is to demonstrate the application and ability of the a p approach to reproduce standard and measured kcb for a variety of trees and vines and vegetable and field crops the standard kcb used herein were derived from actual crop evapotranspiration data obtained through soil water balance procedures based upon accurate soil moisture measurements as well as by sap flow and eddy covariance measurements whose data were ingested into the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a the linearly segmented kcb curves were then computed through the calibration and validation of the model rosa et al 2012b using the observed soil water content or the observed transpiration with sap flow devices or the crop et measured with eddy covariance instrumentation the kcb values obtained through the calibration procedures are referred hereafter as kcb simdualkc kcb values reported here were also obtained from crop et accurately measured with large size weighing lysimeters located in the middle of large fields cultivated with the same crop and techniques used in the lysimeters lópez urrea et al 2016 these kcb values are named herein as kcb lysimeter et measurements and the kcb derivation procedures are described in the publications cited for each crop parameters in the a p functions were determined using a simplified trial and error procedure such that kcb a p approximate the kcb simdualkc or kcb lysimeter during various stages for each crop only the case study of section 5 6 fit a p parameters directly to experimental data ranges of values found for parameters give indication of values for parameters to be expected in practice these ranges in the case of trees and vines refer to variation in fc and h following pruning and natural plant growth during a stage in the case of vegetable and field crops refer to crop growth during a stage and later to senescence and for grasses and pasture refer to cuttings and regrowth 5 1 trees and vines 5 1 1 olive data were provided from field research reported by paço et al 2019 which was performed during 2011 2013 in a 78 ha super intensive olive orchard located at viana do alentejo southern portugal fc values used with the a p approach were obtained through field observations or using remote sensing pôças et al 2015 kcb simdualkc values were derived from the calibration and validation of the simdualkc model using sap flow transpiration measurements further validation was performed using eddy covariance measurements of etc act a value of ml 1 5 was used in eq 9 and kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 table 1 provides the ranges of values for the terms of the a p approach computed using observed data ranges are related with fc changes due to pruning and related responses of trees exacerbated by heavy pruning following exceptional frosts fr values were estimated after those tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 fig 2 shows the kcb a p estimated values compared with the kcb simdualkc values resulting from field observations during three growing seasons the regression forced through the origin fto produced a regression slope of b0 1 00 fig 3 thus there were no over or under estimation trends 5 1 2 peach in a study performed during 1998 and 1999 seasons in a commercial orchard located at atalaia montijo southern portugal paço et al 2012 measured peach transpiration using sap flow tc act along with et measurements of eddy covariance etec one year of tc act measurements was used to calibrate the simdualkc model and the other was used for model validation along with the etec measurements in this study only one value for fc eff 0 30 was measured during the mid season considering ml 1 4 kh 0 1 and fr 1 the calculated kd was 0 41 when kcb full was 1 17 thus resulting in kcb a p 0 51 which compared well with the field derived kcb simdualkc 0 50 5 1 3 pear a study was performed during two seasons 2013 and 2014 in a 50 ha commercial rocha pear orchard located in torres vedras western portugal rosa 2019 spatially distributed soil water measurements were accurately performed with fdr devices other measurements included the water table depth fc eff values were obtained from intercepted photosynthetically active radiation fipar measured with accupar lp 80 decagon devices usa all measurements were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model and therefore to derive the kcb simdualkc fig 4 in the a p approach ml 1 5 was used and kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 table 2 provides ranges for terms of the a p approach computed using observed fc eff and h fr values were estimated following allen and pereira 2009 the fto regression fig 4 produced b0 0 98 indicating a slight under estimation tendency by the kcb a p 5 1 4 lemon a study was performed on lemons during two growing seasons 2013 and 2014 in a 5 ha fully established lemon orchard rosa 2019 located in mafra near the west coast of portugal as per the study on pear soil water content was performed with fdr instrumentation at representative locations within the orchard fc eff was obtained from fipar measurements the soil moisture based et data were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model and therefore to derive kcb fig 5 in the a p approach ml 1 2 was used and kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 table 3 provides ranges for the terms in the a p approach computed using observed fc eff and h fr values were estimated after those tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 the fto regression fig 5 produced b0 1 03 thus a slight over estimation tendency for the kcb a p 5 1 5 wine grapes 5 1 5 1 vineyards with bare soil data were collected during two seasons for mature tempranillo wine grapes and reported by lópez urrea et al 2012 the water use of two grapevines was measured with a monolithic large weighing lysimeter installed in the center of a 1 ha plot surrounded by a drip irrigated vineyard of about 5 ha etc values were calculated as the difference between lysimeter mass losses from evaporation and or transpiration divided by the lysimeter area 9 0 m2 the lysimeter container is 3 m 3 m square and 1 7 m deep the lysimeter soil containing tank sits on a system of beams and a counterbalances that offsets the dead weight of the soil and the tank and reduces the load on the weigh beam by 1 000 1 the lysimeter mass resolution was 0 01 mm and its accuracy was greater than 0 03 mm equivalent water depth two vines were planted in the lysimeter each one occupying 4 5 m2 i e the same as the vines outside the lysimeter thus allowing for representative measurements of vineyard etc efforts were made to keep the vines inside the lysimeter growing at the same rate as the crop outside to minimize edge effects the basal crop coefficient kcb was obtained from the lysimeter kc values minus the calculated ke values using the fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 additional information about the lysimeter facility and the technical features of the lysimeter may be found in lópez urrea et al 2012 in the a p approach ml varied among the different stages with ml values of 1 1 1 3 and 1 8 used respectively for the initial development and mid season kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 table 4 provides for the terms of the a p approach computed using fc and h observations fr values were estimated after those tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 the regression forced through the origin fig 6 produced b0 0 99 thus no under or over estimation tendency for the kcb a p values 5 1 5 2 vineyards with active ground cover three examples are provided in this section first an albariño vineyard with permanent active ground cover at pontevedra spain and then two vineyards with the cv godello and mencía at valdeorras and ribeira sacra respectively galicia spain having active ground cover which transformed into mulch during the growing season two different trellis systems were utilized in the three examples in all cases etc act was determined with a swb and the soil water content was monitored with tdr these data were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model thus to derive kcb for the three vineyards the first example includes data for fc and h data for mature albariño wine grapes semi trellis system which were reported by fandiño et al 2012 fc and h values were measured during five growing seasons with unpublished data from 2011 and 2012 seasons an active ground cover was maintained in the inter row area consisting of natural herbaceous vegetation for active ground cover characterization observations were performed during the crop season including its density height h cover and fraction of green active ground cover fc cover these characteristics changed throughout the season due to various cultivation practices mainly mowing and application of herbicides along the vine row an adjustment to the measured fc was applied to determine fc eff effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation using the equations proposed by rosa et al 2012a a complete description of observations measurements the swb approach and the derivation of kcb simdualkc is provided by fandiño et al 2012 in the a p approach ml 1 5 was used kcb full was computed with eq 6 and kcb a p was determined using eq 5 due to the presence of an active ground cover in the inter row during the entire season kcb gcover relative to the active ground cover vegetation was determined with the simdualkc model taking into account different soil management operations practiced during the season which are reported in fandiño et al 2012 table 5 presents ranges for the terms of the a p approach computed using observations for fc and h fr values for initial and midseason periods and for the end season were taken from fandiño et al 2012 which were related to kcb full adjusted to local conditions fig 7 shows the comparison of estimated kcb a p values with kcb simdualkc through a fto regression where kcb simdualkc values were derived from observations estimated values for the initial and development stages showed worse results during the five seasons likely because the effects of the active ground cover were more important during these stages the fto regression fig 7 produced b0 1 00 thus no tendency for under or over estimation of the kcb a p values the resulting error in daily kcb estimation had an rmse of 0 05 the second group of vineyards represent data for fc and h for mature godello and mencía wine grapes vertical trellis on a double and single cordon system respectively that were reported by cancela et al 2015 data from 2012 and 2013 were used in both cases with fc and h values measured during two growing seasons a similar process to the albariño vineyard was applied to produce the kcb a p values kcb gcover was also determined using the simdualkc model taking into account variation in active ground cover during the season with the ground cover mulched during the development stage table 6 presents ranges for the terms of the a p approach computed using observations fr values for initial and midseason periods and for end season were taken from cancela et al 2015 and related with kcb full adjusted to local conditions fig 8 shows the comparison of estimated kcb a p values with simulated kcb simdualkc for godello fig 8a and mencía fig 8b trials the fto regression produced b0 1 01 for godello and b0 1 03 for mencía thus a slight over estimation while the resulting error in kcb estimation was rmse of 0 02 and 0 04 for godello and mencía respectively 5 2 vegetable crops 5 2 1 peas for industry the data set used was obtained at two commercial fields one of 30 ha located at alpiarça and the other with 47 ha at golegã central portugal both cropped with vining peas for industry during two seasons 2011 2012 as reported by paredes et al 2017 during the first year both fields were monitored but only one was monitored in the second year measurements included the net irrigation depths soil water content with fdr devices down to 0 80 m crop height root depths and fc eff soil water content was measured twice a week along the crop seasons at several representative locations the fraction of soil shaded by the crop canopy near solar noon was observed within four 1 m 1 m areas at various dates throughout the seasons in addition the dates for the crop growth stages were observed observations and measurements were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the potential kcb simdualkc were kcb mid 1 15 and kcb end 1 11 the high kcb end is due to the very early harvest required by the industry in the a p approach ml 2 was used and kh 0 2 in eq 6 performed the best in reproducing the kcb simdualkc data kh 0 2 was applied to the pea canopy and for other crops having similar architecture where there is considerable leaf area with relatively low canopy height ranges in parameters for the a p approach used in eqs 4 6 7 and 9 are given in table 7 fig 9 illustrates the fto regression between kcb a p and kcb simdualkc values the a p approach tended to under estimate the kcb values by about 6 b0 0 94 5 2 2 onions a dataset for onions was reported by lópez urrea et al 2009a etc measurements of sprinkler irrigated onions were conducted with a large weighing lysimeter installed in the center of a 100 100 m plot the lysimeter container is 2 7 m long 2 3 m wide and 1 7 m deep with an approximate total weight of 14 5 t the crop inside the lysimeter was kept at the same growth rate as the crop on the outside to minimize edge effects the lysimeter mass resolution was 0 02 mm with an accuracy of 0 04 mm equivalent water depth readers are referred to lópez urrea et al 2009a for a detailed description of lysimeter technical features and measurements fc and h values were measured during one growing season with 34 observations a value for ml 2 was used and kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 2 table 8 presents ranges for terms of the a p approach computed using observations fig 10 shows the comparison of estimated kcb a p values with measured kcb lysimeter the slope of the linear regression forced through the origin shows a slight under estimation tendency with b0 0 96 5 2 3 tomato a dataset for tomato refers to a study by zheng et al 2013 field experiments were developed during 2010 and 2011 seasons at wuwei gansu province northwest china five drip irrigated treatments relative to various soil matric potential thresholds were considered using a completely randomized design measurements included root depths leaf area index lai precipitation net irrigation depths and soil water content surveyed down to 0 80 m tomato et was derived from the soil water balance kd was obtained from lai measurements performed during two growing seasons using eq 8 kcb full was computed with eq 6 using kh 0 1 because differently from other vegetable crops referred before the crop was trained on a trellis table 9 presents ranges for the terms of the a p approach computed using lai and h observations fig 11 shows the comparison of single crop coefficients the estimated kc a p values and kc swb derived from soil water balance observations the slope of the linear fto regression produced b0 1 00 indicating no tendency for under or over estimation 5 3 field crops 5 3 1 barley data sets were collected along two contrasting rainfall seasons 2012 and 2013 at a 30 ha commercial malting barley field located at alpiarça central portugal pereira et al 2015 measurements included root depths crop height lai fc eff net irrigation depths and soil water content the latter were measured with fdr devices to a depth of 0 90 m observations were performed at several representative locations within the field the dates of the crop growth stages were observed along both seasons all observations and measurements were used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model and therefore to derive adequate kcb values the potential kcb simdualkc was set to kcb mid 1 04 and kcb end 0 10 based on et measurement data ml 2 was used and the best fit kh value was 0 1 table 10 provides ranges for parameters used with the a p approach fig 12 presents the fto regression relating the kcb simdualkc with the kcb a p values which produced b0 1 02 which was close to 1 5 3 2 wheat three sets of data were evaluated for wheat one set represented winter wheat with frozen soil after sowing and two sets represented spring wheat the winter wheat study was performed along two seasons 2007 08 and 2008 09 in daxing north china plain zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 field observations to obtain crop et and to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model included the soil water content using tdr devices along the entire root zone 1 0 m and ec observations in addition observations also included crop height root depths the fraction of ground cover fc observed randomly along the crops season soil evaporation measured with microlysimeters placed along the crop row the dates of the crop growth stages and the net irrigation depths one of the spring wheat data sets was observed at hetao inner mongolia miao et al 2016 where the wheat was sown after frozen soil melting this study was performed during three seasons 2010 2012 and various basin irrigated fields were surveyed with the soil water content measured with the gravimetric method field observations and measurements performed at randomly distributed locations within each 10 50 m plot included crop height fc the dates of the crop growth stages the rooting depth net irrigation depths and precipitation wheat et was obtained from the soil water balance with the simdualkc calibrated and validated against soil water content data therefore making it appropriate to derive kcb from observations of the swb the third set for spring wheat was sowed in a semi arid environment near albacete spain and kcb were obtained with weighing lysimeters sánchez et al 2015 the dual crop coefficient was calculated with the standard fao56 approach allen et al 1998 and using the crop coefficient values obtained from lysimeter measurements first the evaporation component ke was calculated with the fao56 methodology and afterwards the basal crop coefficient kcb was obtained from the lysimeter kc values minus the calculated ke values the lysimeter description is provided in section 5 2 2 and additional information is given in lópez urrea et al 2009b and sánchez et al 2015 for winter wheat the potential kcb simdualkc values fitted to et measurements were kcb mid 1 14 and kcb end 0 25 while for spring wheat the fitted potential kcb simdualkc values were kcb mid 1 15 and kcb end 0 32 in hetao and kcb mid 1 15 and kcb end 0 21 in albacete for all cases a ml 2 was used and the best fit kh used in eq 6 was 0 2 table 11 provides for the parameters used with the a p approach for the three case studies fig 13 presents the fto regression relating kcb a p with kcb simdualkc or kcb lysimeter for both winter and spring wheat a slight tendency for under estimation of kcb a p for the winter wheat crop b0 0 95 was observed but not for spring wheat cases b0 1 00 and 0 98 respectively for china and spain case studies 5 3 3 maize several data sets were used for evaluation of the a p approach for maize studies for non stressed grain maize are reported by zhang et al 2013 and zhao et al 2013 relative to experiments in daxing north china plain where etec and et from a swb were observed and kcb were derived from the respective calibration and validation of simdualkc other studies using a swb are those reported by martins et al 2013 using fdr instrumentation in santa maria southern brazil by paredes et al 2014 also using fdr in alpiarça central portugal and by miao et al 2016 in hetao inner mongolia using the gravimetric method a rainfed groundwater dependent grain maize was studied in horqin eastern inner mongolia where a swb was used to derive crop et under water stress conditions as reported by wu et al 2015a in addition a study on grain maize subject to high levels of water stress reported by giménez et al 2016 was developed at paysandú western uruguay using a swb supported by neutron probe data a data set relative to a swb observed with silage maize cropped at santa maria southern brazil was reported by martins et al 2013 which refers to the use of fdr measurements for most cases experiments were performed during two seasons measurements included for all cases the components of the soil water balance which were used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model and therefore to derive kcb the soil evaporation was also measured in the study by zhao et al 2013 ml was set to 2 for the non water stress data sets and 1 5 for the water stressed data set which produced a smaller canopy density for all cases the best kh value was 0 1 for grain maize the potential kcb simdualkc for kcb mid ranged from 1 10 to 1 17 and the kcb end ranged from 0 26 to 0 38 depending upon the grain moisture at harvest lower kcb simdualkc were obtained for the rainfed maize at horqin with kcb mid 0 95 and kcb end 0 15 for the high water stress uruguayan case kcb mid ranged from 1 00 1 08 and kcb end was 0 36 for silage maize kcb mid was 1 11 and kcb end was 0 77 table 12 provides ranges for parameters used with the a p approach fr was set to 0 65 for the end season for silage maize indicating impacts of some leaf senescence and reduction in stomatal conductance whereas for the end season of grain maize fr was set to 0 45 when harvesting with high grain moisture and 0 30 when harvesting with low grain moisture the reduction in fr was necessary during late season to counteract the impact of relatively high fc even though leaves were senescing fig 14 presents the fto regression relating kcb simdualkc with kcb a p for the various cases results show no tendency for under or over estimation with b0 values close to 1 0 for individual cases fig 14 presents the regression relating kcb a p with kcb simdualkc for all maize data sets with results b0 1 01 showing that the a p approach presented no tendencies for under or over estimating observed kcb simdualkc values 5 3 4 sunflower two data sets were available for sunflower one refers to three seasons 2010 2012 of field studies near hetao inner mongolia as described by miao et al 2016 sunflower et was derived from a swb based upon gravimetric method data measurements were used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the potential kcb simdualkc values were kcb mid 1 16 and kcb end 0 27 the second dataset refers to weighing lysimeter studies performed during two growing seasons near albacete spain as reported by lópez urrea et al 2014 in this study sunflower etc measurements were conducted with a large weighing lysimeter previously described the basal crop coefficient kcb was obtained from the lysimeter kc values minus the calculated ke values using the fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 ml 2 was adopted with a best fit kh value of 0 1 table 13 provides ranges for values for parameters used with the a p approach the regression results relating kcb a p values with kcb simdualkc or kcb lysimeter produced b0 0 99 and 1 03 respectively for the china and spain case studies combining all sunflower datasets resulted in b0 1 02 fig 15 thus a slight tendency for over estimation 5 3 5 canola the canola dataset represented a one year experiment with weighing lysimeters reported by sánchez et al 2014 etc measurements of sprinkler irrigated canola were carried out with a weighing lysimeter located at the lysimeter facility near albacete southeast spain kcb values were determined from the lysimeter kc values lysimeter etc pm eto minus the calculated ke values using the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 an ml 2 was used and the best fit kh was 0 1 table 14 presents ranges in terms of the a p approach computed using observations fig 16 shows the comparison of estimated kcb a p values with measured kcb lysimeter the slope of the linear fto regression was 0 99 thus very close to 1 0 5 3 6 cotton the cotton data set was comprised of two years of observations in fergana central asia cholpankulov et al 2008 which were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc and to derive appropriate kcb values as described by rosa et al 2012b measurements included the soil water balance components based upon neutron probe observations the potential kcb simdualkc were kcb mid 1 15 and kcb end 0 50 the ml value of 1 5 was adopted and the best kh value was 0 20 table 15 provides ranges in parameters used with the a p approach the fto regression relating kcb simdualkc with kcb a p values fig 17 produced b0 0 98 thus quite close to 1 and indicating the ability to reproduce measurement fitted kcb values using the a p approach with physically and visually derived field parameters 5 3 7 soybean two different sets of data on soybean were evaluated the first is from paysandú eastern uruguay giménez et al 2017 developed along two seasons where the soybean varieties are tall reaching 1 20 m height in contrast the second soybean study developed along three seasons in daxing north china plain wei et al 2015 used a short variety with an average maximum height of 0 70 m measurements included in both cases the fc eff the dates of the crop growth stages as well as the components of the soil water balance the former based upon neutron probe observations and on tdr the second the swb were used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the study by wei et al 2015 also provided soil evaporation data which allowed further validation of the et partition approach used by the simdualkc model the potential kcb simdualkc for the tall variety fitted to field measurements was kcb mid 1 10 and kcb end 0 42 while for the short variety kcb mid 1 00 and kcb end 0 33 consequently different approaches were used when computing kcb a p ml 2 was utilized for both cases and the best fit kh value was 0 10 table 16 provides ranges in parameters used with the a p approach the fto regression relating kcb a p values with kcb simdualkc shows b0 of 0 99 and 0 95 for the data sets of the tall and the short varieties combining all the soybeans datasets produced b0 0 96 fig 18 thus showing a slight tendency for under estimation 5 4 pasture and forage crops 5 4 1 grassland a data set produced from a groundwater dependent grassland observed during two seasons 2009 and 2011 in the steppe of horqin eastern inner mongolia china wu et al 2015b was evaluated killing frosts occurred during both autumn and winter observations and measurements were performed at random locations and included root depth fc grass height the dates of the crop growth stages water table depths precipitation and the soil water content down to 0 60 m all information was used to properly calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the potential kcb simdualkc values fitted to measured etsimdualkc were kcb mid 0 67 and kcb end 0 38 these values are quite low and correspond to cropping under water stress conditions and its effect on vegetation growth and density an ml value of 1 5 was used and the best fit kh value was 0 20 fr 1 0 was assumed because the studied steppe grassland was water stressed quite often throughout the cropping season table 17 provides ranges in values for parameters used with the a p approach the fto regression relating kcb simdualkc with kcb a p values fig 19 shows a good agreement b0 1 01 5 4 2 bermudagrass a data set describing a tifton bermudagrass cropped in santa maria brazil along two growing seasons and two years 2015 16 and 2016 17 was reported by paredes et al 2018 the data set consists of three irrigated treatments where the forage cuts were spaced at 124 248 and 372 cumulative growing degree days cgdd field observations and measurements included the dates of the crop growth stages relative to the various cuts net irrigation depths root depths and grass height the fraction of ground cover and the soil water content along the entire root zone of 0 50 m observed with fdr devices thus grass et was obtained from swb and the collected data were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model the derived potential fitted kcb simdualkc values were 0 91 and 0 96 respectively for the growth and cutting stages ml 1 5 was applied and the best fit kh value was 0 10 table 18 provides parameters used with the a p approach fig 20 shows the kcb a p values compared with the dynamics of the kcb simdualkc values for two years relative to the case where the interval between successive cuttings was 248 cgdd the regression between kcb a p and kcb simdualkc values was not performed because the range of variation in those values was too small producing a small r2 and non representative b0 instead the quality of estimates for kcb a p was assessed through verifying if the potential kcb simdualkc values for the growth and cutting stages respectively 0 91 and 0 96 fell within the range of kcb a p given in table 18 this assessment can be confirmed through the visual observation of fig 20 which shows that kcb a p fit modelled kcb simdualkc curves well for forage cuttings at 248 cgdd results for 124 and 372 cgdd not shown were similar 5 5 summary of goodness of fit indicators table 19 presents the goodness of fit indicators used to compare estimated kcb a p with simdualkc model derived kcb or lysimeter derived kcb relative to all crops described in the previous sections these results show that the coefficients of regression for the fto regression varied between 0 94 and 1 03 which indicates that kcb a p values are statistically close on average to kcb simdualkc or to kcb lysimeter thus producing estimates for kcb values similar to those resulting from field measurements moreover this similarity of estimates refers not only to kcb mid but also to the late season and despite the fact that the observation period is short to the crop development stage as well in addition similarity was observed not only for crops under pristine cultivation but also for crops under water stress which effectively expands the scope of application of the a p approach the ordinary least squares ols coefficients of determination were relatively high generally 0 90 which indicates that the a p computed kcb values were quite close to the fitted regression line and the target kcb values produced by the simdualkc model this provides confidence in the ability of predictions from the a p approach to reproduce field conditions associated with the good results for both b0 and r2 the rmse are small generally much smaller than 10 of kcb where 10 is a commonly accepted or expected error in et measurement and modelling allen et al 2011 5 6 a modification of the fr parameter eq 7 for tree orchards the parameter fr allen et al 1998 applies a downward adjustment fr 1 0 to kcb full when the vegetation exhibits more stomatal control on transpiration than it is common for most annual agricultural crops which is of particular importance for perennial crops and for the late season of annual crops the standard value for fr is 1 0 since for most non stressed annual crops rl is approximately 100 s m 1 the applications presented above refer to fr values not computed from observed rl values but estimated with a simplified tentative and error procedure aimed at driving the a p computed kcb values kcb a p towards the kcb determined using accurate et measurement approaches described in the relevant references those applications show fr 1 0 for perennials section 5 1 and fr 1 0 for vegetable and field crops sections 5 2 and 5 3 however with fr 1 0 after senescence started this empirical parameterization was successfully adopted when tabulating kcb and kc for a wide panoply of annual and perennial crops pereira et al 2020a aimed at providing indicative values for the parameters of the a p approach fr included since kcb and kc were previously determined pereira et al 2020b c a different approach has been proposed by mobe et al 2020 based upon measurements in 12 apple orchards of south africa with fc varying from 0 20 to 0 60 and relative to four apple varieties after observing that the kcb resulting from the a p approach kcb a p largely overestimated the kcb derived from eddy covariance measurements mobe et al 2020 found that fr was over estimated due to using the ratio rl 100 with the observed apple rl to the average leaf resistance of annual crops 100 s m 1 instead they replaced the 100 s m 1 in eq 7 with a resistance parameter α considered to represent the minimum unstressed canopy resistance for apple trees following this modification they observed that kcb a p was able to match kcb derived from ec measurements quite well over the 12 orchards the computations were made for the average rl 202 s m 1 and α 37 s m 1 therefore the mobe et al 2020 proposed that the fr modification may apply when there are observations of leaf resistance of orchard trees so that the parameter α can be estimated this approach is of great interest when there are observations of rl and when kcb values are known which allow one to back calculate fr and then solve the fr function for α more research along these lines is needed 6 applications of kc and kcb estimation from fraction of ground cover and height using remote sensing 6 1 the satellite irrigation management support framework a principal strength of the a p approach is that it provides a robust and standardized method for deriving kcb values for a wide diversity of crops as illustrated in section 5 using mostly physical and visual parameters combining the a p approach with the relationships between ndvi and fc described in trout et al 2008 and johnson and trout 2012 provides a basis for wide area mapping of crop coefficients from satellite data the satellite irrigation management support sims framework melton et al 2012 2020 provides one example of the implementation of this approach for satellite mapping of kcb values and applications of sims to date include both irrigation management and monitoring of crop evapotranspiration by water management agencies through a partnership between nasa and the california department of water resources cdwr sims has been implemented over california and is currently being expanded to provide data for other states in the western u s sims can be driven with satellite data from optical multispectral instruments onboard satellites including landsat 5 landsat 7 landsat 8 sentinel 2a sentinel 2b and others sims can be applied with both atmospherically corrected surface reflectance values or top of atmosphere reflectance though use of surface reflectances generally leads to higher accuracy for sims estimates for kcb and etc for the comparisons with ground measurements of et described below atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data were obtained from the usgs landsat collection 1 for the enhanced thematic mapper etm on landsat 7 and the operational land imager oli on landsat 8 sims first calculates ndvi values from the surface reflectance values and utilizes the relationship described in trout et al 2008 to calculate fc from ndvi following eq 10 10 fc eff 1 26 ndvi 0 18 where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation near solar noon and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index this equation has been shown to be robust across a range of crop types although additional refinements or the use of crop specific equations can be applied to further reduce errors in mapping of kcb values to facilitate use of the sims fc data with the a p approach the satellite derived fc is used as an estimate of fc eff and notated as fc eff below for consistency with section 4 following the derivation of fc eff sims calculates kd values as a function of fc eff and crop height h following eq 9 in section 4 crop type information is used to calculate h and for the u s sims uses crop type information gridded at 30 m resolution from the usda cropland data layer johnson and mueller 2010 sims also allows the user to specify crop type information as an input to the model sims uses maximum crop height hmax values from table 12 of fao 56 allen et al 1998 and assumes that for annuals h starts at zero and increases linearly to a plateau of hmax at 0 7 fc eff generally regarded as effective full cover for vineyards and mature orchards h is set equal to hmax for orchards an immaturity correction is implemented when fc eff 0 5 and hmax is reduced by 1 m no immaturity correction is applied to vineyards where h is typically set by physical trellis configuration and young vineyards are thus considered to have the same height as mature vineyards for practical purposes once the kd values are determined sims follows the a p approach to calculate kcb values including application of fr to adjust for stomatal regulation for perennial tree and vine crops for details see melton et al 2020 sims calculates ndvi fc eff and kcb values for each satellite scene and the time interval is dependent on the satellite data inputs for the analysis described below data from landsat 7 and landsat 8 were used resulting in updated values for kcb as frequently as every eight days excepting cloud cover following quality assurance quality control qa qc procedures and screening for residual cloud cover kcb values were next linearly interpolated to daily kcb values daily grass reference evapotranspiration eto data were obtained from the california irrigation management information system cimis operated by cdwr eto data were ingested from spatial cimis which produces daily eto maps for california on a 2 km state wide grid hart et al 2009 as the final step daily sims crop et etc sims values are calculated following the fao56 approach combining the satellite derived kcb values with the eto data from spatial cimis etc sims represents et from a well watered crop with minimal soil evaporation and sets ks 1 and ke 0 in eq 11 11 etc sims kskcb ke eto in situations where soil evaporation and crop water stress must be considered sims output can be combined with a soil water balance model to facilitate calculation of ks and ke based on precipitation records and observed or simulated irrigation events melton et al 2020 for applications in other states in the u s sims integrates eto data from gridmet abatzoglou 2013 or etref data from agricultural weather station networks such as the u s bureau of reclamation usbr agrimet network nevada s nice net or oklahoma s mesonet for international applications sims can be combined with etref derived from agricultural weather stations or gridded meteorological fields from global weather models a full description of sims is available in melton et al 2012 2020 along with an extensive accuracy assessment of etc sims data relative to ground based measurements of et for a range of crops including both well watered and deficit irrigated crops since the analyses in this manuscript are primarily focused on kcb values we summarize results from the accuracy assessment for sites and date ranges that are primarily associated with the well watered conditions that are best represented by etc sims 6 2 accuracy assessment melton et al 2020 compared etc sims with ground based et datasets for 14 crop types under both well irrigated and deficit irrigated conditions across all crop types studied they found that sims seasonal total et estimates were within 15 mean absolute error mae relative to ground based et datasets collected in commercial agricultural fields use of a soil water balance model to correct for soil evaporation and crop water stress reduced this seasonal error to less than 10 mae on a daily time step mae was 0 4 to 1 0 mm d 1 for typically well watered crops including rice leaf lettuce broccoli and other field crops and 0 8 to 1 6 mm d 1 for deficit irrigated crops including wine grapes and cotton here we evaluate only the subset of the full dataset that can be considered to represent well watered conditions with a generally dry surface and limited soil evaporation we extracted the subset based on soil water potential measurements collected at each site and satellite derived fc eff data to limit the analysis to periods when conditions could be considered to be well watered and the crop canopy was established enough to limit soil evaporation relative to the overall et et ground based datasets were collected using both flux towers with micrometeorological instrumentation as well as sensor networks and instrumentation used to calculate a complete soil water balance the flux towers included in the study were instrumented to derive et either by the full eddy covariance ec method or as the residual of the energy balance reb the sites with full ec instrumentation included a peach site and a second wine grape site wine2 and details for these sites are described in semmens et al 2016 and anderson et al 2017 respectively instrumentation deployed at these sites included a 3d sonic anemometer co located with an open path gas analyzer a four component net radiometer soil heat flux plates coupled with thermocouples and humidity and temperature sensors the reb instrumentation deployed at the first wine grape site wine1 included a similar instrumentation package with the exception that it did not include an open path gas analyzer and calculated the latent energy flux as the residual of the energy balance following the approach described by linquist et al 2015 instrumentation was deployed at these sites to calculate a daily soil water balance and included flow meters to measure applied irrigation precipitation gauges to measure rainfall capacitance probes and capacitance frequency domain probes to measure volumetric water content dielectric water potential sensors to measure soil water potential and capillary lysimeters to measure drainage below the root zone for this analysis daily estimates of actual crop et were calculated from the micrometeorological instrumentation via energy balance calculations etc eb and were filtered to eliminate dates when fractional cover was low fc eff 25 and when soil water potential swp measured in the field with dielectric soil water potential instruments mps 2 meter group pullman wa usa was less than 100 kpa indicating sustained soil water deficits for annual crops the daily mae between etc sims and etc eb was 0 71 mm d 1 16 0 and the mean bias error mbe was 0 33 mm d 1 5 7 fig 21 in general there was a strong relationship between etc sims and etc eb r2 0 81 and the largest differences were associated with the rice crop and explained by flood irrigation events that substantially increased evaporation even with a well established canopy for the perennial crop sites evaluated mae was 0 67 mm d 1 21 7 mbe was 0 35 mm d 1 6 9 and r2 was 0 91 fig 22 while these data represent only eight of the hundreds of different crops grown in california the crops included in this analysis span a wide range of growth forms and include examples of flood sprinkler and drip irrigated crops overall the results demonstrate the utility of the a p approach to provide valuable information for irrigation scheduling and management that is representative of well watered conditions and provide an indication of the error that might be associated with use of kcb values derived from satellite data in combination with etref data provided by agricultural weather networks sims currently provides data for california via web based data services which provide capabilities for visualization of maps and time series as well as data retrieval via an application programming interface api sims is available as open source code and includes both a python implementation for use on local or cloud based computing resources and as an implementation on google s earth engine gorelick et al 2017 using the python api for earth engine the sims api is being used to integrate data from sims into other irrigation management software including irriquest johnson et al 2014 and cropmanage cahn et al 2014 integration of sims with these and other irrigation management software tools facilitates correction for soil evaporation and crop water stress via a soil water balance model and supports calculation of irrigation system operating times from et data these tools also provide the ability to maintain records and calculate on farm water use efficiency metrics demonstrating the value of satellite observations for a variety of on farm water management applications 7 conclusions and recommendations the crop coefficient methodology adopted and documented in fao56 is a successful and essential component for improved agricultural water management and particularly for promoting water savings and precision irrigation the methodology has been and continues to be widely used for vegetable field and fruit crops to determine crop water requirements assess irrigation needs and support irrigation scheduling and management throughout the world due to both its relative simplicity and robustness nevertheless the predictive estimation of kc and kcb can be challenging with the use of tabulated values for kc and kcb being the most common option used by practitioners however many cropped conditions can deviate from those represented by the standardized tabulated values due to different cropping or tree densities and agronomic practices research over the past 50 years has demonstrated for a variety of vegetable field and fruit crops that crop coefficients relate well with the leaf area index the fraction of ground cover fc the fraction of ground shaded by the canopy fshad and the fraction of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation fipar these relationships can be varied using factors that explain the variability of kc values obtained from crop et determined in field however they have not been generally used to predict kc or kcb these relationships reviewed in this study nevertheless provided for a first approach adopted in fao56 to estimate kc from the effective fc or lai and the crop height h through relating kcb mid with lai or fc through the kcb full i e the kcb during the mid season at peak plant height for vegetation having full ground cover or lai 3 the original kcb mid lai and kcb mid fc equations proposed in fao56 were aimed at estimating kcb mid for natural non typical or non pristine agricultural vegetation that were not included in the kc and kcb tables and thus were not focused on the common agricultural crops a resistance correction factor fr was proposed in fao56 to consider the effects of stomatal control by the vegetation under study that methodology has received limited adoption despite research that has proven that strong relations exist between kc or kcb with fc or lai especially for tree and vine crops therefore that fao56 approach was upgraded with the a p approach allen and pereira 2009 through the development of a more visual density coefficient kd computed either from fc and h or from lai and by adopting specific equations for crop coefficients for orchards and vineyards including consideration of active ground cover the review provided here has shown good acceptance of the approach by the research community therefore it is opportune to test and summarize the approach for a variety of vegetable field and forage crops as well as orchards and vineyards with a focus on the parameterization of the a p equations results comparing the a p predicted kcb kcb a p with kcb values obtained from field measurements reveal coefficients of regression close to 1 0 indicating that kcb a p values are statistically close to those obtained from field data and with rmse generally smaller than 10 of kcb often not exceeding 5 the accurate results obtained allow us to conclude that the a p approach is appropriate to use for estimating crop coefficients from observed crop characteristics like fc and h a recently proposed modification of the stomatal resistance adjustment parameter fr for apple orchards mobe et al 2020 opens a new area of research for orchards when leaf resistances are observed observing crop heights is easy but determining average fc in the field over large areas can be challenging and requires appropriate methods different approaches are reviewed herein and particular attention is paid to determining fc from remote sensing in line with this a summary of results from the application of the satellite irrigation management support sims system are analyzed the accuracy of estimating daily crop et obtained with the a p approach when fc is derived from time series of satellite measurements of ndvi etc sims was compared with daily et determined from ground based energy balance measurements etc eb for annual crops the daily mean absolute error between etc sims and etc eb was mae 0 71 mm d 1 16 0 and the mean bias error mbe was small representing 5 7 the largest differences were associated with a rice crop likely due to flood irrigation events that substantially increased evaporation even with a well established canopy plus impacts of exposed water on the ndvi signal for perennial crops mae was also small 0 67 mm d 1 however larger in relative terms 21 7 while mbe represented only 6 9 while the field data included in the analysis only address a small fraction of the hundreds of different crops grown in california the crops included in the analysis span a wide range of growth forms and irrigation methods overall the results demonstrate the utility of the a p approach to provide valuable information for irrigation scheduling and management that is representative of well watered conditions research on both lines needs to be continued to support both ground and satellite based applications in irrigation scheduling and management namely to support users in parameterizing the a p approach with easy to obtain information with this objective a companion paper pereira et al 2020a tabulates kcb for vegetable and field crops based on related literature reviews pereira et al 2020b c and tabulates kcb for orchards and vineyards using satellite sims data and reviewed ground crop data it is our overall goal that the use of the a p approach can
