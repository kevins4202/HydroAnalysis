11450,crop production as a function of water use or water applied called the crop water production function cwpf is a useful tool for irrigation planning design and management however these functions are not only crop and variety specific they also vary with soil types and climatic conditions locations derivation of multi year average cwpfs through field experiments for different locations and soils is time consuming and expensive as it requires careful long term and multi location field experiments to obtain them process based crop system models provide a useful tool for determining cwpfs using short term field experimental data for calibration and validation the aim of this study was to determine soybean cwpfs using the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model across three soil types vaiden silty clay cahaba sandy loam and demopolis clay loam and three weather conditions 14 year average from 2002 to 2015 dry and wet of a humid irrigated region in mississippi usa the results showed that the relationship between simulated soybean grain yield gy and the seasonal crop evapotranspiration et for each soil under 14 year average weather condition was linear compared with the vaiden soil the cahaba and demopolis soils had slightly higher water use efficiency wue over 14 year average weather conditions the cwpfs for gy vs supplemental irrigation were cubic polynomials for all soil types and weather conditions with varying coefficients the maximum values of irrigation water use efficiency iwuemax derived from these cubic cwpfs varied from 2 58 to 9 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 across soils and weather conditions the irrigation amount during the growing season required imax to achieve the maximum gy for soybean also had a wide range of values from 110 to 405 mm the iwue and imax were related to available water holding capacity of soils the relationship between gy and total plant available water supply tws was also a cubic function with coefficients varying with soil types and climatic conditions the yield response factor ky was 1 24 greater than 1 00 when averaged over 14 years weather data indicating that soybean was very sensitive to water stress even in a humid region like mississippi thus supplemental irrigation is necessary to increase gy and ensure stability in yields keywords apex model soybean crop water production function yield response factor irrigation management a humid region 1 introduction worldwide there has been a rapid increase of urban and industrial water demand in recent decades which in turn makes water become a limiting factor for crop production most soybean in the world is grown under rainfed conditions such as in usa india africa brazil and china bhatia et al 2008 heinemann et al 2016 there is a common view that achieving the maximum possible economic yield through optimizing irrigation management is crucial to meet the increasing food and nutritional demands of the growing global population bhatia et al 2008 van ittersum and cassman 2013 even in a humid region like mississippi usa due to the uneven distribution of precipitation during the growing season paz et al 2007 supplemental irrigation issues of timing and amount in the dry periods have increasingly attracted the concern of governments experts and farmers karam et al 2005 garcia y garcia et al 2010 vories and evett 2014 hence agricultural water resource management that uses the available water to obtain the most economic crop production is important all over the world soybean is the dominant crop in mississippi with harvest area of 8 17 105 ha accounting for 44 of the total crop area in 2014 nrcs 2015 only 25 30 of the soybean area is irrigated thomas and blaine 2014 although smaller in soybean irrigated area mississippi experienced the largest percentage increase of 92 in irrigated area from 1998 to 2008 among the mid south states of usa nass 1999 2010 and the increasing trend will continue current research on defining irrigation for optimum yield can t keep pace with the increase of soybean irrigated area in these states vories and evett 2014 the soybean producers still confront the dilemma on how much and when water should be applied to obtain optimal yield with available water crop water production functions cwpfs which express the relation between crop yield and consumptive water use plant available water or irrigation water applied along with the knowledge of temporal crop water demands and deficits are an effective way to answer these questions however cwpfs are crop site and time specific and vary considerably among soils and climatic zones stewart and hagan 1973 kipkorir et al 2002 igbadun et al 2007 moreover the current studies on cwpfs are mainly concentrated in arid or semi arid regions much less in humid regions hence it is meaningful to determine soybean cwpfs in a humid region like mississippi for optimizing irrigation management cwpfs have been shown to be a very useful tool to optimize irrigation planning and management strategies as well as to calculate and compare water use efficiency al jamal et al 2000 kipkorir et al 2002 with the help of cwpfs decision makers can calculate the amount of irrigation to meet the evapotranspiration demand during dry spells for targeted crop yield accounting for rainfall and soil water or conversely assess likely grain yield for fixed volumes of water including effective rainfall irrigation and soil water brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 thus the economic return of different irrigation levels can be estimated by cwpfs when the yield price and crop production costs are known which supports the decision making on how much irrigation is a profitable investment in a humid region e g mississippi the dependent variables in cwpfs are usually biomass or grain yield while the independent variables are crop actual evapotranspiration etc irrigation amount i or available plant water supply which is the sum of effective rainfall plant available soil water and applied irrigation hanks 1974 al jamal et al 2000 kipkorir et al 2002 brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 tolk and howell 2008 saseendran et al 2015 the current reports on cwpfs concentrated mainly on crop et and water issues including precipitation and irrigation the soil properties which are crucial factors to generate grain yield are much less addressed there is a need to determine cwpfs under different soil types approaches to determine cwpfs include field experiments and crop modeling although the experimental method is ideal determining multiyear average cwpfs from field experiments is quite expensive and time consuming as it generally requires extensive long term experimental data to get reliable results russo and bakker 1987 zhang and oweis 1999 brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 even when the cwpfs are derived from long term field experiments they are still not geographically portable rhenals and bras 1981 clumpner and solomon 1987 process oriented crop models are an effective approach to overcome these limitations of the field experiments however some experimental data are still needed to ground truth the models in simulating the daily crop growth grain and biomass yield and components of water balance soil water content runoff percolation et irrigation and precipitation for generating the cwpfs brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 saseendran et al 2015 furthermore cwpfs developed by a crop model are not single functions but multiple functions reflecting the variability in weather soils and locations or multiple year averaged functions for each soil and location van ittersum et al 2013 the agricultural policy environmental extender apex is a process based agricultural system model williams et al 2008 cavero et al 2012 which was developed to simulate various agricultural management practices and land use strategies borah et al 2006 crop growth production irrigation runoff soil and n management and water quality have been successfully simulated by apex model wang et al 2008 powers et al 2011 cavero et al 2012 apex is very suitable for developing cwpfs as it provides three automatic irrigation methods triggered based on soil water deficit plant water stress and soil water tension williams et al 2012 which support a fast and effective way to determine cwpfs main objectives of this study were to 1 determine the average cwpfs across 14 years for three soils in a humid region using a modeling approach 2 examine cwpfs for a wet and a dry year for each soil 3 develop yield response factors and determine et yield and irrigation amount from cwpfs of soybean grown in a humid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study site 2 1 1 study area this study was conducted to simulate conditions in noxubee county mississippi usa soybean is the dominant crop of noxubee county grown on 7 103 ha corresponding to 31 of its total cropland nrcs 2015 noxubee county is located in the blackland prairie region of

ksat undisturbed core samples of 5 cm diameter with 1 cm and 6 cm heights were collected from the soil surface and at 0 15 15 30 30 60 and 60 100 cm depths in both the bed and furrow four samples were collected for each soil layer according to our observations the root depth of soybean in a humid region mississippi is 80 100 cm which accorded with kirkham et al 1998 the hydraulic properties were determined in the laboratory using the pressure plate and water flow apparatus meteorological data was obtained from macon station 33 13 n 88 48 w noxubee county mississippi http ext msstate edu anr

datalogger model cr1000 campbell scientific corporation combined with the weather data the crop growth information and soil properties obtained in the two years of field experiments were used for calibration and validation of the apex model the detailed description on field experiments was given in the previous study by zhang et al 2016a b 2 2 the apex model the apex williams et al 2008 model is a flexible and dynamic tool which was developed to evaluate a variety of land management scenarios at a farm or a small watershed scales borah et al 2006 the watershed may be divided into homogeneous subareas that have similar soils land use and topography steglich et al 2014 williams et al 2012 provides an updated in depth theoretical manual for the latest apex model version 0806 the apex model is a continuous model wang et al 2008 powers et al 2011 which operates on a daily time step some processes use hourly or smaller time steps and is capable of simulating up to hundreds of years if necessary farms may be subdivided into fields soil types landscape positions or any other desirable configuration steglich et al 2014 the apex model was developed to evaluate various agriculture management strategies considering sustainability erosion by wind and water sheet and channel economics water supply amount and quality soil quality plant competition weather and pests management capabilities in the apex model include irrigation drainage furrow diking buffer strips terraces waterways fertilization manure management lagoons reservoirs crop rotation and selection pesticide application grazing and tillage steglich et al 2014 the major input components in apex are weather data soil data crop data equipment management cropping system and control file steglich et al 2014 the weather data to drive the model includes daily solar radiation precipitation maximum air temperature and minimum air temperature the average daily wind speed and relative humidity were also required if the penman or penman monteith methods are used to estimate potential evaporation penman 1948 williams et al 2008 soil characteristics of bulk density field capacity permanent wilting point saturated water conductivity texture and soil organic carbon content are also required to run apex model crop data includes root depth crop height biomass and leaf area index the rate date times and machine types of planting fertilizing irrigation pest control and harvest can be set through management inputs in apex model equipment and cropping system can be set according to the purpose of study the control file can help to set the calculating formula and choose the output items the automatic irrigation will be triggered based on water stress level which can be set through water factor the detail information is shown in section 2 4 2 the apex model supports five options of hargreaves and samani 1985 penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 penman monteith monteith 1965 and baier and robertson 1965 to estimate potential evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration was the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration which are estimated separately by apex model the automatic irrigation will stop for wetted soil beyond field capacity the winapex software is a user friendly windows interface designed by the blackland research and extension center williams et al 2008 the program provides a watershed builder subroutine that takes the user through a series of screens in order to construct the input data for individual subareas which will be incorporated into an apex field landscape whole farm or watershed simulation the apex model provides editing tools that support assessments of the impacts of alternative scenarios potential increase in biomass for a day is estimated with the equation by monteith 1977 percolation is computed simultaneously using storage routing and pipe flow equations and surface runoff is predicted for daily rainfall by using the usda scs curve number equation williams et al 2012 the apex model can output daily monthly or annual yield biomass leaf area index irrigation amount etc runoff and percolation which depends on the users choice the accumulative water stress days aws can be calculated according to the daily output of water stress the outputs of apex simulations are stored in a series of access tables which provide post processing or export options 2 3 estimation of et in apex model the apex model computes evaporation from soils and plants separately ritchie 1972 detail information to estimate et can be found in williams et al 2012 and zhang et al 2016b potential plant water evaporation is computed by eq 1 1 e p l a i e o 3 0 l a i 3 e o l a i 3 where ep is the potential plant water evaporation mm d 1 eo is the potential evaporation mm d 1 lai is leaf area index the soil water evaporation is calculated based on eq 2 2 s e p s e e 2 5 f c s t f c p w p p w p s t f c p s e f c s t where se is the soil water evaporation mm pse is the potential soil evaporation mm st is soil water content in the root zone cm3 cm 3 the crop field et et c during the growing season is then computed as eq 3 3 e t c e p s e 2 4 development of crop water production functions cwpfs 2 4 1 definition of cwpfs cwpfs were defined as the relationship between simulated grain yield gy and the actual evapotranspiration et irrigation amount i or total available water supply tws 4 cwpf 1 y et 5 cwpf 2 y i 6 cwpf 3 y tws 7 tws ieff peff asw dp 8 asw rzswf rzswi where et is the actual evapotranspiration mm i is irrigation amount which is equal to effective irrigation ieff in eq 7 as the runoff and percolation due to model irrigation were zero mm peff is effective rainfall which is equal to rainfall runoff mm asw is available soil water mm rzswi is the initial soil water in the root zone at planting mm and rzswf is the final soil water in the root zone at maturity mm and dp is deep percolation mm 2 4 2 irrigation scheduling to obtain cwpfs the derived cwpfs are obtained by model simulations as apex supports automatic irrigation scheduling based on the adjustment of water factor wf which was defined as steglich et al 2014 9 itr 1 wf 0 wf 1 where itr is irrigation trigger point wf is the water factor which can be set from 0 to 1 in the irrigation management interface of the apex model irrigation will be triggered when the plant reaches a 1 wf stress level the 1 wf equals the fraction of plant water stress allowed the value of 0 for wf means rainfed conditions that automatic irrigation will never be triggered the value of 1 for wf does not allow plant water stress through automatic triggering irrigation the crop will reach yield potential without any drought stress when wf is set to 1 for the derivation of cwpfs thirteen levels of wf was set to obtain the relationship between gy and et i and tws 0 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 95 and 1 the apex model simulated and outputted the yield irrigation et runoff percolation for 14 years for each of these 13 water stress factors the tws was calculated according to eqs 7 and 8 2 5 yield response to water stress the yield response factor to water stress or water deficit ky during soybean growing season was determined by relating the relative simulated yield decrease 1 ya ym to the corresponding relative evapotranspiration deficit 1 eta etm using the method given by doorenbos and kassam 1979 and steduto et al 2012 in eq 10 10 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where ya is the actual harvest grain yield kg ha 1 and eta represents crop field et during growing season mm ym is the maximum harvest yield under non limiting water conditions by irrigation kg ha 1 and etm represents the corresponding maximum evapotranspiration under no drought stress in each soil type mm the ya ym eta and etm are obtained from simulations by apex model ky were derived using both field observations and model predictions values of ky 1 indicate that crop is very sensitive to water stress or water deficit with proportional larger yield reductions when water use is reduced because of drought stress values of ky 1 indicate that crop is more tolerant to water stress or water deficit and recovers partially from stress exhibiting less than proportional reductions in yield with reduced water use values of ky 1 indicate yield reduction is directly proportional to reduced water use steduto et al 2012 2 6 statistical analysis a process based crop model generally is considered well calibrated and validated if it responds to management practices with reasonable accuracy in terms of nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency ef and the mean absolute error mae ahjua and ma 2002 hassanli et al 2016 to evaluate mae more quantitatively and easily the relative mean absolute error rmae defined as the ratio of mean absolute simulation error to mean of the observed values was used to evaluate model performance for each outcome of interest the relative mae rmae may be calculated from mae as 11 m a e i 1 n p i o i n 12 r m a e m a e o the nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency ef nash and sutclliffe 1970 is defined as 13 e f 1 0 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where pi is the model predicted valuesand oi is the experimental measured values o is the mean of measured values n is the number of values small rmae means a better model performance so rmae 0 indicates a perfect match between experimental and modeling results if the rmae value was within 10 for all measurements it was considered a very good for model evaluation and a value within 20 was considered good within 30 is considered satisfactory and greater than 30 is considered poor for agricultural models jamieson et al 1991 ma et al 2011 the performance of crop model was acceptable when ef was greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 ef 1 indicates a perfect match between simulations and measurements several statistical parameters such as sum average standard deviation maximum and minimum were used in this paper all statistical computation for this paper were implemented using sas software version 9 2 3 results 3 1 evaluation of apex model for simulation of soybean growth and yield the apex model was successfully calibrated and validated using the two year field experimental data in the previous study by zhang et al 2016a and the calibrated plant parameters were utilized for the work presented here the detailed comparison of simulated and measured soybean growth and grain yield results were not repeated in this paper in brief we conducted detailed evaluation of simulated and measured soybean growth including daily dry biomass biom and leaf area index lai validation results for biom indicated a good agreement between simulated and measured values for varf derf oksm brsm okhalfsm and brhalfsm with rmae values ranging between 4 64 and 10 64 fig 2 respectively although okhalfsm particularly on july 14 july 25 aug 18 and sep 10 had a large bias of 1 23 2 11 mg ha 1 between simulated and measured biom and the corresponding rmae was also large the simulated biom was reasonable and within acceptable error levels fig 2 fig 3 shows a good validation on lai with r2 0 91 and rmae 12 44 however the deviation from a 1 1 line indicated the different treatments had different performance for lai validation the relationship between predicted and observed lai values appeared to have somewhat larger bias for varf and oksm than that for okhalfsm derf brsm and brhalfsm in disagreement with treatment rankings for bias on simulated vs measured biom values simulated gy and etc were in good accordance with those measured values in the evaluation dataset table 2 additionally the evaluation results of gy and etc were reasonable with ef of 0 86 and 0 90 respectively which fitted to the established criteria for acceptable correlation moreover it was a good comparison between simulated and measured gy and etc with rmae values of 9 70 and 13 34 respectively table 2 3 2 long term average cwpfs across 14 years for three soils the long term 14 year average cwpfs were defined as averaged simulated soybean grain yield gy in response to different levels of averaged seasonal actual evapotranspiration et irrigation amount i and total water supply tws for vaiden cahaba and demopolis soil types scatter plot fig 4 showed a strong linear relationship between simulated soybean grain yield gy and the seasonal crop evapotranspiration et for each soil under 14 year average weather condition with r2 of 0 96 for vaiden 0 97 for cahaba and 0 99 for demopollis respectively wues indicated by the slopes in the linear regression models of cwpf for yield vs et were 13 41 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vaiden 14 91 kg ha 1 mm 1 for cahaba 14 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 for demopollis however the 95 confidence intervals of the slopes were 11 67 15 14 for vaiden 13 20 16 61 for cahaba and 13 90 15 62 for demopollis respectively and this overlap pattern of confidence intervals showed no significant difference among the three estimated slopes from the linear regression models therefore an overall model should be adequate to describe wue for all the three soil types which was y 13 60 et 1245 60 r2 0 95 and the 95 confidence interval of the slope was between 12 55 and 14 64 the physical meaning of the slope of the cwpf for yield vs et has been interpreted as the water productivity wp or water use efficiency wue tolk and howell 2008 and a higher slope expressed a higher wue overall the y et functions averaged over all 14 years across three soils was linear with the wue of around 13 60 kg ha 1 mm 1 on the other hand the functions cwpfs of average simulated gy with irrigation amount i for all the three soil types fitted well by cubic polynomials with r2 values of 0 98 0 99 fig 5 at zero level of irrigation rainfed condition the point at which the response to irrigation started vaiden silty clay soil had the highest yield followed in order by cahaba sandy loam and demoplis clay loam fig 5 considering the variance in soil properties this order corresponded to the available water capacity of the three soils table 1 the data in fig 5 also shows that the maximum yield obtained with irrigation was the same in all three soils in addition the slope of cwpfs for simulated gy vs irrigation represented irrigation water productivity iwp or irrigation water use efficiency iwue and a higher slope meant higher iwue as the cwpfs for gy vs irrigation was y f i ai 3 bi 2 ci d i 0 and a 0 the iwue can be estimated using the equation iwue f i f 0 i ai 2 bi c so the relationship for iwue and irrigation was quadratic averaged across 14 years demopolis had the highest maximum iwue value of 7 70 kg ha 1 mm 1 that value of 5 83 kg ha 1 mm 1 was in the middle for cahaba and that value of 3 07 kg ha 1 mm 1 was the lowest for vaiden table 3 accordingly under average weather conditions averaged across 14 years the irrigation amount to achieve maximum iwue was 108 123 and 132 mm for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 similar cubic equations were found in the functions cwpfs of average simulated gy with tws for all the three soil types with r2 values of 0 99 1 00 fig 6 the cwpfs for three soils varied greatly at tws values between 300 and 400 mm but then gradually came closer together at larger values of tws this indicates that in this range of tws in addition to tws the differences among soils in hydraulic conductivity and pressure head water relation were important factors affecting the plant water uptake and gy these differences also affected the rainfall use efficiency ratio of yield and effective rainfall in the soils before irrigation was applied as indicated by large differences in gy values among the soils just before the irrigation was applied corresponding to tws values of 309 303 and 222 mm for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 furthermore the difference of the yield response to tws in this range was mostly due to the initial soil water content which was different for the different soils of 0 28 0 46 m m zhang et al 2016a b the maximum gy ymax under average weather conditions were similar for three soils close to yield potential under non water limitation and obtained at the same value of tws twsmax values to obtain ymax were 489 487 and 487 mm for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 because of cubic nature of the gy tws curve the highest gy increase was found at the tws value of 399 395 and 355 mm for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 4 3 3 cwpfs in wet year and dry year for vaiden cahaba and demopolis in addition to the average cwpfs across 14 years cwpfs were examined in one wet year 2003 with seasonal rainfall of 566 mm and one dry year 2006 of 272 mm to demonstrate the cwpfs of y i and y tws under extreme wet and dry weather conditions in a humid region like mississippi which would support more detailed information for irrigation management the wet and dry category year was determined by the value of rainfall during growing season based on empirical frequency analysis the detailed steps were shown in zhang et al 2016a similar to average cwpfs on y i the relationships between simulated gy and irrigation amount in the wet year cwpfwi and dry year cwpfdi were non linear cubic polynomials fitted well to these data with r2 values of 0 98 0 99 for the three soil types fig 7 the functions for wet year were closer together than the functions for 14 year average weather conditions but for the dry year they were similar to the average functions the maximum gy obtained with irrigation was similar for all soils in the wet year as well as the dry year however the maximum yield was higher in the dry year than in the wet year the slope of cwpfs on y i indicated that the iwue from the three soils was relatively similar in the wet year though a relatively higher value was found for demopolis soil type fig 7a however the slope of cwpfs indicated that the values of iwue varied greatly among the soil types in the dry year with a higher value for demopolis a mediate value for cahaba and a lower value for vaiden fig 7b the maximum iwue iwuemax was relatively low in the wet year compared with that in the dry year the iwuemax values in the dry year varied greatly among the three soils with values of 3 14 6 77 and 9 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 while the iwuemax values in the wet year were close to each other among the three simulated soils with the values of 2 58 2 69 and 3 27 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 similar to the average conditions the highest iwuemax value was found in demopolis while the lowest iwuemax was found in vaiden soil type both in the wet and dry year the irrigation amount required to obtain iwuemax in the dry year ranging from 237 to 289 mm was higher than that in the wet year from 83 to 97 mm table 3 the cwpfs for gy vs tws were also cubic polynomials for the three soils in both the wet and dry year with r2 values from 0 99 to 1 00 fig 8 again the functions y tws for wet year were closer together than the functions for 14 year average weather conditions but for the dry year were similar to the 14 year average functions the rainfed yield values among the three soil types varied greatly from 2170 to 4696 in the dry year while those values in the wet year were very close to each other from 4575 to 4643 kg ha 1 table 4 for the dry year the yield difference yd between ymax the maximum yield under certain tws and ymin rainfed yield was 923 2540 and 3521 kg ha 1 for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively indicating a large variance among the three soil types whereas variance in the wet year was relativley small with corresponding yd values of 246 252 and 320 kg ha 1 respectively table 4 relatively lower rainfed ymin values in the dry year corresponded to lower tws values caused by low rainfall in the dry year on the contrary higher tws amount corresponding to ymax twsmax values from 569 to 585 mm were observed in the dry year which produced higer ymax values than the wet year among the simulated three soils fig 8 table 4 the tws values obtained the rapidest gy increase velocity twsmaxv were close across the simulated three soils both in the wet and dry year ranging from 363 to 412 mm table 4 3 4 yield response factor for water stress conditions averaged across 14 years and three soils linear relationships were found between relative gy reduction 1 ya ym and relative evapotranspiration loss 1 eta etm with r2 of 0 97 and p 0 01 fig 9 the yield response factor ky indicates the relative sensitivity of a given crop to drought stress or water deficit doorenbos and kassam 1979 the average ky values across 14 years among three soils were 1 24 fig 9 which indicated that the yield reduction was more than proportional to water deficit as ky 1 so it was obvious that the soybean gy was easily affected by water deficit due to drought stress even in a humid region like mississippi with average ky values more than 1 the yield estimation errors between measured and predicted values varied from 1 63 to 14 34 when using the derived ky for the experimental years across soils to predict yield values meanwhile the yield estimation errors of measured and predicted values were acceptable with the ef value of 0 93 4 discussion the three types of cwpfs developed here provide information on how much irrigation is needed to obtain the maximum profitable yield for a given soil type if the required amount of irrigation water is not available they provide estimate of the crop yield obtainable with available water thus helping to make the best use of available water 4 1 grain yield vs evapotranspiration previous studies have shown a linear relationship between gy and crop evapotranspiration for many crops under irrigated conditions if water is not applied in excess such as sorghum corn cotton and wheat tolk and howell 2008 saseendran et al 2015 the linear relationship between soybean gy and seasonal evapotranspiration in fig 4 is in agreement with the results of linear relationship between gy and seasonal eta reported by nielsen 1990 schneekloth et al 1991 stone 2003 and pejić et al 2011 furthermore the relationship for gy vs et was mostly linear for 37 crops at various climatic conditions and locations in the world solomon 1985 according to the observations the gy and et from experimental trials were within those simulated for the 14 years which were also in the range of those reported in literature for soybeans the linearity of gy and et equation was on the basis of the assumption that the yield biomass ratio was either constant or decreased or increased linearly with change in plant transpiration t or etc saseendran et al 2015 however klocke et al 1989 concluded that soybean gy was related to seasonal et by a quadratic equation for four locations independent of stress timing similar quadratic polynomial for the relationship between soybean gy and et for 2 years was observed by candogan et al 2013 the slope of the cwpfs for gy vs et can be used as the wue of soybean in comparison of vaiden silty clay the demopolis clay loam with a higher ksat and lower awc had a higer wue fig 4 and table 1 hence the soil characteristics like ksat and awc was the main reason for the difference of cwpfs for gy vs et among soils through affecting soil evaporation as the crop transpiration was relative similar meanwhile it is reported that a change in slope of the function for gy vs et was found when et demand increased beyond an upper limit tolk and howell 2008 4 2 grain yield vs irrigation compared with this study similar cubic function for gy vs irrigation was reported for corn across three locations and soils saseendran et al 2015 while gerҫek et al 2009 reported a quadratic polynomial relationship for soybean gy vs irrigation for four irrigated treatments from two year s field study in turkey the cubic equations fitted to the yield irrigation functions y i ai 3 bi 2 ci d i 0 and a 0 can be used to estimate grain yield under rainfed conditions as well as yield at different levels of irrigation the maximum possible yield and the corresponding maximum irrigation amount can be obtained by setting the derivative of this equation equal to zero and taking the positive root of the resulting quadratic equation as described in the text the maximum iwue values iwuemax derived from cwpfs for gy vs irrigation varied from 2 58 to 9 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 across three simulated soil types and three weather conditions table 2 these results agreed with the iwue for soybean ranging from 2 0 to 11 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 under full seasonal irrigation found in a similar humid region of georgia the southeastern usa garcia y garcia et al 2010 as well as with soybean iwue values from 3 1 to 11 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the same region in mississippi heatherly and elmore 1986 some differences can result from the fact that this is a long term simulated 14 years study across three soil types compared with the field experimental studies in a different climatic region relatively low iwue values from 3 0 to 7 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in a 2 year soybean field study in italy were reported by casa and lo cascio 2008 considering the soil types demopolis had the highest iwuemax ranging from 3 27 to 9 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 that values for cahaba were moderate from 2 69 to 6 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the lowest for vaiden from 2 58 to 3 14 kg ha 1 mm 1 under three set of weather conditions table 3 these results across three soil types probably can be explained by the great yield difference yd between maximum yield under full irrigation conditions and rainfed yield table 4 whereas the full irrigation yields ymax were similar for all soils the rainfed yield yr was highest for vaiden medium for cahaba and lowest for demoplis and these yield differences are proportional to the soils available water holding capacities table 1 the irrigation amount to achieve the maximum gy imax for soybean was greatly different across three soil types and among three weather conditions with a wide range of imax values from 110 to 405 mm during the growing season table 5 mullen et al 2009 noted that the average irrigation demand from 1998 to 2003 was 221 mm for soybean in mississippi garcia y garcia et al 2010 applied a relatively lower supplemental irrigation amount of 78 137 mm with sprinkler system during the growing season to obtain the maximum gy in a similar humid region of georgia southeastern usa meanwhile a higher irrigation amount of 617 mm was applied using drip system for soybean under a full seasonal irrigation conditions in a sub humid region in turkey sincik et al 2008 therefore considering the wide range of irrigation amount in other similar humid regions our findings of supplemental irrigation needed to obtain maximum yield were in agreement with the previous results based on the characteristics of cwpfs for gy vs irrigation it was decreasing function in the range of i imax suggesting that gy will decrease when extra irrigation was applied after the imax point similar result was reported by risadi et al 2005 that negative effect on gy may occur when irrigation was applied before a heavy rain because in that situation soil moisture may approach to field capacity or saturation which reduced soil aeration for roots respiration and brings percolation and runoff taking nutrients away vaiden soil had the highest yr values of 4728 and 4692 mg ha 1 under average weather conditions and the dry year cahaba was in the middle with values of 4353 and 3202 mg ha 1 and demopolis produced the lowest values of 3698 and 2294 mg ha 1 table 5 however similar yr values of 4600 mg ha 1 were estimated for three soils in the wet year notably the minimum gy ymin across the three soils in the wet year was a little lower than the corresponding rainfed yield yr which probably caused by extra water by irrigation table 5 the maximum yield ymax values were similar for the three soils under the average weather conditions the wet year or the dry year about 5200 4900 and 5600 kg ha 1 respectively table 5 the lower ymax on the wet year was that a wet year means more rainfall and lower solar radiation which was used to calculate the plant growth by apex model these results agreed that under optimal conditions of water and nutrition crop growth and yield was not affected by soil properties but determined solely by solar radiation temperature atmospheric co2 and genetic traits evans 1993 1998 van ittersum et al 2013 grassini et al 2015 however the small ymax difference among three soils under full irrigation may be caused by the difference speed of supplemental irrigation determined by soil properties the ksat values in 0 30 m soil depth was 2 15 7 48 and 6 75 mm h for vaiden silty clay cahaba sandy loam and demopolis clay loam respectively table 1 for 14 year averages the irrigation amounts to achieve ymax values imax for vaiden cahaba and demopolis soils were 152 172 and 254 mm respectively table 5 as expected the corresponding imax values were higher in the dry year meanwhile similar imax values were founded in the wet year for the three soils table 5 4 3 grain yield vs total water supply the relationship between gy and tws was cubic function regardless of soil types and weather conditions similar cubic function for gy and tws was reported for corn by saseendran et al 2015 on the other hand a quadratic equation of gy and tws has been reported by many researchers stewart and hagan 1973 zhang and oweis 1999 sepaskhah and akbari 2005 the amount of tws for soybean varied from 431 to 585 mm during the growing season table 4 which agreed with the reported water demand for soybean of 385 617 mm to produce maximum yield depending on climatic conditions and variety sincik et al 2008 garcia y garcia et al 2010 while to achieve ymax under full irrigation conditions the soybean cultivars sahar g3 and dpx required 550 580 and 640 mm of tws respectively kiani and abbasi 2012 furthermore tws varied greatly as tws was very dependent on climatic conditions the irrigation amount for different conditions and probably location can be calculated by y tws function with the knowledge of local rainfall similar to y i y tws was decreasing function on the range of tws twsmax which mean that gy will decrease if the amount of tws were higher than the value of twsmax table 4 4 4 yield response factor under average weather conditions the yield response factor ky was greater than 1 fig 9 which indicated that soybean was very sensitive to water stress ws even in a humid region like mississippi similar results were reported by karam et al 2005 and paz et al 2007 that supplemental irrigation was required to alleviate ws and achieve a high soybean yield due to the uneven distribution of rainfall during the growing season in a humid region the simulated results showed that soybeans were more sensible to water stress in r4 and r5 stages korte et al 1983 observed a single irrigation during r3 r4 increased seeds per plant and irrigation during r5 r6 increased weight per seed pejić et al 2011 noted that yield soybean was more sensitive to water stress at the stage of flowering and yield formation pod development and pod filling with ky of 0 41 and 0 46 compared with vegetative of ky of 0 31 thus soybeans were more sensitive to water stress during r3 to r5 under rainfed conditions demopolis clay loam produced the lowest cahaba sandy loam the moderate gy and vaiden silty clay the highest gy table 5 these results show that demopolis was the most sensitive to ws while vaiden silty clay can be more tolerant to ws a relatively higher soil available water content awc of 0 19 m m probably were the main reason to ensure vaiden silty clay more tolerant to ws with a relatively low ky table 1 in contrast the lowest awc value of 0 16 m m probably resulted in demopolis clay loam the most sensitive to ws accompanying the proportional yield reduction with the highest ky table 1 thus awc fc pwp was the main reason of the ky difference related to fc ahuja et al 1989 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat may be another factor to affect water stress and water use through affecting water loss this agreed with that cahaba produced the highest percolation of 171 40 mm by the highest ksat of 7 48 mm h among three simulated soils the linear relationship between relative yield reduction 1 ya ym and relative evapotranspiration deficit 1 ya ym observed in the three soil types agreed with the reports by doorenbos and kassam 1979 rosadi et al 2007 and pejić et al 2011 the soybean ky values of 1 24 under average weather conditions agreed with those of 0 00 1 30 in indonesia reported by rosadi et al 2007 therefore the ky values can serve as a reference and knowledge base for soybean growers to determine irrigation schedule under different soil conditions in this humid region like mississippi under rainfed conditions in humid areas variability in seasonal rainfall leads to year to year variability in the uptake of water and nutrients and in the growth development and yield of the crop scott et al 1986 supplemental irrigation was necessary to increase gy and ensure stability in yields hence the relative yield 1 ya ym versus the relative evapotranspiration 1 eta etm functions presented in eq 10 and fig 9 bring the yield et function of all different soils to coalesce together and thus have a technology transfer application these functions allow the transfer of the knowledge of cwpf for one location to another if the maximum et etm and y ym of the other location are known 5 conclusions 1 linear relationships were established between simulated soybean gy and the seasonal et for all the three soils under 14 year average weather conditions with r2 of 0 95 2 the relationship of cwpfs for gy vs irrigation was cubic polynomial among the three soils under three weather conditions the irrigation amount to achieve the maximum gy imax of 110 405 mm during the growing season was greatly different across three soils and weather conditions cubic equations were also observed for the relationship between gy and tws regardless of soils and climatic conditions the amount of tws to obtain maximum gy for soybean varied from 431 to 585 mm during the growing season under three weather conditions 3 the yield response factor ky values can serve as a reference and knowledge base for soybean growers to apply irrigation under different soil conditions our results indicated that ky was greater than 1 across three soils under average weather conditions suggesting soybean was sensitive to water stress even in a humid region like mississippi the sensitivity to water stress ky differed with soil properties of available water content awc indicating that soil properties of water holding capacity and permanent wilting point should be considered to illustrate water stress 4 the soil specific soybean cwpfs presented in this study can be used to optimize the use of the available water resources for agricultural production the long term average functions are very useful tool for strategic planning of supplemental irrigation system design and management for soybean in mississippi the examples of wet and dry year cwpfs also help in allocation of irrigation water from year to year using the weather forecasts

11450,crop production as a function of water use or water applied called the crop water production function cwpf is a useful tool for irrigation planning design and management however these functions are not only crop and variety specific they also vary with soil types and climatic conditions locations derivation of multi year average cwpfs through field experiments for different locations and soils is time consuming and expensive as it requires careful long term and multi location field experiments to obtain them process based crop system models provide a useful tool for determining cwpfs using short term field experimental data for calibration and validation the aim of this study was to determine soybean cwpfs using the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model across three soil types vaiden silty clay cahaba sandy loam and demopolis clay loam and three weather conditions 14 year average from 2002 to 2015 dry and wet of a humid irrigated region in mississippi usa the results showed that the relationship between simulated soybean grain yield gy and the seasonal crop evapotranspiration et for each soil under 14 year average weather condition was linear compared with the vaiden soil the cahaba and demopolis soils had slightly higher water use efficiency wue over 14 year average weather conditions the cwpfs for gy vs supplemental irrigation were cubic polynomials for all soil types and weather conditions with varying coefficients the maximum values of irrigation water use efficiency iwuemax derived from these cubic cwpfs varied from 2 58 to 9 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 across soils and weather conditions the irrigation amount during the growing season required imax to achieve the maximum gy for soybean also had a wide range of values from 110 to 405 mm the iwue and imax were related to available water holding capacity of soils the relationship between gy and total plant available water supply tws was also a cubic function with coefficients varying with soil types and climatic conditions the yield response factor ky was 1 24 greater than 1 00 when averaged over 14 years weather data indicating that soybean was very sensitive to water stress even in a humid region like mississippi thus supplemental irrigation is necessary to increase gy and ensure stability in yields keywords apex model soybean crop water production function yield response factor irrigation management a humid region 1 introduction worldwide there has been a rapid increase of urban and industrial water demand in recent decades which in turn makes water become a limiting factor for crop production most soybean in the world is grown under rainfed conditions such as in usa india africa brazil and china bhatia et al 2008 heinemann et al 2016 there is a common view that achieving the maximum possible economic yield through optimizing irrigation management is crucial to meet the increasing food and nutritional demands of the growing global population bhatia et al 2008 van ittersum and cassman 2013 even in a humid region like mississippi usa due to the uneven distribution of precipitation during the growing season paz et al 2007 supplemental irrigation issues of timing and amount in the dry periods have increasingly attracted the concern of governments experts and farmers karam et al 2005 garcia y garcia et al 2010 vories and evett 2014 hence agricultural water resource management that uses the available water to obtain the most economic crop production is important all over the world soybean is the dominant crop in mississippi with harvest area of 8 17 105 ha accounting for 44 of the total crop area in 2014 nrcs 2015 only 25 30 of the soybean area is irrigated thomas and blaine 2014 although smaller in soybean irrigated area mississippi experienced the largest percentage increase of 92 in irrigated area from 1998 to 2008 among the mid south states of usa nass 1999 2010 and the increasing trend will continue current research on defining irrigation for optimum yield can t keep pace with the increase of soybean irrigated area in these states vories and evett 2014 the soybean producers still confront the dilemma on how much and when water should be applied to obtain optimal yield with available water crop water production functions cwpfs which express the relation between crop yield and consumptive water use plant available water or irrigation water applied along with the knowledge of temporal crop water demands and deficits are an effective way to answer these questions however cwpfs are crop site and time specific and vary considerably among soils and climatic zones stewart and hagan 1973 kipkorir et al 2002 igbadun et al 2007 moreover the current studies on cwpfs are mainly concentrated in arid or semi arid regions much less in humid regions hence it is meaningful to determine soybean cwpfs in a humid region like mississippi for optimizing irrigation management cwpfs have been shown to be a very useful tool to optimize irrigation planning and management strategies as well as to calculate and compare water use efficiency al jamal et al 2000 kipkorir et al 2002 with the help of cwpfs decision makers can calculate the amount of irrigation to meet the evapotranspiration demand during dry spells for targeted crop yield accounting for rainfall and soil water or conversely assess likely grain yield for fixed volumes of water including effective rainfall irrigation and soil water brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 thus the economic return of different irrigation levels can be estimated by cwpfs when the yield price and crop production costs are known which supports the decision making on how much irrigation is a profitable investment in a humid region e g mississippi the dependent variables in cwpfs are usually biomass or grain yield while the independent variables are crop actual evapotranspiration etc irrigation amount i or available plant water supply which is the sum of effective rainfall plant available soil water and applied irrigation hanks 1974 al jamal et al 2000 kipkorir et al 2002 brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 tolk and howell 2008 saseendran et al 2015 the current reports on cwpfs concentrated mainly on crop et and water issues including precipitation and irrigation the soil properties which are crucial factors to generate grain yield are much less addressed there is a need to determine cwpfs under different soil types approaches to determine cwpfs include field experiments and crop modeling although the experimental method is ideal determining multiyear average cwpfs from field experiments is quite expensive and time consuming as it generally requires extensive long term experimental data to get reliable results russo and bakker 1987 zhang and oweis 1999 brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 even when the cwpfs are derived from long term field experiments they are still not geographically portable rhenals and bras 1981 clumpner and solomon 1987 process oriented crop models are an effective approach to overcome these limitations of the field experiments however some experimental data are still needed to ground truth the models in simulating the daily crop growth grain and biomass yield and components of water balance soil water content runoff percolation et irrigation and precipitation for generating the cwpfs brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 saseendran et al 2015 furthermore cwpfs developed by a crop model are not single functions but multiple functions reflecting the variability in weather soils and locations or multiple year averaged functions for each soil and location van ittersum et al 2013 the agricultural policy environmental extender apex is a process based agricultural system model williams et al 2008 cavero et al 2012 which was developed to simulate various agricultural management practices and land use strategies borah et al 2006 crop growth production irrigation runoff soil and n management and water quality have been successfully simulated by apex model wang et al 2008 powers et al 2011 cavero et al 2012 apex is very suitable for developing cwpfs as it provides three automatic irrigation methods triggered based on soil water deficit plant water stress and soil water tension williams et al 2012 which support a fast and effective way to determine cwpfs main objectives of this study were to 1 determine the average cwpfs across 14 years for three soils in a humid region using a modeling approach 2 examine cwpfs for a wet and a dry year for each soil 3 develop yield response factors and determine et yield and irrigation amount from cwpfs of soybean grown in a humid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study site 2 1 1 study area this study was conducted to simulate conditions in noxubee county mississippi usa soybean is the dominant crop of noxubee county grown on 7 103 ha corresponding to 31 of its total cropland nrcs 2015 noxubee county is located in the blackland prairie region of mississippi which is the major agricultural region in the east gulf coastal plain section of the atlantic plain and it s slightly elevated and hilly most of this area is underlain by creataceous age

which cover about 79 of the total soybean area in blackland prairie mississippi fig 1 usda 2003 2 1 2 field experiments the field experiments were conducted on a 7 04 ha irrigated field in 2014 and on a 1 2 ha irrigated field in 2015 located in noxubee county mississippi these experimental fields were conducted on vaiden va okolona ok demopolis de and brooksville br soil types the experiments

calibration and validation of the apex model the detailed description on field experiments was given in the previous study by zhang et al 2016a b 2 2 the apex model the apex williams et al 2008 model is a flexible and dynamic tool which was developed to evaluate a variety of land management scenarios at a farm or a small watershed scales borah et al 2006 the watershed may be divided into homogeneous subareas that have similar soils land use and topography steglich et al 2014 williams et al 2012 provides an updated in depth theoretical manual for the latest apex model version 0806 the apex model is a continuous model wang et al 2008 powers et al 2011 which operates on a daily time step some processes use hourly or smaller time steps and is capable of simulating up to hundreds of years if necessary farms may be subdivided into fields soil types landscape positions or any other desirable configuration steglich et al 2014 the apex model was developed to evaluate various agriculture management strategies considering sustainability erosion by wind and water sheet and channel economics water supply amount and quality soil quality plant competition weather and pests management capabilities in the apex model include irrigation drainage furrow diking buffer strips terraces waterways fertilization manure management lagoons reservoirs crop rotation and selection pesticide application grazing and tillage steglich et al 2014 the major input components in apex are weather data soil data crop data equipment management cropping system and control file steglich et al 2014 the weather data to drive the model includes daily solar radiation precipitation maximum air temperature and minimum air temperature the average daily wind speed and relative humidity were also required if the penman or penman monteith methods are used to estimate potential evaporation penman 1948 williams et al 2008 soil characteristics of bulk density field capacity permanent wilting point saturated water conductivity texture and soil organic carbon content are also required to run apex model crop data includes root depth crop height biomass and leaf area index the rate date times and machine types of planting fertilizing irrigation pest control and harvest can be set through management inputs in apex model equipment and cropping system can be set according to the purpose of study the control file can help to set the calculating formula and choose the output items the automatic irrigation will be triggered based on water stress level which can be set through water factor the detail information is shown in section 2 4 2 the apex model supports five options of hargreaves and samani 1985 penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 penman monteith monteith 1965 and baier and robertson 1965 to estimate potential evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration was the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration which are estimated separately by apex model the automatic irrigation will stop for wetted soil beyond field capacity the winapex software is a user friendly windows interface designed by the blackland research and extension center williams et al 2008 the program provides a watershed builder subroutine that takes the user through a series of screens in order to construct the input data for individual subareas which will be incorporated into an apex field landscape whole farm or watershed simulation the apex model provides editing tools that support assessments of the impacts of alternative scenarios potential increase in biomass for a day is estimated with the equation by monteith 1977 percolation is computed simultaneously using storage routing and pipe flow equations and surface runoff is predicted for daily rainfall by using the usda scs curve number equation williams et al 2012 the apex model can output daily monthly or annual yield biomass leaf area index irrigation amount etc runoff and percolation which depends on the users choice the accumulative water stress days aws can be calculated according to the daily output of water stress the outputs of apex simulations are stored in a series of access tables which provide post processing or export options 2 3 estimation of et in apex model the apex model computes evaporation from soils and plants separately ritchie 1972 detail information to estimate et can be found in williams et al 2012 and zhang et al 2016b potential plant water evaporation is computed by eq 1 1 e p l a i e o 3 0 l a i 3 e o l a i 3 where ep is the potential plant water evaporation mm d 1 eo is the potential evaporation mm d 1 lai is leaf area index the soil water evaporation is calculated based on eq 2 2 s e p s e e 2 5 f c s t f c p w p p w p s t f c p s e f c s t where se is the soil water evaporation mm pse is the potential soil evaporation mm st is soil water content in the root zone cm3 cm 3 the crop field et et c during the growing season is then computed as eq 3 3 e t c e p s

amount which is equal to effective irrigation ieff in eq 7 as the runoff and percolation due to model irrigation were zero mm peff is effective rainfall which is equal to rainfall runoff mm asw is available soil water mm rzswi is the initial soil water in the root zone at planting mm and rzswf is the final soil water in the root zone at maturity mm and dp is deep percolation mm 2 4 2 irrigation scheduling to obtain cwpfs the derived cwpfs are obtained by model simulations as apex supports automatic irrigation scheduling based on the adjustment of water factor wf which was defined as steglich et al 2014 9 itr 1 wf 0 wf 1 where itr is irrigation trigger point wf is the water factor which can be set from 0 to 1 in the irrigation management interface of the apex model irrigation will be triggered when the plant reaches a 1 wf stress level the 1 wf equals the fraction of plant water stress allowed the value of 0 for wf means rainfed conditions that automatic irrigation will never be triggered the value of 1 for wf does not allow plant water stress through automatic triggering irrigation the crop will reach yield potential without any drought stress when wf is set to 1 for the derivation of cwpfs thirteen levels of wf was set to obtain the relationship between gy and et i and tws 0 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 95 and 1 the apex model simulated and outputted the yield irrigation et runoff percolation for 14 years for each of these 13 water stress factors the tws was calculated according to eqs 7 and 8 2 5 yield response to water stress the yield response factor to water stress or water deficit ky during soybean growing season was determined by relating the relative simulated yield decrease 1 ya ym to the corresponding relative evapotranspiration deficit 1 eta etm using the method given by doorenbos and kassam 1979 and steduto et al 2012 in eq 10 10 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where ya is the actual harvest grain yield kg ha 1 and eta represents crop field et during growing season mm ym is the maximum harvest yield under non limiting water conditions by irrigation kg ha 1 and etm represents the corresponding maximum evapotranspiration under no drought stress in each soil type mm the ya ym eta and etm are obtained from simulations by apex model ky were derived using both field observations and model predictions values of ky 1 indicate that crop is very sensitive to water stress or water deficit with proportional larger yield reductions when water use is reduced because of drought stress values of ky 1 indicate that crop is more tolerant to water stress or water deficit and recovers partially from stress exhibiting less than proportional reductions in yield with reduced water use values of ky 1 indicate yield reduction is directly proportional to reduced water use steduto et al 2012 2 6 statistical analysis a process based crop model generally is considered well calibrated and validated if it responds to management practices with reasonable accuracy in terms of nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency ef and the mean absolute error mae ahjua and ma 2002 hassanli et al 2016 to evaluate mae more quantitatively and easily the relative mean absolute error rmae defined as the ratio of mean absolute simulation error to mean of the observed values was used to evaluate model performance for each outcome of interest the relative mae rmae may be calculated from mae as 11 m a e i 1 n p i o i n 12 r m a e m a e o the nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency ef nash and sutclliffe 1970 is defined as 13 e f 1 0 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i

indicates a perfect match between experimental and modeling results if the rmae value was within 10 for all measurements it was considered a very good for model evaluation and a value within 20 was considered good within 30 is considered satisfactory and greater than 30 is considered poor for agricultural models jamieson et al 1991 ma et al 2011 the performance of crop model was acceptable when ef was greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 ef 1 indicates a perfect match between simulations and measurements several statistical parameters such as sum average standard deviation maximum and minimum were used in this paper all statistical computation for this paper were implemented using sas software version 9 2 3 results 3 1 evaluation of apex model for simulation of soybean growth and yield the apex model was successfully calibrated and validated using the two year field experimental data in the previous study by zhang et al 2016a and the calibrated plant parameters were utilized for the work presented here the detailed comparison of simulated and measured soybean growth and grain yield results were not repeated in this paper in brief we conducted detailed evaluation of simulated and measured soybean growth including daily dry biomass biom and leaf area index lai validation results for biom indicated a good agreement between simulated and measured values for varf derf oksm brsm okhalfsm and brhalfsm with rmae values ranging between 4 64 and 10 64 fig 2 respectively although okhalfsm particularly on july 14 july 25 aug 18 and sep 10 had a large bias of 1 23 2 11 mg ha 1 between simulated and measured biom and the corresponding rmae was also large the simulated biom was reasonable and within acceptable error levels fig 2 fig 3 shows a good validation on lai with r2 0 91 and rmae 12 44 however the deviation from a 1 1 line indicated the different treatments had different performance for lai validation the relationship between predicted and observed lai values appeared to have somewhat larger bias for varf and oksm than that for okhalfsm derf brsm and brhalfsm in disagreement with treatment rankings for bias on simulated vs measured biom values simulated gy and etc were in good accordance with those measured values in the evaluation dataset table 2 additionally the evaluation results of gy and etc were reasonable with ef of 0 86 and 0 90 respectively which fitted to the established criteria for acceptable correlation moreover it was a good comparison between simulated and measured gy and etc with rmae values of 9 70 and 13 34 respectively table 2 3 2 long term average cwpfs across 14 years for three soils the long term 14 year average cwpfs were defined as averaged simulated soybean grain yield gy in response to different levels of averaged seasonal actual evapotranspiration et irrigation amount i and total water supply tws for vaiden cahaba and demopolis soil types scatter plot fig 4 showed a strong linear relationship between simulated soybean grain yield gy and the seasonal crop evapotranspiration et for each soil under 14 year average weather condition with r2 of 0 96 for vaiden 0 97 for cahaba and 0 99 for demopollis respectively wues indicated by the slopes in the linear regression models of cwpf for yield vs et were 13 41 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vaiden 14 91 kg ha 1 mm 1 for cahaba 14 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 for demopollis however the 95 confidence intervals of the slopes were 11 67 15 14 for vaiden 13 20 16 61 for cahaba and 13 90 15 62 for demopollis respectively and this overlap pattern of confidence intervals showed no significant difference among the three estimated slopes from the linear regression models therefore an overall model should be adequate to describe wue for all the three soil types which was y 13 60 et 1245 60 r2 0 95 and the 95 confidence interval of the slope was between 12 55 and 14 64 the physical meaning of the slope of the cwpf for yield vs et has been interpreted as the water productivity wp or water use efficiency wue tolk and howell 2008 and a higher slope expressed a higher wue overall the y et functions averaged over all 14 years across three soils was linear with the wue of around 13 60 kg ha 1 mm 1 on the other hand the functions cwpfs of average simulated gy with irrigation amount i for all the three soil types fitted well by cubic polynomials with r2 values of 0 98 0 99 fig 5 at zero level of irrigation rainfed condition the point at which the response to irrigation started vaiden silty clay soil had the highest yield followed in order by cahaba sandy loam and demoplis clay loam fig 5 considering the variance in soil properties this order corresponded to the available water capacity of the three soils table 1 the data in fig 5 also shows that the maximum yield obtained with irrigation was the same in all three soils in addition the slope of cwpfs for simulated gy vs irrigation represented irrigation water productivity iwp or irrigation water use efficiency iwue and a higher slope meant higher iwue as the cwpfs for gy vs irrigation was y f i ai 3 bi 2 ci d i 0 and a 0 the iwue can be estimated using the equation iwue f i f 0 i ai 2 bi c so the relationship for iwue and irrigation was quadratic averaged across 14 years demopolis had the highest maximum iwue value of 7 70 kg ha 1 mm 1 that value of 5 83 kg ha 1 mm 1 was in the middle for cahaba and that value of 3 07 kg ha 1 mm 1 was the lowest for vaiden table 3 accordingly under average weather conditions averaged across 14 years the irrigation amount to achieve maximum iwue was 108 123 and 132 mm for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 similar cubic equations were found in the functions cwpfs of average simulated gy with tws for all the three soil types with r2 values of 0 99 1 00 fig 6 the cwpfs for three soils varied greatly at tws values between 300 and 400 mm but then gradually came closer together at larger values of tws this indicates that in this range of tws in addition to tws the differences among soils in hydraulic conductivity and pressure head water relation were important factors affecting the plant water uptake and gy these differences also affected the rainfall use efficiency ratio of yield and effective rainfall in the soils before irrigation was applied as indicated by large differences in gy values among the soils just before the irrigation was applied corresponding to tws values of 309 303 and 222 mm for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 furthermore the difference of the yield response to tws in this range was mostly due to the initial soil water content which was different for the different soils of 0 28 0 46 m m zhang et al 2016a b the maximum gy ymax under average weather conditions were similar for three soils close to yield potential under non water limitation and obtained at the same value of tws twsmax values to obtain ymax were 489 487 and 487 mm for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 because of cubic nature of the gy tws curve the highest gy increase was found at the tws value of 399 395 and 355 mm for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 4 3 3 cwpfs in wet year and dry year for vaiden cahaba and demopolis in addition to the average cwpfs across 14 years cwpfs were examined in one wet year 2003 with seasonal rainfall of 566 mm and one dry year 2006 of 272 mm to demonstrate the cwpfs of y i and y tws under extreme wet and dry weather conditions in a humid region like mississippi which would support more detailed information for irrigation management the wet and dry category year was determined by the value of rainfall during growing season based on empirical frequency analysis the detailed steps were shown in zhang et al 2016a similar to average cwpfs on y i the relationships between simulated gy and irrigation amount in the wet year cwpfwi and dry year cwpfdi were non linear cubic polynomials fitted well to these data with r2 values of 0 98 0 99 for the three soil types fig 7 the functions for wet year were closer together than the functions for 14 year average weather conditions but for the dry year they were similar to the average functions the maximum gy obtained with irrigation was similar for all soils in the wet year as well as the dry year however the maximum yield was higher in the dry year than in the wet year the slope of cwpfs on y i indicated that the iwue from the three soils was relatively similar in the wet year though a relatively higher value was found for demopolis soil type fig 7a however the slope of cwpfs indicated that the values of iwue varied greatly among the soil types in the dry year with a higher value for demopolis a mediate value for cahaba and a lower value for vaiden fig 7b the maximum iwue iwuemax was relatively low in the wet year compared with that in the dry year the iwuemax values in the dry year varied greatly among the three soils with values of 3 14 6 77 and 9 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 while the iwuemax values in the wet year were close to each other among the three simulated soils with the values of 2 58 2 69 and 3 27 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively table 3 similar to the average conditions the highest iwuemax value was found in demopolis while the lowest iwuemax was found in vaiden soil type both in the wet and dry year the irrigation amount required to obtain iwuemax in the dry year ranging from 237 to 289 mm was higher than that in the wet year from 83 to 97 mm table 3 the cwpfs for gy vs tws were also cubic polynomials for the three soils in both the wet and dry year with r2 values from 0 99 to 1 00 fig 8 again the functions y tws for wet year were closer together than the functions for 14 year average weather conditions but for the dry year were similar to the 14 year average functions the rainfed yield values among the three soil types varied greatly from 2170 to 4696 in the dry year while those values in the wet year were very close to each other from 4575 to 4643 kg ha 1 table 4 for the dry year the yield difference yd between ymax the maximum yield under certain tws and ymin rainfed yield was 923 2540 and 3521 kg ha 1 for vaiden cahaba and demopolis respectively indicating a large variance among the three soil types whereas variance in the wet year was relativley small with corresponding yd values of 246 252 and 320 kg ha 1 respectively table 4 relatively lower rainfed ymin values in the dry year corresponded to lower tws values caused by low rainfall in the dry year on the contrary higher tws amount corresponding to ymax twsmax values from 569 to 585 mm were observed in the dry year which produced higer ymax values than the wet year among the simulated three soils fig 8 table 4 the tws values obtained the rapidest gy increase velocity twsmaxv were close across the simulated three soils both in the wet and dry year ranging from 363 to 412 mm table 4 3 4 yield response factor for water stress conditions averaged across 14 years and three soils linear relationships were found between relative gy reduction 1 ya ym and relative evapotranspiration loss 1 eta etm with r2 of 0 97 and p 0 01 fig 9 the yield response factor ky indicates the relative sensitivity of a given crop to drought stress or water deficit doorenbos and kassam 1979 the average ky values across 14 years among three soils were 1 24 fig 9 which indicated that the yield reduction was more than proportional to water deficit as ky 1 so it was obvious that the soybean gy was easily affected by water deficit due to drought stress even in a humid region like mississippi with average ky values more than 1 the yield estimation errors between measured and predicted values varied from 1 63 to 14 34 when using the derived ky for the experimental years across soils to predict yield values meanwhile the yield estimation errors of measured and predicted values were acceptable with the ef value of 0 93 4 discussion the three types of cwpfs developed here provide information on how much irrigation is needed to obtain the maximum profitable yield for a given soil type if the required amount of irrigation water is not available they provide estimate of the crop yield obtainable with available water thus helping to make the best use of available water 4 1 grain yield vs evapotranspiration previous studies have shown a linear relationship between gy and crop evapotranspiration for many crops under irrigated conditions if water is not applied in excess such as sorghum corn cotton and wheat tolk and howell 2008 saseendran et al 2015 the linear relationship between soybean gy and seasonal evapotranspiration in fig 4 is in agreement with the results of linear relationship between gy and seasonal eta reported by nielsen 1990 schneekloth et al 1991 stone 2003 and pejić et al 2011 furthermore the relationship for gy vs et was mostly linear for 37 crops at various climatic conditions and locations in the world solomon 1985 according to the observations the gy and et from experimental trials were within those simulated for the 14 years which were also in the range of those reported in literature for soybeans the linearity of gy and et equation was on the basis of the assumption that the yield biomass ratio was either constant or decreased or increased linearly with change in plant transpiration t or etc saseendran et al 2015 however klocke et al 1989 concluded that soybean gy was related to seasonal et by a quadratic equation for four locations independent of stress timing similar quadratic polynomial for the relationship between soybean gy and et for 2 years was observed by candogan et al 2013 the slope of the cwpfs for gy vs et can be used as the wue of soybean in comparison of vaiden silty clay the demopolis clay loam with a higher ksat and lower awc had a higer wue fig 4 and table 1 hence the soil characteristics like ksat and awc was the main reason for the difference of cwpfs for gy vs et among soils through affecting soil evaporation as the crop transpiration was relative similar meanwhile it is reported that a change in slope of the function for gy vs et was found when et demand increased beyond an upper limit tolk and howell 2008 4 2 grain yield vs irrigation compared with this study similar cubic function for gy vs irrigation was reported for corn across three locations and soils saseendran et al 2015 while gerҫek et al 2009 reported a quadratic polynomial relationship for soybean gy vs irrigation for four irrigated treatments from two year s field study in turkey the cubic equations fitted to the yield irrigation functions y i ai 3 bi 2 ci d i 0 and a 0 can be used to estimate grain yield under rainfed conditions as well as yield at different levels of irrigation the maximum possible yield and the corresponding maximum irrigation amount can be obtained by setting the derivative of this equation equal to zero and taking the positive root of the resulting quadratic equation as described in the text the maximum iwue values iwuemax derived from cwpfs for gy vs irrigation varied from 2 58 to 9 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 across three simulated soil types and three weather conditions table 2 these results agreed with the iwue for soybean ranging from 2 0 to 11 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 under full seasonal irrigation found in a similar humid region of georgia the southeastern usa garcia y garcia et al 2010 as well as with soybean iwue values from 3 1 to 11 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the same region in mississippi heatherly and elmore 1986 some differences can result from the fact that this is a long term simulated 14 years study across three soil types compared with the field experimental studies in a different climatic region relatively low iwue values from 3 0 to 7 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in a 2 year soybean field study in italy were reported by casa and lo cascio 2008 considering the soil types demopolis had the highest iwuemax ranging from 3 27 to 9 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 that values for cahaba were moderate from 2 69 to 6 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the lowest for vaiden from 2 58 to 3 14 kg ha 1 mm 1 under three set of weather conditions table 3 these results across three soil types probably can be explained by the great yield difference yd between maximum yield under full irrigation conditions and rainfed yield table 4 whereas the full irrigation yields ymax were similar for all soils the rainfed yield yr was highest for vaiden medium for cahaba and lowest for demoplis and these yield differences are proportional to the soils available water holding capacities table 1 the irrigation amount to achieve the maximum gy imax for soybean was greatly different across three soil types and among three weather conditions with a wide range of imax values from 110 to 405 mm during the growing season table 5 mullen et al 2009 noted that the average irrigation demand from 1998 to 2003 was 221 mm for soybean in mississippi garcia y garcia et al 2010 applied a relatively lower supplemental irrigation amount of 78 137 mm with sprinkler system during the growing season to obtain the maximum gy in a similar humid region of georgia southeastern usa meanwhile a higher irrigation amount of 617 mm was applied using drip system for soybean under a full seasonal irrigation conditions in a sub humid region in turkey sincik et al 2008 therefore considering the wide range of irrigation amount in other similar humid regions our findings of supplemental irrigation needed to obtain maximum yield were in agreement with the previous results based on the characteristics of cwpfs for gy vs irrigation it was decreasing function in the range of i imax suggesting that gy will decrease when extra irrigation was applied after the imax point similar result was reported by risadi et al 2005 that negative effect on gy may occur when irrigation was applied before a heavy rain because in that situation soil moisture may approach to field capacity or saturation which reduced soil aeration for roots respiration and brings percolation and runoff taking nutrients away vaiden soil had the highest yr values of 4728 and 4692 mg ha 1 under average weather conditions and the dry year cahaba was in the middle with values of 4353 and 3202 mg ha 1 and demopolis produced the lowest values of 3698 and 2294 mg ha 1 table 5 however similar yr values of 4600 mg ha 1 were estimated for three soils in the wet year notably the minimum gy ymin across the three soils in the wet year was a little lower than the corresponding rainfed yield yr which probably caused by extra water by irrigation table 5 the maximum yield ymax values were similar for the three soils under the average weather conditions the wet year or the dry year about 5200 4900 and 5600 kg ha 1 respectively table 5 the lower ymax on the wet year was that a wet year means more rainfall and lower solar radiation which was used to calculate the plant growth by apex model these results agreed that under optimal conditions of water and nutrition crop growth and yield was not affected by soil properties but determined solely by solar radiation temperature atmospheric co2 and genetic traits evans 1993 1998 van ittersum et al 2013 grassini et al 2015 however the small ymax difference among three soils under full irrigation may be caused by the difference speed of supplemental irrigation determined by soil properties the ksat values in 0 30 m soil depth was 2 15 7 48 and 6 75 mm h for vaiden silty clay cahaba sandy loam and demopolis clay loam respectively table 1 for 14 year averages the irrigation amounts to achieve ymax values imax for vaiden cahaba and demopolis soils were 152 172 and 254 mm respectively table 5 as expected the corresponding imax values were higher in the dry year meanwhile similar imax values were founded in the wet year for the three soils table 5 4 3 grain yield vs total water supply the relationship between gy and tws was cubic function regardless of soil types and weather conditions similar cubic function for gy and tws was reported for corn by saseendran et al 2015 on the other hand a quadratic equation of gy and tws has been reported by many researchers stewart and hagan 1973 zhang and oweis 1999 sepaskhah and akbari 2005 the amount of tws for soybean varied from 431 to 585 mm during the growing season table 4 which agreed with the reported water demand for soybean of 385 617 mm to produce maximum yield depending on climatic conditions and variety sincik et al 2008 garcia y garcia et al 2010 while to achieve ymax under full irrigation conditions the soybean cultivars sahar g3 and dpx required 550 580 and 640 mm of tws respectively kiani and abbasi 2012 furthermore tws varied greatly as tws was very dependent on climatic conditions the irrigation amount for different conditions and probably location can be calculated by y tws function with the knowledge of local rainfall similar to y i y tws was decreasing function on the range of tws twsmax which mean that gy will decrease if the amount of tws were higher than the value of twsmax table 4 4 4 yield response factor under average weather conditions the yield response factor ky was greater than 1 fig 9 which indicated that soybean was very sensitive to water stress ws even in a humid region like mississippi similar results were reported by karam et al 2005 and paz et al 2007 that supplemental irrigation was required to alleviate ws and achieve a high soybean yield due to the uneven distribution of rainfall during the growing season in a humid region the simulated results showed that soybeans were more sensible to water stress in r4 and r5 stages korte et al 1983 observed a single irrigation during r3 r4 increased seeds per plant and irrigation during r5 r6 increased weight per seed pejić et al 2011 noted that yield soybean was more sensitive to water stress at the stage of flowering and yield formation pod development and pod filling with ky of 0 41 and 0 46 compared with vegetative of ky of 0 31 thus soybeans were more sensitive to water stress during r3 to r5 under rainfed conditions demopolis clay loam produced the lowest cahaba sandy loam the moderate gy and vaiden silty clay the highest gy table 5 these results show that demopolis was the most sensitive to ws while vaiden silty clay can be more tolerant to ws a relatively higher soil available water content awc of 0 19 m m probably were the main reason to ensure vaiden silty clay more tolerant to ws with a relatively low ky table 1 in contrast the lowest awc value of 0 16 m m probably resulted in demopolis clay loam the most sensitive to ws accompanying the proportional yield reduction with the highest ky table 1 thus awc fc pwp was the main reason of the ky difference related to fc ahuja et al 1989 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat may be another factor to affect water stress and water use through affecting water loss this agreed with that cahaba produced the highest percolation of 171 40 mm by the highest ksat of 7 48 mm h among three simulated soils the linear relationship between relative yield reduction 1 ya ym and relative evapotranspiration deficit 1 ya ym observed in the three soil types agreed with the reports by doorenbos and kassam 1979 rosadi et al 2007 and pejić et al 2011 the soybean ky values of 1 24 under average weather conditions agreed with those of 0 00 1 30 in indonesia reported by rosadi et al 2007 therefore the ky values can serve as a reference and knowledge base for soybean growers to determine irrigation schedule under different soil conditions in this humid region like mississippi under rainfed conditions in humid areas variability in seasonal rainfall leads to year to year variability in the uptake of water and nutrients and in the growth development and yield of the crop scott et al 1986 supplemental irrigation was necessary to increase gy and ensure stability in yields hence the relative yield 1 ya ym versus the relative evapotranspiration 1 eta etm functions presented in eq 10 and fig 9 bring the yield et function of all different soils to coalesce together and thus have a technology transfer application these functions allow the transfer of the knowledge of cwpf for one location to another if the maximum et etm and y ym of the other location are known 5 conclusions 1 linear relationships were established between simulated soybean gy and the seasonal et for all the three soils under 14 year average weather conditions with r2 of 0 95 2 the relationship of cwpfs for gy vs irrigation was cubic polynomial among the three soils under three weather conditions the irrigation amount to achieve the maximum gy imax of 110 405 mm during the growing season was greatly different across three soils and weather conditions cubic equations were also observed for the relationship between gy and tws regardless of soils and climatic conditions the amount of tws to obtain maximum gy for soybean varied from 431 to 585 mm during the growing season under three weather conditions 3 the yield response factor ky values can serve as a reference and knowledge base for soybean growers to apply irrigation under different soil conditions our results indicated that ky was greater than 1 across three soils under average weather conditions suggesting soybean was sensitive to water stress even in a humid region like mississippi the sensitivity to water stress ky differed with soil properties of available water content awc indicating that soil properties of water holding capacity and permanent wilting point should be considered to illustrate water stress 4 the soil specific soybean cwpfs presented in this study can be used to optimize the use of the available water resources for agricultural production the long term average functions are very useful tool for strategic planning of supplemental irrigation system design and management for soybean in mississippi the examples of wet and dry year cwpfs also help in allocation of irrigation water from year to year using the weather forecasts

11451,compensation programs ensure the efficacy of water conservation programs and sustainability of interregional water cooperation here a water conservation compensation standard model based on the cost and contribution to benefits regarding water quality and quantity was constructed and then applied to the paddy land to dry land program pldlp in the beijing hebei region of china we found that the pldlp reduced the pollution load of total nitrogen and total phosphorous to downstream areas by 27 63 and 88 53 respectively runoff to downstream areas increased by 4 22 without considering the labor costs of family members the net income of farmers decreased 41 65 and the compensation standard was calculated at 5165 41 cny per ha from the perspective of social comprehensive value income generated from becoming migrant worker was treated as an opportunity cost for farmers and under this model the net income of farmers decreased 10 99 and compensation standard was calculated at 1362 95

different regions within watersheds are interconnected during the development utilization pollution management treatment and conservation of water resources engel et al 2008 rao et al 2014 during water shortages competition and conflict are inevitable between cities upstream downstream left bank and right bank kosoy et al 2007 dasgupta et al 2008 robins et al 2017 when the whole watershed is segmented by administrative divisions a city alone often finds it difficult to tackle water shortages and environmental problems individually wunder et al 2008 guan et al 2016 a more efficient approach to solving competition and conflict is when different administrative regions in watersheds cooperate to promote coordination between ecological environmental protection and economic development barrantes and gamez 2007 huang et al 2009 one important source of agricultural non point source pollution is the transport of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from surface runoff to surface water hanifzadeh et al 2017 nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from rice paddies are estimated to be a large contributor to algal blooms in downstream lakes reservoirs and rivers ho and michalak 2015 the transformation of land use patterns in upper reaches of a watershed because of programs such as the sloping land conversion program or paddy land to dry land program represents an opportunity for cooperation reallocation of resources and environmental and economic benefits vincent 2010 hecken and bastiaensen 2010 these programs are often accompanied by eco compensation policies that aim to coordinate interests between shareholders and provide interest drivers and economic incentives for preserving water resources zhang et al 2008 bennett 2008 the payment standards for watershed services are a significant issue when establishing compensation mechanisms and remain an important indicator affecting implementation acceptability and fairness mcdermott et al 2013 the determination of standards according to existing literature is mainly by valuing ecosystem services provided by the upper reaches of the watershed or on inputs for water conservation and ecological protection xu et al 2014 kauffman 2014 while some studies have used factors such as water quantity and water quality to better distribute and revise total costs xu et al 2009 van hecken et al 2015 current methods are static and ignore changes in the value of services costs and benefits downstream before or after implementing water conservation measures wu et al 2012 zanella et al 2014 during the determination of payment standards considering the effects of water resource conservation measures and contributions to downstream benefits is necessary to guarantee the effects of water resource protection measures here we construct a calculation model of payment standards for water conservation services based on upstream contributions we then apply this novel method to the paddy land to dry land program pldlp across the beijing hebei area of china 2 methods 2 1 study site beijing is a city of severe water shortages it has an average annual rainfall of 585 mm and annual average water resources of 3 74 billion m3 zuo et al 2011 miyun reservoir fig 1 is the largest artificial lake in asia and located 100 km north of beijing the reservoir is an important surface water source for beijing zheng et al 2013 it comprises more than 20 of the total water supply to the city and more than 50 of urban water supply however since four fifths of this watershed is located in adjacent hebei province tang et al 2011 both water quality and quantity are important concerns for the beijing government since 1999 farmers in the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir have plant large amounts of rice consuming large volumes of water and producing surface pollution wang et al 2004 chen 2007 in the late 1990s the area of rice in the upper reaches of the reservoir reached 13400 ha du et al 1999 annual water consumption is great a large volume of water resources are trapped by rice systems and pesticides and fertilizers have caused non point source pollution problems for the miyun reservoir gao et al 2002 diminishing water quantity and quality in miyun reservoir has intensified competition and sparked interprovincial conflict between hebei and beijing zheng et al 2013 on 11 october 2006 the beijing municipal government and hebei provincial government formally signed the memorandum of understanding between the beijing municipal people s government and the hebei provincial people s government on strengthening economic and social development the memorandum stated that 6866 67 ha of rice in the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir should be converted to dryland and that the beijing government would compensate farmers for any losses this program is called the paddy land to dry land program pldlp and by 2014 farmers in the upper reaches of miyun reservoir had converted all 6866 67 ha of rice fields to corn fig 2 2 2 model of eco compensation standards for water conservation according to natural migration and transformation rules of pollutants in water the environmental impact of water pollutant emission reduction or excessive discharge has a certain scope liu and yang 2012 water conservation methods such as conserving water source forests or converting paddy land to dry land may increase water flows in the watershed but the effects may be affected by other water usage behavior or natural evaporation and leakage zheng et al 2013 serna chavez et al 2014 based on the theory of internalizing externalities we quantified the contribution of water resource conservation upstream to downstream from the perspective of water quality and water quantity into a model based on the costs of ecological protection to produce a more acceptable payment standard for stakeholders 2 2 1 basic assumptions for the purpose of simplification the model is based on the following assumptions 1 payments for the watershed services take place in both areas a and b within the same watershed where a is located upstream of the watershed and b downstream 2 the upstream landholders who adopt water resources conservation measures and contribute to water quantity and quality downstream are objects of payments ecosystem service providers and those who benefit from water quantity and quality are subjects of payments ecosystem service beneficiaries 2 2 2 cost accounting for water conservation behavior the costs of implementing water conservation measures in the upper reaches include both direct and indirect costs direct costs dc mainly refer to additional costs for protection or construction in order to preserve water resources including direct inputs of human material and financial resources indirect costs ic are the loss of income and development opportunities during the process of water resource conservation arising from constraints on development and changes in land use patterns in upstream areas according to different subject bearing loss the indirect cost of water conservation is calculated as 1 ic eoc goc ioc wherein ic is the indirect cost of preserving water resources in the watershed eoc is the opportunity cost for enterprises goc is the opportunity cost for government and ioc is the opportunity cost for residents 2 2 3 contribution of water conservation practices according to the inseparable characteristics of water quality and quantity the impact of preserving water resources in the upper reaches is usually manifested in water quality and water quantity 1 contribution coefficient of water quality water conservation practices often improve water quality by reducing the generation and discharge of water pollutants e g reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural production from the source by reducing the transport of water or by depositing pollutants so to prevent the transport of pollutants to receiving water e g farmland boundary belt coastal vegetation buffer or by strengthening the self purification capacity of water ecosystems e g wetland restoration and reconstruction water resource preservation in the upper reaches of the watershed improves the quality of the aquatic environment across the whole watershed provides high quality water resources for downstream areas increases the quality of the local aquatic environment and availability of water resources and reduces the costs of pollution treatment the proportion of benefits received by beneficiaries downstream from water conservation practices upstream is 2 k 1 δ l δ l wherein k1 is the contribution coefficient of water quality 0 k1 1 the local effect of water quality improvement resulting from water conservation practices can be measured by δl the decrease in pollutant load flowing into water in the upstream area the contribution to water quality improvement in the downstream area can be measured by δl and the decrease in water pollutant load at the convergence between the upstream and downstream areas 2 contribution coefficient of water quantity water conservation practices such as water source forest conservation and industrial and agricultural water conservation reform facilitate the conservation of water resources and increase water discharge in the watershed the proportion of lower reaches of the watershed to benefit from increases in water resources due to water conservation practices in the upper reaches is 3 k 2 δ q δ q wherein k2 is the contribution coefficient of water quantity 0 k2 1 δq is the increment of runoff resulting from water conservation practices and δq is the increment of runoff at the convergence of upstream and downstream areas 3 comprehensive contribution coefficient in order to give full consideration to the impact of water quality and water quantity we might as well give the two a certain weight so as to get the comprehensive proportion of the contribution of water resource protection in the upstream area to downstream area 4 k 1 α k 1 α k 2 wherein k is the comprehensive contribution of upstream to downstream water quality and quantity and α is the weight of the water quantity contribution α 1 0 2 2 4 calculation of standards of payment for water conservation services according to the principle of who profits should compensate downstream landholders should share the costs of water resource conservation in upstream areas according to the proportion of the contributions of upstream water resource conservation downstream on the other hand taking into account the social and economic development gap between upstream and downstream areas and in order to activate the upstream region to participate in water conservation cooperation programs we used a correction coefficient greater than 1 0 to adjust payment standards the formula of the payment is calculated as 5 m φ k d c i c wherein m is the amount that the downstream area should compensate for the water conservation practices in the upstream area of the watershed φ is the correction coefficient and the specific value is the ratio of per capita gdp in the upstream and downstream watershed k is the comprehensive contribution coefficient of upstream to the water quality and water quantity downstream dc is the direct cost of water conservation practices and ic is the indirect cost of water conservation practices 2 3 data farmers participating in the pldlp are the main stakeholders and responsible persons under the program in 2006 and 2014 we conducted two surveys of farmer households in fengning luanping and chicheng and collected data input and output of farmers before and after the pldlp referring to all kinds of input factors of rice and corn cultivation on the hebei rural statistical yearbook in 2007 and the hebei rural statistical yearbook we calculated the costs and income variations before and after the pldlp to analyze the impact of land use changes on the income of farmers and local ecological environment hydrologic stations in xiabao sandaoying and gubeikou fig 2 are respectively the sections of baihe heihe and chaohezi watersheds at the beijing hebei convergence the total drainage area added is 58 6 of the total area of the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir the total rice area in this region is 6840 hm2 accounting for about 99 6 of total rice area in the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir by analyzing changes in water quality and quantity at these three hydrologic stations before and after the pldlp we can measure the benefits of the program for downstream beijing 3 results and discussion 3 1 the cost of water conservation after implementation of the pldlp the input structure and output of cultivation changed and the total cost of the investment and total income decreased table 1 without considering labor costs the net income of planting rice and corn was respectively 21132 88 cny hm2 and 12330 20 cny hm2 and net income of farmers after pldlp decreased by 8802 68 cny hm2 41 65 considering that the main costs of the pldlp are the loss of income to farmers the cost of water conservation practices is 8802 68 cny hm2 after implementation of pldlp household employed laborers decreased from 301 5 per hm2 to 166 5 per hm2 saving 135 laborers per hectare 44 78 according to the second survey in 2014 the average net income per unit of migrant workers in the region was 80 cny day and the actual migrant labor force account for 60 of the regional total a ratio can be considered as the probability of laborers choosing to work as migrant workers in their time saved if we take the income of migrant workers as the opportunity cost of farming then the net income of farmers after pldlp decreased by 2322 68 cny hm2 10 99 3 2 impacts of the pldlp on the environment 3 2 1 the local environment based on monitoring of fertilizer loss of single cropping rice and annual plants in the field across the huang huai hai region during the first national survey on sources of pollution coefficients for the total loss of nitrogen and phosphorus in the rice planting area were respectively 1 555 0 275 and in the corn planting area were respectively 0 563 and 0 350 in rice and corn planting areas the planting fertilizer applied was generally diammonium phosphate and the fertilizers applied during the growing process were generally carbarmide and ammonium hydrogencarbonate loss of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus is shown in fig 3 changes in land use via the pldlp changed the load of non point source pollution and the application of nitrogen and phosphorous was reduced by 147 09 kg hm2 25 40 and 5 70 kg hm2 9 52 respectively fig 3 the loss of nitrogen and phosphorous was reduced by 7 82 kg hm2 86 85 and 0 15 kg hm2 44 51 respectively if the total area the pldlp is calculated as 6866 67 hm2 then the loss of nitrogen and phosphorous via surface runoff was respectively reduced by 10 73 104 kg 86 85 and 2033 kg 44 51 3 2 2 the downstream environment we can estimate water quality implications of the program on downstream areas by analyzing variation in pollutant loads flowing into the reservoir before and after pldlp we focused on changes in two water quality indexes of tn and tp the total load reduction of tn and tp were 24 30 104 kg 27 63 and 0 99 104 kg 88 53 respectively fig 4 3 3 surface runoff as the pldlp was implemented along the river of the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir watershed irrigation is mostly directed from the river to replace paddy lands with dry lands reduction in irrigation water can be considered as the increase in runoff brought about by the pldlp 3 3 1 local surface runoff based on a study of water consumption in a single season of rice and spring corn in northern china chen et al 1995 and precipitation conditions in our study area in years of drought the requirement of irrigation water of rice and corn was 8550 m3 hm2 and 3540 m3 hm2 each hectare can save 5010 m3 58 60 of irrigation water after pldlp in normal years the requirement of the irrigation water of rice and corn was respectively 7140 m3 hm2 and 2865 m3 hm2 each hectare can save 4275 m3 59 87 of irrigation water after pldlp if the total area the pldlp is calculated as 6866 67 hm2 then the consumption of irrigation water saved is 3 44 107 m3 drought years and 2 94 107 m3 normal years resulting in 3 44 107 m3 58 60 and 2 94 107 m3 59 87 in incremental runoff 3 3 2 downstream surface runoff to eliminate the partial influence of inter annual variability of precipitation on runoff we adopted the typical annual runoff coefficient method to evaluate the contribution flow of the pldlp to runoff in each sub basin according to the principle of similar total precipitation and similar spatial distribution the runoff coefficient in 2006 was selected as the typical year before implementation of the program and was taken to calculate coefficients and measured precipitation to obtain the converted volume of runoff by reducing the converted volume of runoff from measured runoff we can obtain the runoff increment from the pldlp table 2 the contribution runoff of pldlp is 510 77 104 m3 4 22 indicating that implementation of pldlp had a tendency to increase runoff 3 4 contribution coefficient calculation from the above analysis the reduction in the total amount of tn and tp load into the reservoir was respectively 24 30 104 kg and 0 99 104 kg after implementation of the program which is higher than nitrogen fertilizer tn and phosphate fertilizer tp loss from surface runoff this may be because implementation of the pldlp can not only reduce the amount of non point source pollution by reducing fertilizer loss but also reduce irrigation water required for planting corn so that the erosion of farmland discharge to farmland soil is reduced further reducing the agricultural non point source pollution load and benefiting downstream areas through water quality improvement the water quality contribution coefficient k1 can be taken as 1 implementation of the pldlp saves irrigation water of 3 44 107 m3 year and the contribution volume of runoff of the lower reaches of the basin is 510 78 104m3 according to formula 3 the water contribution coefficient k2 is 0 148 in recent years due to drought and other factors the upstream of the miyun reservoir runoff into the reservoir has reduced sharply and competition and conflict over water resources has become obvious therefore to increase water in the miyun reservoir and guarantee water demand in beijing the water weight coefficient α can be taken as 0 6 when taking a comprehensive consideration of water quality and water quantity according to formula 4 the comprehensive contribution coefficient k is 0 489 3 5 payment standards of the pldlp changes in the structure of input factors and output conditions have led to reallocation of water resources water environmental benefits and economic benefits between pldlp participants in the upper reaches of the watershed and water users downstream the cost of water resource protection is 8802 68 cny hm2 without considering the cost of household labor using formula 5 the amount of the payment m for pldlp participants should be 5165 41 cny hm2 the current payment standard basically covers the loss and gains of farmers participating in the pldlp but is higher than the payment standard calculated in this study based on the contribution of water quality and water quantity from the perspective of social comprehensive value when the income of migrant labors is considered an opportunity cost of farming the cost of water conservation is 2322 68 cny hm2 in this case the amount of the payment m for pldlp participants in beijing should be 1362 95 cny hm2 4 conclusions water resource cooperation within watersheds is a long term and continuous undertaking water resource conservation programs have long term impacts on the welfare of local stakeholders on the other hand the contribution of the program downstream may be affected by other water use and environmental practices upstream resulting in uncertainty based on the costs of water resource conservation and its contribution to water quality and quantity in the beneficiary area we constructed a calculation model of payments standards for watershed services in the pldlp in the beijing hebei region if the payment standards are based on the contribution to downstream water quality and quantity from the program the payment standards can be updated in stages managers upstream will enhance water and sewage regulation and implement strict water control mechanisms thus ensuring benefits downstream after implementation of pldlp the input structure and output of the cultivation changed and the net income of farmers decreased by 8802 68 cny hm2 41 65 however after pldlp labor force demand decreased by 135 people per hm2 44 78 if we consider the opportunity cost of labor then net income of farmers decreased by 2322 68 cny hm2 10 99 changes in land use via the pldlp changed the load of non point source pollution and the total load reduction of tn and tp in downstream areas was 24 30 104 kg 27 63 and 0 99 104kg 88 53 respectively as requirements for irrigation water of corn are smaller than rice in northern china runoff to reservoir increased by 510 78 104 m3 4 22 the payment standard is 5165 41 cny hm2 without considering the cost of household labor if labor income of migrant workers is used as an opportunity cost for farmers the payment standard is actually 1362 95 cny hm2 acknowledgements this research was supported by the china national key r d plan 2017yfc0506402 and as a special research institute project of the chinse academy of

11451,compensation programs ensure the efficacy of water conservation programs and sustainability of interregional water cooperation here a water conservation compensation standard model based on the cost and contribution to benefits regarding water quality and quantity was constructed and then applied to the paddy land to dry land program pldlp in the beijing hebei region of china we found that the pldlp reduced the pollution load of total nitrogen and total phosphorous to downstream areas by 27 63 and 88 53 respectively runoff to downstream areas increased by 4 22 without considering the labor costs of family members the net income of farmers decreased 41 65 and the compensation standard was calculated at 5165 41 cny per ha from the perspective of social comprehensive value income generated from becoming migrant worker was treated as an opportunity cost for farmers and under this model the net income of farmers decreased 10 99 and compensation standard was calculated at 1362 95 cny per ha keywords water cooperation eco compensation compensation standard miyun reservoir paddy land to dry land program 1 introduction as a result of water mobility and the integrity of watersheds different regions within watersheds are interconnected during the development utilization pollution management treatment and conservation of water resources engel et al 2008 rao et al 2014 during water shortages competition and conflict are inevitable between cities upstream downstream left bank and right bank kosoy et al 2007 dasgupta et al 2008 robins et al 2017 when the whole watershed is segmented by administrative divisions a city alone often finds it difficult to tackle water shortages and environmental problems individually wunder et al 2008 guan et al 2016 a more efficient approach to solving competition and conflict is when different administrative regions in watersheds cooperate to promote coordination between ecological environmental protection and economic development barrantes and gamez 2007 huang et al 2009 one important source of agricultural non point source pollution is the transport of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from surface runoff to surface water hanifzadeh et al 2017 nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from rice paddies are estimated to be a large contributor to algal blooms in downstream lakes reservoirs and rivers ho and michalak 2015 the transformation of land use patterns in upper reaches of a watershed because of programs such as the sloping land conversion program or paddy land to dry land program represents an opportunity for cooperation reallocation of resources and environmental and economic benefits vincent 2010 hecken and bastiaensen 2010 these programs are often accompanied by eco compensation policies that aim to coordinate interests between shareholders and provide interest drivers and economic incentives for preserving water resources zhang et al 2008 bennett 2008 the payment standards for watershed services are a significant issue when establishing compensation mechanisms and remain an important indicator affecting implementation acceptability and fairness mcdermott et al 2013 the determination of standards according to existing literature is mainly by valuing ecosystem services provided by the upper reaches of the watershed or on inputs for water conservation and ecological protection xu et al 2014 kauffman 2014 while some studies have used factors such as water quantity and water quality to better distribute and revise total costs xu et al 2009 van hecken et al 2015 current methods are static and ignore changes in the value of services costs and benefits downstream before or after implementing water conservation measures wu et al 2012 zanella et al 2014 during the determination of payment standards considering the effects of water resource conservation measures and contributions to downstream benefits is necessary to guarantee the effects of water resource protection measures here we construct a calculation model of payment standards for water conservation services based on upstream contributions we then apply this novel method to the paddy land to dry land program pldlp across the beijing hebei area of china 2 methods 2 1 study site beijing is a city of severe water shortages it has an average annual rainfall of 585 mm and annual average water resources of 3 74 billion m3 zuo et al 2011 miyun reservoir fig 1 is the largest artificial lake in asia and located 100 km north of beijing the reservoir is an important surface water source for beijing zheng et al 2013 it comprises more than 20 of the total water supply to the city and more than 50 of urban water supply however since four fifths of this watershed is located in adjacent hebei province tang et al 2011 both water quality and quantity are important concerns for the beijing government since 1999 farmers in the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir have plant large amounts of rice consuming large volumes of water and producing surface pollution wang et al 2004 chen 2007 in the late 1990s the area of rice in the upper reaches of the reservoir reached 13400 ha du et al 1999 annual water consumption is great a large volume of water resources are trapped by rice systems and pesticides and fertilizers have caused non point source pollution problems for the miyun reservoir gao et al 2002 diminishing water quantity and quality in miyun reservoir has intensified competition and sparked interprovincial conflict between hebei and beijing zheng et al 2013 on 11 october 2006 the beijing municipal government and hebei provincial government formally signed the memorandum of understanding between the beijing municipal people s government and the hebei provincial people s government on strengthening economic and social development the memorandum stated that 6866 67 ha of rice in the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir should be converted to dryland and that the beijing government would compensate farmers for any losses this program is called the paddy land to dry land program pldlp and by 2014 farmers in the upper reaches of miyun reservoir had converted all 6866 67 ha of rice fields to corn fig 2 2 2 model of eco compensation standards for water conservation according to natural migration and transformation rules of pollutants in water the environmental impact of water pollutant emission reduction or excessive discharge has a certain scope liu and yang 2012 water conservation methods such as conserving water source forests or converting paddy land to dry land may increase water flows in the watershed but the effects may be affected by other water usage behavior or natural evaporation and leakage zheng et al 2013 serna chavez et al 2014 based on the theory of internalizing externalities we quantified the contribution of water resource conservation upstream to downstream from the perspective of water quality and water quantity into a model based on the costs of ecological protection to produce a more acceptable payment standard for stakeholders 2 2 1 basic assumptions for the purpose of simplification the model is based on the following assumptions 1 payments for the watershed services take place in both areas a and b within the same watershed where a is located upstream of the watershed and b downstream 2 the upstream landholders who adopt water resources conservation measures and contribute to water quantity and quality downstream are objects of payments ecosystem service providers and those who benefit from water quantity and quality are subjects of payments ecosystem service beneficiaries 2 2 2 cost accounting for water conservation behavior the costs of implementing water conservation measures in the upper reaches include both direct and indirect costs direct costs dc mainly refer to additional costs for protection or construction in order to preserve water resources including direct inputs of human material and financial resources indirect costs ic are the loss of income and development opportunities during the process of water resource conservation arising from constraints on development and changes in land use patterns in upstream areas according to different subject bearing loss the indirect cost of water conservation is calculated as 1 ic eoc goc ioc wherein ic is the indirect cost of preserving water resources in the watershed eoc is the opportunity cost for enterprises goc is the opportunity cost for government and ioc is the opportunity cost for residents 2 2 3 contribution of water conservation practices according to the inseparable characteristics of water quality and quantity the impact of preserving water resources in the upper reaches is usually manifested in water quality and water quantity 1 contribution coefficient of water quality water conservation practices often improve water quality by reducing the generation and discharge of water pollutants e g reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural production from the source by reducing the transport of water or by depositing pollutants so to prevent the transport of pollutants to receiving water e g farmland boundary belt coastal vegetation buffer or by strengthening the self purification capacity of water ecosystems e g wetland restoration and reconstruction water resource preservation in the upper reaches of the watershed improves the quality of the aquatic environment across the whole watershed provides high quality water resources for downstream areas increases the quality of the local aquatic environment and availability of water resources and reduces the costs of pollution treatment the proportion of benefits received by beneficiaries downstream from water conservation practices upstream is 2 k 1 δ l δ l wherein k1 is the contribution coefficient of water quality 0 k1 1 the local effect of water quality improvement resulting from water conservation practices can be measured by δl the decrease in pollutant load flowing into water in the upstream area the contribution to water quality improvement in the downstream area can be measured by δl and the decrease in water pollutant load at the convergence between the upstream and downstream areas 2 contribution coefficient of water quantity water conservation practices such as water source forest conservation and industrial and agricultural water conservation reform facilitate the conservation of water resources and increase water discharge in the watershed the proportion of lower reaches of the watershed to benefit from increases in water resources due to water conservation practices in the upper reaches is 3 k 2 δ q δ q wherein k2 is the contribution coefficient of water quantity 0 k2 1 δq is the increment of runoff resulting from water conservation practices and δq is the increment of runoff at the convergence of upstream and downstream areas 3 comprehensive contribution coefficient in order to give full consideration to the impact of water quality and water quantity we might as well give the two a certain weight so as to get the comprehensive proportion of the contribution of water resource protection in the upstream area to downstream area 4 k 1 α k 1 α k 2 wherein k is the comprehensive contribution of upstream to downstream water quality and quantity and α is the weight of the water quantity contribution α 1 0 2 2 4 calculation of standards of payment for water conservation services according to the principle of who profits should compensate downstream landholders should share the costs of water resource conservation in upstream areas according to the proportion of the contributions of upstream water resource conservation downstream on the other hand taking into account the social and economic development gap between upstream and downstream areas and in order to activate the upstream region to participate in water conservation cooperation programs we used a correction coefficient greater than 1 0 to adjust payment standards the formula of the payment is calculated as 5 m φ k d c i c wherein m is the amount that the downstream area should compensate for the water conservation practices in the upstream area of the watershed φ is the correction coefficient and the specific value is the ratio of per capita gdp in the upstream and downstream watershed k is the comprehensive contribution coefficient of upstream to the water quality and water quantity downstream dc is the direct cost of water conservation practices and ic is the indirect cost of water conservation practices 2 3 data farmers participating in the pldlp are the main stakeholders and responsible persons under the program in 2006 and 2014 we conducted two surveys of farmer households in fengning luanping and chicheng and collected data input and output of farmers before and after the pldlp referring to all kinds of input factors of rice and corn cultivation on the hebei rural statistical yearbook in 2007 and the hebei rural statistical yearbook we calculated the costs and income variations before and after the pldlp to analyze the impact of land use changes on the income of farmers and local ecological environment hydrologic stations in xiabao sandaoying and gubeikou fig 2 are respectively the sections of baihe heihe and chaohezi watersheds at the beijing hebei convergence the total drainage area added is 58 6 of the total area of the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir the total rice area in this region is 6840 hm2 accounting for about 99 6 of total rice area in the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir by analyzing changes in water quality and quantity at these three hydrologic stations before and after the pldlp we can measure the benefits of the program for downstream beijing 3 results and discussion 3 1 the cost of water conservation after implementation of the pldlp the input structure and output of cultivation changed and the total cost of the investment and total income decreased table 1 without considering labor costs the net income of planting rice and corn was respectively 21132 88 cny hm2 and 12330 20 cny hm2 and net income of farmers after pldlp decreased by 8802 68 cny hm2 41 65 considering that the main costs of the pldlp are the loss of income to farmers the cost of water conservation practices is 8802 68 cny hm2 after implementation of pldlp household employed laborers decreased from 301 5 per hm2 to 166 5 per hm2 saving 135 laborers per hectare 44 78 according to the second survey in 2014 the average net income per unit of migrant workers in the region was 80 cny day and the actual migrant labor force account for 60 of the regional total a ratio can be considered as the probability of laborers choosing to work as migrant workers in their time saved if we take the income of migrant workers as the opportunity cost of farming then the net income of farmers after pldlp decreased by 2322 68 cny hm2 10 99 3 2 impacts of the pldlp on the environment 3 2 1 the local environment based on monitoring of fertilizer loss of single cropping rice and annual plants in the field across the huang huai hai region during the first national survey on sources of pollution coefficients for the total loss of nitrogen and phosphorus in the rice planting area were respectively 1 555 0 275 and in the corn planting area were respectively 0 563 and 0 350 in rice and corn planting areas the planting fertilizer applied was generally diammonium phosphate and the fertilizers applied during the growing process were generally carbarmide and ammonium hydrogencarbonate loss of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus is shown in fig 3 changes in land use via the pldlp changed the load of non point source pollution and the application of nitrogen and phosphorous was reduced by 147 09 kg hm2 25 40 and 5 70 kg hm2 9 52 respectively fig 3 the loss of nitrogen and phosphorous was reduced by 7 82 kg hm2 86 85 and 0 15 kg hm2 44 51 respectively if the total area the pldlp is calculated as 6866 67 hm2 then the loss of nitrogen and phosphorous via surface runoff was respectively reduced by 10 73 104 kg 86 85 and 2033 kg 44 51 3 2 2 the downstream environment we can estimate water quality implications of the program on downstream areas by analyzing variation in pollutant loads flowing into the reservoir before and after pldlp we focused on changes in two water quality indexes of tn and tp the total load reduction of tn and tp were 24 30 104 kg 27 63 and 0 99 104 kg 88 53 respectively fig 4 3 3 surface runoff as the pldlp was implemented along the river of the upper reaches of the miyun reservoir watershed irrigation is mostly directed from the river to replace paddy lands with dry lands reduction in irrigation water can be considered as the increase in runoff brought about by the pldlp 3 3 1 local surface runoff based on a study of water consumption in a single season of rice and spring corn in northern china chen et al 1995 and precipitation conditions in our study area in years of drought the requirement of irrigation water of rice and corn was 8550 m3 hm2 and 3540 m3 hm2 each hectare can save 5010 m3 58 60 of irrigation water after pldlp in normal years the requirement of the irrigation water of rice and corn was respectively 7140 m3 hm2 and 2865 m3 hm2 each hectare can save 4275 m3 59 87 of irrigation water after pldlp if the total area the pldlp is calculated as 6866 67 hm2 then the consumption of irrigation water saved is 3 44 107 m3 drought years and 2 94 107 m3 normal years resulting in 3 44 107 m3 58 60 and 2 94 107 m3 59 87 in incremental runoff 3 3 2 downstream surface runoff to eliminate the partial influence of inter annual variability of precipitation on runoff we adopted the typical annual runoff coefficient method to evaluate the contribution flow of the pldlp to runoff in each sub basin according to the principle of similar total precipitation and similar spatial distribution the runoff coefficient in 2006 was selected as the typical year before implementation of the program and was taken to calculate coefficients and measured precipitation to obtain the converted volume of runoff by reducing the converted volume of runoff from measured runoff we can obtain the runoff increment from the pldlp table 2 the contribution runoff of pldlp is 510 77 104 m3 4 22 indicating that implementation of pldlp had a tendency to increase runoff 3 4 contribution coefficient calculation from the above analysis the reduction in the total amount of tn and tp load into the reservoir was respectively 24 30 104 kg and 0 99 104 kg after implementation of the program which is higher than nitrogen fertilizer tn and phosphate fertilizer tp loss from surface runoff this may be because implementation of the pldlp can not only reduce the amount of non point source pollution by reducing fertilizer loss but also reduce irrigation water required for planting corn so that the erosion of farmland discharge to farmland soil is reduced further reducing the agricultural non point source pollution load and benefiting downstream areas through water quality improvement the water quality contribution coefficient k1 can be taken as 1 implementation of the pldlp saves irrigation water of 3 44 107 m3 year and the contribution volume of runoff of the lower reaches of the basin is 510 78 104m3 according to formula 3 the water contribution coefficient k2 is 0 148 in recent years due to drought and other factors the upstream of the miyun reservoir runoff into the reservoir has reduced sharply and competition and conflict over water resources has become obvious therefore to increase water in the miyun reservoir and guarantee water demand in beijing the water weight coefficient α can be taken as 0 6 when taking a comprehensive consideration of water quality and water quantity according to formula 4 the comprehensive contribution coefficient k is 0 489 3 5 payment standards of the pldlp changes in the structure of input factors and output conditions have led to reallocation of water resources water environmental benefits and economic benefits between pldlp participants in the upper reaches of the watershed and water users downstream the cost of water resource protection is 8802 68 cny hm2 without considering the cost of household labor using formula 5 the amount of the payment m for pldlp participants should be 5165 41 cny hm2 the current payment standard basically covers the loss and gains of farmers participating in the pldlp but is higher than the payment standard calculated in this study based on the contribution of water quality and water quantity from the perspective of social comprehensive value when the income of migrant labors is considered an opportunity cost of farming the cost of water conservation is 2322 68 cny hm2 in this case the amount of the payment m for pldlp participants in beijing should be 1362 95 cny hm2 4 conclusions water resource cooperation within watersheds is a long term and continuous undertaking water resource conservation programs have long term impacts on the welfare of local stakeholders on the other hand the contribution of the program downstream may be affected by other water use and environmental practices upstream resulting in uncertainty based on the costs of water resource conservation and its contribution to water quality and quantity in the beneficiary area we constructed a calculation model of payments standards for watershed services in the pldlp in the beijing hebei region if the payment standards are based on the contribution to downstream water quality and quantity from the program the payment standards can be updated in stages managers upstream will enhance water and sewage regulation and implement strict water control mechanisms thus ensuring benefits downstream after implementation of pldlp the input structure and output of the cultivation changed and the net income of farmers decreased by 8802 68 cny hm2 41 65 however after pldlp labor force demand decreased by 135 people per hm2 44 78 if we consider the opportunity cost of labor then net income of farmers decreased by 2322 68 cny hm2 10 99 changes in land use via the pldlp changed the load of non point source pollution and the total load reduction of tn and tp in downstream areas was 24 30 104 kg 27 63 and 0 99 104kg 88 53 respectively as requirements for irrigation water of corn are smaller than rice in northern china runoff to reservoir increased by 510 78 104 m3 4 22 the payment standard is 5165 41 cny hm2 without considering the cost of household labor if labor income of migrant workers is used as an opportunity cost for farmers the payment standard is actually 1362 95 cny hm2 acknowledgements this research was supported by the china national key r d plan 2017yfc0506402 and as a special research institute project of the chinse academy of

technique for efficient consumption of precipitation that increases water accessibility to crops at critical growth stages however this system has not yet been characterized under simulated rainfall

planting tf under three levels of simulated precipitation 1 275 mm 2 200 mm 3 125 mm with two limited irrigation levels 150 mm or 75 mm the topsoil from 5 to 25 cm temperature and et were significantly higher under tf planting than in the rf system which increased both soil moisture between 0 200 cm and soil respiration rate during different growth stages the rf system also regulated soil temperature and respiration rate reduced et 46 and prolonged the period of water accessibility which led to exhibited fast and stable seedling establishment the average grain yield increased by 10 6 and 12 6 for rf1150 and rf175 compared to tf1150 and tf175 and increased by 18 9 and 22 5 for rf2150 and rf275 as compared to tf2150 and tf275 while rf3150 and rf375 treatments significantly increased by 14 3 and 8 9 as compared to tf3150 and tf375 respectively average wue significantly improved by p 0 05 in rf1150 rf175 rf2150 rf275 rf3150 and rf375 were 53 3 56 4 75 8 85 1 68 2 and 75 3 compared to tf planting respectively as precipitation increased from 200 to 275 mm there were no significant increases in moisture contents soil respiration rate et wue and grain yield under both planting models therefore we concluded that the rf2150 treatment is suitable as a water saving technology to achieve higher wheat production and wue in semi arid agro ecosystems of china keywords soil respiration rate ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting simulated rainfall limited irrigation grain yield wue soil water content 1 introduction rainwater is the major water source in rain fed agro ecosystems of china and winter wheat crop productivity mainly depends on unpredictable and limited rainfall moret and arrue 2007 rain fed areas in china have annual mean precipitation of 380 mm and 59 of the precipitation occurs between july and september govaerts et al 2009 in addition heavy storms in the spring combined with high solar radiation and air temperature in the summer increase annual evaporation and soil temperature but reduce soil moisture contents which causes water scarcity nagaz et al 2012 improvement of water saving techniques is required to deal with the inadequate rainwater resources in this region and to improve water use efficiency wue richards et al 2002 the ridge furrow rf precipitation harvesting technique has been used in rain fed areas in order to solve the problem of water scarcity bronick and lal 2005 the rf system significantly increases the utilization of rainwater improves soil water content and reduces soil temperature and evapotranspiration rate due to increased wue and soil respiration rate hu et al 2014 under the rf system the ridges are covered with a plastic film creating a precipitation collection zone the furrows are used as a sowing zone and is not covered with a plastic film moret and arrue 2007 jia et al 2018 the rf technique can increase moisture contents by accumulating water from light precipitation and preserving runoff from heavy rainfall lampurlanes et al 2002 plastic film mulching also reduces soil evaporation and extends the duration of water accessibility to critical growth stages thereby improving wheat productivity wue and soil respiration rate ali et al 2017 the rf system increases soil moisture by 5 12 at the 200 cm soil layer depth under simulated precipitation of 230 mm and increases grain yield by 75 ren et al 2008 therefore the rf system is an efficient technique for increased use of precipitation and increased crop production in rain fed regions of china malagnoux 2006 limited irrigation li with the rf technique might be a realistic solution to provide water during key crop growth stages xiao et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 li is an efficient strategy for improving winter wheat production olesen et al 2000 oweis and hachum 2006 however excessive irrigation can increase evapotranspiration dry matter and leaf area per plant but it does not significantly increase grain yield wue and it reduces the soil respiration rate kang et al 2002 jia et al 2017 soil respiration is mainly produced by the microbial oxidation of organic matter and root respiration and is an indicator of soil quality and soil moisture content govaerts et al 2009 wang et al 2009 studied the effect of limited irrigation on soil respiration rate and the results revealed that soil respiration rate improved with increasing irrigation but that over irrigation inhibited soil respiration zhang et al 2009 reported that heavy rainfall suppressed the soil respiration rate by 33 the unnecessary losses of limited irrigation and precipitation lead to reduced winter wheat production in semi arid agro ecosystems of china wei et al 2018 crop cultivation techniques have greatly improved after switching from traditional flat tf planting to the rf rainfall harvesting system to increase the productivity of runoff and collect the maximum amount of precipitation which could increase wue of natural rainfall schwen et al 2011 our research group has carried out many trials using the rf technique since the dry land farming system project started in semi arid regions of china whereas earlier studies focused mostly on water regulation wu et al 2015 kargas et al 2012 fertilizer application rates zhang et al 2009 and ridge covering mulching materials ren et al 2008 the objectives of the present study is to explore 1 the effect of rf system on winter wheat grain yield and wue 2 the effect of simulated rainfall with limited irrigation conditions under the rf system on soil water contents in various soil layers soil temperature et rate soil respiration rate and crop development 3 the establishment of the befitting rainfall range for rainwater harvesting under semi arid climate we expect that this study will completely support the rf system and provide mechanisms for efficient consumption of simulated precipitation as well as limited irrigation in semi arid agro ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description and design field trials were conducted from 2015 to 2017 at northwest a f university yangling shaanxi province in china 34 20 n 108 24 e 466 7 m above sea

used to manage natural rainfall on rainy days the research trial consisted of two planting patterns rf ridge furrow rainfall collection and tf traditional flat planting with three precipitation levels 1 275 mm 2 200 mm 3 125 mm and two limited irrigation 150 mm and 75 mm levels in a randomized complete block design rcbd with three replications half of the limited irrigation was supplied on december 12 2015 and december 15 2016 before the re wintering stage and the other half was supplied on march 28 2016 and march 25 2017 at the jointing stage with the help of a precise water meter the limited irrigation volumes of 150 and 75 mm were measured according to the irrigation area the irrigation area for the tf planting treatment was 6 3 m2 2 0 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volumes were 0 95 and 0 47 m3 under 150 and 75 mm respectively the irrigation area of the two furrows under the rf technique was 3 78 m2 1 2 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volumes of the two furrows were 0 57 and 0 28 m3 the rf technique had a ridge height of 15 cm with furrow and ridge widths of 60 40 cm a plastic film with 0 008 mm thickness was used to cover all ridges with hidden edges of 4 5 cm deep in the soil four rows of wheat were planted in furrows fig 2 the width and length of each plot was 2 0 m 3 15 m each plot was separated by 17 cm thick concrete walls to prevent inter exchange of soil moisture content weeds were controlled manually during each winter wheat growing season wheat cultivar xinong 979 was planted at the rate of 2 250 000 seeds ha 1 seeds were planted with an inter row space of 20 cm on october 15 in 2015 and on october 10 in 2016 wheat was hand harvested on june 2 in 2016 and on may 27 in 2017 all of the nitrogen urea and phosphorus diammonium phosphate were applied at the time of planting at the rates of 225 and 75 kg ha 1 respectively in this study simulated rainfall was used and no natural rainfall was allowed during the wheat growing season fig 3 simulated rainfall was applied according to methods from previous studies liu et al 2013 ali et al 2017 complete detail of the rainfall conditions can be seen in table 1 in this rainfall simulator study the amount of rainwater measured under field conditions was reasonably similar to natural rainfall amounts 2 2 sampling and measurement 2 2 1 soil moisture content moisture content was determined in the furrows at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 200 cm at the seedling jointing flowering grain filling and harvesting stages from 2015 to 2017 moisture content at 20 cm intervals in 0 200 cm soil layers was recorded using a tdr meter time domain reflectometry trase system soil moisture equipment corp germany 2 2 2 soil temperature a set of mercury in glass geo thermometers with bent stems were installed in the middle of a furrow in each plot at soil depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm to determine soil temperature the soil temperature was recorded at 08 10 12 14 16 and 18 h daily over 10 day intervals starting at 50 80 110 140 170 200 and 230 days after sowing 2 2 3 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency evapotranspiration et mm for individual plots was determined for seasonal total and between the growing stages using the soil water balance eq 1 li et al 2016 1 et p i c d r δw where p mm is the total precipitation i mm is the limited irrigation c is the upward flow into the root zone d is the downward drainage out of the root zone r is the surface runoff from each plot and δw mm is the soil moisture content for the 0 200 cm soil depths between planting time and maturity stage or between the growth stages the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat there were no heavy rains or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant over 200 cm depth water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following eq 2 huang et al 2005 2 wue y et where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 and et is the total evapotranspiration mm over the growing season 2 2 4 soil respiration rate soil respiration rates were recorded in the field using an li 8100 automated soil co2 flux system connected with temperature and moisture sensors at the tillering re wintering jointing flowering and grain filling stages of the winter wheat crop 2 2 5 lai total dry matter accumulations and grain yield five plants were randomly selected from each plot at the tillering re wintering jointing flowering and grain filling stages and leaf area per plant was calculated in cm2 using software win folia pro 2007b and a scanner machine epson perfection 4990 during the study years 2015 16 and 2016 17 the lai was calculated using the following formula 3 lai la ga where la is the leaf area per plant m2 and ga is the ground m2 the total biomass accumulation per plant at each growth stage was determined after furnace drying at 100 c for 1 h followed by 70 c for a minimum of 69 h four central rows of wheat were hand harvested from each plot and the grain yield and harvest index were calculated including the combined area of the ridges and furrows 2 2 6 statistical analysis the data were analysed using an analysis of variance anova and data obtained from each sampling event were analysed separately multiple comparisons were tested with duncan s new multiple range test mean values were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 if the f tests were significant all data were analysed in spss 18 0 3 results 3 1 soil water content the soil water content swc profiles from various growth stages at soil depths of 0 200 cm are shown in figs 4 and 5 during 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively there were no significant differences in swc among different treatments within each of the planting models at the seedling stage of both experimental years but the swc in the rf system was slightly higher 22 than in tf planting at the depth of 0 20 cm in both study years at the jointing stage the swc under rf1150 and rf2150 treatments increased 33 and 30 significantly as compared with tf1150 and tf2150 treatments under the rf model swc increased 29 compared to tf treatments among soil layers at the depth of 0 200 cm at all growth stages there differences in swc were not significant between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments at a depth of 0 200 cm at the grain filling and harvesting stages at the flowering and grain filling stages the swc between 0 and 60 cm increased while from 60 to 200 cm the swc decreased trend under both planting models and study years furthermore the swc increased under both planting models as the simulated rainfall amounts and limited irrigation increased there were small differences between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments and between the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments where the swc levels were significantly higher than the rest of the treatments at all growth stages however at the maturity stage the swc under the rf system increased 53 compared to tf at the depth of 0 80 cm which implies that the plants under the rf system took up less water from the deeper soil layer than plants under tf planting 3 2 soil temperature the soil temperatures at 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 25 cm soil depths in the tf375 treatment were greater than in the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments for all growth stages of winter wheat especially after the grain filling stage 200 230 dap fig 6 there were no significant differences among any of the other treatments usually the tf planting pattern had higher 1 76 c soil temperature compared to the rf model under different precipitation concentrations and limited irrigation levels after planting winter wheat the soil temperature gradually decreased up to 110 dap but after 110 dap the soil temperature increased in all treatments at different soil depths a lower 4 13 c soil temperature was observed in the rf1150 treatment compared to the tf3150 treatment at different soil depths in both study years as the winter wheat canopy improved after 170 dap a lower 11 13 c and 10 66 c soil temperature was recorded at a depth of 5 cm in the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments compared to the tf375 treatment increasing precipitation amounts and limited irrigation levels resulted in decreasing soil temperatures under both planting models soil temperature under the tf375 treatment at 10 cm soil depth was significantly higher 1 23 c than rf375 treatment in both study years in addition the soil temperatures at the depths of 0 5 and 5 10 cm in the rf1150 rf2150 and rf3150 treatments were lower than in tf3150 treatment at the flowering stage 170 dap grain filling stage 200 dap and maturity stage 230 dap however in the rf system from 50 dap up to 140 dap the soil temperatures at 10 15 15 20 and 20 25 cm soil depths were not significantly different than in the tf planting pattern 3 3 evapotranspiration rate et there were obvious differences in et among the treatments throughout the winter wheat growing period table 2 for all winter wheat growth stages the utilization of water occurred mostly by soil evaporation and the et rate under tf planting was higher than in the rf model with different precipitation amounts and limited irrigation plastic mulching on ridges decreased soil evaporation and the et rate under the rf model causing values in the rf system to be lower than in tf planting throughout the winter wheat growing period as the simulated rainfall amounts increased the et rate increased during the first two growth stages 0 30 30 60 dap and the last three growth stages under both planting models 120 150 150 180 180 210 dap the et rate decreased gradually in the early growth stages 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 dap increased rapidly in the middle growth stage 120 150 dap and gradually decreased in the later growth stages 150 180 180 210 dap under tf150 treatment simulated precipitation of 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm significantly affected the et rate compared to rf150 treatment table 2 over all growth stages the average et rate under tf150 with 275 mm rainfall level was significantly increased by 132 mm and 191 mm compared to rf1150 and rf2150 treatments respectively 3 4 soil respiration rate the rf model with simulated precipitation had a significant effect on soil respiration rate under limited irrigation conditions at some growth stages of winter wheat during both study years fig 7 soil respiration rates under the rf system with 275 mm and 200 mm precipitation levels were not significantly different at jointing flowering or grain filling stages during the 2015 2017 growing seasons in 2015 16 at tillering stage ts re wintering stage rws jointing stage js flowering stage fs and grain filling stage gfs soil respiration rates in the rf1150 treatment were greater by 11 1 7 8 2 4 38 8 and 66 9 respectively compared to tf1150 and rates in the rf2150 treatment were greater by 2 3 1 3 2 0 31 7 and 64 0 respectively compared to tf2150 treatment during 2016 17 at ts rws js fs and gfs soil respiration rates in the rf1150 treatment were greater by 1 0 9 6 18 8 41 3 and 2 8 respectively compared to tf1150 and rates in the rf2150 treatment were greater by 3 0 1 6 13 1 14 3 and 4 5 respectively compared to tf2150 treatment the soil respiration rates under rf150 treatment with 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall concentrations were not significantly different at various growth stages of winter wheat crop during 2015 2017 3 5 crop development early winter wheat growth was faster under tf treatments compared to the rf system in both study years resulting in a shorter time to reach maturity table 3 the jointing date of the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments was earlier than in rf1150 and rf2150 treatments by 7 10 days in 2015 16 and 8 10 days in 2016 17 which showed that there was shorter vegetative growth duration in tf treatment compared to the rf system under simulated rainfall conditions regardless of the level of limited irrigation the flowering date of the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments was 8 9 days earlier in 2015 16 and 7 9 days earlier in 2016 17 compared to rf1150 and rf2150 treatments furthermore the physiological maturity date of plants in the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments was earlier by 6 days in 2015 16 and 6 5 days in 2016 17 compared to rf1150 and rf2150 treatments 3 6 total dry matter accumulation and leaf area index lai at different simulated precipitation levels the lai and biomass accumulation per plant were significantly higher under the rf model compared to tf planting fig 8 table 4 during both growing seasons there were no significant differences in dry matter root shoot per plant and lai from tillering to re wintering growth stages under both planting models the dry matter per plant increased gradually at tillering and re wintering rapidly at jointing and flowering and reached a peak value at the ripeness stage table 4 there were no significant variations in the total dry matter with precipitation above 200 mm under both planting models during different growth stages the differences between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant but both had higher biomass accumulation than tf1150 and tf2150 treatments respectively the differences in the lai started at the jointing stage achieved a peak value in the flowering stage and then slowly decreased from the flowering to late grain filling stage due to leaf senescence limited irrigation had a significant influence on lai under both planting models except at the tillering and re wintering stages fig 8 however rf1150 treatment slightly increased the lai during different growth stages but differences between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant during the later grain filling stage the lai under both planting models with 125 mm simulated rainfall declined much more than that in the treatments with rainfall levels between 200 and 275 mm which shows that an inadequate water supply can lead to early leaf senescence 3 7 yield water use efficiency and harvest index the grain yield and wue of winter wheat were significantly different under both planting models with simulated precipitation and limited irrigation table 5 the grain yield and wue increased with simulated precipitation and limited irrigation but differences were not significant when the rainfall was above 200 mm under both planting models under simulated precipitation with limited irrigation the rf system led to a maximum grain yield than tf treatment the average of two year data indicated that the rf model improved soil moisture content and soil respiration rate but reduced soil temperature and et rate therefore rf produced a 15 higher grain yield 0 79 t ha 1 than tf planting the two year average of grain yield showed that rf2150 and rf275 treatments were significantly increased by 1 19 t ha 1 18 90 and 1 15 t ha 1 22 50 respectively compared to tf planting wue increased along with the increase in grain yield the wue improved by 9 04 kg mm 1 ha 1 68 53 under the rf model compared to tf treatment due to decreased soil temperature and et rate compared with tf1150 and tf175 treatments average wue under rf1150 and rf175 treatments were significantly increased by 8 12 kg mm 1 ha 1 and 7 73 kg mm 1 ha 1 respectively mean wue of rf2150 and rf275 were significantly increased by 12 39 kg mm 1 ha 1 and 11 29 kg mm 1 ha 1 respectively compared to tf2150 and tf275 the harvest index hi ranged from 35 72 to 45 84 in 2015 16 the rf system under different simulated rainfall had a significantly higher hi compared to tf treatment limited irrigation had no significant effect under rf system compared to tf planting in 2016 17 the rf1150 treatment had a significantly p 0 05 higher hi of 46 05 among different treatments but hi was not significantly different from rf2150 or tf1150 treatments 4 discussion 4 1 soil water temperature and respiration rate water saving agriculture practices has been developed all over the world due to gradually rising global temperatures crop cultivation techniques have greatly improved after switching from flat planting to the rf rainfall harvesting system to increase the efficiency of runoff and collect the maximum amount of precipitation which could increase soil water content and wue in crops where natural precipitation and limited irrigation are used angus and herwaarden 2001 plastic mulching reduces the loss of soil moisture and evaporation and increases soil water content due to the greater rainwater harvesting efficiencies from the ridge furrow planting pattern ramakrishna et al 2006 zougmore et al 2003 the rf system can improve the soil moisture condition by collecting water from light rainfall reducing unproductive evaporation and promoting rainfall infiltration li et al 2001 wang et al 2009 in present study we found that at the jointing stage the swc under rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were significantly increased compared to tf planting at the flowering and grain filling stages the swc at soil depths from 0 to 60 cm increased while from 60 to 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting models furthermore the swc increased under both planting models as the simulated rainfall amounts and limited irrigation increased at all growth stages however in the maturity stage swc under the rf model increased between 0 and 80 cm compared to tf which showed that the plants under the rf system took up less water from the deeper soil layer the higher soil water content under the rf model has two key justifications the first is decreased soil evaporation ren et al 2010 showed that ridges covered with plastic film can efficiently save more rainwater in the soil than conventional flat planting thereby reducing losses by evaporation from the covered ridges moret and arrue 2007 the second justification is that the rf cultivation is better for using light rain hu et al 2014 which is why the soil water content under the rf system was higher than tf planting during all growth stages ren et al 2008 reported that under simulated precipitation of 230 340 and 440 mm in the rf system the swc in the 0 200 cm soil depth were 2 3 5 2 and 4 5 greater than in tf treatment respectively soil moisture and temperature are essential for crop development zhou et al 2012 the use of plastic film mulch prevents water and heat exchange between soil and air thereby reducing latent heat flux zhou et al 2009 earlier studies have suggested that the rf system can decrease soil temperature govaerts et al 2006 and increase soil moisture keyantash and dracup 2002 klumpp et al 2007 thereby increasing grain yield we also found higher soil temperatures under the tf planting pattern compared to the rf model under different rainfall amounts and limited irrigation after planting winter wheat the soil temperature gradually decreased up to 110 dap but after 110 dap the soil temperature increased in all treatments at different soil depths as the winter wheat canopy increased after 170 dap lower soil temperatures were recorded at a depth of 5 cm in the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments compared to tf planting several studies have shown that suitable temperatures during the early stage of crop growth can greatly accelerate grain germination and crop yield ren et al 2016 increasing precipitation concentrations and limited irrigation levels resulted in decreasing soil temperatures under both planting models in addition soil temperatures at the depths of 0 5 and 5 10 cm in the rf1150 rf2150 and tf1150 treatments were lower than tf2150 and tf3150 treatments at the flowering stage 170 dap grain filling stage 200 dap and the maturity stage 230 dap li et al 2001 showed that the average soil temperature at a depth of 10 cm in plastic film mulched plots was 0 5 4 5 c greater than that in non mulched plots however under the rf system from 50 dap up to 140 dap the soil temperatures at 10 15 cm 15 20 cm and 20 25 cm soil depths were not significantly different from temperatures in the tf planting pattern wang et al 2005 found that early during the growing season the topsoil temperature in an rf system was 3 0 6 8 c lower than in an uncovered flat planting treatment whereas later in the growing season no difference was found between the two conditions zhang et al 2009 also suggested that soil temperatures under tf planting were higher than in the rf system in warmer climates gan et al 2013 also revealed that tf planting significantly improved soil temperature and evaporation but decreased soil water storage soil respiration is mainly produced by microbial oxidation of organic matter and root respiration and is an indicator of soil quality soil temperature and soil water contents azooz and arshad 2001 ronga et al 2015 during the 2015 2017 growing seasons the rf system at the jointing and flowering stages with 275 mm and 200 mm precipitation levels showed significantly higher soil respiration rates than in tf planting soil respiration rates under the rf system with 275 mm and 200 mm precipitation levels were not significantly different at the jointing flowering or grain filling stages in 2015 16 at ts rws js fs and gfs soil respiration rates of rf2150 treatment were greater than in the tf2150 treatment by 2 3 1 3 2 0 31 7 and 64 0 respectively during 2016 17 at the ts rws js fs and gfs soil respiration rates of rf2150 treatment were greater than in tf2150 treatment by 3 0 1 6 13 1 14 3 and 4 5 respectively the soil respiration rate under rf150 treatment with 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall amounts had no significant differences at various growth stages of winter wheat crop during 2015 2017 fig 7 wang et al 2011 studied the effect of limited irrigation on soil respiration rate and the results revealed that soil respiration rate improved with increasing irrigation amount but over irrigation inhibited soil respiration zhang et al 2007 studied the response of soil respiration rate to heavy rainfall in the winter wheat crop and found that heavy rainfall inhibited soil respiration rate during wet growing season the rainfall on the soil to suppress 33 soil respiration rate govaerts et al 2009 4 2 et et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration and under the rf system transpiration contributes more to et rate than in tf planting morris et al 2010 schwen et al 2011 mulching on ridges decreased the evaporation and et under rf treatments than that of tf treatments ren et al 2008 feng et al 2016 we also found that as the simulated rainfall amounts increased the et rate increased during the last three growth stages under both planting models 120 150 150 180 180 210 dap the et rate decreased gradually in the early growth stages 0 120 dap increased rapidly in the middle growth stage 120 150 dap and gradually decreased in the late growth stage 150 210 dap under tf150 treatment simulated precipitation of 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm significantly table 2 affected the et rate while the differences were no significant between rf150 and tf75 treatments under 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm precipitation levels during the whole growing season therefore the rf system obtained a lower total et compared with tf planting as reported by wen et al 2012 and wang et al 2015 the average et rate under tf150 with 275 mm rainfall was significantly increased by 132 mm and 191 mm compared to rf1150 and rf2150 treatments respectively liu et al 2015 also reported that ridges covered with plastic film encourage crop transpiration with little soil evaporation earlier studies have revealed that ridges covered with plastic film can change crop water utilization patterns because they can reduce evaporation enhance transpiration and change soil water evaporation into crop transpiration thereby decreasing et rate and improving wue andersson et al 2014 li et al 2016 4 3 total dry matter accumulation and leaf area index lai at different simulated precipitation concentrations the total dry matter per plant and lai were significantly higher under the rf model than in the tf model fig 8 table 4 the maximum dry matter accumulation and lai were achieved with limited irrigation in the rf system rostamza et al 2011 ali et al 2016 under both planting models there were no significant differences in total dry matter root shoot per plant and lai from the tillering to re wintering growth stages there were no significant differences in total dry matter when precipitation was above 200 mm under both planting models the differences between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant and both treatments had higher biomass accumulation than tf treatments ren et al 2008 confirmed that under the rf model the best precipitation ranges were between 230 and 440 mm and the increases in total dry matter accumulation and lai limited irrigation had a significant influence on green lai except at the tillering and re wintering stages fig 8 rf1150 treatment slightly improved the lai during different growth stages but the differences between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant earlier studies revealed that a plastic film can maintain soil temperature and improve soil water content and soil respiration rate thereby improving crop growth as a result of a significant increase in the dry matter accumulation and lai at different growth stages duan et al 2006 sadras 2003 in the later grain filling stage the lai under both planting models with 125 mm simulated rainfall tended to decline much more than that in the treatments with rainfall levels between 200 and 275 mm which showed that an inadequate water supply can lead to early leaf yellowing li et al 2001 also found that total dry matter and lai did not significantly increase under the rf system when heavy rainfall occurred 4 4 grain yield wue and hi the grain yield and wue tended to improve with precipitation and limited irrigation but the differences were not significant under both planting models when the rainfall exceeded 200 mm li et al 2001 reported that the optimum simulated precipitation for the rf system was 230 440 mm and there were no significant increases in the grain yield and wue when the simulated rainfall exceeded 440 mm we also found that the rf model improved moisture contents and soil respiration rate and reduced soil temperature and et rate therefore producing maximum grain yield 15 compared to tf treatment the rf system can efficiently maintain a higher swc during maize growth thereby promoting crop growth and increasing wue and grain yield gan et al 2013 hu et al 2014 reported that the rf model can make better use of light rainfall causing crops to have more access to water than tf planting promoting a higher grain yield ali et al 2017 reported that there is no need to use the rf model in regions with greater than 200 mm of rainfall under the rf model when rainfall exceeds 340 mm had non significant increase in grain yield ren et al 2008 in our study we found that the wue was increased by 68 53 under the rf model compared to tf treatment due to a decreasing soil temperature and et rate the highest wue was found under the rf system due to lower et with high grain yield nielsen and vigil 2005 it has been confirmed that ridges covered with plastic film can significantly increase the wue wang et al 2015 hi ranged from 35 72 to 45 84 in 2015 16 the rf system under different simulated rainfall had a significantly higher hi compared to tf treatment limited irrigation had no significant effect under the rf model compared to tf treatment in 2016 17 the data illustrated that the hi in the rf1150 treatment was significantly higher by 46 05 among different treatments but hi was not significantly different from rf2150 and tf1150 treatments therefore rf2150 treatment is suitable as a water saving technology for achieving higher winter wheat production and wue in the rain fed areas of china 5 conclusions the rf method is a technique for efficient consumption of precipitation and for improving moisture content in addition to facilitating a limited irrigation strategy for winter wheat in the rain fed areas of china in the present study the rf technique with 200 mm precipitation and 150 mm limited irrigation achieved fast and stable seedling establishment due to its high moisture content regulated soil temperature and respiration rate reduced et at field scale and prolonged the period of water accessibility which led to longer growth duration thus significantly enhancing winter wheat yield and wue compared to tf planting simulated precipitation with limited irrigation has significant effects on total biomass and lai and wue under the rf technique there were no significant increases in soil respiration rate et lai soil temperature soil water contents wue crop development and grain yield when precipitation increased from 200 to 275 mm under both planting models therefore we suggest the rf2150 treatment as water saving technology and a promising strategy to achieving higher winter wheat production and wue in the rain fed areas of china or other similar rain fed regions in the world future study is needed to investigate the impact of rf system on crops production runoff use efficiency and economic benefit under different ridge furrow ratios ridge covering materials soil types slopes and plant species using biodegradable mulching materials such as grass hay wood chips wood fibers and straw

11452,the development of effective water saving farming practices have been vitally important for increasing wheat productivity in semi arid regions of china ridge furrow rf rainfall harvesting is a technique for efficient consumption of precipitation that increases water accessibility to crops at critical growth stages however this system has not yet been characterized under simulated rainfall conditions with limited irrigation a two year field study was carried out from oct 2015 to may 2017 to investigate the potential role of two planting models 1 the rf system and 2 traditional flat planting tf under three levels of simulated precipitation 1 275 mm 2 200 mm 3 125 mm with two limited irrigation levels 150 mm or 75 mm the topsoil from 5 to 25 cm temperature and et were significantly higher under tf planting than in the rf system which increased both soil moisture between 0 200 cm and soil respiration rate during different growth stages the rf system also regulated soil temperature and respiration rate reduced et 46 and prolonged the period of water accessibility which led to exhibited fast and stable seedling establishment the average grain yield increased by 10 6 and 12 6 for rf1150 and rf175 compared to tf1150 and tf175 and increased by 18 9 and 22 5 for rf2150 and rf275 as compared to tf2150 and tf275 while rf3150 and rf375 treatments significantly increased by 14 3 and 8 9 as compared to tf3150 and tf375 respectively average wue significantly improved by p 0 05 in rf1150 rf175 rf2150 rf275 rf3150 and rf375 were 53 3 56 4 75 8 85 1 68 2 and 75 3 compared to tf planting respectively as precipitation increased from 200 to 275 mm there were no significant increases in moisture contents soil respiration rate et wue and grain yield under both planting models therefore we concluded that the rf2150 treatment is suitable as a water saving technology to achieve higher wheat production and wue in semi arid agro ecosystems of china keywords soil respiration rate ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting simulated rainfall limited irrigation grain yield wue soil water content 1 introduction rainwater is the major water source in rain fed agro ecosystems of china and winter wheat crop productivity mainly depends on unpredictable and limited rainfall moret and arrue 2007 rain fed areas in china have annual mean precipitation of 380 mm and 59 of the precipitation occurs between july and september govaerts et al 2009 in addition heavy storms in the spring combined with high solar radiation and air temperature in the summer increase annual evaporation and soil temperature but reduce soil moisture contents which causes water scarcity nagaz et al 2012 improvement of water saving techniques is required to deal with the inadequate rainwater resources in this region and to improve water use efficiency wue richards et al 2002 the ridge furrow rf precipitation harvesting technique has been used in rain fed areas in order to solve the problem of water scarcity bronick and lal 2005 the rf system significantly increases the utilization of rainwater improves soil water content and reduces soil temperature and evapotranspiration rate due to increased wue and soil respiration rate hu et al 2014 under the rf system the ridges are covered with a plastic film creating a precipitation collection zone the furrows are used as a sowing zone and is not covered with a plastic film moret and arrue 2007 jia et al 2018 the rf technique can increase moisture contents by accumulating water from light precipitation and preserving runoff from heavy rainfall lampurlanes et al 2002 plastic film mulching also reduces soil evaporation and extends the duration of water accessibility to critical growth stages thereby improving wheat productivity wue and soil respiration rate ali et al 2017 the rf system increases soil moisture by 5 12 at the 200 cm soil layer depth under simulated precipitation of 230 mm and increases grain yield by 75 ren et al 2008 therefore the rf system is an efficient technique for increased use of precipitation and increased crop production in rain fed regions of china malagnoux 2006 limited irrigation li with the rf technique might be a realistic solution to provide water during key crop growth stages xiao et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 li is an efficient strategy for improving winter wheat production olesen et al 2000 oweis and hachum 2006 however excessive irrigation can increase evapotranspiration dry matter and leaf area per plant but it does not significantly increase grain yield wue and it reduces the soil respiration rate kang et al 2002 jia et al 2017 soil respiration is mainly produced by the microbial oxidation of organic matter and root respiration and is an indicator of soil quality and soil moisture content govaerts et al 2009 wang et al 2009 studied the effect of limited irrigation on soil respiration rate and the results revealed that soil respiration rate improved with increasing irrigation but that over irrigation inhibited soil respiration zhang et al 2009 reported that heavy rainfall suppressed the soil respiration rate by 33 the unnecessary losses of limited irrigation and precipitation lead to reduced winter wheat production in semi arid agro ecosystems of china wei et al 2018 crop cultivation techniques have greatly improved after switching from traditional flat tf planting to the rf rainfall harvesting system to increase the productivity of runoff and collect the maximum amount of precipitation which could increase wue of natural rainfall schwen et al 2011 our research group has carried out many trials using the rf technique since the dry land farming system project started in semi arid regions of china whereas earlier studies focused mostly on water regulation wu et al 2015 kargas et al 2012 fertilizer application rates zhang et al 2009 and ridge covering mulching materials ren et al 2008 the objectives of the present study is to explore 1 the effect of rf system on winter wheat grain yield and wue 2 the effect of simulated rainfall with limited irrigation conditions under the rf system on soil water contents in various soil layers soil temperature et rate soil respiration rate and crop development 3 the establishment of the befitting rainfall range for rainwater harvesting under semi arid climate we expect that this study will completely support the rf system and provide mechanisms for efficient consumption of simulated precipitation as well as limited irrigation in semi arid agro ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description and design field trials were conducted from 2015 to 2017 at northwest a f university yangling shaanxi province in china 34 20 n 108 24 e 466 7 m above sea

used to manage natural rainfall on rainy days the research trial consisted of two planting patterns rf ridge furrow rainfall collection and tf traditional flat planting with three precipitation levels 1 275 mm 2 200 mm 3 125 mm and two limited irrigation 150 mm and 75 mm levels in a randomized complete block design rcbd with three replications half of the limited irrigation was supplied on december 12 2015 and december 15 2016 before the re wintering stage and the other half was supplied on march 28 2016 and march 25 2017 at the jointing stage with the help of a precise water meter the limited irrigation volumes of 150 and 75 mm were measured according to the irrigation area the irrigation area for the tf planting treatment was 6 3 m2 2 0 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volumes were 0 95 and 0 47 m3 under 150 and 75 mm respectively the irrigation area of the two furrows under the rf technique was 3 78 m2 1 2 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volumes of the two furrows were 0 57 and 0 28 m3 the rf technique had a ridge height of 15 cm with furrow and ridge widths of 60 40 cm a plastic film with 0 008 mm thickness was used to cover all ridges with hidden edges of 4 5 cm deep in the soil four rows of wheat were planted in furrows fig 2 the width and length of each plot was 2 0 m 3 15 m each plot was separated by 17 cm thick concrete walls to prevent inter exchange of soil moisture content weeds were controlled manually during each winter wheat growing season wheat cultivar xinong 979 was planted at the rate of 2 250 000 seeds ha 1 seeds were planted with an inter row space of 20 cm on october 15 in 2015 and on october 10 in 2016 wheat was hand harvested on june 2 in 2016 and on may 27 in 2017 all of the nitrogen urea and phosphorus diammonium phosphate were applied at the time of planting at the rates of 225 and 75 kg ha 1 respectively in this study simulated rainfall was used and no natural rainfall was allowed during the wheat growing season fig 3 simulated rainfall was applied according to methods from previous studies liu et al 2013 ali et al 2017 complete detail of the rainfall conditions can be seen in table 1 in this rainfall simulator study the amount of rainwater measured under field conditions was reasonably similar to natural rainfall amounts 2 2 sampling and measurement 2 2 1 soil moisture content moisture content was determined in the furrows at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 200 cm at the seedling jointing flowering grain filling and harvesting stages from 2015 to 2017 moisture content at 20 cm intervals in 0 200 cm soil layers was recorded using a tdr meter time domain reflectometry trase system soil moisture equipment corp germany 2 2 2 soil temperature a set of mercury in glass geo thermometers with bent stems were installed in the middle of a furrow in each plot at soil depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm to determine soil temperature the soil temperature was recorded at 08 10 12 14 16 and 18 h daily over 10 day intervals starting at 50 80 110 140 170 200 and 230 days after sowing 2 2 3 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency evapotranspiration et mm for individual plots was determined for seasonal total and between the growing stages using the soil water balance eq 1 li et al 2016 1 et p i c d r δw where p mm is the total precipitation i mm is the limited irrigation c is the upward flow into the root zone d is the downward drainage out of the root zone r is the surface runoff from each plot and δw mm is the soil moisture content for the 0 200 cm soil depths between planting time and maturity stage or between the growth stages the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat there were no heavy rains or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant over 200 cm depth water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following eq 2 huang et al 2005 2 wue y et where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 and et is the total evapotranspiration mm over the growing season 2 2 4 soil respiration rate soil respiration rates were recorded in the field using an li 8100 automated soil co2 flux system connected with temperature and moisture sensors at the tillering re wintering jointing flowering and grain filling stages of the winter wheat crop 2 2 5 lai total dry matter accumulations and grain yield five plants were randomly selected from each plot at the tillering re wintering jointing flowering and grain filling stages and leaf area per plant was calculated in cm2 using software win folia pro 2007b and a scanner machine epson perfection 4990 during the study years 2015 16 and 2016 17 the lai was calculated using the following formula 3 lai la ga where la is the leaf area per plant m2 and ga is the ground m2 the total biomass accumulation per plant at each growth stage was determined after furnace drying at 100 c for 1 h followed by 70 c for a minimum of 69 h four central rows of wheat were hand harvested from each plot and the grain yield and harvest index were calculated including the combined area of the ridges and furrows 2 2 6 statistical analysis the data were analysed using an analysis of variance anova and data obtained from each sampling event were analysed separately multiple comparisons were tested with duncan s new multiple range test mean values were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 if the f tests were significant all data were analysed in spss 18 0 3 results 3 1 soil water content the soil water content swc profiles from various growth stages at soil depths of 0 200 cm are shown in figs 4 and 5 during 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively there were no significant differences in swc among different treatments within each of the planting models at the seedling stage of both experimental years but the swc in the rf system was slightly higher 22 than in tf planting at the depth of 0 20 cm in both study years at the jointing stage the swc under rf1150 and rf2150 treatments increased 33 and 30 significantly as compared with tf1150 and tf2150 treatments under the rf model swc increased 29 compared to tf treatments among soil layers at the depth of 0 200 cm at all growth stages there differences in swc were not significant between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments at a depth of 0 200 cm at the grain filling and harvesting stages at the flowering and grain filling stages the swc between 0 and 60 cm increased while from 60 to 200 cm the swc decreased trend under both planting models and study years furthermore the swc increased under both planting models as the simulated rainfall amounts and limited irrigation increased there were small differences between the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments and between the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments where the swc levels were significantly higher than the rest of the treatments at all growth stages however at the maturity stage the swc under the rf system increased 53 compared to tf at the depth of 0 80 cm which implies that the plants under the rf system took up less water from the deeper soil layer than plants under tf planting 3 2 soil temperature the soil temperatures at 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 25 cm soil depths in the tf375 treatment were greater than in the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments for all growth stages of winter wheat especially after the grain filling stage 200 230 dap fig 6 there were no significant differences among any of the other treatments usually the tf planting pattern had higher 1 76 c soil temperature compared to the rf model under different precipitation concentrations and limited irrigation levels after planting winter wheat the soil temperature gradually decreased up to 110 dap but after 110 dap the soil temperature increased in all treatments at different soil depths a lower 4 13 c soil temperature was observed in the rf1150 treatment compared to the tf3150 treatment at different soil depths in both study years as the winter wheat canopy improved after 170 dap a lower 11 13 c and 10 66 c soil temperature was recorded at a depth of 5 cm in the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments compared to the tf375 treatment increasing precipitation amounts and limited irrigation levels resulted in decreasing soil temperatures under both planting models soil temperature under the tf375 treatment at 10 cm soil depth was significantly higher 1 23 c than rf375 treatment in both study years in addition the soil temperatures at the depths of 0 5 and 5 10 cm in the rf1150 rf2150 and rf3150 treatments were lower than in tf3150 treatment at the flowering stage 170 dap grain filling stage 200 dap and maturity stage 230 dap however in the rf system from 50 dap up to 140 dap the soil temperatures at 10 15 15 20 and 20 25 cm soil depths were not significantly different than in the tf planting pattern 3 3 evapotranspiration rate et there were obvious differences in et among the treatments throughout the winter wheat growing period table 2 for all winter wheat growth stages the utilization of water occurred mostly by soil evaporation and the et rate under tf planting was higher than in the rf model with different precipitation amounts and limited irrigation plastic mulching on ridges decreased soil evaporation and the et rate under the rf model causing values in the rf system to be lower than in tf planting throughout the winter wheat growing period as the simulated rainfall amounts increased the et rate increased during the first two growth stages 0 30 30 60 dap and the last three growth stages under both planting models 120 150 150 180 180 210 dap the et rate decreased gradually in the early growth stages 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 dap increased rapidly in the middle growth stage 120 150 dap and gradually decreased in the later growth stages 150 180 180 210 dap under tf150 treatment simulated precipitation of 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm significantly affected the et rate compared to rf150 treatment table 2 over all growth stages the average et rate under tf150 with 275 mm rainfall level was significantly increased by 132 mm and 191 mm compared to rf1150 and rf2150 treatments respectively 3 4 soil respiration rate the rf model with simulated precipitation had a significant effect on soil respiration rate under limited irrigation conditions at some growth stages of winter wheat during both study years fig 7 soil respiration rates under the rf system with 275 mm and 200 mm precipitation levels were not significantly different at jointing flowering or grain filling stages during the 2015 2017 growing seasons in 2015 16 at tillering stage ts re wintering stage rws jointing stage js flowering stage fs and grain filling stage gfs soil respiration rates in the rf1150 treatment were greater by 11 1 7 8 2 4 38 8 and 66 9 respectively compared to tf1150 and rates in the rf2150 treatment were greater by 2 3 1 3 2 0 31 7 and 64 0 respectively compared to tf2150 treatment during 2016 17 at ts rws js fs and gfs soil respiration rates in the rf1150 treatment were greater by 1 0 9 6 18 8 41 3 and 2 8 respectively compared to tf1150 and rates in the rf2150 treatment were greater by 3 0 1 6 13 1 14 3 and 4 5 respectively compared to tf2150 treatment the soil respiration rates under rf150 treatment with 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall concentrations were not significantly different at various growth stages of winter wheat crop during 2015 2017 3 5 crop development early winter wheat growth was faster under tf treatments compared to the rf system in both study years resulting in a shorter time to reach maturity table 3 the jointing date of the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments was earlier than in rf1150 and rf2150 treatments by 7 10 days in 2015 16 and 8 10 days in 2016 17 which showed that there was shorter vegetative growth duration in tf treatment compared to the rf system under simulated rainfall conditions regardless of the level of limited irrigation the flowering date of the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments was 8 9 days earlier in 2015 16 and 7 9 days earlier in 2016 17 compared to rf1150 and rf2150 treatments furthermore the physiological maturity date of plants in the tf1150 and tf2150 treatments was earlier by 6 days in 2015 16 and 6 5 days in 2016 17 compared to rf1150 and rf2150 treatments 3 6 total dry matter accumulation and leaf area index lai at different simulated precipitation levels the lai and biomass accumulation per plant were significantly higher under the rf model compared to tf planting fig 8 table 4 during both growing seasons there were no significant differences in dry matter root shoot per plant and lai from tillering to re wintering growth stages under both planting models the dry matter per plant increased gradually at tillering and re wintering rapidly at jointing and flowering and reached a peak value at the ripeness stage table 4 there were no significant variations in the total dry matter with precipitation above 200 mm under both planting models during different growth stages the differences between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant but both had higher biomass accumulation than tf1150 and tf2150 treatments respectively the differences in the lai started at the jointing stage achieved a peak value in the flowering stage and then slowly decreased from the flowering to late grain filling stage due to leaf senescence limited irrigation had a significant influence on lai under both planting models except at the tillering and re wintering stages fig 8 however rf1150 treatment slightly increased the lai during different growth stages but differences between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant during the later grain filling stage the lai under both planting models with 125 mm simulated rainfall declined much more than that in the treatments with rainfall levels between 200 and 275 mm which shows that an inadequate water supply can lead to early leaf senescence 3 7 yield water use efficiency and harvest index the grain yield and wue of winter wheat were significantly different under both planting models with simulated precipitation and limited irrigation table 5 the grain yield and wue increased with simulated precipitation and limited irrigation but differences were not significant when the rainfall was above 200 mm under both planting models under simulated precipitation with limited irrigation the rf system led to a maximum grain yield than tf treatment the average of two year data indicated that the rf model improved soil moisture content and soil respiration rate but reduced soil temperature and et rate therefore rf produced a 15 higher grain yield 0 79 t ha 1 than tf planting the two year average of grain yield showed that rf2150 and rf275 treatments were significantly increased by 1 19 t ha 1 18 90 and 1 15 t ha 1 22 50 respectively compared to tf planting wue increased along with the increase in grain yield the wue improved by 9 04 kg mm 1 ha 1 68 53 under the rf model compared to tf treatment due to decreased soil temperature and et rate compared with tf1150 and tf175 treatments average wue under rf1150 and rf175 treatments were significantly increased by 8 12 kg mm 1 ha 1 and 7 73 kg mm 1 ha 1 respectively mean wue of rf2150 and rf275 were significantly increased by 12 39 kg mm 1 ha 1 and 11 29 kg mm 1 ha 1 respectively compared to tf2150 and tf275 the harvest index hi ranged from 35 72 to 45 84 in 2015 16 the rf system under different simulated rainfall had a significantly higher hi compared to tf treatment limited irrigation had no significant effect under rf system compared to tf planting in 2016 17 the rf1150 treatment had a significantly p 0 05 higher hi of 46 05 among different treatments but hi was not significantly different from rf2150 or tf1150 treatments 4 discussion 4 1 soil water temperature and respiration rate water saving agriculture practices has been developed all over the world due to gradually rising global temperatures crop cultivation techniques have greatly improved after switching from flat planting to the rf rainfall harvesting system to increase the efficiency of runoff and collect the maximum amount of precipitation which could increase soil water content and wue in crops where natural precipitation and limited irrigation are used angus and herwaarden 2001 plastic mulching reduces the loss of soil moisture and evaporation and increases soil water content due to the greater rainwater harvesting efficiencies from the ridge furrow planting pattern ramakrishna et al 2006 zougmore et al 2003 the rf system can improve the soil moisture condition by collecting water from light rainfall reducing unproductive evaporation and promoting rainfall infiltration li et al 2001 wang et al 2009 in present study we found that at the jointing stage the swc under rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were significantly increased compared to tf planting at the flowering and grain filling stages the swc at soil depths from 0 to 60 cm increased while from 60 to 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting models furthermore the swc increased under both planting models as the simulated rainfall amounts and limited irrigation increased at all growth stages however in the maturity stage swc under the rf model increased between 0 and 80 cm compared to tf which showed that the plants under the rf system took up less water from the deeper soil layer the higher soil water content under the rf model has two key justifications the first is decreased soil evaporation ren et al 2010 showed that ridges covered with plastic film can efficiently save more rainwater in the soil than conventional flat planting thereby reducing losses by evaporation from the covered ridges moret and arrue 2007 the second justification is that the rf cultivation is better for using light rain hu et al 2014 which is why the soil water content under the rf system was higher than tf planting during all growth stages ren et al 2008 reported that under simulated precipitation of 230 340 and 440 mm in the rf system the swc in the 0 200 cm soil depth were 2 3 5 2 and 4 5 greater than in tf treatment respectively soil moisture and temperature are essential for crop development zhou et al 2012 the use of plastic film mulch prevents water and heat exchange between soil and air thereby reducing latent heat flux zhou et al 2009 earlier studies have suggested that the rf system can decrease soil temperature govaerts et al 2006 and increase soil moisture keyantash and dracup 2002 klumpp et al 2007 thereby increasing grain yield we also found higher soil temperatures under the tf planting pattern compared to the rf model under different rainfall amounts and limited irrigation after planting winter wheat the soil temperature gradually decreased up to 110 dap but after 110 dap the soil temperature increased in all treatments at different soil depths as the winter wheat canopy increased after 170 dap lower soil temperatures were recorded at a depth of 5 cm in the rf1150 and rf2150 treatments compared to tf planting several studies have shown that suitable temperatures during the early stage of crop growth can greatly accelerate grain germination and crop yield ren et al 2016 increasing precipitation concentrations and limited irrigation levels resulted in decreasing soil temperatures under both planting models in addition soil temperatures at the depths of 0 5 and 5 10 cm in the rf1150 rf2150 and tf1150 treatments were lower than tf2150 and tf3150 treatments at the flowering stage 170 dap grain filling stage 200 dap and the maturity stage 230 dap li et al 2001 showed that the average soil temperature at a depth of 10 cm in plastic film mulched plots was 0 5 4 5 c greater than that in non mulched plots however under the rf system from 50 dap up to 140 dap the soil temperatures at 10 15 cm 15 20 cm and 20 25 cm soil depths were not significantly different from temperatures in the tf planting pattern wang et al 2005 found that early during the growing season the topsoil temperature in an rf system was 3 0 6 8 c lower than in an uncovered flat planting treatment whereas later in the growing season no difference was found between the two conditions zhang et al 2009 also suggested that soil temperatures under tf planting were higher than in the rf system in warmer climates gan et al 2013 also revealed that tf planting significantly improved soil temperature and evaporation but decreased soil water storage soil respiration is mainly produced by microbial oxidation of organic matter and root respiration and is an indicator of soil quality soil temperature and soil water contents azooz and arshad 2001 ronga et al 2015 during the 2015 2017 growing seasons the rf system at the jointing and flowering stages with 275 mm and 200 mm precipitation levels showed significantly higher soil respiration rates than in tf planting soil respiration rates under the rf system with 275 mm and 200 mm precipitation levels were not significantly different at the jointing flowering or grain filling stages in 2015 16 at ts rws js fs and gfs soil respiration rates of rf2150 treatment were greater than in the tf2150 treatment by 2 3 1 3 2 0 31 7 and 64 0 respectively during 2016 17 at the ts rws js fs and gfs soil respiration rates of rf2150 treatment were greater than in tf2150 treatment by 3 0 1 6 13 1 14 3 and 4 5 respectively the soil respiration rate under rf150 treatment with 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall amounts had no significant differences at various growth stages of winter wheat crop during 2015 2017 fig 7 wang et al 2011 studied the effect of limited irrigation on soil respiration rate and the results revealed that soil respiration rate improved with increasing irrigation amount but over irrigation inhibited soil respiration zhang et al 2007 studied the response of soil respiration rate to heavy rainfall in the winter wheat crop and found that heavy rainfall inhibited soil respiration rate during wet growing season the rainfall on the soil to suppress 33 soil respiration rate govaerts et al 2009 4 2 et et is the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration and under the rf system transpiration contributes more to et rate than in tf planting morris et al 2010 schwen et al 2011 mulching on ridges decreased the evaporation and et under rf treatments than that of tf treatments ren et al 2008 feng et al 2016 we also found that as the simulated rainfall amounts increased the et rate increased during the last three growth stages under both planting models 120 150 150 180 180 210 dap the et rate decreased gradually in the early growth stages 0 120 dap increased rapidly in the middle growth stage 120 150 dap and gradually decreased in the late growth stage 150 210 dap under tf150 treatment simulated precipitation of 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm significantly table 2 affected the et rate while the differences were no significant between rf150 and tf75 treatments under 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm precipitation levels during the whole growing season therefore the rf system obtained a lower total et compared with tf planting as reported by wen et al 2012 and wang et al 2015 the average et rate under tf150 with 275 mm rainfall was significantly increased by 132 mm and 191 mm compared to rf1150 and rf2150 treatments respectively liu et al 2015 also reported that ridges covered with plastic film encourage crop transpiration with little soil evaporation earlier studies have revealed that ridges covered with plastic film can change crop water utilization patterns because they can reduce evaporation enhance transpiration and change soil water evaporation into crop transpiration thereby decreasing et rate and improving wue andersson et al 2014 li et al 2016 4 3 total dry matter accumulation and leaf area index lai at different simulated precipitation concentrations the total dry matter per plant and lai were significantly higher under the rf model than in the tf model fig 8 table 4 the maximum dry matter accumulation and lai were achieved with limited irrigation in the rf system rostamza et al 2011 ali et al 2016 under both planting models there were no significant differences in total dry matter root shoot per plant and lai from the tillering to re wintering growth stages there were no significant differences in total dry matter when precipitation was above 200 mm under both planting models the differences between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant and both treatments had higher biomass accumulation than tf treatments ren et al 2008 confirmed that under the rf model the best precipitation ranges were between 230 and 440 mm and the increases in total dry matter accumulation and lai limited irrigation had a significant influence on green lai except at the tillering and re wintering stages fig 8 rf1150 treatment slightly improved the lai during different growth stages but the differences between rf1150 and rf2150 treatments were not significant earlier studies revealed that a plastic film can maintain soil temperature and improve soil water content and soil respiration rate thereby improving crop growth as a result of a significant increase in the dry matter accumulation and lai at different growth stages duan et al 2006 sadras 2003 in the later grain filling stage the lai under both planting models with 125 mm simulated rainfall tended to decline much more than that in the treatments with rainfall levels between 200 and 275 mm which showed that an inadequate water supply can lead to early leaf yellowing li et al 2001 also found that total dry matter and lai did not significantly increase under the rf system when heavy rainfall occurred 4 4 grain yield wue and hi the grain yield and wue tended to improve with precipitation and limited irrigation but the differences were not significant under both planting models when the rainfall exceeded 200 mm li et al 2001 reported that the optimum simulated precipitation for the rf system was 230 440 mm and there were no significant increases in the grain yield and wue when the simulated rainfall exceeded 440 mm we also found that the rf model improved moisture contents and soil respiration rate and reduced soil temperature and et rate therefore producing maximum grain yield 15 compared to tf treatment the rf system can efficiently maintain a higher swc during maize growth thereby promoting crop growth and increasing wue and grain yield gan et al 2013 hu et al 2014 reported that the rf model can make better use of light rainfall causing crops to have more access to water than tf planting promoting a higher grain yield ali et al 2017 reported that there is no need to use the rf model in regions with greater than 200 mm of rainfall under the rf model when rainfall exceeds 340 mm had non significant increase in grain yield ren et al 2008 in our study we found that the wue was increased by 68 53 under the rf model compared to tf treatment due to a decreasing soil temperature and et rate the highest wue was found under the rf system due to lower et with high grain yield nielsen and vigil 2005 it has been confirmed that ridges covered with plastic film can significantly increase the wue wang et al 2015 hi ranged from 35 72 to 45 84 in 2015 16 the rf system under different simulated rainfall had a significantly higher hi compared to tf treatment limited irrigation had no significant effect under the rf model compared to tf treatment in 2016 17 the data illustrated that the hi in the rf1150 treatment was significantly higher by 46 05 among different treatments but hi was not significantly different from rf2150 and tf1150 treatments therefore rf2150 treatment is suitable as a water saving technology for achieving higher winter wheat production and wue in the rain fed areas of china 5 conclusions the rf method is a technique for efficient consumption of precipitation and for improving moisture content in addition to facilitating a limited irrigation strategy for winter wheat in the rain fed areas of china in the present study the rf technique with 200 mm precipitation and 150 mm limited irrigation achieved fast and stable seedling establishment due to its high moisture content regulated soil temperature and respiration rate reduced et at field scale and prolonged the period of water accessibility which led to longer growth duration thus significantly enhancing winter wheat yield and wue compared to tf planting simulated precipitation with limited irrigation has significant effects on total biomass and lai and wue under the rf technique there were no significant increases in soil respiration rate et lai soil temperature soil water contents wue crop development and grain yield when precipitation increased from 200 to 275 mm under both planting models therefore we suggest the rf2150 treatment as water saving technology and a promising strategy to achieving higher winter wheat production and wue in the rain fed areas of china or other similar rain fed regions in the world future study is needed to investigate the impact of rf system on crops production runoff use efficiency and economic

11453,useful in evaluating best management practices and nutrient management planning the prediction of phosphorus p transfer from agricultural lands to water bodies via surface runoff and tile drainage remains as a challenge as few models can provide reasonably accurate p loss simulations the epic environmental policy integrated climate model was firstly applied to simulate crop yields

potential evapotranspiration and curve number equations were compared to determine the most suitable equations penman monteith equation and variable daily curve number with soil moisture index for this region a crack flow coefficient was used to deal with inflow partitioned to cracks a soil layer below tile drain with low saturated hydraulic conductivity was employed in simulating the

and cumulative drainage closely matched observed data over shorter periods months surface runoff nse 0 78 tile drainage nse 0 57 and relevant drp loss nse 0 5 simulations were satisfactory except for two periods of drp loss in surface runoff where most drp moved downward through lateral flow and deep percolation due to limitations in the crack flow coefficient for this vertic soil epic generally simulated crop yields and flow volumes well while drp losses were only adequately simulated keywords modelling surface runoff tile drainage phosphorus loss epic lake erie 1 introduction estimates based on simulations using swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2011 suggest that lake erie s worst and most harmful cyanobacteria bloom which occurred in 2011 was mainly attributable to long term dissolved reactive phosphorus drp loss from agricultural lands daloglu et al 2012 michalak et al 2013 several studies have shown that both surface runoff and tile drainage are important

please phosphorus leaching from soils to the environment and swat they found the icecreamdb model has macropore and p components however neither the overall model nor its new approach to partitioning

water quality model and drainmod others e g epic apex and swat are spatially explicit hydrologic models capable of predicting p losses that lack experimental corroboration to confirm the quality of their performance in modelling p loss accordingly we sought to evaluate the performance of the field scale model epic for drp loss epic incorporates the popular p model of jones et al 1984 and is capable of simulating p losses in surface runoff peruta et al 2014 vadas et al 2006 however epic has not been tested with a vertisol due to its limitations in simulating nutrient transport through tile drainage wang et al 2012 previously epic has been incorporated with a drainage system component similar to drainmod sabbagh et al 1991a sabbagh et al 1993 but it was not tested because of its complexity the current version of the model simplifies drainage volume by modifying the lateral subsurface flow of the area where depth of the drainage system and the time required for the drainage system to reduce plant stress are used for adjustment williams et al 2015 adjusting these parameters could be useful in improving the accuracy of surface runoff predictions however for the vertic clay loam soil under study the prediction of surface runoff would be unreliable without concurrently considering preferential flow since epic does not include preferential flow or macropore flow procedures radcliffe et al 2015 we used the crack flow coefficient parm 17 to deal with inflow partitioned to cracks or pipe flow baffaut et al 2015 set the crack flow coefficient equal to 0 5 in their swat

are open source permitting users to modify the code for their own investigations as epic has not been tested under the typical cracking brookston clay loam soil of the lake erie region our objectives were to i compare the impacts of different potential evapotranspiration et p and curve number cn equations on crop yields surface runoff drainage and p losses and thereby select the most suitable et p and cn equations through model calibration ii evaluate epic s ability to predict crop yield surface runoff drainage and soil p losses under a corn soybean rotation in a clay loam soil vertisol and iii specify the epic model s limitations in terms of simulating surface runoff drainage and relevant p loss 2 material methods 2 1 field experiments field experiments conducted from 2008 to 2011 on the hon eugene f whelan research farm of the harrow research and development centre agriculture and agri food canada at woodslee on were used as the basis for modelling agricultural runoff in the

harvest three parallel 104 mm diameter tile drains ran along the length of the plot at a depth of 0 8 m and 3 8 m spacing on a slope of 0 1 0 5 this plot was isolated to prevent flow from the adjacent plots by i a double layer of 0 1016 mm 4 mil thick plastic barrier installed from the surface to a depth of 1 2 m on three sides with the open side being available for collection of surface runoff and ii a 7 5 m wide by 67 m long buffer area with a single drain to prevent plot cross contamination surface runoff and tile drainage delivered to the instrumentation building were collected by catch basins and automatically recorded by a water meter analog and digital pulse signals were sent by the water meter to a multi channel data logger to monitor measure and store water volumes tan et al 1993 to reflect the reality of p loss water samples collecting periods were scheduled based on agronomic practices and forecasted precipitation tan and zhang 2011 zhang et al 2015a which resulted in a total of 17 water sampling periods during jun 2008 to dec 2011 figs 1 and 2 weather data maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation were collected

nutrients soil temperature plant growth plant environment control tillage and economic budgets five et p models are available the penman monteith hargreaves baier robertson penman and priestly taylor equations a generic crop growth routine is used in epic for simulating a wide range of crops and cropping systems daily heat unit accumulation is used to calculate daily crop biomass accumulation root

developmental stage potential water use is simulated as a fraction of the potential evaporation based on the lai relationship soil carbon and nitrogen modules are simulated based on the concepts used

modification of the natural resources conservation service nrcs curve number technique which is an efficient method related to land use soil type and hydrologic condition peak runoff rate predictions are based on a modification of the rational formula drainage is treated as modified lateral subsurface flow where percolating water moves laterally above an impervious or semi impervious soil layer the drain depth was input by the user to enable simulation of drainage time to reduce plant stress in a wet soil therefore lateral subsurface flow was simulated as drainage system rather than return flow to avoid a lagged and attenuated flow pattern 1 h c l j p o j w p j 24 d r t where hclj is the horizontal saturated flow rate mm h 1 for soil layer j containing the tile drain poj and wpj are the

on the concept of partitioning pesticides into the solution and sediment phases using the gleams model sabbagh et al 1991b the soluble p loss in surface runoff drp kg ha 1 can be expressed as 2 d r p

2 3 epic simulation the epic0810 model was calibrated and validated using field measured data given the potential uncertainty of daily identification of flow monitoring caused by the initial installation and evaluation of drain function in early 2008 and by flooding in partial periods of 2011 due to exceptional precipitation and snow melt table 1 daily flow data for those two years were not used to test the suitability of the model daily surface runoff and tile drainage in 2009 and crop yields of 2008 2009 were used to calibrate epic validation was conducted based on daily surface runoff and tile drainage in 2010 and crop yields of 2010 2011 observations surface runoff drainage and p loss corresponding to the 17th water sampling periods during jun 2008 to dec 2011 were also used to validate the model the drp from surface runoff and tile drainage was measured and compared with labile p simulated from the epic model the vertic clay loam soil is prone to cracking during prolonged dry weather and the site is prone to preferential flow via cracks as well as earthworm and root channels the epic pipe crack flow option was used to deal with inflow partitioned to cracks or pipe flow the parm 17 crack flow coefficient 0 4 was used a limitation of this option is that the dynamics of cracks is not considered in this epic version tile drainage is treated as a modification of the natural lateral subsurface flow of the area where percolating water moves laterally on top of a soil layer that has a very low saturated hydraulic conductivity since this soil is usually fine textured and subtended by an impervious or semi impervious soil layer restricting percolation downward the soil layer below tile drains was set to a saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of 0 01 mm h 1 in order to treat all the lateral subsurface flow above tile drain layer as drainage this method has been verified by chung et al 2001 and chung et al 2002 that ignored the possibility of water leached below tile drain which was minor at specific site the time required for the drainage system to reduce plant stress drt was set at 1 day dissolved reactive p loss in surface runoff was estimated using the exponent modified gleams method initially the model was calibrated and validated using the penman montieth equation and variable daily cn with smi soil moisture index subsequently the five et p equations and five curve number cn policies were compared to determine the most suitable et p equation and curve number estimation methods option 1 variable daily cn with depth soil water weighting option 2 variable daily cn without depth weighting option 3 variable daily cn linear cn sw with no depth weighting option 4 non varying cn cn2 used for all storms and option 5 variable daily cn with smi finally based on the most suitable et p equation and cn method evaluation of epic was conducted in terms of crop yield surface runoff drainage and drp losses 2 4 statistical analysis three statistics were used to evaluate model performance the sum of square errors sse the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error

daily annual and periodic statistical analyses were all performed monthly recommended statistical performance ratings are presented in table a1 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation the calibration based on daily surface runoff in 2009 yielded a reasonably accurate model nse 0 45 pbias 13 51 and rsr 0 74 table 2 however in the validation phase using daily data from 2010 performance was unacceptable data not shown this poor performance rating was highlighted by mismatch on july 24 2010 the site had a total of 73 8 mm rainfall on july 24 2010 with no observed surface runoff that day however the model simulated 18 7 mm surface runoff after this precipitation event there was an additional rainfall event of 17 8 mm on july 26 2010 the measured surface runoff was 27 2 mm on the day this delay in measured surface flow was mainly due to the brookston clay loam soil s high capability for water storage it can store up to 50 mm of precipitation without producing surface runoff experimental site technician personal communication dirks and bolton 1981 also set maximum soil moisture capacity to 100 mm for this brookston soil however by using a crack flow coefficient the model simulated the opening of downward preferential flow paths leading to water percolation and lateral subsurface flow which is added to quick return flow more details about crack flow can be found in swat s theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 prior to this large precipitation event small rainfall events earlier in july had not led to any surface runoff the additional rainfall event of 17 8 mm on july 26 2010 saturated the soil and produced surface runoff thus we calculated the statistics of cumulative surface runoff nse 0 79 table 2 in the calibration phase 2009 data the match between the observed and modelled daily drainage data was poor nse 0 28 rsr 0 85 even though the pbias was low pbias 1 92 table 2 this indicates that although the quantity of drainage was reasonably well simulated its pattern was poorly estimated this can be attributed to the factors i the predicted tile drainage did not simulate the january snow melt and ii the model simulated non zero drainage from mid july to mid december whereas observed drainage was near zero data not shown this overestimation could be due to the use of subsurface lateral flow instead of downward drainage the validation for 2010 was even more unrealistic except the pbias of 7 27 as mentioned above july 24 2010 saw extremely high precipitation but no drainage but drainage did occur on july 26 2010 after an additional small precipitation event however the model simulated drainage in both days this delay might have been caused by the reduction in soil water storage capacity due to greater hydraulic conductivity resulted from the greater constant crack flow coefficient i e swelling or close of cracks was not simulated in the model neitsch et al 2011 another overestimation of drainage 32 3 mm which occurred on august 1 2010 when almost zero precipitation 0 2 mm occurred was likely attributable to the limitations of using lateral subsurface flow to simplify drainage flow this study indicated that the crack flow coefficient the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the lower soil layer under the tile drain and the time period for the lateral subsurface flow to reach the tiles need to be investigated and calibrated with measured tile outflow because of the model simplification in simulating tile drain and uncalibrated related parameters a comparison using cumulative drainage flow volume between the simulated and the measured drainage flow data is more realistic than using daily ones in this study the nse of tile drainage for calibration and validation periods was 0 81 and 0 63 respectively table 2 3 2 impacts of pet and cn equations 3 2 1 et p equations based on calibration and validation we used different et p and cn equations to evaluate their impacts on crop yield flow volumes and relevant drp loss and determine the best combination table 3 summarizes the results obtained from simulations assessing the et p equations simulated averaged annual estimates of et p obtained using the three equations were penman montieth 703 6 mm hargreaves 720 8 mm and baier robertson 812 6 mm these estimates were within the range of annual means 732 83 mm reported by fallow et al 2003 relevant simulated crop yields were also very close to their observed counterparts with statistical analyses showing near perfect performance sse close to 0 table 3 simulated annual averaged surface runoff based on penman montieth 115 5 mm hargreaves 96 3 mm and baier robertson 91 9 mm were close to observed data 107 5 mm with the best pbias 0 75 being achieved with the penman montieth equation table 3 with these three equations simulated drainage on an annual basis closely matched observed data with similar means and high performance statistics table 3 in contrast the penman and priestly taylor equations performed very poorly by greatly overestimating et p and accordingly underestimating surface runoff and yield due to unavailability of equation adjustment williams et al 2015 as simulated et p and annual surface runoff were reliable under three et p equations penman monteith hargreaves and baier robertson tested the different equations ability to allow the model to yield accurate simulated values on a periodic or daily basis was assessed on a daily basis and in the calibration phase the baier robertson equations provided a better simulation of both surface runoff nse 0 64 pbias 0 68 rsr 0 60 and drainage nse 0 50 pbias 5 49 and rsr 0 71 table 2 the et p equations resulted in minor impacts on the daily results validation cumulative phase table 2 for validation over longer periods the penman monteith equation yielded the best estimates of both surface runoff nse 0 78 pbias 3 52 rsr 0 47 and drainage nse 0 57 pbias 0 80 rsr 0 66 table 3 since the observed periodic data minimized the perturbation of flooding and delays in flow validation using periodic data seems more reasonable than using daily data larger uncertainty penman monteith equation is generally considered the most accurate method to estimate et p despite its sensitivity to wind speed which is prone to measurement errors williams et al 2015 crop canopy and penman monteith adjustment factors can be used to adjust penman monteith et p estimates penman monteith is also capable to estimate the impacts of changes on co2 stockle et al 1992 hargreaves method evaluates et p as a function of extraterrestrial radiation and air temperature and was modified to closely match the penman monteith et p estimates by the choice of equation coefficients and exponents the baier roberson method was developed for cold climates such as that in canada however no parameters are available to adjust this method similarly no adjustment parameters are available for the priestley taylor and penman equations resulting in unreasonably high et p values the priestley taylor method provides simulation without wind or relative humidity data and its coefficient is simplified to a value of 1 28 for use when surface areas are wet which is much higher than what one would expect under standard agricultural condition neitsch et al 2011 another concern is that there is a greater focus on annual or periodic flow which is easier for policymakers to understand and adopt clearly penman monteith equation shows greater accuracy in annual and periodic simulation accordingly this et p equation was used in the current study 3 2 2 cn equations the cn equations have no impacts on et p and only marginal impacts on crop yields based on sse table 4 williams et al 2012b reported similar et values based on the direct link cn method vs a revised soil moisture index cn method using the apex model the best simulations nse for periodic surface runoff and drainage are 0 78 and 0 57 respectively under different cn equations were achieved by adjusting the nrcs runoff cn adjustment parameters in this study the nrcs curve number index coefficient and upper limit of curve number retention parameter are available to adjust surface runoff flow volume annual simulation of surface runoff and drainage was reasonably accurate when based on variable daily cn estimation options 1 2 and 3 except that pbias 25 in contrast simulation under option 4 was not acceptable for periodic data only simulation under option 5 was satisfactory table 4 the direct link between the nrcs retention parameter and soil moisture water content θ are generally thought to be more physically accurate than the revised smi williams et al 2012b however the overestimates of surface runoff were obvious for this site although the variable daily cn smi option 5 with smi was developed to overcome the usually overestimated problem with low storage soils williams et al 2012b this option was still deemed the most suitable equation for this experimental site even with this clay loam soil with high water storage although epic offers the option of using the green and ampt method to simulate runoff we chose cn method because it is not only evidently reliable and efficient in computation but also the inputs required are often routinely available in addition the cn method more closely connects surface runoff with soil type land use and management practices applied with the soil moisture index method option 5is robust insensitive to soil data errors and capable of producing more realistic runoff simulations over a wide range of soil properties than other daily cn estimation method williams et al 2012b 3 3 crop yields using the penman monteith equation and option 5 method the mean simulated corn yield 7 9 mg ha 1 was similar to the observed one 8 0 mg ha 1 this was also the case for the simulated vs measured soybean yield tables 1 and 4 crop water use efficiency wue defined as crop yield growing season et during the growing season showed negligible differences for corn 27 2 27 7 and soybean i e 14 5 14 9 table 5 overestimation of corn yield in 2010 might be attributable to an overestimation of crop available water soil water at planting growing season rainfall runoff resulting from an underestimation 42 0 in surface runoff in the field experiment water stress could extend for more than 3 2 days compared to overestimated crop available water table 5 leading to higher simulated corn yield in 2010 than was observed in contrast underestimation of corn yield in 2008 might be the result of 4 7 days of simulated aeration stress when water capacity approaches its saturation simulated growing season surface runoff in 2008 was 51 9 mm more than twice that in 2010 table 5 this simulated aeration stress might not have occurred at the experimental site because the surface runoff was overestimated by 14 mm in period 3 fig 1a for soybean the marginal simulated nitrogen stress was likely less than the actual nitrogen stress which occurred in the field and resulted in lower observed yields drury et al 2009 who also conducted field experiments at the whelan experimental farm woodslee ontario reported that increasing n fertilization resulted in greater soybean yield although no p fertilization was applied no p stress occurred over the four years this was consistent with field observations that levels of soil test p i e annual mean 61 5 mg p kg 1 table 1 were above the values for p fertilization to be recommended 30 mg p kg 1 omafra 2009 3 4 surface runoff and tile drainage on an annual basis simulated surface runoff was close to observed data with a negligible bias table 3 periodic simulation of surface runoff was also satisfactory however some overestimations and underestimations did occur periods with overestimation were 3 6 and 14 while underestimation occurred in period 5 fig 1a both simulated and measured surface runoff was directly linked to precipitation however incapability of simulating delayed surface runoff is a common phenomenon in simulation linked to the weakened water storage capacity of the brookston clay loam through the crack flow coefficient for period 3 from july 18 2008 to october 22 2008 the observed cumulative runoff data was 0 6 mm although 187 8 mm of precipitation had fallen in simulation the heavy rainfall event of september 9 2008 generated 14 6 mm in surface runoff this could be contributed to constant crack flow coefficient like period 3 periods 6 and 14 produced larger simulated surface runoff due to reduced soil water storage resulting from greater hydraulic conductivity with constant crack flow coefficient this means that cracks would have been closed by swelling lowered hydraulic conductivity and higher water storage during wet condition which cannot be reflect by constant crack flow coefficient however in contrast to period 6 periods 3 and 14 occurred during the growing season when crop interception of rainfall not simulated by epic might also skew runoff simulations williams et al 2012a for period 5 from february 12 2009 to march 17 2009 the underestimation could be resulted from underestimation of snow melt simulations of annual cumulative drain flow volume were very close to observed values nse 0 99 pbias 1 96 rsr 0 09 while simulation of drainage over shorter periods was also good nse 0 57 pbias 0 80 rsr 0 66 table 3 there were seven periods that were either overestimated or underestimated during period 1 there was negligible drain discharge as the water was predominately stored in the soil profile although there was continuous rainfall however epic overestimated the lateral subsurface water by using the crack flow coefficient to simplify macropores which led to lower storage of soil water neitsch et al 2011 another reason was that based on the assumption that the soil layer below tile drains was set to a saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of 0 01 mm h 1 all the lateral subsurface flow above this layer was treated as tile drainage for largely the same reason periods 3 8 12 and 15 were also overestimated an extreme example for the overestimation of drain flow in period 12 was the poor simulation of drainage 32 3 mm on august 1 2010 with negligible rain conversely underestimation occurred in period 4 under continuous light rainfall this was due to fluctuations in temperature around zero from november to december 2008 which resulted in melting of frozen soil leading to high drainage rates data not shown however this snow melting condition had not been well simulated here cracks are a major flow path for water and nutrients especially in the dry periods kazemi et al 2008 the crack flow coefficient which serves the function of macropores can redistribute the overall runoff between surface runoff and tile drainage neitsch et al 2011 this contributed to the greater model accuracy vs not using the coefficient and ignoring macropores in predicting surface runoff and drainage on an annual or periodic basis however the crack flow coefficient remained constant at 0 4 whereas in reality crack volume changed significantly depending on the weather potentially leading to a less accurate simulation of some periods 3 5 phosphorus loss in surface runoff and tile drainage water phosphorus losses in surface runoff p sr and drainage water p dr are driven by both flow volume and the level of labile p in the soil even when in period 2 the flow volume of surface runoff was accurately simulated the simulated p loss in surface runoff was overestimated by 25 fig 2a overestimation of daily flow on june 21 and 28 2008 could be the main reason data not shown another reason could be that being constant the p flux regulating coefficients parm 77 78 cannot respond dynamically to changing environments consequently p dr in period 2 was roughly three times that observed although the simulated drainage was only two fold that observed figs 1b and 2b drainage overestimated due to constant crack flow coefficient and use of lateral subsurface flow above drain layer led in part to overestimated p losses similarly overestimation of flow resulted in overestimated p sr in periods 6 and 14 and overestimated p dr in periods 1 2 3 11 and 15 underestimation of flow resulted in underestimated p sr in period 5 and 11 and p dr in periods 4 and 10 strangely no p sr was simulated for periods 16 and 17 although the simulated surface runoff and drainage were large but close to observed flows this might be attributable to a high crack flow coefficient such that most of the p moved downward to lateral flow and even deep percolation williams et al 2015 associated nutrients transported through cracks were not taken into consideration baffaut et al 2015 another possible reason was that epic did not consider annual crop leaves drop which means no organic p source from crop residue was considered without considering those two points the nse pbias and rsr for p sr were 0 54 24 46 and 0 67 respectively while for p dr they were satisfactory nse 0 59 pbias 14 04 rsr 0 64 the labile p in soil was the main factor influencing drp loss the model s incorporated p routine was developed within the epic framework by jones et al 1984 to predict temporal changes of p in solution p the p sr is based on the concept of partitioning pesticides into solution and sediment phases whereas p dr is partitioned by flux ratio among drainage lateral flow and percolation four parameters were used to adjust p loss i parm 8 the p partition between runoff and sediment ii parm 43 the upward movement of p due to soil surface evaporation iii parm 77 the coefficient regulating p flux between the labile and active pool and iv parm 78 the coefficient regulating p flux between the active and stable pools williams et al 2015 the upper limit of parm 8 is 20 for epic but 100 for the apex model when parm 8 was set to 100 in epic both p dr and p sr were strongly linked to sediment levels the values of parm 77 and parm 78 have default settings of 0 0001 however to correctly reflect p desorption these were set to 0 1 in an effort to increase p desorption not affecting changes in the p flux among labile active and stable p pools parm 43 only can partition the p flux upward and downward ratio the p sorption coefficient psp also plays a significant role in the p sorption desorption process by regulating p flux among different p pools eq 2 the psp adjusts how much of the added inorganic p remains as labile p in the soil vadas et al 2006 while peruta et al 2014 reported that psp could range from 0 1 to 0 4 for different soils psp could range from 0 05 to 0 75 in apex williams et al 2012a however psp range has not been clearly detailed in epic but could be similar to that in apex in the present study psp 0 51 eq 3 under calcareous soil 11 calcium carbonate content of soil without considering weathering information showed the most reliable results than other psp equilibriums data not shown this was consistent with the study that this site falls in the strongly calcareous classes 6 40 caco3 equivalent evans and cameron 1983 4 conclusions using the penman monteith equation and cn4 with soil moisture index the epic model generated a reasonably accurate simulation of crop yields surface runoff and tile drainage for a brookston clay loam soil vertisol located in the lake erie region however there were still some limitations 1 without a macropore component the epic model could only see limited usage on the region s brookston clay soil vertisol however the crack flow coefficient can increase prediction accuracy for annual and periodic surface runoff and drainage but at the risk of causing a large bias in specific periods due to the coefficient s constant value not allowing the model to properly mimic dynamic changes in crack sizes this also reduced the soil s water storage capacity in some cases 2 phosphorus sorption adsorption with a constant coefficient parameter to regulate p flux is not sufficient and p may be directed into deep percolation instead into surface runoff by constant crack coefficient p nutrient loss in cracks is not considered in this version of epic 3 the baier robertson equation could give better daily simulation of surface runoff and tile drainage if some parameters were available to adjust its et p values though the baier robertson equation was designed for canada it remains limited in applicability given its lack of adjustable parameters our future work would be to tackle these limitations by incorporating preferential flow using the steady state hooghoudt equation and improve epic s p subroutine and p loss simulations by incorporating p sorption

potential evapotranspiration and curve number equations were compared to determine the most suitable equations penman monteith equation and variable daily curve number with soil moisture index for this region a crack flow coefficient was used to deal with inflow partitioned to cracks a soil layer below tile drain with low saturated hydraulic conductivity was employed in simulating the experimental site where most water was leaving the field through tile drain lateral subsurface flow was used to substitute for drainage annual simulations of crop grain yield cumulative surface runoff

two periods of drp loss in surface runoff where most drp moved downward through lateral flow and deep percolation due to limitations in the crack flow coefficient for this vertic soil epic generally simulated crop yields and flow volumes well while drp losses were only adequately simulated keywords modelling surface runoff tile drainage phosphorus loss epic lake erie 1 introduction estimates based on simulations using swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2011 suggest that lake erie s worst and most harmful cyanobacteria bloom which occurred in 2011 was mainly attributable to

the ability to complete economic analyses of bmps beneficial management practices rao et al 2012 however these models still deal poorly with p sorption desorption processes rossi et al 2012 as well as

drainage waters including adapt agricultural drainage and pesticide transport apex agricultural policy environmental extender drainmod hspf hydrologic simulation program fortran hydrus icecreamdb please phosphorus leaching from soils to the environment and swat they found the icecreamdb model has macropore and p components however neither the overall model nor its new approach to partitioning surface runoff and macropore flow according to the complex and uncertain interaction of surface runoff and drainage has been tested several widely used models lack p sub models e g rzwqm2 root zone water quality model and drainmod others e g epic apex and swat are spatially explicit hydrologic models capable of predicting p losses that lack experimental corroboration to confirm the quality of their performance in modelling p loss accordingly we sought to evaluate the performance of the field scale model epic for drp loss epic incorporates the popular p model of jones et al 1984 and is capable of simulating p losses in surface runoff peruta et al 2014 vadas et al 2006 however epic has not been tested with a vertisol due to its limitations in simulating nutrient transport through tile drainage wang et al 2012 previously epic has been incorporated with a drainage system component similar to drainmod sabbagh et al 1991a sabbagh et al 1993 but it was not tested because of its complexity the current version of the model simplifies drainage volume by modifying the lateral subsurface flow of the area where depth of the drainage system and the time required for the drainage system to reduce plant stress are used for adjustment williams et al 2015 adjusting these parameters could be useful in improving the accuracy of surface runoff predictions however for the vertic clay loam soil under study the prediction of surface runoff would be unreliable without concurrently considering preferential flow since epic does not include preferential flow or macropore flow procedures radcliffe et al 2015 we used the crack flow coefficient parm 17 to deal with inflow partitioned to cracks or pipe flow baffaut et al 2015 set the crack flow coefficient equal to 0 5 in their swat

hon eugene f whelan research farm of the harrow research and development centre agriculture and agri food canada at woodslee on were used as the basis for modelling agricultural runoff in the brookstone vertisol brookston is a clay loam with 36 3 clay 39 7 silt and 23 9 sand permanent wilting point θ pwp and field capacity θ fc at the experimental site were 18 3 and 37 9 h2o respectively bulk density ρ was 1 33 mg m 3 the plot was 67 1 m long and 15 2 m wide approximately 0 1 ha the cropping system was a corn soybean rotation corn zea mays l was planted at a density of 79 800 seeds ha

harvest three parallel 104 mm diameter tile drains ran along the length of the plot at a depth of 0 8 m and 3 8 m spacing on a slope of 0 1 0 5 this plot was isolated to prevent flow from the adjacent plots by i a double layer of 0 1016 mm 4 mil thick plastic barrier installed from the surface to a depth of 1 2 m on three sides with the open side being available for collection of surface runoff and ii a 7 5 m wide by 67 m long buffer area with a single drain to prevent plot cross contamination surface runoff and tile drainage delivered to the instrumentation building were collected by catch basins and automatically recorded by a water meter analog and digital pulse signals were sent by the water meter to a multi channel data logger to monitor measure and store water volumes tan et al 1993 to reflect the reality of p loss water samples collecting periods were scheduled based on agronomic practices and forecasted precipitation tan and zhang 2011 zhang et al 2015a which resulted in a total of 17 water sampling periods during jun 2008 to dec 2011 figs 1 and 2 weather data maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation were collected

are based on a modification of the rational formula drainage is treated as modified lateral subsurface flow where percolating water moves laterally above an impervious or semi impervious soil layer the drain depth was input by the user to enable simulation of drainage time to reduce plant stress in a wet soil therefore lateral subsurface flow was simulated as drainage system rather than return

2 3 epic simulation the epic0810 model was calibrated and validated using field measured data given the potential uncertainty of daily identification of flow monitoring caused by the initial installation and evaluation of drain function in early 2008 and by flooding in partial periods of 2011 due to exceptional precipitation and snow melt table 1 daily flow data for those two years were not used to test the suitability of the model daily surface runoff and tile drainage in 2009 and crop yields of 2008 2009 were used to calibrate epic validation was conducted based on daily surface runoff and tile drainage in 2010 and crop yields of 2010 2011 observations surface runoff drainage and p loss corresponding to the 17th water sampling periods during jun 2008 to dec 2011 were also used to validate the model the drp from surface runoff and tile drainage was measured and compared with labile p simulated from the epic model the vertic clay loam soil is prone to cracking during prolonged dry weather and the site is prone to preferential flow via cracks as well as earthworm and root channels the epic pipe crack flow option was used to deal with inflow partitioned to cracks or pipe flow the parm 17 crack flow coefficient 0 4 was used a limitation of this option is that the dynamics of cracks is not considered in this epic version tile drainage is treated as a modification of the natural lateral subsurface flow of the area where percolating water moves laterally on top of a soil layer that has a very low saturated hydraulic conductivity since this soil is usually fine textured and subtended by an impervious or semi impervious soil layer restricting percolation downward the soil layer below tile drains was set to a saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of 0 01 mm h 1 in order to treat all the lateral subsurface flow above tile drain layer as drainage this method has been verified by chung et al 2001 and chung et al 2002 that ignored the possibility of water leached below tile drain which was minor at specific site the time required for the drainage system to reduce plant stress drt was set at 1 day dissolved reactive p loss in surface runoff was estimated using the exponent modified gleams method initially the model was calibrated and validated using the penman montieth equation and variable daily cn with smi soil moisture index subsequently the five et p equations and five curve number cn policies were compared to determine the most suitable et p equation and curve number estimation methods option 1 variable daily cn with depth soil water weighting option 2 variable daily cn without depth weighting option 3 variable daily cn linear cn sw with no depth weighting option 4 non varying cn cn2 used for all storms and option 5 variable daily cn with smi finally based on the most suitable et p equation and cn method evaluation of epic was conducted in terms of crop yield surface runoff drainage and drp losses 2 4 statistical analysis

daily annual and periodic statistical analyses were all performed monthly recommended statistical performance ratings are presented in table a1 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation the calibration based on daily surface runoff in 2009 yielded a reasonably accurate model nse 0 45 pbias 13 51 and rsr 0 74 table 2 however in the validation phase using daily data from 2010 performance was unacceptable data not shown this poor performance rating was highlighted by mismatch on july 24 2010 the site had a total of 73 8 mm rainfall on july 24 2010 with no observed surface runoff that day however the model simulated 18 7 mm surface runoff after this precipitation event there was an additional rainfall event of 17 8 mm on july 26 2010 the measured surface runoff was 27 2 mm on the day this delay in measured surface flow was mainly due to the brookston clay loam soil s high capability for water storage it can store up to 50 mm of precipitation without producing surface runoff experimental site technician personal communication dirks and bolton 1981 also set maximum soil moisture capacity to 100 mm for this brookston soil however by using a crack flow coefficient the model simulated the opening of downward preferential flow paths leading to water percolation and lateral subsurface flow which is added to quick return flow more details about crack flow can be found in swat s theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 prior to this large precipitation event small rainfall events earlier in july had not led to any surface runoff the additional rainfall event of 17 8 mm on july 26 2010 saturated the soil and produced surface runoff thus we calculated the statistics of cumulative surface runoff nse 0 79 table 2 in the calibration phase 2009 data the match between the observed and modelled daily drainage data was poor nse 0 28 rsr 0 85 even though the pbias was low pbias 1 92 table 2 this indicates that although the quantity of drainage was reasonably well simulated its pattern was poorly estimated this can be attributed to the factors i the predicted tile drainage did not simulate the january snow melt and ii the model simulated non zero drainage from mid july to mid december whereas observed drainage was near zero data not shown this overestimation could be due to the use of subsurface lateral flow instead of downward drainage the validation for 2010 was even more unrealistic except the pbias of 7 27 as mentioned above july 24 2010 saw extremely high precipitation but no drainage but drainage did occur on july 26 2010 after an additional small precipitation event however the model simulated drainage in both days this delay might have been caused by the reduction in soil water storage capacity due to greater hydraulic conductivity resulted from the greater constant crack flow coefficient i e swelling or close of cracks was not simulated in the model neitsch et al 2011 another overestimation of drainage 32 3 mm which occurred on august 1 2010 when almost zero precipitation 0 2 mm occurred was likely attributable to the limitations of using lateral subsurface flow to simplify drainage flow this study indicated that the crack flow coefficient the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the lower soil layer under the tile drain and the time period for the lateral subsurface flow to reach the tiles need to be investigated and calibrated with measured tile outflow because of the model simplification in simulating tile drain and uncalibrated related parameters a comparison using cumulative drainage flow volume between the simulated and the measured drainage flow data is more realistic than using daily ones in this study the nse of tile drainage for calibration and validation periods was 0 81 and 0 63 respectively table 2 3 2 impacts of pet and cn equations 3 2 1 et p equations based on calibration and validation we used different et p and cn equations to evaluate their impacts on crop yield flow volumes and relevant drp loss and determine the best combination table 3 summarizes the results obtained from simulations assessing the et p equations simulated averaged annual estimates of et p obtained using the three equations were penman montieth 703 6 mm hargreaves 720 8 mm and baier robertson 812 6 mm these estimates were within the range of annual means 732 83 mm reported by fallow et al 2003 relevant simulated crop yields were also very close to their observed counterparts with statistical analyses showing near perfect performance sse close to 0 table 3 simulated annual averaged surface runoff based on penman montieth 115 5 mm hargreaves 96 3 mm and baier robertson 91 9 mm were close to observed data 107 5 mm with the best pbias 0 75 being achieved with the penman montieth equation table 3 with these three equations simulated drainage on an annual basis closely matched observed data with similar means and high performance statistics table 3 in contrast the penman and priestly taylor equations performed very poorly by greatly overestimating et p and accordingly underestimating surface runoff and yield due to unavailability of equation adjustment williams et al 2015 as simulated et p and annual surface runoff were reliable under three et p equations penman monteith hargreaves and baier robertson tested the different equations ability to allow the model to yield accurate simulated values on a periodic or daily basis was assessed on a daily basis and in the calibration phase the baier robertson equations provided a better simulation of both surface runoff nse 0 64 pbias 0 68 rsr 0 60 and drainage nse 0 50 pbias 5 49 and rsr 0 71 table 2 the et p equations resulted in minor impacts on the daily results validation cumulative phase table 2 for validation over longer periods the penman monteith equation yielded the best estimates of both surface runoff nse 0 78 pbias 3 52 rsr 0 47 and drainage nse 0 57 pbias 0 80 rsr 0 66 table 3 since the observed periodic data minimized the perturbation of flooding and delays in flow validation using periodic data seems more reasonable than using daily data larger uncertainty penman monteith equation is generally considered the most accurate method to estimate et p despite its sensitivity to wind speed which is prone to measurement errors williams et al 2015 crop canopy and penman monteith adjustment factors can be used to adjust penman monteith et p estimates penman monteith is also capable to estimate the impacts of changes on co2 stockle et al 1992 hargreaves method evaluates et p as a function of extraterrestrial radiation and air temperature and was modified to closely match the penman monteith et p estimates by the choice of equation coefficients and exponents the baier roberson method was developed for cold climates such as that in canada however no parameters are available to adjust this method similarly no adjustment parameters are available for the priestley taylor and penman equations resulting in unreasonably high et p values the priestley taylor method provides simulation without wind or relative humidity data and its coefficient is simplified to a value of 1 28 for use when surface areas are wet which is much higher than what one would expect under standard agricultural condition neitsch et al 2011 another concern is that there is a greater focus on annual or periodic flow which is easier for policymakers to understand and adopt clearly penman monteith equation shows greater accuracy in annual and periodic simulation accordingly this et p equation was used in the current study 3 2 2 cn equations the cn equations have no impacts on et p and only marginal impacts on crop yields based on sse table 4 williams et al 2012b reported similar et values based on the direct link cn method vs a revised soil moisture index cn method using the apex model the best simulations nse for periodic surface runoff and drainage are 0 78 and 0 57 respectively under different cn equations were achieved by adjusting the nrcs runoff cn adjustment parameters in this study the nrcs curve number index coefficient and upper limit of curve number retention parameter are available to adjust surface runoff flow volume annual simulation of surface runoff and drainage was reasonably accurate when based on variable daily cn estimation options 1 2 and 3 except that pbias 25 in contrast simulation under option 4 was not acceptable for periodic data only simulation under option 5 was satisfactory table 4 the direct link between the nrcs retention parameter and soil moisture water content θ are generally thought to be more physically accurate than the revised smi williams et al 2012b however the overestimates of surface runoff were obvious for this site although the variable daily cn smi option 5 with smi was developed to overcome the usually overestimated problem with low storage soils williams et al 2012b this option was still deemed the most suitable equation for this experimental site even with this clay loam soil with high water storage although epic offers the option of using the green and ampt method to simulate runoff we chose cn method because it is not only evidently reliable and efficient in computation but also the inputs required are often routinely available in addition the cn method more closely connects surface runoff with soil type land use and management practices applied with the soil moisture index method option 5is robust insensitive to soil data errors and capable of producing more realistic runoff simulations over a wide range of soil properties than other daily cn estimation method williams et al 2012b 3 3 crop yields using the penman monteith equation and option 5 method the mean simulated corn yield 7 9 mg ha 1 was similar to the observed one 8 0 mg ha 1 this was also the case for the simulated vs measured soybean yield tables 1 and 4 crop water use efficiency wue defined as crop yield growing season et during the growing season showed negligible differences for corn 27 2 27 7 and soybean i e 14 5 14 9 table 5 overestimation of corn yield in 2010 might be attributable to an overestimation of crop available water soil water at planting growing season rainfall runoff resulting from an underestimation 42 0 in surface runoff in the field experiment water stress could extend for more than 3 2 days compared to overestimated crop available water table 5 leading to higher simulated corn yield in 2010 than was observed in contrast underestimation of corn yield in 2008 might be the result of 4 7 days of simulated aeration stress when water capacity approaches its saturation simulated growing season surface runoff in 2008 was 51 9 mm more than twice that in 2010 table 5 this simulated aeration stress might not have occurred at the experimental site because the surface runoff was overestimated by 14 mm in period 3 fig 1a for soybean the marginal simulated nitrogen stress was likely less than the actual nitrogen stress which occurred in the field and resulted in lower observed yields drury et al 2009 who also conducted field experiments at the whelan experimental farm woodslee ontario reported that increasing n fertilization resulted in greater soybean yield although no p fertilization was applied no p stress occurred over the four years this was consistent with field observations that levels of soil test p i e annual mean 61 5 mg p kg 1 table 1 were above the values for p fertilization to be recommended 30 mg p kg 1 omafra 2009 3 4 surface runoff and tile drainage on an annual basis simulated surface runoff was close to observed data with a negligible bias table 3 periodic simulation of surface runoff was also satisfactory however some overestimations and underestimations did occur periods with overestimation were 3 6 and 14 while underestimation occurred in period 5 fig 1a both simulated and measured surface runoff was directly linked to precipitation however incapability of simulating delayed surface runoff is a common phenomenon in simulation linked to the weakened water storage capacity of the brookston clay loam through the crack flow coefficient for period 3 from july 18 2008 to october 22 2008 the observed cumulative runoff data was 0 6 mm although 187 8 mm of precipitation had fallen in simulation the heavy rainfall event of september 9 2008 generated 14 6 mm in surface runoff this could be contributed to constant crack flow coefficient like period 3 periods 6 and 14 produced larger simulated surface runoff due to reduced soil water storage resulting from greater hydraulic conductivity with constant crack flow coefficient this means that cracks would have been closed by swelling lowered hydraulic conductivity and higher water storage during wet condition which cannot be reflect by constant crack flow coefficient however in contrast to period 6 periods 3 and 14 occurred during the growing season when crop interception of rainfall not simulated by epic might also skew runoff simulations williams et al 2012a for period 5 from february 12 2009 to march 17 2009 the underestimation could be resulted from underestimation of snow melt simulations of annual cumulative drain flow volume were very close to observed values nse 0 99 pbias 1 96 rsr 0 09 while simulation of drainage over shorter periods was also good nse 0 57 pbias 0 80 rsr 0 66 table 3 there were seven periods that were either overestimated or underestimated during period 1 there was negligible drain discharge as the water was predominately stored in the soil profile although there was continuous rainfall however epic overestimated the lateral subsurface water by using the crack flow coefficient to simplify macropores which led to lower storage of soil water neitsch et al 2011 another reason was that based on the assumption that the soil layer below tile drains was set to a saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of 0 01 mm h 1 all the lateral subsurface flow above this layer was treated as tile drainage for largely the same reason periods 3 8 12 and 15 were also overestimated an extreme example for the overestimation of drain flow in period 12 was the poor simulation of drainage 32 3 mm on august 1 2010 with negligible rain conversely underestimation occurred in period 4 under continuous light rainfall this was due to fluctuations in temperature around zero from november to december 2008 which resulted in melting of frozen soil leading to high drainage rates data not shown however this snow melting condition had not been well simulated here cracks are a major flow path for water and nutrients especially in the dry periods kazemi et al 2008 the crack flow coefficient which serves the function of macropores can redistribute the overall runoff between surface runoff and tile drainage neitsch et al 2011 this contributed to the greater model accuracy vs not using the coefficient and ignoring macropores in predicting surface runoff and drainage on an annual or periodic basis however the crack flow coefficient remained constant at 0 4 whereas in reality crack volume changed significantly depending on the weather potentially leading to a less accurate simulation of some periods 3 5 phosphorus loss in surface runoff and tile drainage water phosphorus losses in surface runoff p sr and drainage water p dr are driven by both flow volume and the level of labile p in the soil even when in period 2 the flow volume of surface runoff was accurately simulated the simulated p loss in surface runoff was overestimated by 25 fig 2a overestimation of daily flow on june 21 and 28 2008 could be the main reason data not shown another reason could be that being constant the p flux regulating coefficients parm 77 78 cannot respond dynamically to changing environments consequently p dr in period 2 was roughly three times that observed although the simulated drainage was only two fold that observed figs 1b and 2b drainage overestimated due to constant crack flow coefficient and use of lateral subsurface flow above drain layer led in part to overestimated p losses similarly overestimation of flow resulted in overestimated p sr in periods 6 and 14 and overestimated p dr in periods 1 2 3 11 and 15 underestimation of flow resulted in underestimated p sr in period 5 and 11 and p dr in periods 4 and 10 strangely no p sr was simulated for periods 16 and 17 although the simulated surface runoff and drainage were large but close to observed flows this might be attributable to a high crack flow coefficient such that most of the p moved downward to lateral flow and even deep percolation williams et al 2015 associated nutrients transported through cracks were not taken into consideration baffaut et al 2015 another possible reason was that epic did not consider annual crop leaves drop which means no organic p source from crop residue was considered without considering those two points the nse pbias and rsr for p sr were 0 54 24 46 and 0 67 respectively while for p dr they were satisfactory nse 0 59 pbias 14 04 rsr 0 64 the labile p in soil was the main factor influencing drp loss the model s incorporated p routine was developed within the epic framework by jones et al 1984 to predict temporal changes of p in solution p the p sr is based on the concept of partitioning pesticides into solution and sediment phases whereas p dr is partitioned by flux ratio among drainage lateral flow and percolation four parameters were used to adjust p loss i parm 8 the p partition between runoff and sediment ii parm 43 the upward movement of p due to soil surface evaporation iii parm 77 the coefficient regulating p flux between the labile and active pool and iv parm 78 the coefficient regulating p flux between the active and stable pools williams et al 2015 the upper limit of parm 8 is 20 for epic but 100 for the apex model when parm 8 was set to 100 in epic both p dr and p sr were strongly linked to sediment levels the values of parm 77 and parm 78 have default settings of 0 0001 however to correctly reflect p desorption these were set to 0 1 in an effort to increase p desorption not affecting changes in the p flux among labile active and stable p pools parm 43 only can partition the p flux upward and downward ratio the p sorption coefficient psp also plays a significant role in the p sorption desorption process by regulating p flux among different p pools eq 2 the psp adjusts how much of the added inorganic p remains as labile p in the soil vadas et al 2006 while peruta et al 2014 reported that psp could range from 0 1 to 0 4 for different soils psp could range from 0 05 to 0 75 in apex williams et al 2012a however psp range has not been clearly detailed in epic but could be similar to that in apex in the present study psp 0 51 eq 3 under calcareous soil 11 calcium carbonate content of soil without considering weathering information showed the most reliable results than other psp equilibriums data not shown this was consistent with the study that this site falls in the strongly calcareous classes 6 40 caco3 equivalent evans and cameron 1983 4 conclusions using the penman monteith equation and cn4 with soil moisture index the epic model generated a reasonably accurate simulation of crop yields surface runoff and tile drainage for a brookston clay loam soil vertisol located in the lake erie region however there were still some limitations 1 without a macropore component the epic model could only see limited usage on the region s brookston clay soil vertisol however the crack flow coefficient can increase prediction accuracy for annual and periodic surface runoff and drainage but at the risk of causing a large bias in specific periods due to the coefficient s constant value not allowing the model to properly mimic dynamic changes in crack sizes this also reduced the soil s water storage capacity in some cases 2 phosphorus sorption adsorption with a constant coefficient parameter to regulate p flux is not sufficient and p may be directed into deep percolation instead into surface runoff by constant crack coefficient p nutrient loss in cracks is not considered in this version of epic 3 the baier robertson equation could give better daily simulation of surface runoff and tile drainage if some parameters were available to adjust its et p values though the baier robertson equation was designed for canada it remains limited in applicability given its lack of adjustable parameters our future work would be to tackle these limitations by incorporating preferential flow using the steady state hooghoudt equation and improve epic s p subroutine and p loss simulations by incorporating p sorption coefficient and p sorption desorption rate factors from surphos surface phosphorus and runoff model acknowledgement authors appreciate dr andrew n sharpley who provided valuable review comments during

11454,there have been studies on the effect of water stresses on leaf stomatal conductance gs however the scientific reports on using non contact techniques such as thermography for sesame sesamum indicum l are rare the objectives of this study were hence to detect water status in sesame genotype naz takshakhe under greenhouse conditions using crop water stress cwsi and stomatal conductance ig indices one hundred and fifty pots were randomly assigned to three equal groups which were irrigated at soil water potential of 0 1 mpa well watered ww 1 0 mpa moderate water stressed mws and 1 5 mpa severe water stressed sws four formulations of cwsi and two of ig using canopy temperature tc from the ww treatment or temperature from a wet reference for the upper threshold and tc from the sws treatment temperature from a dry reference or air temperature plus 3 as the lower threshold were compared moreover an additional cwsi and ig formulations were also obtained by non water stress baseline nwsb information using meteorological data furthermore the relative water content rwc and gs were measured on the youngest and uppermost fully developed leaves of each pot tc of mws and sws plants was higher than ww plants by 1 9 and 2 6 c respectively a significant and linear relationship p 0 001 between cwsi ig and gs rwc was found therefore both physiological traits of gs and rwc can be estimated by temperature based indices of cwsi ig the results also showed the developed system enables us to estimate actual time variations in canopy temperatures this study validates the

productivity is limited worldwide by various biotic and abiotic stresses kumar 2013 drought is of particular importance since it is the main abiotic stress factor which causes the highest yield losses manavalan and nguyen 2012 from the agricultural point of view crop water stress occurs when the amount of the water provided through rainfall and irrigation is not sufficient to meet the needs of plant evapotranspiration like other crop stresses water stress influences on a large number of physiological biochemical and molecular reactions of plants lisar et al 2012 manavalan and nguyen 2012 precision irrigation can help to improve water use efficiency and to increase the crop productivity several methods for monitoring crop water stress have been introduced which can be classified as soil based and plant based measurements alves and pereira 2000 cohen et al 2005 cohen et al 2012 among these methods soil moisture sensors pressure chambers and leaf diffusion porometers have been widely used for measuring soil moisture individual leaf stem water potential and leaf stomatal conductance respectively ballester et al 2013 idso et al 1977 moller et al 2006 however these techniques are unsuitable for automatic monitoring of crop water stress since they are destructive labor intensive and time consuming therefore the applications of these methods for spatial and temporal monitoring of crop water stress in large acreage production systems are not feasible ballester et al 2013 from plant physiology if a plant is experiencing water stress the stomata tends to close leads to a reduction in transpiration and rising the leaf temperature ballester et al 2013 jones 1999 2004 leinonen and jones 2004 therefore the increase in canopy temperature can be a good water stress indicator that can be measured by means of infrared thermometers or thermal cameras moller et al 2006 these methods offer non contact and non destructive monitoring of crop water stress jones 2004 leinonen and jones 2004 infrared thermometers are more limited in use since they provide a single point average temperature value of all objects within the sensor s field of view such as shaded and unshaded parts of plant canopy and or soil surface the accuracy of this sensor is even worse when the plant is immature because soil covers a majority of the surface maes and steppe 2012 however thermal imaging is a potential tool for estimating plant temperature which can be used as an indicator of stomatal closure and water deficit stress recently the emergence of thermal cameras particularly when combined with the automated analysis of images makes the use of thermal images much easier the accuracy of this method is higher than that obtained using infrared thermometer because in this imaging method by segmentation of canopy thermal images the influence of soil background can be minimized maes and steppe 2012 however thermal cameras are capable of measuring relative temperature rather than actual temperature to quantify actual surface temperature the thermal camera has to be calibrated at environmental conditions mangus et al 2016 there are three broad categories of remote sensing platforms ground based airborne and satellite the platform used in this research is laboratory instruments ground based which is used almost exclusively for research however for monitoring water status in field crops other remote sensing platforms should be used to cover large surfaces of crops in very short times by mounting thermal cameras on board drones aircrafts or satellites low altitude aircraft drone is good for acquiring high spatial resolution data the most stable platform aloft is a satellite which is space borne nevertheless for satellite data atmospheric correction may be needed to obtain accurate surface temperature estimates ramírez cuesta et al 2017 several indices have been presented for quantifying and monitoring the crop water stress in which tc crop canopy temperature is the main factor for evaluating the crop water status the first indicator which was developed for the arid climate of arizona where has a similar climate to the arid regions of central iran was known as crop water stress index cwsi jones 1999 for calculating cwsi tc must be normalized with well watered and non transpiring crop canopy temperatures as lower and upper leaf temperature bounds respectively dejonge et al 2015 s indicum is an ancient warm season oilseed crop which is said to be partially resistant to some environmental constraints bedigian 2010 mortazavian and kohpayegani 2010 sesame oil contains an unique antioxidants that cannot be found in other edible oils and make the sesame oil the high quality one in addition to the oil crop seed is used as a source of proteins vitamins and minerals for humans as well as in animal feed boureima et al 2012 thus the seed owes its great economic potential to the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries yet greater economic interest lies in its oil content which is used in the production of high quality edible oil sesame is usually cultivated in semi arid region and like many other crops it is sensitive to drought during its vegetation stage therefore its production potential can be affected widely by water stress boureima et al 2012 although there have been studies on the effects of water stresses on leaf stomatal conductance yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 there are few scientific reports on using non contact instruments such as thermometers for sesame hall et al 1979 to the best of our knowledge thermography has not been applied for sesame plants however it can be recommended as long as there is a significant relationship between stomatal conductance and thermal indices which can be derived from thermal images in this regard the main objective of the study was to detect water status in sesame under greenhouse conditions using plant temperature based indices the other objectives were to compare gs rwc measurements with indices extracted from thermal images and to estimate the actual canopy temperature by means of a transfer function 2 materials and methods 2 1 greenhouse experiments this research was conducted on july 2016 in an experimental greenhouse of isfahan university of technology central iran 32 38 n 51 39 e and 1620 m altitude as a pot experiment the experiment was a completely randomized design with three irrigation treatments the treatments were a irrigation at soil water potential of 0 1 mpa as well watered ww b 1 0 mpa as moderate water stressed mws and c 1 5 mpa as severe water stressed sws yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 each treatment had 50 replications pots sesame sesamum indicum l seeds naz takshakhe genotype were sown on the 13th of july 2016 into 17 cm diameter tapered conical pots the pots with a volume vpot of 1940 cm3 were filled with equal amounts of gravel for drainage and soil 2 5 kg of air dried soil with a sandy clay loam texture as potting material physico chemical properties of the soil are given in table 1 the average air temperature tair and relative humidity rh in the greenhouse were 24 c and 32 for daytime and 18 c and 10 for night time respectively and average solar radiation during experiments was 115 w m 2 the day length was 15 h after complete emergence thinning was carried out to six seedlings per pot up to 6 weeks after sowing all pots were irrigated equally when 20 of available soil water asw was depleted the experimental duration was from the 25th of august till the 8th of september weight method was used to determine the amount of water irrigation by means of this method the pots had to be irrigated approximately every other day the volume of the irrigation virrig was calculated based on the maximum allowable depletion percentage p of the asw where 20 73 and 86 depletions were considered as ww mws and sws treatments respectively the soil water potential based on depletion of asw was determined by a soil moisture release curve fig 1 which is the relationship between soil water content and water potential schuhmann et al 2011 the asw and virrig were determined using eqs 1 and 2 respectively kirkham 2014 kramer and boyer 1995 1 a s w θ f c θ p w p ρ b v p o t 2 v i r r i g a s w p where θfc and θpwp are the percentage of gravimetric soil water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point respectively and ρb is soil bulk density g cm 3 cumulative irrigation water applied to a single pot of each irrigation treatments during the experiments from the 24th of august till the 8th of september was shown in fig 2 2 2 thermal imaging and environmental monitoring an imaging system including imaging frame thermal infrared and visible cameras was developed and deployed in the greenhouse for taking both thermal and visible images fig 3 at the top of the frame there was a place for mounting both cameras next to each other in such a position that the distance between the centers of camera lenses was 16 cm thermal images were obtained with a thermal infrared camera sat g90 guangzhou sat infrared technology co ltd china with a 24 20 fov lens it was equipped with an uncooled microbolometer sensor with a 240 320 fixed pixel array and sensitive to long wave infrared lwir radiation of 8 14 μm for using uncooled microbolometer thermal camera the effects of focal plane array fpa temperature warm up time camera settings and the environment in which the measurements are performed should be considered kusnierek and korsaeth 2014 however the results of other studies showed that the accuracy of uncooled microbolometer thermal camera for detecting canopy temperature is sufficient mangus et al 2016 meron et al 2010 the camera also had an accuracy of 2 c a temperature resolution of 0 08 c and provided an 8 bit 256 discrete pixel intensity or digital value dv thermal images these temperature resolution and image dv have been shown to be enough for this kind of studies maes et al 2016 mangus et al 2016 the thermal camera was mounted on the frame at a 2 m height nadir to the ground throughout the study thereby providing a spatial resolution of 2 5 mm pixel 1 at the same time visible images were obtained by a digital camera canon powershot a3100is 12 1 mp pot images were taken at 25th 27th 29th of august and 3rd and 8th of september 1 3 5 11 and 15 days after water stress treatments were applied in addition to the thermal and visible images ambient air temperature and relative humidity were measured by digital sensors thermo hygrometer tfa with accuracies of 0 1 c and 2 respectively solar radiation was also measured by a solar meter tes 1333r datalogging with an accuracy of 0 1 w m 2 for normalizing the camera temperatures with ambient conditions artificial wet and dry references were used within the view of the camera reference temperatures were measured continuously by a digital thermometer gwinstek gdm 451 with an accuracy of 0 1 c fig 3 the vapor pressure deficit vpd during the experiment was calculated using the measured tair c rh and solar radiance data from 11 00 to 14 00 h as follows monteith and unsworth 2013 3 v p d 1 r h 100 0 6108 10 7 5 t a i r 237 3 t a i r where vpd was calculated in kpa then the vpd versus the canopy minus air temperature differences for well irrigated plants ww was plotted in order to determine a non water stressed baseline nwsb for solar radiation greater than 100 w m 2 the baseline can be obtained as follows mangus et al 2016 4 t w w c t a i r a b v p d where twwc is the well watered canopy temperature c and a c and b c kpa 1 are the crop specific intercept and slope for nwsb respectively the temperatures of the canopy and artificial references were derived from the thermal infrared images via a supervised method in this method the temperatures were obtained by using the software satir report of the thermal camera at first both visible and thermal images were compared with each other then the plant canopy and the references were recognized and finally the average temperatures of these regions were determined by the camera software to evaluate the plant canopy temperature under three irrigation regimes time variation of the canopy temperatures for ww mws and sws plants were obtained 2 3 plant measurements immediately after taking the thermal and visible images the stomatal conductance of the plant was measured on the three uppermost fully developed leaves per pot yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 by a leaf diffusion porometer sc 1 decagon devices inc usa the mean value of 3 measurements was assigned to each pot consequently one of the leaves was chosen for the gravimetric measurement of rwc which was calculated as proposed by smart and bingham 1974 eq 5 5 r w c f w d w t w d w 100 where fw is the fresh weight of the leaf g dw is the weight of the leaf after drying g and tw is the weight of the leaf after placing them in distilled water for 4 h in a dark room g smart and bingham 1974 2 4 artificial dry and wet references for normalizing the canopy surface temperature for microclimatic conditions wet and dry artificial reference surfaces were embedded in the scene of the thermal images for making these references a horizontal aluminum frame was used and water absorbent non woven polyester and viscose mixture cloth was covered around the surface of the frame loveys et al 2006 to create the same light absorbing or reflecting conditions as the leaf surfaces the color of the artificial reference surfaces were chosen in green maes et al 2016 for the wet reference the cloth was mounted on the frame in such a way that its edges were constantly absorbing water from a reservoir fig 4 therefore these edges served as wicks soaking up the water to replace evaporation both wet and dry reference clothes were selected with the same size and were placed at the same height at the middle of the plant canopies a value of 0 98 for emissivity of both the canopy and references was used other studies are also used an emissivity of 0 98 for canopy surfaces of natural vegetation as well as artificial references berni et al 2009b lopez et al 2012 meron et al 2013 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 2 5 crop water stress cwsi and stomatal conductance ig indices the following equation was used to calculate cwsi for each pot eq 6 6 c w s i t c t w e t t d r y t w e t where tc is the plant canopy temperature in this study five different approaches were used to determine cwsi table 2 in the first four indices cwsi1 cwsi2 cwsi3 and cwsi4 tdry and twet were calculated according to the methods given in table 2 in addition recent studies suggested use of non water stress baseline nwsb information for calculating the cwsi ballester et al 2013 el shikha et al 2007 erdem et al 2010 grant et al 2006 therefore for calculating cwsi5 eq 7 was used 7 c w s i 5 δ t 1 δ t 2 δ t 1 δ t 3 where δt2 is the temperature difference of the canopy and air δt1 and δt3 were obtained from table 2 mangus et al 2016 three different approaches were also used to determine the stomatal conductance index ig jones 1999 for calculating ig1 and ig2 eq 8 was used 8 i g t d r y t c t d r y t w e t where tdry and twet were chosen according to table 2 the third stomatal conductance index ig3 was calculated using eq 9 9 i g 3 δ t 3 δ t 2 δ t 3 δ t 1 where δt1 δt2 and δt3 are the same as the ones given for cwsi5 2 6 estimation of actual canopy temperature to obtain actual canopy temperature the linear line fitting method developed by mangus et al 2016 was followed to consider the environmental influences such as air temperature relative humidity and solar radiance on measured temperatures by the camera the wet and dry references temperatures measured by the thermal images which is called measured temperature and by a digital thermometer which is called the actual temperature were used to develop the transfer function defined by eq 10 10 y 2 y 1 m x 2 x 1 where m is the slope of the transfer function x1 and x2 respectively are the temperatures of the wet and dry references in thermal images y1 and y2 respectively are the measured surface temperatures of the wet and dry references using thermometer then the actual canopy temperatures can be predicted by eq 11 11 y y 1 m x x 1 where x is the canopy temperature measured by the thermal camera which is called measured canopy temperature and y is the predicted canopy temperature to compare the predicted canopy temperature with the one derived by thermal camera the time variation curve of both predicted and measured canopy temperatures was obtained then the time variation curves of canopy temperature under three irrigations regimes ww mws and sws were found 3 results and discussion in this study gs and rwc were used as conventional plant based methods for expressing the plant water status the results showed that the gs and rwc significantly decreased by 50 and 16 under mws and 80 and 23 under sws treatments as compared with ww treatment respectively fig 5 in other studies with the aim of evaluating sesame under drought stress similar reduction in gs was observed in all sesame genotypes under water stress compared to control boureima et al 2012 seyyedan jasbi and ehsanzadeh 2014 yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 rwc versus gs is plotted in fig 5 a significant and linear relationship was found between gs and rwc with a goodness of fit r2 of 0 80 this figure shows how the three irrigation treatments data are separated well along the fitted line 3 1 non water stress baseline nwsb the variation of vapor pressure deficit vpd in the period of 11 00 to 14 00 h was in the range of 1 8 3 4 kpa during the experiments similar approach as suggested by mangus et al 2016 was used to predict nwsb canopy temperature the plot of the ww canopy minus air temperature differences and vpd is shown in fig 6 the fitted line is considered as the nwsb for solar radiation greater than 100 w m 2 a significantly linear and inverse relationship between canopy minus air temperature differences tc tair and the vapor pressure deficit vpd of the air for well watered ww plants was observed the specific intercept a and slope b for the nwsb line were 3 c and 2 7 c kpa 1 respectively fig 6 in addition to obtain nwsb canopy temperature the time variation of canopy temperatures for three irrigation treatments is provided in fig 7 the results indicated that the mws canopy temperatures were located between ww and sws because in ww plants leaf stomata are open and leaf water evaporates through transpiration which makes the plant cool on the other hand sws plant closes its stomata to retain water which resulted in reducing transpiration and increasing leaf temperature therefore ww and sws canopy temperatures can be used as the low and high temperature bounds respectively jones 1999 also reported that the temperature of a non transpiring and fully transpiring canopy can be considered respectively as upper and lower bounds for canopy temperature the time variation of the sws canopy dry reference and air temperatures during 5 imaging days including 1 3 5 10 and 15 days after the first irrigation treatment applied at the 25th 27th 29th of august 3rd and 8th of september respectively is shown in fig 8 a the results show that the variation of the dry reference temperature follows well the variation in sws canopy temperature as it shown in fig 8a the high threshold of the sws canopy temperature was approximately equal to the air temperature plus 3 c the maximum difference between sws canopy temperature and tair which was happened on the 29th of august around 13 20 h however irmak et al 2000 suggested a 5 c higher than the air temperature as dry reference temperature which may be due to the differences in the environments where the experiments were conducted greenhouse versus field the dry reference temperature versus the sws canopy temperature is plotted in fig 9 the results show a significant and linear relationship r2 0 88 between both temperatures it indicates that the dry reference can mimic the temperature of the sws canopy successfully however as illustrated in fig 8a the temperature of dry reference was higher than sws canopy this observation shows that although the sws plants were considered as no transpiration plants its minimum transpiration made the sws plants cooler than the dry reference surface and led to this over estimation of dry reference this over estimation can also be related to differences in overall characteristics between leaf and artificial reference surface the time variation of the temperatures for the ww canopy wet reference and ambient air during 5 imaging days including 1 3 5 10 and 15 days after application of irrigation treatments is shown in fig 8b the wet reference temperature changes follow the ww canopies the relationship between the wet reference and the ww canopy temperatures is presented in fig 9 although a linear relationship r 2 0 53 between both temperatures was found however the wet reference was always cooler than the ww canopy the average difference was approximately 3 c this could be due to different characteristics of leaf and artificial reference surface such as their emissivities therefore the artificial wet reference can be used as a low temperature bound in plant thermal imaging the temperature of artificial wet reference also was used by other researchers jones et al 2002 meron et al 2013 as an indicator of the temperature of a freely transpiring leaf with fully opened stomata their observations are consistent with the results obtained in this research 3 2 crop water stress cwsi and stomatal conductance ig indices the different crop water stress cwsi and stomatal conductance ig indices were examined in order to recommend the optimum index for estimating sesame water status figs 10 and 11 there was a strong and significant correlation r2 0 74 between gs and cwsi1 fig 10a since the temperature of dry reference was close to the sws canopy figs 8a and 9 the calculated cwsi1 ranged from 0 to approximately 1 the calculated cwsi1 in some points led to the values greater than 1 due to in those moments that the sws canopy temperatures reached to a higher temperature than the dry reference the cwsi2 had also a strong correlation r2 0 73 with gs fig 10b in addition the higher slope of the fitted line showed that the cwsi2 had more sensitivity to the changes in the stomatal conductance fig 10a e also illustrates that the data points are located in three distinct clusters by irrigation treatments the cwsi3 has also a linear and significant correlation r2 0 67 with the gs fig 10c and was properly able to estimate the crop water status both cwsi1 and cwsi3 have similar slopes fig 10a c this was due to the fact that the temperatures of dry reference and the sws canopy were very close to each other fig 8a since sws canopy temperature was used as tdry in cwsi3 therefore this index was equal to 1 for sws plants therefore the upper limit of the canopy temperature can be replaced by the dry reference similar to the cwsi3 a linear and significant relationship with r2 value of 0 68 was found for cwsi4 fig 10d since ww canopy temperature was used as twet in cwsi4 therefore this index was equal to 0 for ww plants although using the artificial wet and dry references was a robust technique for determining the cwsi fig 11a and b the wet and dry references are not practical within a prolonged monitoring study and the researchers have been looking for other approaches to calculate the cwsi without relying on these references for this purpose the cwsi5 was calculated by using nwsb s information and the air temperature plus 3 c the results showed a significant and linear relationship r2 0 75 between the gs and cwsi5 fig 10e some of cwsi5 values were less than 0 since the values of δt1 canopy minus air temperature differences for ww treatment in eq 8 were very close to the values of δt2 canopy minus air temperature differences for ww treatment as measured by the thermal camera and thermometer respectively that led to the cwsi5 values to be less than 0 at some points the comparison of the four first cwsis with the cwsi5 showed that the cwsi5 calculated by the empirically determined nwsb can present a robust technique for determining the cwsi without relying on artificial reference temperatures similar results were reported by other researchers taghvaeian et al 2014a taghvaeian et al 2014b in general the relationships of gs with the five cwsi showed that all five indices had significantly strong and inverse relationships with gs and they were well able to estimate the crop water status in sesame berni et al 2009a reported that there was a linear relationship between cwsi and gs in olive in addition yu et al 2015 reported that there was a logarithmic relationship between cwsi and gs in firmiana plataninfolia the three ig indices versus the gs were plotted in fig 11 both ig1 and ig2 have significant and linear relationships with the gs with r2 values of 0 67 and 0 73 respectively moreover both had the ability to satisfactorily predict the crop water status similar to cwsi1 and cwsi2 ig2 had a higher r2 value than the ig1 fig 11a and b in addition ig3 significantly correlated with the gs and had the higher r2 of 0 75 in general the ig was directly correlated with the gs which means that by increasing the gs the ig would increase as well among all indices the cwsi5 and ig3 with high correlation with gs figs 10e and 11c were plotted versus rwc in fig 12 a and b the rwc had significant and linear relationships with both cwsi5 and ig3 r2 0 65 however the former and latter had inverse and direct correlations with the rwc respectively thus the physiological trait of rwc can also be estimated by the temperature based indices of cwsi ig but their relationships are not as strong as with gs based on the results obtained in this research the thermography has capability to act as a rapid and accurate method for remote sensing of plant water status in sesame however the camera should be on board of a uav aircraft or satellite otherwise it will be time expensive because of the high number of images required to create the mosaic of all the crop surface in addition there are possibilities to use the infrared image sensors under greenhouse conditions as an interesting option to continuously monitor canopy temperature by selecting pixels of interest for processing 3 3 predicting the canopy temperature using the transfer function to quantify the actual canopy temperature a transfer function to include the environmental influences from the air temperature relative humidity and solar radiance was considered the relationship between the actual temperature of the artificial wet and dry references measured by thermometer called actual temperature and the temperature of the same surfaces recorded by the thermal camera called measured temperature was plotted in fig 13 the results indicated a strong and linear relationship between the actual and measured temperature with a coefficient of determination of 0 97 the relationship between the canopy temperatures measured by the thermal camera and predicted by the transfer function is illustrated in fig 14 the slope of the fitted line in fig 14 is the same as the one obtained for the artificial references as shown in fig 13 both fitted lines have slopes of 0 93 which show the thermal camera under estimates the temperatures the time variation of the predicted and measured canopy temperatures of the plants under three different irrigation regimes ww mws and sws is shown in fig 15 the results revealed that the average canopy temperature measured by the camera ranged from 25 3 to 28 4 c whereas by using the transfer function this range altered to 23 9 26 78 c with a difference of 1 5 c thus there is a 1 5 c difference between the measured and actual canopy temperatures this overestimation might be due to the influence of the environmental factors such as solar radiation air temperature and background temperature on the thermal camera jones 1999 jones et al 2002 therefore transfer function can be a good solution to compensate all of those environmental effects to detect the actual canopy temperature rather than the relative ones 4 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first report using thermography to identify the systematic nature of the quantitative relationships between cwsi ig indices and gs rwc for sesame the results showed that thermography is a rapid and accurate method for remote sensing of plant water status in sesame the average value of vpd in this study was 2 5 kpa that represented a difference of approximately 3 c between ww canopy and the air temperature under greenhouse conditions significantly linear relationships between the artificial dry and wet reference temperatures and sws and ww canopy temperatures respectively proved that for computing the cwsi of sesame the wet and dry references can be good surrogates detecting water stress in sesame using cwsi ig indices extracted from the thermal images validated the effectiveness of the developed thermal imaging system however cwsi ig calculated by the information obtained from nwsb had the higher r2 for estimating the leaf cwsi rwc the results obtained under greenhouse conditions showed that if the air temperature is used as dry reference the tdry in cwsi ig should be considered as the air temperature plus 3 c a strong and linear relationship between the actual and measured temperatures of the artificial references was achieved a 1 5 c difference between the predicted and measured canopy temperatures was observed this was due to overestimation of the measured temperature by the thermal camera the overestimation was probably due to the effects of environmental factors such as solar radiation air temperature and background temperature that could be corrected by using the developed transfer function moreover transfer function was proved as a good solution to compensate all of those environmental effects to detect the actual canopy temperature rather than the relative ones this study revealed that the non contact thermal imaging is able to detect water stress and estimate leaf rwc in sesame plant effectively acknowledgements financial support for this project no 95835271 was

11454,there have been studies on the effect of water stresses on leaf stomatal conductance gs however the scientific reports on using non contact techniques such as thermography for sesame sesamum indicum l are rare the objectives of this study were hence to detect water status in sesame genotype naz takshakhe under greenhouse conditions using crop water stress cwsi and stomatal conductance ig indices one hundred and fifty pots were randomly assigned to three equal groups which were irrigated at soil water potential of 0 1 mpa well watered ww 1 0 mpa moderate water stressed mws and 1 5 mpa severe water stressed sws four formulations of cwsi and two of ig using canopy temperature tc from the ww treatment or temperature from a wet reference for the upper threshold and tc from the sws treatment temperature from a dry reference or air temperature plus 3 as the lower threshold were compared moreover an additional cwsi and ig formulations were also obtained by non water stress baseline nwsb information using meteorological data furthermore the relative water content rwc and gs were measured on the youngest and uppermost fully developed leaves of each pot tc of mws and sws plants was higher than ww plants by 1 9 and 2 6 c respectively a significant and linear relationship p 0 001 between cwsi ig and gs rwc was found therefore both physiological traits of gs and rwc can be estimated by temperature based indices of cwsi ig the results also showed the developed system enables us to estimate actual time variations in canopy temperatures this study validates the

productivity is limited worldwide by various biotic and abiotic stresses kumar 2013 drought is of particular importance since it is the main abiotic stress factor which causes the highest yield losses manavalan and nguyen 2012 from the agricultural point of view crop water stress occurs when the amount of the water provided through rainfall and irrigation is not sufficient to meet the needs of plant evapotranspiration like other crop stresses water stress influences on a large number of physiological biochemical and molecular reactions of plants lisar et al 2012 manavalan and nguyen 2012 precision irrigation can help to improve water use efficiency and to increase the crop productivity several methods for monitoring crop water stress have been introduced which can be classified as soil based and plant based measurements alves and pereira 2000 cohen et al 2005 cohen et al 2012 among these methods soil moisture sensors pressure chambers and leaf diffusion porometers have been widely used for measuring soil moisture individual leaf stem water potential and leaf stomatal conductance respectively ballester et al 2013 idso et al 1977 moller et al 2006 however these techniques are unsuitable for automatic monitoring of crop water stress since they are destructive labor intensive and time consuming therefore the applications of these methods for spatial and temporal monitoring of crop water stress in large acreage production systems are not feasible ballester et al 2013 from plant physiology if a plant is experiencing water stress the stomata tends to close leads to a reduction in transpiration and rising the leaf temperature ballester et al 2013 jones 1999 2004 leinonen and jones 2004 therefore the increase in canopy temperature can be a good water stress indicator that can be measured by means of infrared thermometers or thermal cameras moller et al 2006 these methods offer non contact and non destructive monitoring of crop water stress jones 2004 leinonen and jones 2004 infrared thermometers are more limited in use since they provide a single point average temperature value of all objects within the sensor s field of view such as shaded and unshaded parts of plant canopy and or soil surface the accuracy of this sensor is even worse when the plant is immature because soil covers a majority of the surface maes and steppe 2012 however thermal imaging is a potential tool for estimating plant temperature which can be used as an indicator of stomatal closure and water deficit stress recently the emergence of thermal cameras particularly when combined with the automated analysis of images makes the use of thermal images much easier the accuracy of this method is higher than that obtained using infrared thermometer because in this imaging method by segmentation of canopy thermal images the influence of soil background can be minimized maes and steppe 2012 however thermal cameras are capable of measuring relative temperature rather than actual temperature to quantify actual surface temperature the thermal camera has to be calibrated at environmental conditions mangus et al 2016 there are three broad categories of remote sensing platforms ground based airborne and satellite the platform used in this research is laboratory instruments ground based which is used almost exclusively for research however for monitoring water status in field crops other remote sensing platforms should be used to cover large surfaces of crops in very short times by mounting thermal cameras on board drones aircrafts or satellites low altitude aircraft drone is good for acquiring high spatial resolution data the most stable platform aloft is a satellite which is space borne nevertheless for satellite data atmospheric correction may be needed to obtain accurate surface temperature estimates ramírez cuesta et al 2017 several indices have been presented for quantifying and monitoring the crop water stress in which tc crop canopy temperature is the main factor for evaluating the crop water status the first indicator which was developed for the arid climate of arizona where has a similar climate to the arid regions of central iran was known as crop water stress index cwsi jones 1999 for calculating cwsi tc must be normalized with well watered and non transpiring crop canopy temperatures as lower and upper leaf temperature bounds respectively dejonge et al 2015 s indicum is an ancient warm season oilseed crop which is said to be partially resistant to some environmental constraints bedigian 2010 mortazavian and kohpayegani 2010 sesame oil contains an unique antioxidants that cannot be found in other edible oils and make the sesame oil the high quality one in addition to the oil crop seed is used as a source of proteins vitamins and minerals for humans as well as in animal feed boureima et al 2012 thus the seed owes its great economic potential to the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries yet greater economic interest lies in its oil content which is used in the production of high quality edible oil sesame is usually cultivated in semi arid region and like many other crops it is sensitive to drought during its vegetation stage therefore its production potential can be affected widely by water stress boureima et al 2012 although there have been studies on the effects of water stresses on leaf stomatal conductance yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 there are few scientific reports on using non contact instruments such as thermometers for sesame hall et al 1979 to the best of our knowledge thermography has not been applied for sesame plants however it can be recommended as long as there is a significant relationship between stomatal conductance and thermal indices which can be derived from thermal images in this regard the main objective of the study was to detect water status in sesame under greenhouse conditions using plant temperature based indices the other objectives were to compare gs rwc measurements with indices extracted from thermal images and to estimate the actual canopy temperature by means of a transfer function 2 materials and methods 2 1 greenhouse experiments this research was conducted on july 2016 in an experimental greenhouse of isfahan university of technology central iran 32 38 n 51 39 e and 1620 m altitude as a pot experiment the experiment was a completely randomized design with three irrigation treatments the treatments were a irrigation at soil water potential of 0 1 mpa as well watered ww b 1 0 mpa as moderate water stressed mws and c 1 5 mpa as severe water stressed sws yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 each treatment had 50 replications pots sesame sesamum indicum l seeds naz takshakhe genotype were sown on the 13th of july 2016 into 17 cm diameter tapered conical pots the pots with a volume vpot of 1940 cm3 were filled with equal amounts of gravel for drainage and soil 2 5 kg of air dried soil with a sandy clay loam texture as potting material physico chemical properties of the soil are given in table 1 the average air temperature tair and relative humidity rh in the greenhouse were 24 c and 32 for daytime and 18 c and 10 for night time respectively and average solar radiation during experiments was 115 w m 2 the day length was 15 h after complete emergence thinning was carried out to six seedlings per pot up to 6 weeks after sowing all pots were irrigated equally when 20 of available soil water asw was depleted the experimental duration was from the 25th of august till the 8th of september weight method was used to determine the amount of water irrigation by means of this method the pots had to be irrigated approximately every other day the volume of the irrigation virrig was calculated based on the maximum allowable depletion percentage p of the asw where 20 73 and 86 depletions were considered as ww mws and sws treatments respectively the soil water potential based on depletion of asw was determined by a soil moisture release curve fig 1 which is the relationship between soil water content and water potential schuhmann et al 2011 the asw and virrig were determined using eqs 1 and 2 respectively kirkham 2014 kramer and boyer 1995 1 a s w θ f c θ p w p ρ b v p o t 2 v i r r i g a s w p where θfc and θpwp are the percentage of gravimetric soil water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point respectively and ρb is soil bulk density g cm 3 cumulative irrigation water applied to a single pot of each irrigation treatments during the experiments from the 24th of august till the 8th of september was shown in fig 2 2 2 thermal imaging and environmental monitoring an imaging system including imaging frame thermal infrared and visible cameras was developed and deployed in the greenhouse for taking both thermal and visible images fig 3 at the top of the frame there was a place for mounting both cameras next to each other in such a position that the distance between the centers of camera lenses was 16 cm thermal images were obtained with a thermal infrared camera sat g90 guangzhou sat infrared technology co ltd china with a 24 20 fov lens it was equipped with an uncooled microbolometer sensor with a 240 320 fixed pixel array and sensitive to long wave infrared lwir radiation of 8 14 μm for using uncooled microbolometer thermal camera the effects of focal plane array fpa temperature warm up time camera settings and the environment in which the measurements are performed should be considered kusnierek and korsaeth 2014 however the results of other studies showed that the accuracy of uncooled microbolometer thermal camera for detecting canopy temperature is sufficient mangus et al 2016 meron et al 2010 the camera also had an accuracy of 2 c a temperature resolution of 0 08 c and provided an 8 bit 256 discrete pixel intensity or digital value dv thermal images these temperature resolution and image dv have been shown to be enough for this kind of studies maes et al 2016 mangus et al 2016 the thermal camera was mounted on the frame at a 2 m height nadir to the ground throughout the study thereby providing a spatial resolution of 2 5 mm pixel 1 at the same time visible images were obtained by a digital camera canon powershot a3100is 12 1 mp pot images were taken at 25th 27th 29th of august and 3rd and 8th of september 1 3 5 11 and 15 days after water stress treatments were applied in addition to the thermal and visible images ambient air temperature and relative humidity were measured by digital sensors thermo hygrometer tfa with accuracies of 0 1 c and 2 respectively solar radiation was also measured by a solar meter tes 1333r datalogging with an accuracy of 0 1 w m 2 for normalizing the camera temperatures with ambient conditions artificial wet and dry references were used within the view of the camera reference temperatures were measured continuously by a digital thermometer gwinstek gdm 451 with an accuracy of 0 1 c fig 3 the vapor pressure deficit vpd during the experiment was calculated using the measured tair c rh and solar radiance data from 11 00 to 14 00 h as follows monteith and unsworth 2013 3 v p d 1 r h 100 0 6108 10 7 5 t a i r 237 3 t a i r where vpd was calculated in kpa then the vpd versus the canopy minus air temperature differences for well irrigated plants ww was plotted in order to determine a non water stressed baseline nwsb for solar radiation greater than 100 w m 2 the baseline can be obtained as follows mangus et al 2016 4 t w w c t a i r a b v p d where twwc is the well watered canopy temperature c and a c and b c kpa 1 are the crop specific intercept and slope for nwsb respectively the temperatures of the canopy and artificial references were derived from the thermal infrared images via a supervised method in this method the temperatures were obtained by using the software satir report of the thermal camera at first both visible and thermal images were compared with each other then the plant canopy and the references were recognized and finally the average temperatures of these regions were determined by the camera software to evaluate the plant canopy temperature under three irrigation regimes time variation of the canopy temperatures for ww mws and sws plants were obtained 2 3 plant measurements immediately after taking the thermal and visible images the stomatal conductance of the plant was measured on the three uppermost fully developed leaves per pot yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 by a leaf diffusion porometer sc 1 decagon devices inc usa the mean value of 3 measurements was assigned to each pot consequently one of the leaves was chosen for the gravimetric measurement of rwc which was calculated as proposed by smart and bingham 1974 eq 5 5 r w c f w d w t w d w 100 where fw is the fresh weight of the leaf g dw is the weight of the leaf after drying g and tw is the weight of the leaf after placing them in distilled water for 4 h in a dark room g smart and bingham 1974 2 4 artificial dry and wet references for normalizing the canopy surface temperature for microclimatic conditions wet and dry artificial reference surfaces were embedded in the scene of the thermal images for making these references a horizontal aluminum frame was used and water absorbent non woven polyester and viscose mixture cloth was covered around the surface of the frame loveys et al 2006 to create the same light absorbing or reflecting conditions as the leaf surfaces the color of the artificial reference surfaces were chosen in green maes et al 2016 for the wet reference the cloth was mounted on the frame in such a way that its edges were constantly absorbing water from a reservoir fig 4 therefore these edges served as wicks soaking up the water to replace evaporation both wet and dry reference clothes were selected with the same size and were placed at the same height at the middle of the plant canopies a value of 0 98 for emissivity of both the canopy and references was used other studies are also used an emissivity of 0 98 for canopy surfaces of natural vegetation as well as artificial references berni et al 2009b lopez et al 2012 meron et al 2013 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 2 5 crop water stress cwsi and stomatal conductance ig indices the following equation was used to calculate cwsi for each pot eq 6 6 c w s i t c t w e t t d r y t w e t where tc is the plant canopy temperature in this study five different approaches were used to determine cwsi table 2 in the first four indices cwsi1 cwsi2 cwsi3 and cwsi4 tdry and twet were calculated according to the methods given in table 2 in addition recent studies suggested use of non water stress baseline nwsb information for calculating the cwsi ballester et al 2013 el shikha et al 2007 erdem et al 2010 grant et al 2006 therefore for calculating cwsi5 eq 7 was used 7 c w s i 5 δ t 1 δ t 2 δ t 1 δ t 3 where δt2 is the temperature difference of the canopy and air δt1 and δt3 were obtained from table 2 mangus et al 2016 three different approaches were also used to determine the stomatal conductance index ig jones 1999 for calculating ig1 and ig2 eq 8 was used 8 i g t d r y t c t d r y t w e t where tdry and twet were chosen according to table 2 the third stomatal conductance index ig3 was calculated using eq 9 9 i g 3 δ t 3 δ t 2 δ t 3 δ t 1 where δt1 δt2 and δt3 are the same as the ones given for cwsi5 2 6 estimation of actual canopy temperature to obtain actual canopy temperature the linear line fitting method developed by mangus et al 2016 was followed to consider the environmental influences such as air temperature relative humidity and solar radiance on measured temperatures by the camera the wet and dry references temperatures measured by the thermal images which is called measured temperature and by a digital thermometer which is called the actual temperature were used to develop the transfer function defined by eq 10 10 y 2 y 1 m x 2 x 1 where m is the slope of the transfer function x1 and x2 respectively are the temperatures of the wet and dry references in thermal images y1 and y2 respectively are the measured surface temperatures of the wet and dry references using thermometer then the actual canopy temperatures can be predicted by eq 11 11 y y 1 m x x 1 where x is the canopy temperature measured by the thermal camera which is called measured canopy temperature and y is the predicted canopy temperature to compare the predicted canopy temperature with the one derived by thermal camera the time variation curve of both predicted and measured canopy temperatures was obtained then the time variation curves of canopy temperature under three irrigations regimes ww mws and sws were found 3 results and discussion in this study gs and rwc were used as conventional plant based methods for expressing the plant water status the results showed that the gs and rwc significantly decreased by 50 and 16 under mws and 80 and 23 under sws treatments as compared with ww treatment respectively fig 5 in other studies with the aim of evaluating sesame under drought stress similar reduction in gs was observed in all sesame genotypes under water stress compared to control boureima et al 2012 seyyedan jasbi and ehsanzadeh 2014 yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 rwc versus gs is plotted in fig 5 a significant and linear relationship was found between gs and rwc with a goodness of fit r2 of 0 80 this figure shows how the three irrigation treatments data are separated well along the fitted line 3 1 non water stress baseline nwsb the variation of vapor pressure deficit vpd in the period of 11 00 to 14 00 h was in the range of 1 8 3 4 kpa during the experiments similar approach as suggested by mangus et al 2016 was used to predict nwsb canopy temperature the plot of the ww canopy minus air temperature differences and vpd is shown in fig 6 the fitted line is considered as the nwsb for solar radiation greater than 100 w m 2 a significantly linear and inverse relationship between canopy minus air temperature differences tc tair and the vapor pressure deficit vpd of the air for well watered ww plants was observed the specific intercept a and slope b for the nwsb line were 3 c and 2 7 c kpa 1 respectively fig 6 in addition to obtain nwsb canopy temperature the time variation of canopy temperatures for three irrigation treatments is provided in fig 7 the results indicated that the mws canopy temperatures were located between ww and sws because in ww plants leaf stomata are open and leaf water evaporates through transpiration which makes the plant cool on the other hand sws plant closes its stomata to retain water which resulted in reducing transpiration and increasing leaf temperature therefore ww and sws canopy temperatures can be used as the low and high temperature bounds respectively jones 1999 also reported that the temperature of a non transpiring and fully transpiring canopy can be considered respectively as upper and lower bounds for canopy temperature the time variation of the sws canopy dry reference and air temperatures during 5 imaging days including 1 3 5 10 and 15 days after the first irrigation treatment applied at the 25th 27th 29th of august 3rd and 8th of september respectively is shown in fig 8 a the results show that the variation of the dry reference temperature follows well the variation in sws canopy temperature as it shown in fig 8a the high threshold of the sws canopy temperature was approximately equal to the air temperature plus 3 c the maximum difference between sws canopy temperature and tair which was happened on the 29th of august around 13 20 h however irmak et al 2000 suggested a 5 c higher than the air temperature as dry reference temperature which may be due to the differences in the environments where the experiments were conducted greenhouse versus field the dry reference temperature versus the sws canopy temperature is plotted in fig 9 the results show a significant and linear relationship r2 0 88 between both temperatures it indicates that the dry reference can mimic the temperature of the sws canopy successfully however as illustrated in fig 8a the temperature of dry reference was higher than sws canopy this observation shows that although the sws plants were considered as no transpiration plants its minimum transpiration made the sws plants cooler than the dry reference surface and led to this over estimation of dry reference this over estimation can also be related to differences in overall characteristics between leaf and artificial reference surface the time variation of the temperatures for the ww canopy wet reference and ambient air during 5 imaging days including 1 3 5 10 and 15 days after application of irrigation treatments is shown in fig 8b the wet reference temperature changes follow the ww canopies the relationship between the wet reference and the ww canopy temperatures is presented in fig 9 although a linear relationship r 2 0 53 between both temperatures was found however the wet reference was always cooler than the ww canopy the average difference was approximately 3 c this could be due to different characteristics of leaf and artificial reference surface such as their emissivities therefore the artificial wet reference can be used as a low temperature bound in plant thermal imaging the temperature of artificial wet reference also was used by other researchers jones et al 2002 meron et al 2013 as an indicator of the temperature of a freely transpiring leaf with fully opened stomata their observations are consistent with the results obtained in this research 3 2 crop water stress cwsi and stomatal conductance ig indices the different crop water stress cwsi and stomatal conductance ig indices were examined in order to recommend the optimum index for estimating sesame water status figs 10 and 11 there was a strong and significant correlation r2 0 74 between gs and cwsi1 fig 10a since the temperature of dry reference was close to the sws canopy figs 8a and 9 the calculated cwsi1 ranged from 0 to approximately 1 the calculated cwsi1 in some points led to the values greater than 1 due to in those moments that the sws canopy temperatures reached to a higher temperature than the dry reference the cwsi2 had also a strong correlation r2 0 73 with gs fig 10b in addition the higher slope of the fitted line showed that the cwsi2 had more sensitivity to the changes in the stomatal conductance fig 10a e also illustrates that the data points are located in three distinct clusters by irrigation treatments the cwsi3 has also a linear and significant correlation r2 0 67 with the gs fig 10c and was properly able to estimate the crop water status both cwsi1 and cwsi3 have similar slopes fig 10a c this was due to the fact that the temperatures of dry reference and the sws canopy were very close to each other fig 8a since sws canopy temperature was used as tdry in cwsi3 therefore this index was equal to 1 for sws plants therefore the upper limit of the canopy temperature can be replaced by the dry reference similar to the cwsi3 a linear and significant relationship with r2 value of 0 68 was found for cwsi4 fig 10d since ww canopy temperature was used as twet in cwsi4 therefore this index was equal to 0 for ww plants although using the artificial wet and dry references was a robust technique for determining the cwsi fig 11a and b the wet and dry references are not practical within a prolonged monitoring study and the researchers have been looking for other approaches to calculate the cwsi without relying on these references for this purpose the cwsi5 was calculated by using nwsb s information and the air temperature plus 3 c the results showed a significant and linear relationship r2 0 75 between the gs and cwsi5 fig 10e some of cwsi5 values were less than 0 since the values of δt1 canopy minus air temperature differences for ww treatment in eq 8 were very close to the values of δt2 canopy minus air temperature differences for ww treatment as measured by the thermal camera and thermometer respectively that led to the cwsi5 values to be less than 0 at some points the comparison of the four first cwsis with the cwsi5 showed that the cwsi5 calculated by the empirically determined nwsb can present a robust technique for determining the cwsi without relying on artificial reference temperatures similar results were reported by other researchers taghvaeian et al 2014a taghvaeian et al 2014b in general the relationships of gs with the five cwsi showed that all five indices had significantly strong and inverse relationships with gs and they were well able to estimate the crop water status in sesame berni et al 2009a reported that there was a linear relationship between cwsi and gs in olive in addition yu et al 2015 reported that there was a logarithmic relationship between cwsi and gs in firmiana plataninfolia the three ig indices versus the gs were plotted in fig 11 both ig1 and ig2 have significant and linear relationships with the gs with r2 values of 0 67 and 0 73 respectively moreover both had the ability to satisfactorily predict the crop water status similar to cwsi1 and cwsi2 ig2 had a higher r2 value than the ig1 fig 11a and b in addition ig3 significantly correlated with the gs and had the higher r2 of 0 75 in general the ig was directly correlated with the gs which means that by increasing the gs the ig would increase as well among all indices the cwsi5 and ig3 with high correlation with gs figs 10e and 11c were plotted versus rwc in fig 12 a and b the rwc had significant and linear relationships with both cwsi5 and ig3 r2 0 65 however the former and latter had inverse and direct correlations with the rwc respectively thus the physiological trait of rwc can also be estimated by the temperature based indices of cwsi ig but their relationships are not as strong as with gs based on the results obtained in this research the thermography has capability to act as a rapid and accurate method for remote sensing of plant water status in sesame however the camera should be on board of a uav aircraft or satellite otherwise it will be time expensive because of the high number of images required to create the mosaic of all the crop surface in addition there are possibilities to use the infrared image sensors under greenhouse conditions as an interesting option to continuously monitor canopy temperature by selecting pixels of interest for processing 3 3 predicting the canopy temperature using the transfer function to quantify the actual canopy temperature a transfer function to include the environmental influences from the air temperature relative humidity and solar radiance was considered the relationship between the actual temperature of the artificial wet and dry references measured by thermometer called actual temperature and the temperature of the same surfaces recorded by the thermal camera called measured temperature was plotted in fig 13 the results indicated a strong and linear relationship between the actual and measured temperature with a coefficient of determination of 0 97 the relationship between the canopy temperatures measured by the thermal camera and predicted by the transfer function is illustrated in fig 14 the slope of the fitted line in fig 14 is the same as the one obtained for the artificial references as shown in fig 13 both fitted lines have slopes of 0 93 which show the thermal camera under estimates the temperatures the time variation of the predicted and measured canopy temperatures of the plants under three different irrigation regimes ww mws and sws is shown in fig 15 the results revealed that the average canopy temperature measured by the camera ranged from 25 3 to 28 4 c whereas by using the transfer function this range altered to 23 9 26 78 c with a difference of 1 5 c thus there is a 1 5 c difference between the measured and actual canopy temperatures this overestimation might be due to the influence of the environmental factors such as solar radiation air temperature and background temperature on the thermal camera jones 1999 jones et al 2002 therefore transfer function can be a good solution to compensate all of those environmental effects to detect the actual canopy temperature rather than the relative ones 4 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first report using thermography to identify the systematic nature of the quantitative relationships between cwsi ig indices and gs rwc for sesame the results showed that thermography is a rapid and accurate method for remote sensing of plant water status in sesame the average value of vpd in this study was 2 5 kpa that represented a difference of approximately 3 c between ww canopy and the air temperature under greenhouse conditions significantly linear relationships between the artificial dry and wet reference temperatures and sws and ww canopy temperatures respectively proved that for computing the cwsi of sesame the wet and dry references can be good surrogates detecting water stress in sesame using cwsi ig indices extracted from the thermal images validated the effectiveness of the developed thermal imaging system however cwsi ig calculated by the information obtained from nwsb had the higher r2 for estimating the leaf cwsi rwc the results obtained under greenhouse conditions showed that if the air temperature is used as dry reference the tdry in cwsi ig should be considered as the air temperature plus 3 c a strong and linear relationship between the actual and measured temperatures of the artificial references was achieved a 1 5 c difference between the predicted and measured canopy temperatures was observed this was due to overestimation of the measured temperature by the thermal camera the overestimation was probably due to the effects of environmental factors such as solar radiation air temperature and background temperature that could be corrected by using the developed transfer function moreover transfer function was proved as a good solution to compensate all of those environmental effects to detect the actual canopy temperature rather than the relative ones this study revealed that the non contact thermal imaging is able to detect water stress and estimate leaf rwc in sesame plant effectively acknowledgements financial support for this project no 95835271 was
